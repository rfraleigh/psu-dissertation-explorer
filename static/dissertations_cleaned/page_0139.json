The large fluctuations of these renewable energy sources in power output have brought the vigorous development of the area of energy storage system. Supercapacitors, which bridge the gap of power and energy between batteries and dielectric capacitors, have developed fast in the last decades among these energy storage devices. Although batteries can store a large quantity of energy, they release energy in a slow rate, resulting in a very low power density with a limited lifetime. On the other hand, dielectric capacitors can be charged and discharged at high rate and hence possess very high power density, but their energy density is low. With relatively high power, mid-high energy density and long cycle lifetime, supercapacitors are attractive for many applications, such as in grid scale renewable energy storage and in hybrid electric vehicles where high energy, high power and reasonable lifetime are all required. However, the current commercial supercapacitor product still suffers from the low energy density (less than 10 Wh/kg) and low power density (1 kW/kg). Hence, it is highly desired to further improve electrochemcial performance of supercapacitors cells for the advanced and wide applications. In this dissertation, different supercapacitor cells are introduced to improve the performance by several strategies such as controlling the nanomorphology of electrodes and optimizing the cell configuration.\nThe tortuous ion transport pathways formed in activated carbon, which is widely used as electrodes in the current commerical products, have influenced the power denisty of the cell. To overcome this drawback, the aligned carbon nanotubes (A-CNTs) were investigated in this dissetation due to the superior electrical conductivity and parallel ion pathways of electrodes. Meanwhile, to achieve high volumetric energy and power densities of the cells, a unique mechanical densification method was developed to allow the density of A-CNTs to be tuned precisely over a broad range from 1% volume fraction (Vf) to 40% Vf while preserving the straight ion pathway between A-CNTs. As a result, the supercapacitors fabricated from 40% volumetric fraction (Vf) of A-CNTs as the electrodes with the thickness of 0.8 mm exhibit a power density of 25 kW L-1 (50 kW kg-1), which is much higher than that of the A-CNTs electrodes with similar thickness fabricated by other methods and that of activated carbon electrodes.\nPseudocapacitive materials, such as conducitng polymers and transition metal oxides, can be incorporated into the electrode to increase the specific capacitance because the whole bulk (not only the surface for pure carbon electrode) of pseudocapacitive material has involved the electrochemical energy storage. Poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was studied as the pseudocapacitive materials in this dissertation. The conformal coating of PEDOT on A-CNTs can exhibit long cycle life compared with pure PEDOT or PEDOT coated on random CNTs since the A-CNTs can provide a mechanical structure to absorb the large volume change of PEDOT during the charge and discharge processes. The unique mechanical densification method was also used to densify the composite to 5% to improve the volumetric performance of the cell. Symmetric supercapacitors using the 5% compacted A-CNTs coated with 10nm thickness PEDOT as electrodes, as well as using BMI-BF4/PC as electrolyte can achieve the highest volumetric specific capacitance of 92.79 F cm-3. Meanwhile, the QV curve based on CV curve or galvanostatic curve was firstly introduced. This new investigation method can be used to evaluate the cell energy loss and coulombic efficiency better compared with the conventional one.\nThe energy density and maximum power density of supercapacitor cells are strongly dependent with the operation potential which is limited by the electrochemical window of the interface between electrode and electrolyte. In order to expand the electrochemical window of the supercapacitor cell, the asymmetric configuration was introduced in this dissertation. One electrode can be pseudocapacitive materials and the other one is carbon materials so that the asymmetric configuration can make full use of the different windows and the advantages of two kinds of materials to expand the operation potential and enhance the performance of the cell. An asymmetric supercapacitor with high electrochemical performance has been developed with conformal coating of PEDOT on A-CNTs as one electrode and the ultra-high density A-CNTs as the other one in 2 M BMIBF4/ PC electrolyte. The positive and negative electrodes materials are individually tailored and work synergistically together in the asymmetric cell configuration so that the cell can be operated under the high operation voltage of 4 V to achieve energy and power densities with a long cycle life. Moreover, the EIS of each electrode is modeled by equivalent circuit elements to describe quantitatively the functions of pseudocapacitor and carbon electrode directly. The EIS of the asymmetric cell is also simulated based on the parameters from two electrodes which demonstrate the optimized asymmetric design. \nIn order to improve the electrochemical performance of asymmetric cell further, activated graphene electrode with the higher specific area (more than 3000 m2/g) were used in the high power side to replace the A-CNTs. The aligned microwave exfoliated graphite oxide electrode, fabricated via a self-assembly process, shows high specific gravimetric and volumetric capacitance for the high power electrode. As a result of complementary tailoring of the asymmetric electrodes, the layered device exhibits a wide 4V electrochemical window, and the highest power and energy densities reported thus far for carbon-based supercapacitors, 149 kW L-1 and 113 Wh L-1 in volumetric performance and 233 kW kg-1 and 177 Wh kg-1 in gravimetric performance, respectively.\n\tFinally, the mechanical and thermal energy harvesting devices based on high performance supercapacitor cells have been investigated due to the high specific capacitance and strong dependence with the pressure or temperature. For the mechanical energy harvesting devices based on supercapacitor cell, 40 mV open circuit potential change was obtained, resulting in the high energy harvested of 0.2 J/cc. For the thermal energy harvesting devices, 0.26 J/cc energy harvested per increasing/decreasing temperature cycle was achieved. The large energy harvested per cycle based on supercapacitor cells have surpassed all other energy harvesting devices based on pyroelectric and piezoelectric materials. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11199], "author_name_tesi": "Zhou, Yue ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yue", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Qiming Zhang", "Shizhuo Yin", "Noel Christopher Giebink", "Qing Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Chair", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member", "Noel Christopher Giebink, Committee Member", "Qing Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Energy storage", "Energy harvesting", "supercapacitor"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONAL LIMIT THEOREMS FOR SHOT NOISE PROCESSES WITH DEPENDENCE", "id": "14677yxz197", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14677", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We study shot noise processes when the shot noises are weakly dependent, satisfying the \u03c1-mixing condition.

A better understanding of such service systems will help improving system efficiency, optimizing system managements, and reducing costs. However, exact analysis is hard because of the non-stationarity, randomness and large-scale of such systems. Stochastic models in the heavy-traffic regime turn out to be useful to obtain approximations and provide insights for operational managements. My primary work in this dissertation is to study stochastic models with non-stationarity and to establish associated functional limit theorems.\nI have established a novel and powerful framework for proving functional limit theorems for two-parameter processes describing the system dynamics of non-stationary non-Markovian queueing models. In particular, I have studied i) infinite- server queues with non-stationary arrival and service times (arrival dependent services), ii) infinite-server queues with non-stationary arrival and weakly dependent general service times, and iii) non-Markovian many-server queues with non-stationary arrival and service times.\nI have also studied a new class of non-stationary shot noise models where the distribution of each shot noise depends on the shot time. Shot noise processes have been extensively studied, and have many applications in physics, insurance risk theory, telecommunications, and service systems. In particular, they include the infinite-server queueing models as special cases. My work weakens the i.i.d. assumption on shot noises in the existing literature and thus provides more flexibilities for modeling non-stationary shot noise phenomena.\nNon-stationary stochastic models usually suffer from mathematical intractability. The main theoretical difficulty is the lack of appropriate maximal inequalities for general stochastic processes.

Despite decades of research, the nature of the glass transition, whereby liquids transform to glasses under rapid cooling or compressing, is still a matter of debate. According to many leading glass theories, the dramatic slowing down of dynamics with decreasing temperature or increasing concentration---a key signature of the glass transition---is attributed to some underlying growing length scale. While a number of methods have been proposed, identifying the length scale relevant to the sluggish dynamics in glass-forming liquids remains elusive, since, after all, glasses are defined not by a common feature they share, but rather something they all lack: order.\n\nIn this thesis, we combine computational and theoretical approaches to study the dynamics and structures in glass-forming colloidal hard spheres, which is the simplest model glass-former and theoretically more tractable, as well as realistic polymer systems. First, we develop a novel crystal-avoiding method to suppress  crystallization while preserving the dynamics of monodisperse hard spheres, which allows us to probe the long-time dynamics of the system in metastable equilibrium and offers new opportunities to examine the effect of size polydispersity. Then, we introduce a purely geometric criterion for the glass transition in monodisperse hard spheres, based on potentially caged particles that are restricted to neighbor rearrangement. We also propose a graph theory-based method combining Voronoi tessellation and graph isomorphism to explicitly enumerate distinct inherent structures and thereby obtain the structural entropy. We find a finite structural entropy at the glass transition volume fraction for both hard disks and hard spheres. When applied to identify locally preferred structures, the graph method reveals growing icosahedral clusters in random dense hard spheres, whose lifetime increases significantly as the system is densified. Finally, we expose the hidden correlation lengths in glass-forming systems from the dynamical response to external perturbations ---pinned particles in colloidal hard spheres and free surfaces in polymer thin films. We find the correlation lengths obtained in both systems increase moderately as the glass transition is approached and correlate to the unperturbed structural relaxation times, as predicted by some theories.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14775], "author_name_tesi": "Zhou, Yuxing ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhou", "first_name_ssi": "Yuxing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott Thomas Milner", "Scott Thomas Milner", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn", "Ralph H Colby", "William George Noid"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott Thomas Milner, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott Thomas Milner, Committee Chair", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Member", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "William George Noid, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["glass transition", "colloidal glasses", "polymer glasses", "simulation", "structure and dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Help from Whom?

Next, various orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) schemes are applied to mitigate the multipath effect in IOWC and decrease clipping noise.

Daily, huge amount of social data are being created through fingertips, driven by various of social actions that involve a wide range of user-produced content (e.g. emails or collaborative documentations).

Accordingly, computational social network analysis has become an important topic in user data mining.\n\nDespite a long history of structural social network analysis and recent interests in user behavior analysis, little research has addressed social contents in social networks and heterogeneous networks in user behavior. In fact, social content and heterogeneity are two key elements in contemporary online social networks that offer great benefits: social contents provide more semantic information; meanwhile heterogeneous social networks allow diversified perception of users. Motivated by these considerations, this dissertation seeks to improve traditional computational social network analysis by covering analysis of not only (1) social networks of users; but also (2) social content composed by users, and (3) social actions among users. A series of new methods are presented for knowledge discovery in social documents and social networks, with a special focus on modeling social content and machine learning of heterogeneous networks. In particular, this study first proposes new probabilistic content models for user generated social documents and annotations and investigates the connection between social content and social actions.

The FMC laminate is basically a composite shell that has reinforcements orientated at a particular angle with respect to the longitudinal axis. F2MC tubes have been shown to provide actuation, stiffness change, and vibration reduction in applications that require isolated tubes or multiple tubes embedded in a soft matrix. Structural applications, however, often require stiff and strong materials. The objective of this research is to integrate relatively soft F2MC tubes into rigid host structures, by either embedding or bonding, such that the F2MC integrated structures can have tunable shape, stiffness, fluid pumping, vibration damping, or vibration absorption characteristics.\n\nFirst, we explore the functionality of F2MC tubes embedded into a stiff matrix. The geometry and anisotropy of the tube can be tailored for either highly leveraged fluid pumping under mechanical deformation or highly leveraged stiffness change by preventing fluid flow into or out of the tube. A bilayer analytical model is developed using Lekhnitskii\u2019s solution for an anisotropic tube under axial and pressure loading. The analysis shows a confining effect of the surrounding rigid matrix on the performance of F2MC tubes. With tailoring of the tube wall thickness (thick) and wind angle (near-axial), however, F2MC tubes can pump 250 times more fluid than a piston of the same diameter. Furthermore, axial stiffness can be increased by a factor of 2.2 when fluid flow is prevented. \n\nSecondly, the actuation performance of F2MC tubes embedded in structural media is investigated. The unit cell models examined are cylindrical and bi-layer with the inner layer being a thick walled F2MC tube and the outer layer representing the surrounding rigid composite and composed of either homogeneous epoxy or a second FMC layer made with stiffer matrix material. The analytical models are validated using ABAQUS. The analytical results show that actuation performance is generally reduced compared to that of an isolated F2MC tube due to the radial and longitudinal constraints. Free strain is generally two orders of magnitude smaller for an F2MC tube in structural media, requiring higher actuation pressures for bi-layer F2MC structures. The blocking force of F2MC in either epoxy or composite is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than that of an isolated F2MC tube. \n\nThirdly, we propose damping the vibration of a cantilever beam by bonding multiple F2MC tubes to the beam and using the strain induced fluid pumping to dissipate energy. Transverse beam vibration strains the F2MC tube and generates fluid flow through an energy dissipating orifice. An optimally sized orifice maximizes energy dissipation, greatly reducing the resonant peaks and increasing modal damping. An analytical model is developed based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and Lekhnitskii\u2019s solution for anisotropic layered tubes. Using miniature tubes, a laboratory-scale F2MC-integrated beam prototype is constructed and experimentally tested. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical predictions, provided the fluid bulk modulus is reduced to reflect the entrained air in the fluidic circuit. A design space study shows that damping ratios of 32% and 16% are achievable in the first and second modes of a cantilever beam, respectively, using an F2MC damping treatment.\n\nFinally, this research shows that F2MC tubes with resonant fluidic circuits can absorb and isolate vibration at a specific frequency when bonded to flexible structures. The transverse structural vibration applies cyclic axial strain to the F2MC tubes. The anisotropic elastic properties of the composite tube amplify the axial strain to produce fluid flow through a flow port and into an accumulator. The fluid inertance in the flow port (inertia track) and the stiffness of the accumulator are analogous to the vibration absorbing mass and stiffness in a conventional tuned vibration absorber or isolator. The collocated tip force to tip displacement analytical transfer function of the coupled system is derived for the vibration absorber analysis. For vibration isolation analysis, the tip force to base shear and moment transfer functions are derived. Experimental testing is conducted on a laboratory-scale F2MC beam structure. The resonant peak becomes an absorber notch in the frequency response function if the inertia track length is properly tuned. Tuning the fluid bulk modulus and total flow resistance in the theoretical model produces results that match the experiment well, predicting a magnitude reduction of 35 dB at the first resonance using an F2MC absorber. Based on the experimentally validated model, analysis results show that the cantilever beam vibration can be reduced by more than 99% with optimally designed tube attachment points and flow port geometry. The model also predicts 99.3% reduction of transmitted forces and moments from the tip force. For a given fluidic circuit design, however, the absorber, shear isolation, and moment isolation frequencies are different.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9847], "author_name_tesi": "Zhu, Bin ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn", "Charles E Bakis", "Martin Wesley Trethewey", "Alok Sinha", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn, Committee Chair", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Chair", "Martin Wesley Trethewey, Committee Member", "Alok Sinha, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vibration Control", "Fluidic Flexible Matrix Composite", "Passive Vibration Suppression", "Harmonic Resonance", "Damping Treatment"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Modulation Of Skin Cancer By Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor Beta/delta", "id": "15143", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7520", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ligand activation of peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor-\u03b2/\u03b4 (PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4) inhibits chemically-induced skin tumorigenesis and Ppar\u03b2/\u03b4-null mice exhibit enhanced chemically-induced skin tumorigenesis compared to wild-type mice. Since over 90% of chemically-induced tumors contain Hras mutations, this suggests that PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 could inhibit chemically-induced skin tumorigenesis by modulating Hras signaling, which was examined in this study. In addition, ligand activation of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 and inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) activity by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) can both attenuate skin tumorigenesis. The hypothesis that combining ligand activation of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 with inhibition of COX2 activity will increase the efficacy of chemoprevention of chemically induced skin tumorigenesis over that observed with either approach alone is also examined in this study. \nLigand activation of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 caused a negative selection against cells expressing higher levels of HRAS by inducing a mitotic block. Mitosis-related genes that are predominantly regulated by E2F were induced to a higher level in HRAS-expressing Ppar\u03b2/\u03b4-null keratinocytes as compared to HRAS-expressing wild-type keratinocytes. Ligand activated PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 repressed expression of these genes by direct binding with p130/p107, facilitating nuclear translocation, and increasing promoter recruitment of p130/p107. In addition, co-treatment with a PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 ligand and various mitosis inhibitors increases the efficacy of increasing G2/M arrest. Moreover, PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 suppresses tumorigenesis by promoting HRAS-induced senescence. PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 transcriptionally regulates Rasgrp1 and Ilk causing increased p-ERK and decreased p-AKT that promote HRAS-induced senescence. PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 also promotes senescence through attenuation of HRAS-induced ER stress and ER stress-associated UPR by repressing p-AKT-mTOR signaling. Further, these studies demonstrate a novel positive feedback loop between p-AKT, ER stress and UPR. An acute increase of ER stress is sufficient to establish the positive loop, maintaining higher UPR and p-AKT activity, collectively causing evasion of senescence and malignant conversion. Moreover, increased PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 expression and decreased ER stress correlated with increased senescence in both mouse and human tumors. \nLigand activation of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 with GW0742 caused a PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4-dependent delay in the onset of tumor formation. Nimesulide also delayed the onset of tumor formation and caused inhibition of tumor multiplicity in wild-type mice but not in Ppar\u03b2/\u03b4-null mice. Combining ligand activation of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 with dietary nimesulide resulted in a further decrease of tumor multiplicity in wild-type mice but not in Ppar\u03b2/\u03b4-null mice. Biochemical and molecular analysis of skin and tumor samples show that these effects were due to the modulation of terminal differentiation, attenuation of inflammatory signaling, and induction of apoptosis through both PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4-dependent and PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4-independent mechanisms. Increased levels and activity of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 by nimesulide were also observed.\nThese results are the first to demonstrate that PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 inhibits tumorigenesis through inhibition of mitosis and promotion of cellular senescence. These studies also identify a new pro-tumorigenic role of ER stress facilitated by attenuation of senescence. Moreover, these studies support the hypothesis that combining ligand activation of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 with inhibition of COX2 activity or inhibition of mitosis increases the efficacy of preventing chemically induced skin tumorigenesis as compared with either approach alone.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7458], "author_name_tesi": "Zhu, Bokai ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bokai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Yanming Wang", "Gary H Perdew", "Adam Bleier Glick", "Wendy Hanna Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Chair", "Yanming Wang, Committee Member", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Adam Bleier Glick, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PPARb/d", "HRAS", "Mitosis", "Senescence", "ER stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "POWER-AWARE AND QOS-AWARE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN WIRELESS NETWORKS", "id": "6380", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2421", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the advent of third generation wireless infrastructures and the rapid growth of wireless communication technology,people with battery powered mobile devices will have high-speed wireless data access at any time any place. However, due to the unique characteristics of wireless networks such as dynamic channel condition and limited energy supply, we cannot directly apply the existing resource\nmanagement schemes designed for wired networks to wireless systems. Therefore, new techniques are needed for efficient resource management in wireless networks.\n\nIn this thesis, we have designed and evaluated new scheduling schemes and medium access control (MAC) protocols that focus on power efficiency, QoS provision, fairness and bandwidth utilization\nin wireless networks. We first concentrate on prolonging the battery life of the mobile terminal by reducing the power consumption of the wireless network interface. Each mobile terminal uses its proxies to buffer data so that the wireless network interface can sleep for a long time period and tolerate the state transition delay. The base station applies our proposed\nscheduling schemes to service each flow in a power efficient way without loss of QoS requirements, and alleviates the impact of channel errors on QoS provision.\n\nWe then design the absence compensation fair queuing (ACFQ) model to improve service differentiation under bursty data traffic in wireless networks. To achieve good service differentiation without loss of QoS provision for\neach flow, an absence compensation model and an error compensation model are integrated into ACFQ. By the well-controlled absence compensations, ACFQ can provide much better service differentiation than the legacy fair\nqueuing models (e.g. the weighted fair queuing) under bursty data traffic.\n\nFinally, we propose the relay-enabled MAC protocols in the context of IEEE 802.11 based wireless networks. With the physical layer multi-rate capability, data can be transmitted at different rates according to the channel condition. As a result, when the transmission rate between the sender and the receiver is low, while high rates are available between the sender and the relay node and between the relay node and receiver, data can be delivered much faster through relay. We design protocols that enable the relay mechanism in the point coordination function and the distributed coordination function respectively. Many optimizations are\nused to reduce control overhead and deal with channel utilization issues.\n\nThroughout our study, we have paid considerable effort to deal with design difficulties introduced by limited power supply, dynamic channel conditions, effect of interference or capture, and stringent QoS requirements. We hope that such effort has allowed practical solutions for achieving high-speed data access and providing good QoS in wireless networks.\nMeanwhile, we theoretically analyze our schemes and extensively evaluate the performance via simulations to give a detailed understanding of the characteristics of our schemes.\nWe hope the results have a long, valuable life.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2405], "author_name_tesi": "Zhu, Hao ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Chitaranjan Das", "Thomas F Laporta", "George Kesidis", "Aylin Yener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Committee Chair", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Member", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Member", "George Kesidis, Committee Member", "Aylin Yener, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Wireless Networks", "Power-aware", "QoS", "Scheduling", "MAC"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Optimization of Matching Layer Design for Medical Ultrasonic Transducer\n\n", "id": "8444", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3120", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Matching layers are crucial components in ultrasonic transducers for medical imaging. Without proper matching layers, large acoustic impedance mismatch between piezoelectric resonator and the human body tissue will cause most of the ultrasound energy to lose. For a given frequency, the matching layer thickness should be one quarter of the wavelength and its acoustic impedance should be the geometric mean of the piezoelectric material and the imaging body. There are no natural materials that can meet such requirements, therefore, solid particle/polymer composites are commonly used as matching layer materials. The acoustic impedance of such composites should be in the range of 2-15 MRayls. Therefore, all ultrahigh frequency transducers currently used or under development are not properly matched because the lacking of desired materials. This problem hinders the development of finer resolution ultrahigh frequency ultrasonic imaging. \nIn order to increase the efficiency of matching layer, we have developed a TiO2 nano-structured material with high acoustic impedance and simple processing procedure. The material has porous nano-structure with the volume fraction of voids being controlled by the amount of bonding amorphous phase in the material. Its acoustic impedance can be tuned by controlling the total volume fraction of voids. Using the quarter wavelength thickness characterization method, the acoustic properties of this nano-structured material were accurately characterized. It is found that the acoustic impedance can reach as high as 7.19 Mrayls, which is a solid improvement compared to that of other available nano-composites. \nBecause of recent years?rapid development of the single crystal PMN-PT and PZT-PT materials in medical ultrasonic transducer applications, one of the main tasks of this thesis is to design matching layer with gradient acoustic impedance to achieve broad bandwidth. Wave propagation within multilayer structure has been analyzed and simulated with the principle of finite difference time domain technique by programmed application. By adjusting the acoustic impedance distribution, we get different output spectrums and therefore choose the best distribution functions.

By focusing on affluent schools, our analysis controls for what has been called the \u00a1\u00b0first digital divide\u00a1\u00b1\u00a8C the gap in technological access experienced by students across lines of race and socioeconomic status. Controlling for this gap allows us to examine the \u00a1\u00b0second digital divide,\u00a1\u00b1 the difference in the ways in which students actually experience technology in their classrooms (Attewell, 2001). In other words, this paper asks, how do public school teachers use computer technology when their access to resources is relatively unconstrained? What kind of teacher and school-level characteristics influence the way computers are actually used in classroom? These questions were addressed using the most recent (1999-2000) wave of data from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) Public School, Principal, and Teacher components. Since factor analysis failed to bring up dichotomous factors that conform to the presumed conceptual framework, a series of regression analysis was conducted separately over variables indicating ways computers are used in the most recent two weeks. There seems to be between-school variance when computers are used to obtain information, practice skills, solve problems, do word processing, and correspond via Internet. However, when computers are used for collaboration and multimedia projects, no significant school effects are found. The following teacher and school-level characteristics were found to affect the ways computers are used in classroom: At teacher level, a teacher\u00a1\u00afs priority rating of computer technology, level of control over instructional materials and skills to be mastered, age, class size, teaching experience, professional training on computer technology, and number of computers with Internet access in classroom; at school level, percentage of computers used for instruction, flexible instructional hours, number of computers in school, average level of control among teachers, school enrollment, average class size, and teachers\u00a1\u00af average age. Regardless of variations across schools, however, most schools tend to use computers in traditional ways. This indicates if school and district policy-makers believe transformational use of computers will help reform and restructure public schools, they should build up or strengthen characteristics that enhance transformational ways of computer usage, such as organizing professional workshops on technology use and model classroom sessions to demonstrate how computers are used for classroom instruction.

The main purpose of this thesis is to develop\na quantitative phase-field model for predicting microstructures\nand properties in real alloy systems which can be linked to\nexisting thermodynamic/kinetic databases and parameters obtained\nfrom experimental measurements or first-principle calculations. To\nachieve this goal, many factors involved in complicated real\nsystems are investigated, many of which are often simplified or\nignored in existing models, e.g. the dependence of diffusional\natomic mobility and elastic constants on composition.\n<p>\nEfficient numerical techniques must be developed to solve those\npartial differential equations that are involved in modelling\nmicrostructural evolutions and properties. In this thesis,\ndifferent spectral methods were proposed for the time-dependent\nphase-field kinetic equations and diffusion equations. For solving\nthe elastic equilibrium equation with the consideration of elastic\ninhomogeneity, a conjugate gradient method was utilized. The\nnumerical approaches developed were generally found to be more\naccurate and efficient than conventional approach such as finite\ndifference method.\n<p>\nA composition-dependent Cahn-Hilliard equation was solved by using\na semi-implicit Fourier-spectral method.

For bulk-diffusion-controlled coarsening, a\ncubic growth law was obeyed in the scaling regime, whereas a\nfourth power growth law was observed for\ninterface-diffusion-controlled coarsening.\n<p>\nThe characteristics of a microstructure under the influence of\nelastic energy depend on elastic properties such as elastic\nanisotropy, lattice mismatch, elastic inhomogeneity and externally\napplied strain. Specifically the effects of elastic inhomogeneity\non the coarsening of a two-phase microstructure were investigated.\nIt was generally found that the hard phase tends to form\nprecipitates surrounded by the soft matrix phase to reduce the\nelastic energy, in agreement with prior studies using first-order\napproximations.

The\nNi3Al precipitate shape evolution in a binary Ni-Al system was\nstudied as an example. Depending on the balance between\ninterfacial energy and elastic energy relaxation, the simulated\nmicrostructures developed different shapes at different sizes.\n<p>\nThe diffuse-interface model can also be employed for modelling\ntemporal mass diffusion transport through an arbitrary\nmicrostructure as well as the corresponding effective properties.\nFrom the comparison results in a wide variety of examples\nincluding the three kinetic regimes of grain boundary diffusion,\nthe effective property prediction obtained by the\ndiffuse-interface model was in good agreement with that obtained\nby using a conventional sharp-interface model.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3231], "author_name_tesi": "Zhu, Jingzhi ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jingzhi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen", "Qiang Du", "David John Green", "Karl Eugene Spear Ii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen, Committee Chair", "Qiang Du, Committee Member", "David John Green, Committee Member", "Karl Eugene Spear Ii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ni-base superalloys", "Spectral methods", "Phase-field", "Microstructural Evolution"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Essays on Monitoring Profile Data\n\n", "id": "8884", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3250", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Profile data emerges when the quality of a product or process is\ncharacterized by a relationship between two or more variables.\nEach complete sampling process yields a collection of data points\nthat can be represented by a functional curve (or profile).\nThe purpose of this work is to study novel models\nand procedures regarding monitoring profile data.\n\nMotivated by a vertical density profile problem,\nwe first focus on monitoring the slopes of linear profiles.\nA Shewhart-type control chart for monitoring slopes of linear\nprofiles is proposed.

There has been a strong and growing worldwide interest in the use of anion exchange membranes for electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems. Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have been regarded as promising energy conversion devices for stationary and mobile applications due to their potential low cost. To realize high-performance AEMFCs, new polymeric membranes are needed that are highly conductive and chemically stable. Herein, cross-linked, multication side chain, and fluorene side chain AEMs based on poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)s (PPO) were synthesized.  PPO was chosen as an AEM substrate because of its ease of functionalization at large scale and relatively good stability and membrane properties.\nTo produce anion conductive and durable polymer electrolytes for alkaline fuel cell applications, a series of cross-linked quaternary ammonium functionalized poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)s with mass-based ion exchange capacities (IEC) ranging from 1.80 to 2.55 mmol/g were synthesized via thiol-ene click chemistry. From small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), it was found that the cross-linked membranes developed micro-phase separation between the polar PPO backbone and the hydrophobic alkyl side chains. The ion conductivity, dimensional stability, and alkaline durability of the cross-linked membranes were evaluated. The hydroxide ion conductivity of the cross-linked samples reached 60 mS/cm in liquid water at room temperature. The chemical stabilities of the membranes were evaluated under severe, accelerated aging conditions and degradation was quantified by measuring ion conductivity changes during aging. The cross-linked membranes retained their relatively high ion conductivity and good mechanical properties both in 1 M and 4 M NaOH at 80 \u00b0C after 500 h. Attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectra were used to study the degradation pathways of the membranes, and it was discovered that \u03b2-hydrogen (Hofmann) elimination was likely to be the major pathway for degradation in these membranes.\nSide-chain containing AEMs with one, two or three cations per side chain were designed and synthesized, enabling a study of how the degree of polymer backbone functionalization and arrangement of cations on the side chain impact AEM properties. A systematic study of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) with multiple cations per side chain site was conducted to demonstrate how this motif can boost both the conductivity and stability of poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)-based AEMs.  The highest conductivity, up to 99 mS/cm at room temperature, was observed for a triple-cation side chain AEM with 5 or 6 methylene groups between cations.  This conductivity was considerably higher than AEM samples based on benzyltrimethyl ammonium or benzyldimethylhexyl ammonium groups with only one cation per side chain site. In addition to high conductivity, the multication side chain AEMs showed good alkaline and dimensional stabilities. High retention of ion exchange capacity (IEC) (93% retention) and ionic conductivity (90% retention) were observed for the triple-cation side chain AEMs during degradation testing in 1 M NaOH at 80 \u00b0C for 500 h. Based on the high-performance triple-cation side chain AEM, a Pt-catalyzed fuel cell with a peak power density of 364 mW/cm2 was achieved at 60 \u00b0C under 100% related humidity.\nAnion-conductive copolymers, poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)s containing fluorene side chains with pendant alkyltrimethylammonium groups, were synthesized via Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of aryl bromides with fluorene-boronic acids. The quaternized copolymers produced ductile, transparent membranes which were soluble in dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and methanol at room temperature. The fluorene side chain-containing membranes showed considerably higher hydroxide ion conductivities, up to 176 mS/cm at 80 \u00b0C, compared to that of typical anion exchange membranes based on the benzyltrimethyl ammonium moiety. The results of titration and hydroxide ion conductivity measurements demonstrated excellent chemical stability of the fluorene side chain-containing anion exchange membranes (AEMs), even after 1000 h immersion in 1 M NaOH at 80 \uf0b0C. The results of this study suggest a scalable route for the preparation of AEMs for practical alkaline fuel cell applications.\nA unique approach was employed to toughen AEMs by crosslinking the AEMs using commercial Jeffamine additives. Compared to the BTMA40 membrane, the 10% Jeffamine cross-linked membrane demonstrated significantly higher elongation at break. To be specific, the hydrated BTMA40 membrane showed a 51.7% elongation at break, while the 10% Jeffamine cross-linked membrane had a 166.8 % elongation at break. Clearly, the introducing of hydrophilic cross-linked network greatly enhanced the toughness of the AEMs.\nOverall, this thesis details a number of strategies for the large-scale production of PPO-based anion exchange membranes.  These strategies will be useful in going forward in the design and deployment of hydroxide, bromide, bicarbonate, and chloride-conducting membranes for water purification and electrochemical technology.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11647], "author_name_tesi": "Zhu, Liang ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Liang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Qing Wang", "Evangelos Manias", "Enrique Daniel Gomez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Chair", "Qing Wang, Committee Member", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Member", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Anion exchange membranes", "poly(2", "6-dimethyl-1", "4-phenylene oxide)s", "fuel cells", "fluorene side chains", "Suzuki-Miyaura coupling"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Livsic Theorem for cocycles with value in Gl(n,Q_p)", "id": "15288", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7722", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We extend the well-known results of Liv\\v{s}ic theorem on the regularity of measurable solutions to GL(n,Q_p) valued cocycles, where Q_p is the p-adic field, which is a non-archimedean field.

The study of plant herbivore defense is a popular field that allows researchers to investigate the mechanisms of plant defense.

To prove this hypothesis, I examined changes in different defense gene expression in response to caterpillar feeding in maize whorl and root tissues. The results indicate that leaf herbivory does induce defense gene expression in insect-resistant maize leaves and roots. \nPrevious research has shown that a cysteine protease called Mir1-CP accumulates in the whorls of insect-resistant maize Mp708. This research investigates mir1 gene transcript levels and Mir1-CP accumulation in the leaves and roots after feeding by the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) larvae, in V7 growth stage of maize. Experiment observations suggest that there is aboveground and belowground communication of maize. \nDefense gene expression during the different growth stages of maize was also investigated in this study. At different development stages maize may exhibit various levels of insect resistance and defense. This could result in variations of defense gene transcript levels in response to herbivory. \nThis research reveals that aboveground herbivory increases defense genes transcript levels both in aboveground and belowground parts of insect-resistant maize inbred line Mp708.

Both the theoretical models and experimentally established observations are reviewed, focusing on the magnetic and transport properties of (Ga,Mn)As epilayers. Next, the hybrid ferromagnetic\nmetal/semiconductor heterostructures are introduced. As an excellent candidate for\nmaking these heterostructures, the semi-metal MnAs is reviewed in terms of its structural\nand magnetic properties, which are essential for making the exchange-biased devices described in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6.\n\nThe second chapter describes the experimental techniques encompassed in the scope of this dissertation. Several important techniques, such as MBE growth, device patterning, magnetometry and transport measurements are discussed.\n\nThe third chapter reports the first experiment in this dissertation, which describes the\nlongitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) anomalies of a (Ga,Mn)As epilayer experiencing hard axis magnetization reversal in an perpendicular magnetic field. By probing the MRs for currents running along different crystallographic directions, the origins of these anomalies are identified, and a model based on magneto-impurity scattering is applied to simulate the MR curves at different temperatures.\n\nThe second experiment, described in the fourth chapter, focuses on low frequency electrical noise measurements in (Ga,Mn)As epilayers with different Mn concentrations. The temperature-dependent noise measurements show 1/f-like noise spectra in all the samples, with no observation of any anomalies across the Curie temperatures. However, in the less conducting sample, we find an increase of the integrated noise (over the span 125mHz-11Hz) in the temperature range from 6K to 29K, accompanied by random telegraph noise (RTN) in the time domain. From the magnetic field dependence of the\nRTN, we infer the existence of nanoscale magnetic clusters, whose fluctuations modulate hole transport.\n\nThe fifth and sixth chapters are dedicated to the study of exchange-biasing and spindependent\ntransport in (Ga,Mn)As/MnAs hybrid heterostructures. We demonstrate the fabrication of exchange biased devices based upon (Ga,Mn)As by using a hard ferromagnetic metal (MnAs) overlayer that is exchange coupled with a magnetically softer (Ga,Mn)As underlayer. This discovery of exchange biasing offers a new testbed for studying\nexchange coupling between metals and semiconductors and opens up opportunities\nfor engineering the coercivity of ferromagnetic semiconductors for device applications. In\nChapter 5, we first discuss vertical transport in MnAs/(Ga,Mn)As bilayers, demonstrating\na \"self-exchange biased\" spin valve effect in the current-perpendicular-to-the-plane geometry. Next, in Chapter 6, we discuss the transport properties of (Ga,Mn)As-based exchange-biased MTJs, wherein the tunnel magnetoresistance shows evidence for an\nexchange-spring configuration in the exchange biased (Ga,Mn)As layer.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4529], "author_name_tesi": "Zhu, Meng ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Meng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth", "Peter E Schiffer", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr.", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth, Committee Chair", "Peter E Schiffer, Committee Member", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr., Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["random telegraph noise", "Molecular beam epitaxy", "Mn)As", "(Ga", "Diluted magnetic semiconductor", "exchange biasing", "tunneling magnetoresistance"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "NUMERICAL SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THRUST PRODUCED BY A HOBBY\u2013SCALE PULSEJET ENGINE", "id": "26358", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11634", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The pulsejet is a type of jet engine in which combustion occurs in pulses.

This is in part due to the lack of observations to constrain physical mechanisms of the fragmentation process. While it is challenging to record fragmentation in faint optical meteors, observing meteors using HPLA (High-Power, Large-Aperture) radars can yield considerable information especially when employing coherent radar imaging (CRI). CRI can potentially resolve the fragmentation process in three spatial dimensions by monitoring the evolution of the plasma in the meteor head-echo, flare-echo, and trail-echo regions. On the other hand, the emerging field of compressed sensing (CS) provides a novel paradigm for signal acquisition and processing. Furthermore, it has been, and continues to be, applied with great success in radar systems, offering various benefits such as better resolution compared to traditional techniques, reduced resource requirements, and so forth.\nIn this dissertation, we examine how CS can be incorporated to improve the performance of CRI using HPLA radars. We propose a single CS-based formalism that enables the three-dimensions (3D)\u2014the range, Doppler frequency, and cross range (represented by the direction cosines) domain\u2014coherent imaging. We show that the CS-based CRI can not only reduce the system costs and decrease the needed number of baselines by spatial sparse sampling, which can be much less than the number required by Nyquist-Shannon sampling criterion, but also achieve high resolution for target detection. We implement the CS-based CRI for meteor studies with observations conducted at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO) in Peru. We present the unprecedented resolved details of meteoroids fragmentation, including both along and transverse to the trajectory spreading of the developing plasma, apparently caused by gross fragmentation and plasma diffusion parallel to the geomagnetic field. Moreover, we provide a statistical survey on the properties of low-altitude (\u2272~90 km) sporadic meteors based on three observation sets conducted in 15,16 April 2010 and 4 & 5 August 2014 at the JRO, respectively. We demonstrate the vast majority (~80%) of these low-altitude meteors exhibit low speed (|V|\u2272~25 km/s) and a large meteoroid entry angle (across the beam), suggesting that meteoroids fragmentation accompanied by particle flaring plays a significant role in the generation of these deep-in atmospheric echoes in addition to the classical ablation. Meanwhile, it also infers that the aerodynamic loading is inadequate to explain the fragmentation of those meteoroids. Additionally, the time distribution of these echoes shows an occurrence peak near 0300 (Local Time), which is earlier than the usual sunrise peak corresponding to the near-zenith transit of the apex-of-Earth\u2019s way. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12600], "author_name_tesi": "Zhu, Qian ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John D.

However, means for detecting and mapping the spatial heterogeneity are still limited. Effects of the spatial heterogeneity on water and fertilizer transport, transformation, and storage also have not been fully understood. The objectives of this study are two fold: 1) to understand hydropedological functions in an agricultural landscape typical of central Pennsylvania, including mapping and identifying soil moisture variation, subsurface flow paths, and soil properties spatial patterns, and 2) to examin how these quantified hydropedological functions affect soil nitrogen (N) availability to corn in this agricultural landscape, with implications for precision agriculture. \nFirst, we investigated appropriate kriging methods for mapping different point-based hydropedological properties over the landscape. We examined the combined impacts of sample size, spatial structure, and auxiliary variables on the interpolation accuracy for diverse soil properties and landscape features. The results showed that regression kriging (RK) is preferable when spatial structure can not be well captured (e.g., the ratio of sampling spacing over range > 0.5) or a strong relationship exists between target properties and auxiliary variables (e.g., R2 > 0.6); otherwise, ordinary kriging (OK) performs better for the hydropedological properties investigated in this landscape with multiple parent materials and gentler slope. \n Soil water movement and its controlling factors were investigated to understand hydropedological processes in relation to soil-landscape features. The deterministic 8 single-flow (D8) algorithm was used to simulate lateral concentrated subsurface flow paths at the interfaces of Ap1\u2013Ap2 soil horizon, clay layer (>40% clay cotent), and soil\u2013bedrock. The results confirmed that subsurface concentrated lateral flow only occurred at the interfaces of the clay layer and the soil\u2013bedrock. At these two interfaces, soils on the simulated flow paths were closer to saturation. Higher Mn content was observed on the simulated flow paths at the two interfaces. Soils on the simulated flow paths also had higher soil apparent electrical conductivity readings. \nWe then investigated the factors influencing soil moisture variations at four spatial scales in this landscape, including the entire farm (19.5 ha), landform unit (0.3-5.1 ha), plot size (10\u00d710 m), and hillslope transect (40\u00d72 m). The effects of soil properties, terrain attributes, and crop growth at multiple depths and in different seasons (growing vs. non-growing) were examined. The results showed that crop and soil influences on soil moisture dynamics were stronger during the growing seasons compared to the non-growing seasons, while topography influences showed an opposite effect. The topographic influences on soil moisture became more dominant as topography contrast or soil depth increased in the study area.\nNext, we conducted repeated electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys using different meters (EM38, EM31, and Dualem-2), dipole orientations (V and H), and geometries (HCP and perpendicular-PRP) to explore the best possible protocol for detecting soil and hydrological variations over the landscape. The results suggested that mapping different hydropedological properties using EMI should consider optimal timing (e.g., during wetter period), meter, dipole orientation, and geometry. Repeated EMI surveys within a few months revealed soil moisture temporal dynamics. Correlation between apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and soil moisture was higher (R2 = 0.59-0.77) in wetter areas. The EM31V with 6-m measurement depth had the best correlation to depth to bedrock (R2 = 0.58). Because the top 2 m of most soil profiles exhibited distinct differences in texture, the EM31H and EMHCP with 3-m measurement depth showed the best correlation with soil silt content (R2 > 0.45). \nFinally, this study examined the relationships between corn response to N fertilizer and related hydropedological processes. The experiment was conducted at three sites (labeled as A, B, and C), which represent distinct landforms (i.e., depressional area, steep slope, and flood plain), soil types (i.e., Hagerstown, Opequon, and Melvin series), and hydrological features (including drainage, subsurface flow, and Ksat). A replicated small-plot study was conducted in each of the chosen three sites, including four blocks of two N treatments (NH4NO3) applied to corn at planting (0 and 150 kg N ha-1). The results showed that Site A had the greatest grain yield and biomass because of its fine texture (>19% clay) and low Ksat (<0.3 cm min-1). Site B had the least grain yield, corresponding with the least inorganic soil N content because of its thin Ap1 and Ap2 horizons and shallow lateral subsurface flow at the soil-bedrock interface (0.4 m below the surface). Despite the higher amount of inorganic soil N content at Site C, the biomass and grain yield were small and resulted from the drier soil during the growing season.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5051], "author_name_tesi": "Zhu, Qing ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hangsheng Lin", "Hangsheng Lin", "Jason Philip Kaye", "John Earl Watson", "John Matthew Schmidt", "Kamini Singha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hangsheng Lin, Dissertation Advisor", "Hangsheng Lin, Committee Chair", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member", "John Earl Watson, Committee Member", "John Matthew Schmidt, Committee Member", "Kamini Singha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pedology", "Hydrology", "Geostatistics", "Soil property", "Soil moisture", "Soil Physics"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "FORMATION OF DISK GALAXIES IN \u039bCDM USING PARTICLE-BASED HYDRODYNAMICS", "id": "cc08hf617", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12895", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the past several decades, the current standard model of cosmology (\u039bCDM) has been established.

Although the nature of dark matter remains elusive, its dynamic evolution can be well studied since gravity is the only force at play.\nOn large scales, hierarchical structures form in the computer simulations which closely resemble the observed galaxy clustering properties. On small scales, how- ever, various tensions arise when numerical calculations are confronted with the observed galaxies.

Consequentially, misdiagnoses and ineffective use of resources may happen. \nTo better support clinical decision-making, a framework named Hypothesis-Driven Story Building (HDSB) was proposed to address the information challenges during clinical diagnosis. When given partial information, HDSB generates a list of hypotheses that can explain the current information and rank the hypotheses based on their likelihoods. If more information is needed, HDSB recommends a list of possible actions for information seeking, ranked in their effectiveness in differentiating the potential hypotheses. Whenever new information arrives, the HDSB framework updates the potential hypotheses accordingly.\nThe HDSB framework was built based on Multi-Layer Bayesian Network (MLBN), which is an extension of standard Bayesian network with relational representation on each node, enabling the probabilistic causal inferences for relations based on variable bindings. In MLBN, different conditional probability tables can be defined for different variable bindings so that the Bayesian inferences can be specialized or personalized and abductive reasoning can be conducted. \nA web-based clinical diagnostic decision support prototype SRCAST-Diagnosis was developed based on the HDSB framework. In a given scenario, SRCAST-Diagnosis will display patient conditions, recommend differential diagnoses, and rank lab tests to users. It was evaluated through a controlled experiment conducted at Hershey Medical Center. Participants including nurses, residents, and physicians were divided into a control group and an experimental group. Their actions (ordering lab tests and making diagnoses) were recorded.\nThe result showed that SRCAST-Diagnosis can significantly improve the diagnosis accuracy and reduce the cost of resources overall, although the performances for different role players may vary. The data also showed that the tool helped more decision-makers who made the wrong initial diagnosis eventually find the correct diagnosis (counteracting anchoring heuristics) and helped them quickly figure out the correct diagnosis with significantly less resource cost (counteracting confirmation biases). It can be concluded that misdiagnosis and ineffective use of resources are associated with human cognitive biases, and a well-designed decision support system is able to improve diagnosis accuracy and resource efficiency by counteracting the cognitive biases.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6098], "author_name_tesi": "Zhu, Shizhuo ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shizhuo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Yen", "John Yen", "Madhu Reddy", "Michael Mc Neese", "Christopher N Sciamanna"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Yen, Dissertation Advisor", "John Yen, Committee Chair", "Madhu Reddy, Committee Chair", "Michael Mc Neese, Committee Member", "Christopher N Sciamanna, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Clinical Diagnostic Decision Support System", "Hypothesis-Driven Story Building", "Cognitive Biases"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "PERK REGULATES CALCIUM DYNAMICS IN COGNITION AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE", "id": "05741r698", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "11544", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "          PERK (EIF2AK3), an ER-resident eIF2\u03b1 kinase, is well known for its role in eIF2\u03b1-dependent protein synthesis and translational control. Recent study in insulin-secreting \u03b2-cells revealed that PERK regulates Ca2+ dynamics in \u03b2-cells, which underlies glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and is protein synthesis-independent. In my thesis, motivated by PERK\u2019s acute regulation of Ca2+ dynamics in \u03b2-cells, I explored if PERK also regulates Ca2+ dynamics in pyramidal neurons, and whether this regulation plays any physiological role in the central nervous system. \n          I found that acute PERK inhibition by the use of a highly specific PERK inhibitor reduced Gq protein-coupled intracellular Ca2+ rise in cortical pyramidal neurons. Further experiments revealed that PERK inhibition increased IP3 receptor mediated ER Ca2+ release, but decreased receptor-operated Ca2+ entry from extracellular space.\n           Working memory is a cognitive function that is independent of new protein synthesis, but heavily relies on Ca2+ dynamics.

To test this hypothesis, I ablated Perk in the forebrain of an Alzheimer\u2019s disease mouse model. I found that knocking down PERK in the forebrain alleviated the Alzheimer\u2019s disease mice\u2019s behavior deficits, but did not affect the amyloid-\u03b2 plaque density or the expression of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-\u03b2 peptides in their forebrain. In addition, acute PERK inhibition corrected the exaggerated Gq protein-coupled Ca2+ signaling in primary neurons cultured from the Alzheimer\u2019s disease mice model. Considering the important role of Ca2+ signaling in Alzheimer\u2019s disease progression, it is possible that PERK regulates the disease progression by Ca2+ modulation.\n          Taken together, in my thesis work, I discovered that PERK acutely regulates Gq protein-coupled Ca2+ dynamics in pyramidal neurons, and PERK\u2019s modulation of Ca2+ dynamics may be directly connected to its regulation of working memory and its role in Alzheimer\u2019s disease progression.

Several shock tube experiments have revealed that conventional phenomenological approach can not accurately predict the internal temperature of the gas and also the corresponding radiation.\nIn particular, large rotational nonequilibrium in strong shocks has been observed in several experiments with high peak translational temperatures. The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is a particle-based simulation method that is capable of properly simulating flows with large nonequilibrium. In the experiments above, one dimensional shocks are most widely studied but they are challenging to simulate using the DSMC method due to the unsteady nature of the flows and especially for hypersonic flows with chemical reactions taking place. Therefore, efficient approaches for simulating one-dimensional shocks are developed for use in DSMC simulations.\n\nBoth a shock stabilization technique and a modified DSMC unsteady sampling approach are used in simulating one dimensional, unsteady shocks. In the latter approach, a moving sampling region is used to obtain an accurate profile of the reflected shock in air. The shock number density and temperature profiles are obtained and used to calculate excitation and radiation. The Quasi-Steady-State (QSS) assumption is made in the excitation calculation where both electron impact and heavy particle impact excitation for the NO(A) and the N2+(B) states are studied. The calculated NO radiation in the wavelength range of lambda = 235+/-7nm for shock speeds below 7km/s are in good agreement with the experiment, but, the predicted radiation is lower than the experiment for shock speeds above 7km/s. In addition, the N2+ radiation in the wavelength range of lambda = 391.4+/-0.2nm are in good agreement with the experimental data for shock speeds above 9km/s.  \n\nHigh fidelity models for simulating both the dissociation and relaxation processes in N+N2 and N2+N2 systems are also investigated. \nRelaxation cross sections are computed and the 99 bin method shows good agreement between the bin-to-bin and state specific relaxation cross sections for both N-N2 and N2-N2 relaxation. These relaxation cross sections are then implemented separately in 0D DSMC isothermal relaxation cases. For both cases, the rotational and vibrational temperatures relax to the equilibrium heat bath temperature. For N-N2 relaxations, the rotational temperature relaxes faster than the vibrational temperature at relatively low translational temperature and at a very similar rate to the vibrational temperature at relatively high temperature. These are in qualitative agreement with the observation of earlier experiments. \n\nThe one-dimensional binning method and associated cross sections by Parsons et al. are implemented in DSMC simulations and the results are compared with those using the traditional TCE and LB models. \nFor shock conditions similar to those in the experiments of Gorelov, it is found that the MD-QCT chemical reaction model predicts more dissociation and faster relaxation of the vibrational temperature. In the higher speed shock condition of the experiment by Fujita, the use of MD-QCT databases for both chemical reaction and internal energy predicts more dissociation in the downstream of the shock but slower relaxation of the rotational temperature.

However, the combinational energy-draining stresses of illness from environment, nutrition, and human migratory and cultural practices strike honey bee populations day after day, depriving them of long-term health. The possibility of a multi-factorial cause is one of the problems that make investigating colony declines especially complex. Pesticides are a major concern due to their widespread distribution within the hive. Beyond the effects of acute toxicity, pesticides are also likely to cause sublethal effects that result in behavior alteration or disorder of individual bees, together with the synergistic interactions among various pesticides in hive matrices, which eventually trigger serious harm to colony health. Therefore, a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental approaches were proposed to study the honey bee colony dynamics and quantify the colony-level effects of nutritional disturbance due to pesticides.\n\nFirst, a larval rearing method was adapted to assess experimentally the chronic oral toxicity to honey bee larvae of the four most common pesticides detected in pollen and wax - fluvalinate, coumaphos, chlorothalonil, and chlorpyrifos - tested alone and in all combinations. All individual or combined pesticides at hive-residue levels triggered a significant increase in larval mortality compared to untreated larvae by over two fold, with a strong increase after 3 days of exposure. Among these four pesticides, honey bee larvae were most sensitive to chlorothalonil compared to adults. Synergistic toxicity was observed in the binary mixture of chlorothalonil with fluvalinate at the concentrations of 34 mg/L and 3 mg/L, respectively; whereas, when diluted by 10 fold, the interaction switched to antagonism. Chlorothalonil at 34 mg/L was also found to synergize the miticide coumaphos at 8 mg/L. The three and four component mixtures of tested pesticides have mostly demonstrated additive effects in larval bees. One exception is that the addition of coumaphos significantly reduced the toxicity of the fluvalinate and chlorothalonil mixture, the only significant effect in all tested ternary mixtures. We also tested the common \u2018inert\u2019 ingredient N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at seven realistic concentrations, and documented its unexpected high toxicity to larval bees compared to adults. \nConsidering the extensive detection of chlorothalonil, its coexistence with other pesticides in diverse combinations especially in hive pollen and wax, and its substantial larval toxicity alone and in mixtures shown here, the potential impacts of fungicides on colony survival and development needed further investigation. Thus, we explored the potential hazard to honey bee larvae of frequently-found fungicides at environmentally relevant levels. Bravo\u00ae, its active ingredient (AI) chlorothalonil, and the formulations Nova\u00ae and Pristine\u00ae at environmentally realistic levels all triggered a significant increase in larval mortality through 6-d continuous dietary exposure. We also found a significant difference in larval toxicity of the fungicide formulation and its AI. Bravo\u00ae exhibited a monotonic and positive dose response for larval mortality, with hazard ratios increasing with concentrations; however, chlorothalonil showed a complex nonmonotonic dose response for larval mortality. A critical concentration of 3 mg/L was most toxic to honey bee larvae among those tested. Bravo\u00ae EC50 was significantly lower than the AI by a factor of 4.6 to 18.3. Enhanced toxicity of this formulation positively correlated with the length of exposure or the stage of larval development. The pairing of Bravo\u00ae and Nova\u00ae is the only mixture inducing significant synergism on mortality of larvae older than 3 days, with the mixture eliciting 2-times greater lethality than the expected concentration additive toxicity. This is the first study to report synergism for developing honey bee larvae between the non-systemic fungicide chlorothalonil and systemic EBI fungicide myclobutanil at environmentally relevant dietary levels. \n\nFor further testing of pesticide impacts at the colony level, and linking of larval responses to effects on later honey bee life stages and colony health, we developed a worker-based, stage-structured model of honey bee population dynamics. This model was formulated with combined difference and differential equations, consisting of six discrete stages based on honey bee temporal polyethism: egg, larva, pupa, nurse, house bee and forager stage. It is unique in capturing the adaptive feedback mechanisms in the population and resource dynamics in a healthy bee colony, including the comb pattern formation, brood maintenance and collective foraging behavior. By validating with independent data sets for colony numbers at different latitudes and under different conditions, our model represents the most advanced population model for integrating the top-down differential model and bottom-up difference model that gives the most refined and realistic details of colony population and resource dynamics to date. Two variance-based sensitivity analyses of the model suggested that the disruption of the numerical basis of colony population dynamics has only delayed impacts on colony survival compared to minor changes in colony social structure, especially the nurse-to-forager transition, which can have immediate and drastic consequences. The model simulations also indicated that a balanced allocation of workers with respect to dynamic changes in colony task demands, particularly during the fall season, which is the sensitive stage for colonies to prepare for entering the winter season, is the key to sustain the colony survival. This colony\u2010level simulation model represents a useful tool that can be used to integrate exposure and effects data at individual bee levels of potential stressors within the social dynamics of a honey bee colony. Based on our modeling results of the most influential role of nurse-to-forager transition in maintaining colony homeostasis, the future risk assessments should include testing pesticide impacts on life-history transition in honey bees. \nLastly, as a further step to extend our current modeling efforts, a decision support system (DSS) model (also called knowledge-based system model, expert system) was developed using the NetWeaverTM software, as a new and innovative method of transferring timely, up-to-date decision support to non-specialists and stakeholders for colony management and conservation. This expert system was built upon recent modeling work that determined, described and quantified the major indicators of the colony dynamics including: 1) reproduction quality of the queen, 2) brood-caring quality of nurse bees, 3) foraging quality of foragers, 4) quality of the nectar and pollen resource in the environment, 5) quantity of the honey and pollen storage in the hive, and 6) disease levels of the hive (the levels of Varroa mite infection).

A state-of-the-art review of the literature on quasi-static and cyclic test methods for interlaminar fracture testing is given.   The Mode I, Mode II, and mixed Mode I/II interlaminar fracture behavior of the carbon/epoxy laminated material in quasi-static and fatigue loadings was investigated using the double-cantilever-beam (DCB) specimen, the end-notched flexure (ENF) specimen, and the single leg bending (SLB) specimen, respectively. It was found that the Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness at crack onset (GIc) was low for the investigated material system in comparison to results reported in the literature for carbon/brittle epoxy material system. In addition, the Mode I fracture toughness increased by about 40% after 50 mm crack extension.   The Mode II quasi-static tests were conducted with precracked and un-precracked specimens. Compared to results reported in the literature, the Mode II fracture toughnesses (GIIc) of the investigated material were in the common range for carbon fiber composites made with brittle epoxies. The GIIc value of an un-precracked specimen was 44% -60% higher than that of a precracked specimen.  The mixed-mode fracture toughness (GTc) was found to be low in comparison to the results in the literature and it increased by 11 to 53% after 20 mm crack extension.    For all fatigue tests, the modified Paris\u2019 law was used to fit the experimentally determined crack growth rate per cycle (da/dN) versus the applied maximum strain energy release rate (SERR, Gmax). The delamination growth rate decreased rapidly with decreasing applied SERR, which gave rise to high exponents of the Modified Paris\u2019 law for Mode I, Mode II, and mixed Mode I/II fatigue tests, with the highest in mixed Mode I/II.    To assess the capability of commercial finite element software in solving delamination growth problems, a crack propagation analysis of the DCB specimen was carried out using the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) for Abaqus and Abaqus/Standard V6.7.

A silane coupling agent carbon nanofiller functionalization scheme has been developed.  The functionalization of nanofillers led to improved dispersion of nanofillers in the epoxy system.   Carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers with different ranges of aspect ratios and surface functionalities were chosen to modify an S2-glass/epoxy laminated composite made by a filament winding method.  The fillers were incorporated in the composite by one of two approaches: (1) impregnating the fiber tow with nanofilled resin during filament winding and (2) placing a nanofiller/epoxy interlayer between filament wound wet or dry fiber plies.  Using the nanofiller interlayer approach for fabricating the hybrid composite resulted in a maximum of 95% improvement in the mode I interlaminar fracture toughness (IFT) and a maximum of 109% improvement in the mode II IFT relative to the baseline material with no fillers. Contrastingly, the approach of impregnating the fiber tow with nanofilled resin resulted in slight or no improvement in fracture toughness. Higher aspect ratio functionalized nanofillers added to the interlayer were proven to be more effective in improving fracture toughness than unfunctionalized fillers with lower aspect ratio. Applying electric field in the through-thickness direction of the laminate to assist alignment of nanofillers increased the mode I IFT by a maximum of 105% compared to that of the baseline material.  Multidirectional glass fiber reinforced composite tubes were also fabricated using the two nanofiller placement approaches. Compressive strength and compression after indentation (CAI) strength were determined for nanofiller modified tubes as well as the control tubes without nanofillers.  Using either one of the two nanofiller placement approaches, the compressive strength and CAI strength are improved, with the highest improvement achieved by adding 0.5 wt% short COOH-CNT in the matrix (21% improvement in compressive strength and 17% improvement in CAI strength relative to the baseline material with no filler). \nCarbon nanofillers were aligned and chained in liquid epoxy and the glass/epoxy material by application of an AC electric field. The effect of filler functionality, AC electric field frequency, and strength, and filler concentration on the electric field alignment efficiency and the composite resistivity were evaluated.   Using unfunctionalized and high aspect ratio CNTs for modifying the epoxy were proven to be more effective in achieving high electrical anisotropy and low resistivity in the alignment direction by the electric field alignment method compared to that of functionalized fillers modified epoxy.   Increasing the AC electric field increases material anisotropy, but only within a range of field strength.  The material electrical anisotropy was highest at an AC field frequency of 1 kHz.  Without the addition of nonconductive fillers into the two phase nanofiller/epoxy composites, an anisotropy ratio of electrical resistivity in the transverse direction to that in the alignment direction of greater than 30 was achieved. With the addition of nonconductive glass fibers, the electrical anisotropy ratio reduces as the volume percent of the glass fiber increases and it reaches 1 when the glass fiber volume fraction is greater than 20%.     Glass fiber /epoxy composites with nanofillers were manufactured with an electric field applied during material fabrication for reduced resistivity in the through-thickness direction of the composite.  Interlaminar fracture, compression, and compression after indentation tests were conducted on the hybrid composites while measuring the electrical resistance (ER).  The ER signal was able to detect the onset of both delamination and compressive failure. In the case of delamination, the electrical resistance was correlated to the damage size by a third order polynomial.    \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12843], "author_name_tesi": "Zhu, Ye ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ye", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles E.

Therefore, causal inferences regarding the treatment effect are not as straightforward as in a randomized trial. To adjust for confounding due to measured covariates, the average treatment effect is often estimated by using propensity scores. The objective of this thesis is to develop innovative methods for estimating propensity scores in three different causal inference problems. \n\nIn the first part, we focus on the inverse weighted estimation of causal effect for a binary treatment. We propose a data-adaptive approach that combines parametric and nonparametric machine learning algorithms for estimating propensity scores. Some theoretical results regarding consistency of the procedure are given. Simulation studies are used to assess the performance of the newly proposed methods relative to existing methods, and a data analysis example from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database is presented.\n\nIn the second part, we extend the proposed methodology to causal mediation analysis using inverse probability weighting. We show that combining machine learning algorithms (e.g., a generalized boosted model) and logistic regression to estimate propensity scores can be more accurate and efficient in estimating the controlled direct effects than using logistic regression alone. The proposed methods are general in the sense that we can combine multiple candidate models and use a cross-validation criterion to select the optimal subset of the candidate models for combining. The criterion achieves a balance between the number of models we combine and the variability of the resulting estimator. Simulation studies are conducted and a data application to the Early Dieting in Girls study is presented.\n\nIn the last part, we study the causal inference problem with continuous\ntreatments. In the continuous case, the generalized propensity score is defined as the conditional density of the treatment given covariates. When the dimension of the covariates is large, the estimation of the conditional density suffers from the curse of dimensionality. We propose an alternative approach, L2 boosting, to estimate propensity scores. In L2 boosting, an important tuning parameter is the number of trees to be generated. We propose a criterion called average absolute correlation coefficient (AACC) to determine the optimal number of trees. A weighted AIC or BIC is then used to determine the parametric form of the dose-response function (DRF).

Current electro-thermal de-icing systems require large input power (>20 kw for Bell 412, 4 blades 12000 lbs model). Ultrasonic guided wave de-icing systems are introduced as a possible substitute for the current de-icing systems. These systems generate sufficient shear stresses at the interface between the accreted ice and the substrate to exceed the adhesion strength of ice, causing delamination of the ice layer via fracture and/or fatigue. Compared to the electro-thermal de-icing systems, ultrasonic de-icing systems have non-thermal in nature and have a potential to be low-power.\nIn ultrasonic de-icing systems, the interface shear stresses were generated at the ultrasonic vibration state. In order to gain insight of the ultrasonic de-icing systems based upon the ultrasonic waves and vibration, ultrasonically generated displacement wave structures for ultrasonic wave modes (mode 1 and mode 2) at the transient state were studied and compared to the displacement distributions at the steady state.  For modes 1 and 2, the wave structures in the transient state retain their properties as the ultrasonic guided waves transition to a vibration state.  \nA new structural design feature, termed called Tailored Waveguides (TWG) was introduced to maximize delaminating stresses via the introduction of discontinuities in the rotorcraft plate like structure. These discontinuities allowed the shear stresses at the ice/substrate interface to be focused on specific regions, hence facilitating low power ultrasonic de-icing. Finite element analysis results for TWG structure demonstrated that the introduction of tailored waveguides can generate more than 300% larger interface stresses compared to those of equivalent mass structures without tailored waveguides (i.e. uniform plates). Furthermore, parametric studies indicated that the interfacial shear stresses (ice/aluminum) can be doubled by reducing the spacing between the tailored waveguides. Several different waveguide and ice accretion configurations were examined. Experimental trends and power measurements correlated very well (within 15%) with numerical predictions over a wide range of test conditions. \nA shear mode piezoelectric actuator (exhibiting d15 coupling) was studied and compared to an in plane mode piezoelectric actuator (exhibiting d31 coupling). According to the finite element analysis results, the stresses generated by the shear mode actuator are 28% higher than the ones generated by the in plane mode actuator. \nShear stresses at the ice/substrate interface for different loading functions at different frequencies were explored. Normal mode actuation at 10 kHz generates the highest interface shear stresses, while the shear mode actuation at 20 kHz generates the highest values. At 30 kHz, the in plane actuation generates the highest interface shear stresses. \nFilled TWG structures were studied as optional approaches to a TWG structure. The filled TWG structure can increase the magnitude by 15%-20% in shear stress at the ice/aluminum interface without changing the shape of the geometry. Depending on the material properties of the filler inside the TWG structure, the interface shear stress values may vary. The material filled inside the TWG with a high Young\u2019s modulus and low density generates high interface shear stress values. \nInterface stress concentration coefficients (ISCC) and wave structure were studied for multilayer composite plates, thus the optimal mode (mode 1) and exciting frequency of 300 kHz- 450 kHz were chosen for de-icing on composite plates from the numerical analysis. Shear stresses at the inner ply interfaces were also calculated and compared to the failure stresses. It turned out that the shear stresses at the inner plies of the composite plate were ~10% of the failure stresses. De-icing experiments on the composite plate was conducted in an icing tunnel. The top and bottom edges of the composite plate remain clean as predicted by the finite element analysis at an input power of 60 watts. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6803], "author_name_tesi": "Zhu, Yun ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Edward C Smith", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Chair", "Edward C Smith, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aluminum", "composite", "de-icing", "ultrasonic", "Actuation", "Tailoring"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ROBUST PRECONDITIONERS FOR H(grad), H(curl) AND H(div) SYSTEMS WITH STRONGLY DISCONTINUOUS COEFFICIENTS", "id": "8775", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6892", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is devoted to practical design and theoretical analysis of efficient and robust preconditioners for solving algebraic systems arising from the approximation of partial differential equations, with special emphasis on the problems with strongly discontinuous coefficients. The problems considered here include the standard second order elliptic equations ($H(grad)$ or $H^1$ equations), as well as the second order elliptic systems given in terms of curl and divergence operators ($H(curl)$ and $H(div)$ systems).  \n\nIn regard to the $H^1$ equations with jump coefficients, we study both the multilevel and domain decomposition preconditioners. We analyze the eigenvalue distribution of the preconditioned systems, and prove that only a small number of eigenvalues may deteriorate with respect to coefficients and mesh size. We show that the other eigenvalues are bounded uniformly with respect to the coefficients of the PDE and bounded poly-logarithmically with respect to mesh size. As a result, the asymptotic convergence rate of the PCG algorithms is uniform with respect to the coefficients, and nearly uniform (up to a logarithmic factor) with respect to the mesh size. Various numerical experiments justify the theoretical results.\n\nFor $H(curl)$ and $H(div)$ systems, we give a comprehensive analysis of auxiliary space preconditioners, which rely on regular decompositions. Through such constructions, these preconditioners reduce $H(curl)$ and $H(div)$ systems to the solution of several $H(grad)$ equations, which are amenable by standard algebraic multigrid (AMG) techniques. We also develop a preconditioner for $H(curl)$ systems with jump coefficients. We show that the condition number of the preconditioned system is uniformly bounded with respect to coefficients and mesh size. Another class of preconditioners that we propose are the compatible AMG preconditioners for $H(curl)$ and $H(div)$ systems. This approach makes use of a compatible discretization framework. We reformulate the discrete systems into equivalent 2-by-2 block systems based on discrete Hodge decompositions on co-chains, and then construct the AMG preconditioners for the 2-by-2 block systems.

As one of the largest wireless access networks, the third-generation (3G) network has been largely deployed to cope with the increasing demand of wireless data services. One of the most popular data services, location-based service (LBS), is also booming as the mobile localization technology becomes available on most mobile devices. However, little is known from a network perspective about how these networks are used or how well these networks are performing. These wireless access environments are facing a variety of security and privacy threats, especially when their data access behavior remains unclear. \nFor example, recent cellular phone networks have begun allowing third-party applications to run over certain open-API phone operating systems, such as Windows Mobile, iPhone, and Google's Android platforms. With this increased openness, the fear of rogue programs written to propagate from one phone to another becomes even more real. Moreover, today's location-sensitive services rely on a user's mobile device to determine its location and use this location for all the services. This approach allows the user to cheat by having his device transmit a fake location, which might enable the user to access a restricted resource erroneously or provide bogus alibis. This dissertation explores several issues in the wireless mobile environments, from data access, data (worm) propagation, location data proof and privacy points of view respectively, and proposes innovative solutions to address these problems.\n\nFirst, we present an analysis of data services based on a nationwide 3G network trace collected by one of the largest cellular network service providers in U.S. Our work differentiates itself from previous studies by examining data service usage patterns and user mobility patterns from various dimensions, including applications, user roles, device types, and diurnal characteristics. As a unique data service in 3G networks, Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is studied in detail from various perspectives, such as message size, attachment type, message waiting time, etc. We look into network failures and study how these failures affect local and roaming users. We also discuss frequent registration failures and MMS failures to better understand how the network performs. Our results either verify some of the speculations in previous observations or reveal key areas for further research. These results are important to cellular network operators and protocol designers who can use them to improve network performance and user satisfaction.\n\n\nSecond, we propose a counter mechanism to contain the propagation of a mobile worm at the earliest stage by patching an optimal set of selected phones. The counter mechanism continually extracts a social-relationship graph between mobile phones via an analysis of the network traffic. As people are more likely to open and download messages received from friends, this social-relationship graph represents the potential propagation path of a mobile worm. The counter mechanism partitions the social-relationship graph via two different algorithms, balanced and clustered partitioning, and selects an optimal set of phones to be patched first because they have the capability to infect the highest number of other phones. The performance of these partitioning algorithms is compared against a benchmark random-partitioning scheme. Through extensive trace-driven experiments, using real IP-packet traces from one of the largest cellular networks in the U.S., we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed counter mechanism in containing mobile worms.\n\n\nThird, we propose A Privacy-Preserving Location Proof Updating System (APPLAUS) in which co-located Bluetooth-enabled mobile devices mutually generate location proofs and send updates to a location-proof server. Periodically changed pseudonyms are used by mobile devices to protect source-location privacy from other devices, and from untrusted location-proof servers. We also develop a user-centric location-privacy model in which individual users evaluate their location-privacy levels and decide whether and when to accept the location-proof requests. In order to defend against colluding attacks, we also present betweenness-ranking-based and correlation-clustering-based approaches for outlier detection. APPLAUS can be implemented with existing network infrastructure, and it can be easily deployed in Bluetooth-enabled mobile devices with little computation or power cost. Extensive experimental results show that APPLAUS can effectively provide location proofs, significantly preserve source-location privacy, and effectively detect colluding attacks.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7269], "author_name_tesi": "Zhu, Zhichao ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhichao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Peng Liu", "Sencun Zhu", "Aylin Yener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Committee Chair", "Peng Liu, Committee Member", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Aylin Yener, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["3G", "Data Mining", "Mobile Worms", "Social Network", "Location Proof", "Location Privacy"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "USING TIME-OF-FLIGHT SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY TO INVESTIGATE BEHAVIOR OF VAPOR-DEPOSITED METAL ON ALKANETHIOL SELF-ASSEMBLED MONOLAYERS ", "id": "6890", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7010", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Metal behavior on alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been studied for more than ten years. In the beginning, this system was regarded as an idealized model for understanding the metal/polymer interfaces. In recent years, molecular electronics has developed rapidly. Electronic properties of these devices using a number of functional molecules have been characterized using metal substrate/organic thin film/metal top contact sandwich structures. Therefore, the study of metal/SAM interfaces is of great importance. Our group has employed time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to characterize the SAM/top metal contact for many years, and it has proven to be a very powerful technique. Analysis of the mass spectra yields direct information about chemical reactions, metal penetration, and metal nucleation.\nIn this thesis, ToF-SIMS is applied to study the behavior of K, Au and Ti atoms on several alkanethiol SAMs. Au and Ti are the most commonly used contact metals in molecular electronic studies. The structure of the SAM/Ti interfaces and SAM/Au interfaces are important for measurements of electronic properties of functional molecules. K is an active metal and may be a potential reducing reagent to modify the surface of alkanethiol SAMs. It is also of interest to compare the difference between the chemical activity of K atoms on organic surfaces to that found in organic solvents.  \nIn Chapter 2, the K behavior on C15CH3 (-S(CH2)15CH3), C15CO2H, C15CO2CH3, C16OH, and C16OCH3 SAMs is investigated. It is found that K atoms react with -CO2H, -CO2CH3 and OH groups, forming -CO2K or OK.  The K atoms only form complexes with OCH3 groups, whereas no chemical reaction is observed on the -CH3 surface. The activity of these organic functional groups can be ranked as CO2H > CO2CH3 > OH > OCH3 > CH3. Most K atoms remain at the vacuum interface with very weak penetration through the organic layer in the CO2CH3, CO2H, OH and OCH3 systems. At the same time, no chemical interaction between K and the (CH2)n chain is found, indicating that K dose not alter the basic structure of alkanethiol SAMs.\nIn Chapter 3, the relationship between metal penetration and inter-molecular interactions is studied via the Au/SAM system. It is found that weak inter-molecular interactions lead to high penetration, and strong inter-molecular interactions lead to low penetration. For example, Au atoms continuously penetrate through C15CH3 and C15CO2CH3 films, forming smooth buried layers under organic thin films. Au atoms penetrate through the CO2H film, but form clusters due to H-bonding between CO2H groups. The K modified CO2CH3 or CO2H films are found to prevent Au atoms from leaking through the film. Apparently, the ionic interactions between adjacent film molecules block Au penetration while van der Waals forces and H-bonds do not. Thus, metal penetration can be controlled by adjusting inter-molecular interactions.\nIn Chapter 4, SAM/Ti top contact interfaces are investigated. Ti/organic functional group interactions can be ranked as Ti/CO2H > Ti/CO2CH3 > Ti/CH3. Vapor deposited Ti atoms are so active that they damage all surface organic functional groups and the (CH2)n chain.  At the same time, penetration of Ti atoms through the SAMs is weak. The Ti growth on active surfaces prefers a layer-by-layer mode, but the Ti growth on inactive surfaces prefers an island-enlargement process.\nThe temperature effect on metal penetration through the SAMs is studied in Chapter 5. Decreasing sample temperature is found to reduce metal penetration. However, at low temperature, H2O molecules can be condensed on the sample surface. The effect of H2O molecules on the structure of metal overlayers is not clear.\nIn this thesis, ToF-SIMS shows its unique ability to acquire information about chemical reactions between metal atoms and surface organic functional groups, penetration of metal atoms through the SAMs, growth modes of metal overlayers on top of the SAMs, and damage to organic molecules. All of these processes which are crucial for understanding the structure of SAM/top metal contact interfaces. It is found that the appearance of new characteristic peaks and the disappearance of initial peaks may indicate chemical reactions or damage of organic molecules. The relationship between metal dose and intensity of surface organic functional group-related peaks may suggest information about penetration or cluster-formation. At the same time, metal overlayers on the SAMs affect the intensities of SIMS signals. Removing the metal overlayers by chemical etching and then characterizing samples again is a complementary method that can supply useful information.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7007], "author_name_tesi": "Zhu, Zihua ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zihua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nicholas Winograd", "David Lawrence Allara", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Carlo G Pantano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nicholas Winograd, Committee Chair", "David Lawrence Allara, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ToF-SIMS", "self-assembled monolayer", "vapor metal deposition", "surface", "metal behavior", "molecular electronics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THREE ESSAYS ON ORGANIC MILK MARKETING AND CONSUMER PURCHASE BEHAVIOR\n\n\n", "id": "11064", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6809", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using fluid milk as a case study, this dissertation focuses on purchase behavior associated with two related consumer choices:  choosing organic or non-organic milk, and choosing private label (store brand) or national brand milk.  Milk serves as an excellent sector for a case study because organic milk sales are growing at increasing rates, non-organic private-label milk composes a large share of the market, and organic private-label milk is becoming more widely offered by U.S. supermarkets.  \nEssay I constructs four price series for the organic and non-organic private label and branded milk categories, and estimates a 3SLS system to see how these four prices react to each other.  For non-organic milk, we find that the PL price and the branded price are positively related, a result that is generally consistent with other research.  This type of price reaction can be labeled as cooperative and symmetric.  One the other hand, for organic milk, the national brand price and PL price react to each other differently.  The price of organic PL milk increases with an increase of organic national brand milk price, while instead the organic national brand milk decreases price with a price increase of organic PL milk.  This price reaction falls into the asymmetric dominant-fringe price competition, and fits the reality that organic national brand\u2019s market share is currently dominant in organic milk.\nEssay II estimates factors that influence consumers' hazard for first organic milk purchase.  A discrete time hazard model reveals that demographic variables, such as age, education, and household size affect the time of first organic milk purchase.  Another finding is that the organic milk price affects an organic milk purchase significantly, while the non-organic milk price does not.  Comparing the models with and without frailty, we conclude that neglecting unobserved heterogeneity underestimates the coefficients.\nEssay III uses an estimation of a two-stage decision model where customers are assumed to first decide whether to buy organic or non-organic milk, and then, conditional on that decision, decide whether to buy a store's private label brand or a national brand.  Results show that the effect of shopping patterns, coupon redemptions, and other marketing factors affect households\u2019 private label choice in a similar fashion, no matter organic or non-organic milk is first selected.  However, demographic factors depend on 1st stage selection.  Age and education significantly influence the private label choice for households who select organic but not for those who select non-organic, while income and household size only significantly influence non-organic buyers.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6807], "author_name_tesi": "Zhuang, Yan ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhuang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Jaenicke", "Edward C Jaenicke", "Spiro E Stefanou", "Alessandro Bonanno", "Debashis Ghosh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Jaenicke, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Chair", "Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Member", "Alessandro Bonanno, Committee Member", "Debashis Ghosh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["organic milk", "private label", "national brand", "marketing"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "LOSS PHENOMENOLOGY AND THE METHODOLOGY TO DERIVE LOSS FACTORS IN PIEZOELECTRIC CERAMICS\n", "id": "12219", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6811", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The key factor for the miniaturization of piezoelectric devices is the power density, which is limited by the heat generation or internal losses. With accelerating the commercialization of piezoelectric actuators and transducers, it becomes more and more significant to clarify the loss phenomenology, reduce the hysteresis losses, and increase the mechanical quality factor to enhance the efficiency and performance.\nThere are three loss components for piezoelectric vibrators, i.e., dielectric, elastic and piezoelectric losses. These loss factors are related with mechanical quality factors, which are the figure of merit of the material or device in the sense of efficiency. In order to obtain the mechanical quality factor Qm, IEEE standard provided the measurement method using the resonance and antiresonance frequencies. However, this characterization assumes that the Q value at resonance is equal to the one at antiresonance all the time, which is not consistent with experiment results. For practical materials there is sometimes a big difference between the mechanical quality factors of the resonance (QA) and the antiresonance (QB), and in most cases higher QB can be observed. Therefore, in recent several years we are focusing on a new resonance AC drive methodology to measure the admittance curve accurately around both the resonance and antiresonance peaks for piezoelectric materials, from which QA and QB can be derived by the 3dB method. Various piezoelectric materials were characterized with this technique.\nFurther, the equations were derived showing the relations between quality factors and loss factors by the complex analysis of the admittance/ impedance expressions for specific piezoelectric vibrators. Using QA, QB, and the electromechanical coupling factor k, we can obtain three types of loss factors precisely. Among various vibration modes of piezoelectric vibrators, we focus on k31, kt, k33, kp, and k15 modes, which cover all the 20 parameters of the ferroelectric material with &#8734;mm/6mm crystal symmetry, i.e. piezoelectric ceramic. Plus some other derivations using the fundamental correlations, 20 loss factors can be obtained for all parameters. Using this technique the piezoelectric loss factor is confirmed to be comparable to dielectric and elastic losses and it is the factor that determines whether QB is larger than QA, though it was previously neglected by most researchers. After getting the full loss matrices, the loss anisotropy was accordingly discussed, and the extensive loss factor was verified to be smaller than the intensive one.\nThis methodology is an essential supplement to the current IEEE standard on piezoelectric characterization. The simplicity and accuracy of this technique are very attractive, and hopefully this proposal will be widely accepted as a standard in the piezoelectric community in the future. The inclusion of three loss factors is important for the admittance analysis and thermal simulation of piezoelectric devices in the \u201cfinite element method\u201d software. Furthermore, taking into account the piezoelectric loss in addition to the dielectric and elastic ones, a new domain dynamic model will be established. Our phenomenological solution can be directly applied for the high power characterization methodology to clarify various materials\u2019 loss performances, and a principle for preparing high power density piezoelectric materials will be developed in the future.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6809], "author_name_tesi": "Zhuang, Yuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhuang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino", "Kenji Uchino", "Leslie Eric Cross", "Shizhuo Yin", "Clive A Randall", "Shujun Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenji Uchino, Committee Chair", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Shujun Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["loss characterization", "piezoelectric"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "IMPROVING RELEVANCE RANKING FOR UNDERSPECIFIED QUERIES", "id": "8162", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7000", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Search engines have become an indispensable gateways to the sheer amount of information on the Web. Due to the large number of webpages available on any given topic, search results displayed to the search engine users are usually ranked in descending order of their relevance to the query. Because users typically browse only the first few pages of search results, the quality of relevance ranking is critical to the search experience.\n\nIn this thesis, we address a challenging issue for relevance ranking in Web search: underspecified queries. To improve the quality of relevance ranking for underspecified queries, we exploit user feedbacks from two different perspectives. In the first part of this thesis, we address two common problems of underspecified queries. The first problem is that the top-ranked results for underspecified queries may not contain information that is truly relevant to the user's search intents, due to the large number of pages that could match the query. The second problem is that new webpages (even though relevant) may not be ranked high for an underspecified query due to their freshness. We propose to investigate what we called the query context, i.e. the distributional\ninformation of past queries from the search engine query logs, to refine the relevance ranking of the search results. Empirical evaluation shows that our proposal has improved over the current ranking system of a large-scale commercial Web search engine for 82% of the queries.\n\nIn the second part of the thesis, we study the modeling of collective expertise. We present a novel collaborative ranking model inspired by the network flow theory, which constructs a network based on search engine logs to describe the relationship among the entities in collaborative search: collaborators, queries, and documents. This formal model permits the theoretical investigation of the nature of collaborative ranking in more concrete terms, and the learning of the dependence relations among these heterogenous entities. We then propose FlowRank, a collaborative ranking algorithm derived from this model through an analysis of empirical usage patterns. We also discuss the implementation and evaluation of FlowRank, and report improvements over two baseline ranking algorithms.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6997], "author_name_tesi": "Zhuang, Ziming ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhuang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ziming", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Lee Giles", "Lee Giles And Prasenjit Mitra", "Prasenjit Mitra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Lee Giles, Thesis Advisor", "Lee Giles And Prasenjit Mitra, Thesis Advisor", "Prasenjit Mitra, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["search query", "relevance ranking", "information retrieval", "search engine", "data mining"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "MINING FEEDBACK IN RANKING AND RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS\n\n\n", "id": "8965", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13298", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The amount of online information has grown exponentially over the past few decades, and users become more and more dependent on ranking and recommendation systems to address their information seeking needs. The advance in information technologies has enabled users to provide feedback on the utilities of the underlying ranking and recommendation systems, and in return the systems to utilize such feedback for enhanced service. It is increasingly important to be able to tailor relevant information for different users and applications given various feedback. \n\nIn this dissertation, we study how feedback can be utilized to improve the service quality of ranking and recommendation systems, in the application context of Web search engines and large scale digital libraries. We &#64257;rst introduce a &#64258;ow-based collaborative ranking model of users' collective feedback in an online information seeking process. The model constructs a &#64258;ow-based network to describe the relationship among collaborating users, queries, and documents. This generic model allows us to quantitatively investigate the properties of a collaborative ranking process. We also present a collaborative ranking algorithm derived from this model. \n\nWe then study the implicit user feedback in query reformulations in the context of general purpose Web search ranking. Specifically, we apply the knowledge of user feedback to address the problems introduced by the under-specified queries. We propose an algorithm to leverage the query context to re&#64257;ne the relevance ranking of the search results. We describe empirical evaluations which demonstrate the benefits of our proposal. \n\nWe then study the utility of feedback in two vertical ranking and recommendation systems. The &#64257;rst is a geographic information retrieval system. We analyze users' historical clicks as their implicit feedback to the system, and study two click-based models to infer geographical preference based on mining the user click stream data. We are able to identify search queries and documents with spatial specificity, and generate e&#64256;ective relevance features for search ranking. \n\nThe second vertical is a venue recommendation system for digital libraries. We study the feedback loop of publication quality and venue organization, and propose a set of heuristics to automatically discover prestigious (as well as low-quality) publication venues by exploring the characteristics of the venue organizers.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12844], "author_name_tesi": "Zhuang, Ziming ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhuang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ziming", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C.

Unfavorable cell-and-protein interactions with biomaterial surfaces that lead to thrombus formation are major obstacles that modern surface engineering seeks to overcome. Future advances in the surface-engineering of blood-contacting biomaterials are critically dependent on a detailed understanding of how blood interacts with artificial materials at a molecular level.  Research summarized in this thesis is aimed at such a molecular understanding and seeks to establish structure-property relationships linking material characteristics such as surface chemistry/energy with the propensity to activate blood coagulation. \nBlood-plasma coagulation occurs through a series of linked zymogen-enzyme conversions collectively known as the plasma coagulation cascade. The so-called intrinsic pathway of this cascade becomes activated when plasma contacts artificial material surfaces.  As a consequence, all known cardiovascular biomaterials activate blood coagulation to a measurable extent.  Previous research (corroborated by this thesis work) demonstrated that the propensity to activate plasma coagulation scales as an exponential-like function of surface energy, with low catalytic potential observed for hydrophobic (poorly water wettable, low surface energy) materials and much higher activation for hydrophilic (fully water wettable, high surface energy) materials.  This thesis work further shows that the relationship between surface energy and contact activation holds only in the presence of plasma proteins, providing an important insight into the biochemical mechanism of plasma coagulation.\nBlood factor XII (FXII, Hageman factor) is central to contact activation. The intrinsic pathway of coagulation is potentiated by conversion of the zymogen FXII into the enzyme form, FXIIa, through a surface-mediated reaction termed autoactivation.  It is shown herein that autoactivation occurs with equal efficiency at hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces in neat-buffer solution but that autoactivation rate and yield is substantially attenuated at hydrophobic surfaces in the presence of plasma proteins. Thus it is concluded that FXII activation in the presence of plasma proteins leads to an apparent specificity for hydrophilic surfaces that is actually due to a relative diminution of the FXII&#61614;FXIIa reaction at hydrophobic surfaces. It is further concluded that contact activation of blood FXII in neat-buffer solution is not specific for anionic hydrophilic procoagulants as proposed by the accepted biochemistry of surface activation.  These findings may lead to a new paradigm for the interpretation of hemocompatibility that can guide development of advanced hemocompatible biomaterials.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5452], "author_name_tesi": "Zhuo, Rui ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhuo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Erwin A Vogler", "William O Hancock", "Christopher Alan Siedlecki", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Erwin A Vogler, Committee Chair", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Christopher Alan Siedlecki, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["coagulation", "FXII", "Thrombin", "Blood"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Effects of the Madden-Julian Oscillation on the Cyclogeneses of Hurricane Fausto (2002) and Hurricane Emily (2005)\n\n", "id": "8273", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5593", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Equatorial waves and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) play significant roles in the modulation of tropical convection and development of cyclones in all of the major storm basins.

Changes in molar enthalpy upon formation of the FCP1\u2013RAP74 complex were deconstructed into contributions from the primary driving force of that interaction, the hydrophobic effect, and other concomitant driving forces, such as those associated with helix formation.\n\tIn the current work, we attempt to parse the contribution of helix formation to stabilization of the IDP\u2013target complex through the generation of a helicity series by rational mutagenesis of the disordered protein. In this way, a panel of FCP1 mutants is prepared with amino acid substitutions that confer modulated helicity without disrupting the hydrophobic binding face. The extent of latent helical structure within each FCP1 variant has been quantified using circular dichroism spectroscopy and shown to be linearly correlated with various thermodynamic parameters derived from isothermal titration calorimetry and urea denaturation of the FCP1\u2013RAP74 complex.

Existing shear stress sensors lack the capability of resolving turbulent flow due to spatial and temporal averaging effects.  Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) can be advantageous for such applications because of their small sizes, tight dimensional tolerances, and enhanced dynamic characteristics.  However, concerns regarding bulk micro-machining accuracy and precision, dynamic variation for batch fabrication, and deflection measurement schemes must be resolved before sensor development can continue.\n\nThis research utilizes scanning electron microscope linewidth techniques to evaluate the manufacturing accuracy and precision by measuring individual beam widths to develop mean and 95% confidence intervals.  The beam dimension measurements exhibited a relative error of 1.75%  from design dimensions with a relative uncertainty of 2.83% for the bulk micro-machining process.  Dynamic characterization of the out-of-plane resonance is performed using laser doppler vibrometry techniques to determine the resonant frequency variation and investigate laser doppler vibrometry as a deflection measurement scheme.  The resonant frequency 95% confidence relative uncertainty is 1.44% averaged from 18 micro-fabricated devices with exactly identical design parameters.  Laser doppler vibrometry offers reasonable measurement resolution limited by probe volume and fringe spacing.  Range and bandwidth capabilities are limited by the signal processing equipment.

As early as 1902, Peirce was convinced of the need for a third normative science on which ethics and logic must depend for principles under his Comtean classificatory scheme; however, the classification of esthetics as this third science raises two serious objections.  The first objection states that ethics and logic cannot be made to depend on esthetics for principles without collapsing both sciences into hedonism.  Chapters 1 and 2 engage this first objection.  Chapter 1 considers Peirce\u2019s early and later arguments against hedonism and argues that the refutation of hedonism requires a phenomenological redescription of pleasure and pain rather than the disassociation of these phenomena from normative science.  Chapter 2 then works through Peirce\u2019s phenomenology of pleasure and pain and its implications for his theory of normative science.  The second objection concedes that esthetics is a theoretical science, but maintains that theoretical esthetics is prenormative rather than normative.  Chapter 3 reframes the problem of the normativity of esthetics through this second objection.  Chapters 4 and 5 then answer the objection that esthetics is prenormative by giving an account of the esthetic recognition of the summum bonum as a conscious and thus deliberately controlled process of habit formation.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2685], "author_name_tesi": "Ziemkowski, Joshua G.", "last_name_ssi": "Ziemkowski", "middle_name_ssi": "G.", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent M Colapietro", "John Philip Christman", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan", "Linda Furgerson Selzer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Chair", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Committee Member", "Linda Furgerson Selzer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pragmatism", "American philosophy", "Peirce"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Building Information Modeling Uses for Design in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) Industry\n\n\n", "id": "9094", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4751", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With new technology emerging, facility owners and project participants (designers, contractors, subcontractors and manufacturers) are investigating the most valuable uses for Building Information Modeling (BIM) on their projects.

This study, as part of a buildingSMART Alliance project, is focused on the implementation of BIM in the design segment of the AEC industry. The goal is the identification and definition of BIM uses in the design process with the purpose of them being implemented as the basis for a BIM Project Execution Planning procedure.\nThe research methods employed in this study include a literature review, expert interviews, and qualitative analysis of the data gathered. Interviews with 18 design professionals, engineers, industry experts and BIM champions were conducted, and their perspectives and opinions of using this new technology were collected. Qualitative data was analyzed using a content analysis procedure, and detailed results are presented including a taxonomy for the BIM uses in design, and future research steps.\nFrom the expert interviews, BIM is currently being used for targeted tasks within the design process, but not implemented on projects from initial phases of design through construction to operations. This is due to a lack of planning, infrastructure, tools, and expertise in general, and limited guidelines available for team members involved in the process. The core result of this research is the taxonomy including 15 BIM uses in design with their current frequency of use in four distinctive categories. These categories are: Design Communication, System Analysis, Estimating and Scheduling. The identified BIM uses in design are the basis for preparing a customized project execution plan for BIM.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4716], "author_name_tesi": "Zikic, Nevena ", "last_name_ssi": "Zikic", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nevena", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Messner", "John Messner", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba", "Robert J Holland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Messner, Thesis Advisor", "John Messner, Thesis Advisor", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba, Thesis Advisor", "Robert J Holland, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Implementation", "Design", "Building Information Modeling (BIM)", "BIM Execution Planning"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Anode and Electrolyte Selection to Improve Hydrogen Recovery in Microbial Electrolysis Cells ", "id": "14773eaz6", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14773", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) is a bioelectrochemical system that generates hydrogen from organic matter. A biofilm of microbes grows on an anode and oxidizes the organic matter, and then the electrons are transferred to a conductive cathode to electrochemically produce hydrogen gas. Conductivities of wastewaters vary, influencing the solution resistance, and therefore affecting the extent of treatment, current, and gas production. In order to scale up MECs, it will be necessary to reduce the spacing between the electrodes (to reduce the reactor width per pair of electrodes), but to still produce the same amount of hydrogen per projected area. Brush anodes have shown greater power densities than felt anodes in microbial fuel cells (MFCs), as brush anodes can be placed closer to the cathodes than felt anodes without power being adversely affected. However, oxygen crossover is not a factor for current generation in MECs. In this study, flat carbon felt anodes were compared to carbon brush anodes to determine if current densities and hydrogen production rates were affected by the type of anode. The use of flat anodes could reduce the width of the anode chamber, increasing the overall hydrogen production rate per volume of reactor for the same current. In addition, the impact of solution conductivity was examined to see if higher electrolyte conductivities could improve hydrogen production rates in MECs, as they do for current in MFCs. \nMFCs with carbon brush in a 2 cm long chamber or carbon felt anodes in a 4 cm long chamber were batch fed with sodium acetate in a 50 mM phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Following acclimation to this medium, the MFCs with the felt anodes produced a maximum power density of 0.80 \u00b1 0.02 W/m2, which was lower than that of the brush anodes (1.69 \u00b1 0.10 W/m2). These power densities were consistent with previous studies for both types of electrodes. The anodes were transferred and acclimated to two chamber MECs with anion exchange membranes and platinum carbon cathodes in the same medium until similar current was produced for at least 3 cycles. The brush anode MECs had a higher hydrogen production rate of 0.38 \u00b1 0.02 m3H2/m3d, with an average current density (current for 90% of the total charge transferred, I90) over the cycle of 4.2 \u00b1 0.5 A/m2. The MECs with felt anodes had a lower hydrogen production rate of 0.32 \u00b1 0.02 m3H2/m3d consistent with the lower current (I90 = 3.4 \u00b1 0.1 A/m2). The extent of acetate removal for a cycle, based on the change in chemical oxygen demand (COD) was also greater for the brush anode MECs (89 \u00b1 2%) than the felt anodes (71 \u00b1 2%).  The sharp decline in the current during a fed batch cycle of the MECs with the felt anodes suggested a diffusion limitation of substrate to the anodes, which could have reduced hydrogen production compared to brush anode MECs. To test this hypothesis, the anolytes of the felt MECs were stirred to improve mass transfer to the anode biofilm. Stirring increased the hydrogen production rate of the felt anode MECs by 8% to 0.41 \u00b1 0.04 m3H2/m3d. The I90 and COD removal also increased to 5.1 \u00b1 0.4 A/m2 and 92 \u00b1 1%. By improving mass transfer into the felt anode in an MEC with mixing, the current density, COD removal, and hydrogen production rate became comparable to that obtained with brush anode MECs. \nWhen the solution conductivity was increased to 100 mM PBS in MFCs, the power density improved for the felt anodes (1.00 \u00b1 0.04 W/m2), but it was still lower than that produced using brush anodes (1.25 \u00b1 0.12 W/m2). The MFCs with brushes showed a decline in power compared to the 50 mM tests, likely as a result of the higher phosphate concentration or oxygen intrusion adversely affecting the microbial community. When the anodes from these reactors were transferred into MECs, the decreased solution resistance did not improve the hydrogen production rate or average current density for the MECs with brush (0.37 \u00b1 0.10 m3H2/m3d, 3.9 \u00b1 1.6 A/m2), but did for the felt anodes (0.40 \u00b1 0.04 m3H2/m3d, 3.7 \u00b1 0.4 A/m2). Increasing the solution conductivity reduces solution and membrane resistance, but only improved hydrogen production rates for the felt anode MECs. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16260], "author_name_tesi": "Zikmund, Emily Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Zikmund", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce E.

The name of the disease is derived from the distinctive odor of the urine, often described as a \u201cburnt sugar\u201d smell.

An estimated 1 in 185,000 infants are affected worldwide, although the incidence is much higher in the Old Order Mennonite population \u2013 approximately 1 in 176.  Management of any of the five clinical manifestations of MSUD involves a strict diet devoid of BCAA.  Several reports in the literature detailing orthotopic liver transplants in children and adults have reported success in controlling plasma BCAA levels to the level of patients with a very mild variant of MSUD, despite non-restrictive diets.  However, liver transplantation is a major operative procedure that carries both an elevated surgical risk and a prohibitive financial cost.  Recent studies have suggested that adipose tissue has a previously unappreciated high capacity for BCAA metabolism and is already used extensively in reconstructive surgery.  Our hypothesis is transplantation of adipose tissue from a wild type mouse into mouse models of MSUD will reduce plasma BCAA levels to that of an unaffected animal.  Male and female knockout PP2Cm mice, a model of intermittent MSUD, received either wild type or adipose tissue from affected littermates.  Male and female BCATm mice, a mutant model of MSUD, received wild type fat or underwent a sham surgery.  Mice were challenged with a variety of diets \u2013 BCAA-free, modified BCAA-containing, 18% protein, and 50% protein \u2013 and plasma BCAA levels measured.  Although circulating plasma BCAA levels were not reduced following abdominal transplant of adipose tissue in PP2Cm mice, they were reduced with subcutaneous transplantation in BCATm mice.  Therefore, subcutaneous adipose tissue transplantation may have merit in the treatment of MSUD.

In order to hear their stories and understand how they have evolved into teachers of Spanish as a heritage language without formal training, I utilized narrative inquiry.  Ten university faculty members who are or have been directly engaged in teaching Spanish to heritage learners were interviewed.  Their stories remain intact, and I analyzed the data with three distinct lenses.  To understand how their experiences in their community of practice impacted their teaching, I utilized experiential learning theory/situative cognition.  To comprehend the manner with which university instructors learn to teach, specifically Spanish as heritage language, I considered the scholarship of teaching and learning.  To search for the pedagogies that appear to best meet the needs of these learners, I \ninvestigated culturally responsive teaching/whole person pedagogy. \n\tThroughout these narratives, participants described their teaching that in part subscribed to culturally responsive teaching and whole person pedagogy with commonalities discovered in experience, wholeness, community and co-construction.  Their experiences teaching within a community of Spanish speaking heritage learners contributed to their practice, and they in turn contribute to the practice by participating in the scholarship of teaching and learning. They learn through experiences within the community of practice that in effect teaches them.

Although the \u0192\u00d7-class is widely distributed, only one CA (Cam from a methanoarchaeon Methano-sarcina thermophila) has been characterized while no physiological function has yet been documented.  The work presented in this thesis contributes to the general understanding of the biochemistry of CAs by kinetically investigating Cam, the prototypic \u0192\u00d7-class CA.  In these studies, Cam was shown to utilize a hydrogen bond network analogously to the hydrogen bond network described for the \u0192\u00d1- and \u0192\u00d2-class CAs that involves Cam active site residues Gln75 and Asn73.

GCDH is required for complete oxidation of lysine and tryptophan within mitochondria.  Affected individuals accumulate glutaric acid and 3-hydroxy-glutaric acid (3-OHGA) and often suffer acute striatal injury in the course of an encephalopathic crisis between 6 and 18 months of age.  Current treatments for GA-1 include lysine restriction and low protein diets to limit glutaric acid producing substrates.  Unfortunately, one-third of affected children do not respond to treatment and experience striatal injury despite early diagnosis and careful clinical management.  An animal model is needed to better understand the events that lead up to striatal injury and to develop more effective treatments.  Prior attempts to produce an animal model of GA-1 that presents with neuropathology similar to the human disease, including development of GCDH-deficient mice, have been unsuccessful.  We hypothesized that neuropathology may be induced in GCDH-deficient mice by supplementation with increased dietary protein or lysine.  Here, we show that high protein diets are lethal to 4-week-old and 8-week-old Gcdh-/- mice within 2-3 days and 7-8 days, respectively.  High lysine alone resulted in vasogenic edema and blood brain barrier breakdown within the striatum, associated with serum and tissue glutaric acid accumulation, neuronal loss, hemorrhage, paralysis, seizures and death in 75% of 4-week-old Gcdh-/- mice after 3-12 days.  In contrast, most 8-week-old Gcdh-/- mice survived the high lysine diet, but developed white matter lesions, reactive astrocytes and neuronal loss after 6 weeks.  Thus, lysine supplementation in Gcdh-/- mice appears to be a useful model to study GA-1.  Based on the neuropathology in this model including neuronal loss and blood-brain barrier breakdown, we hypothesized that GCDH expression may be limited to neurons and endothelial cells.  Here we use double-label immunohistochemistry to identify the cell types expressing GCDH in the brain and electron microscopy to detect the earliest pathologic changes associated with protein or lysine diet exposure.  Neuronal vacuolation with mitochondrial swelling and disruption are shown here as the earliest pathologic events consistent with neuronal localization of GCDH expression.  In order to better understand the developmental differences associated with age-dependent susceptibility, we tested for changes in amino and organic acid accumulation between weanling and adult Gcdh-/- mice.  Weanling but not adult Gcdh-/- mice on a high lysine diet had substantial brain lysine and glutaric acid accumulation with depletion of \u00e1-ketoglutarate, glutamate, glutamine, GABA, coenzyme-A, and ATP.  Reduced brain lysine utilization with maturity may account for diminished susceptibility to encephalopathy in GA-1.  Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that controlling brain lysine uptake may be protective by supplementation with other basic amino acids known to compete with lysine.  Based on the standard use of glucose therapy in human GA-1, we also tested whether glucose supplementation could increase the survival rate of lysine supplemented weanling Gcdh-/- mice.  Here we show that both glucose and homoarginine therapy separately improved survival and reduced brain glutaric acid levels.

By refashioning the historical account of their Order\u2019s founding in textual and visual sources, the Hermits transformed St. Augustine from a North African bishop to a mendicant father, alongside St. Francis of Assisi and St. Dominic. This dissertation examines how the Order promoted its evolving founding narrative and celebrated its spiritual ideals through monumental artistic narratives of Augustine\u2019s life, produced in churches and monasteries in fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Italy. As the friars invented a new iconographic tradition for the saint, they highlighted a different aspect of Augustine\u2019s identity \u2013 his singular role as the father and founder of the Hermits. My focus on Italian monumental cycles enables me to discern patterns of decoration in early Renaissance churches and to examine the importance of narrative art to the Order\u2019s corporate aims.\n\tMy study provides a richer understanding of mendicant patronage by examining a saint whose vita differed from the biographies of traditional founder saints, and an order whose founding narratives contrasted sharply with the more contemporary origins of the better known Franciscans and Dominicans. Despite the prominence of the Hermits as distinguished artistic patrons, the scholarship on Augustinian art remains scarce in comparison to the voluminous studies devoted to Franciscan and Dominican patronage. As a result, the Hermits are often excluded from studies of Franciscan and Dominican art. As a fifth-century North African saint, Augustine differed in many fundamental ways from his fellow mendicant founders. My study investigates how the \u201cnew\u201d St. Augustine fit into the established paradigm of the mendicant founder, and how the Order\u2019s representation of their founder compared to the conventional models of mendicant art patronage in general. In some cases, this comparative approach reveals the creativity of artists and patrons in transforming Augustine\u2019s image to conform to the established model of mendicant founder, as European saint and mendicant exemplar. In other instances, this study illuminates how the Hermits challenged the traditional image of the mendicant founder and departed from the artistic traditions of the Franciscans and Dominicans.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13555], "author_name_tesi": "Zins, Katie Allison", "last_name_ssi": "Zins", "middle_name_ssi": "Allison", "first_name_ssi": "Katie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian A Curran", "Brian A Curran", "Robin Lemuel Thomas II", "Elizabeth Bradford Smith", "Sherry Lynnette Roush"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian A Curran, Dissertation Advisor", "Brian A Curran, Committee Chair", "Robin Lemuel Thomas II, Committee Member", "Elizabeth Bradford Smith, Committee Member", "Sherry Lynnette Roush, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Augustinian Hermits", "St. Augustine", "Mendicant order", "Renaissance", "Art"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Lexico-semantic Interaction in Chinese-english Bilingualism", "id": "14157", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7344", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The hundreds or thousands of objects that we commonly encounter in daily life are often categorized under a few names that convey some similarity between them (e.g., various types of\ncups), a behavior known as lexical categorization.

Previous picture naming studies of language production have focused on highly familiar object stimuli that elicit uniform responses among native-speaker participants.

Drawing on research in lexical categorization, I document variation in native-speaker picture naming behavior and examine how this naming behavior and the underlying neural responses change as a result of language interaction in bilinguals.\n\nBehavioral studies (Chapter 2) measure differences in lexical categorization patterns (picture naming responses over many different examples of an object name) among monolingual and bilingual speakers of Chinese and English. Further, this inter-personal variation is explained in terms of speakers' unique language histories and norms of each linguistic community (native speakers of English and Chinese). I propose a statistical model which describes the role of these variables in each language in predicting categorization patterns in both the native language (L1) and second language (L2), identifying significant effects of cross-language interaction for bilinguals in both languages.\n\nNext, I introduce a new stimulus set of 407 objects sampled from several semantic domains (e.g., clothing and vehicles) and normed by native, monolingual speakers of English and Chinese (Chapter 3). This stimulus set demonstrates the extensive variation in picture naming responses among native speakers of each language and between languages. I use these norms to examine a few specific variables relating to native speaker norms identified in the previous chapter.\n\nIn the final set of experiments (Chapters 4 and 5) I select a subset of 183 objects from the new stimulus set to test functional neural correlates of these categorization variables in native, monolingual speakers of each language and in Chinese-English bilinguals. Each categorization variable is associated with brain regions that uniquely respond to its variation, and activity in these regions confirms functional involvement of both L1 and L2 variables in bilinguals' L1 picture naming behavior.

This dissertation focuses mainly upon the characterization of sliding ice over a bed in an unstable fashion.  I investigate unstable sliding through instances where it is observed in passive seismology as well as a focused laboratory study.  The laboratory study attempts to isolate specific aspects of the sliding interface, which could lead to unstable sliding.   Implications of unstable sliding with regards to erosion are also dealt with.  Initially the TAMSEIS array is used to observe a unique set of seismicity originating at the base of David Glacier Antarctica in which  ~20,000 events were located over a ~300 day period as the ice slid over an asperity.  Tidal effects at the terminus modulated the interevent spacing and magnitude of events allowing for a basic analysis of healing process between a glacier and its bed.  The 300 day period of repeat seismicity is hypothesized to arise from advection of debris rich ice over the asperity.  Next the erosion implications of stick slip sliding are investigated.  Sudden advancement associated with seismic energy generation is hypothesized to rapidly expand water filled cavities, which form in lee of bedrock highs.  The rapid expansion creates a drop in water pressure within the cavity resulting in a pressure gradient leading to rapid fracture of bedrock.  During the interseismic period of a stick slipping glacier the static coefficient of friction transfers a larger shear stress to the bed than the dynamic coefficient of friction from stably sliding glacier would.  Next laboratory experimentation is conducted using a biaxial shearing apparatus in order to test the hypothesis that debris rich ice can affect the stability regime of a sliding glacier.  This is preformed on a suite of ice-debris samples with range entrained debris percentages and temperatures.  Both synthetic ice constructed in the laboratory and natural ice taken from the base of Engabreen Glacier were tested.  Transition from a velocity strengthening to velocity weakening interface was observed for a constant velocity if the debris amount was increased thus validating the initial hypothesis.  These exterminations were followed by a set of experiments in which the biax was de-stiffened in order to replicate the elastic strain, which would be accumulated at the base of a glacier.  When driven under conditions previously identified in the unstable slip regime unstable sliding did occur.  This allowed for exploration unstable slip parameters.  Specifically comparisons of stress drop with recurrence interval, and peak-sliding velocity was investigated.  Next POLENET seismic data was used to investigate a set of repeating ruptures occurring near the Executive Committee Range of Marie Byrd Land Antarctica, a known source of volcanic activity.  Surface velocities as low as V < 30 m/yr in this region exist indicating the source of glacially generated seismicity was atypical.  A proposed source of a sudden addition of basal melt water from an increase in geothermal heat flux is hypothesized to result in the seismic signature observed.  Lastly the POLENET dataset was used to investigate calving events located at the terminus of Thwaites Glacier.  The seismicity displayed a monochromatic signal.  A new calving mechanism, which could produce such a source of seismicity, is theorized as resonating within the block, which is being calved off.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7824], "author_name_tesi": "Zoet, Lucas Keith", "last_name_ssi": "Zoet", "middle_name_ssi": "Keith", "first_name_ssi": "Lucas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Richard B Alley", "Chris Marone", "Charles James Ammon", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard B Alley, Committee Member", "Chris Marone, Committee Member", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Glaciology", "glacial erosion", "glacial sliding", "unstable sliding", "seismology"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "OPTIMIZATION-DRIVEN DESIGN OF SYNTHETIC GENETIC CIRCUITS USING BIOBRICKS\n", "id": "12546", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "454", "abstract_tesi": "The comprehensive compilation of the building blocks of synthetic genetic circuits in the MIT registry of standard biological parts (http://parts.mit.edu/) has provided a repository of spare parts to rationally create devices and systems with desired properties.

We applied this framework to a variety of applications including design of a genetic toggle switch, a genetic decoder and a genetic half adder unit. The identified designs are consistent with previously constructed circuit configurations and in some cases point at completely new architectures.

First, an efficient optimization-based procedure, namely SL Finder, is introduced for the targeted enumeration of multi-gene (and by extension multi-reaction) synthetic lethals using genome-scale metabolic models. The complete identification of all double and triple gene and reaction synthetic lethals as well as some quadruple and higher order ones using the iAF1260 metabolic model of E. coli uncovered complex patterns of network robustness and gene/reaction utilization and interdependence thereby providing a bird\u2019s-eye-view of the avenues available for redirecting metabolism. Subsequently, a systematic optimization-based protocol is presented for the curation of metabolic models using multi-gene deletion (i.e., synthetic lethal) experiments. By using the existing and developed curation procedures, 90 distinct modifications for the iMM904 metabolic model of S. cerevisiae along with several regulatory constraints were identified and vetted using literature sources. Incorporation of the suggested modifications led to substantial improvements in the prediction accuracy of the iMM904 model for essentiality and synthetic lethality data. Next, a comprehensive flux balance analysis (FBA) framework, called OptCom, is introduced for the metabolic modeling and analysis of microbial communities. In contrast to earlier FBA approaches that are based on optimization problems with a single objective function, OptCom relies on a multi-level and multi-objective optimization formulation to properly describe trade-offs between individual vs. community level fitness criteria. The applicability of OptCom is demonstrated by modeling three different microbial communities of varying complexities to uncover the inter-species interactions, identify the optimality levels of growth for the species involved, and examine the possibility of adding a new member to an existing microbial community. \n\nIn next part, the OptForce procedure is employed as a computational strain design tool to identify the minimal set of metabolic interventions leading to overproduction of L-serine in E. coli. The suggested interventions include not only straightforward upregulation of the terminal pathway but also non-intuitive manipulations distant from the target product. Finally, the focus is shifted from steady state flux balance analysis to kinetic and dynamic modeling of metabolic networks using the ensemble modeling (EM) approach. Here, an optimization-based algorithm is proposed to pro-actively identify gene/enzyme perturbations that maximally reduce the number of retained models in the ensemble after each round of model screening. The applicability of this procedure is demonstrated using a metabolic model of the central metabolism of E. coli and by successively identifying single, double and triple enzyme perturbations (i.e., knockouts, overexpressions or combinations thereof) that cause the maximum divergent flux predictions by the models in the ensemble. Overall, the wide array of mathematical tools presented in this dissertation highlights their utility for model-driven analysis and redesign of metabolic networks.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7653], "author_name_tesi": "Zomorrodi, Ali Reza", "last_name_ssi": "Zomorrodi", "middle_name_ssi": "Reza", "first_name_ssi": "Ali", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas", "Costas D Maranas", "Ali Borhan", "Howard M Salis", "Reka Z Albert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas, Dissertation Advisor", "Costas D Maranas, Committee Chair", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Howard M Salis, Committee Member", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Metabolic networks", "Flux balance analysis", "Metabolic Enginnering", "Optimization", "Systems biology"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Modeling and Simulation of Cryogenic Fluid Injection and Mixing Dynamics under Supercritical Conditions", "id": "6561", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4806", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-12-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research focuses on the modeling and simulation of cryogenic fluid injection and mixing processes under supercritical conditions.  The objectives are: 1) to establish a unified theoretical framework that could accommodate full conservation laws, turbulence closure, and real-fluid thermodynamics and transport phenomena; 2) to systematically investigate the underlying physiochemical mechanism at near and supercritical conditions, and 3) to construct a quantitative basis for identifying and prioritizing the key design parameters and flow variables that exert strong influence on the injector behavior in different environments.\nThe theoretical formulation is based on the full conservation laws and includes real-fluid thermodynamics and transport phenomena over the entire temperature and pressure regimes of concern.  Thermodynamic properties, such as enthalpy, internal energy, and heat capacity, are directly calculated from fundamental thermodynamics theories and a modified Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equation of state.  Transport properties, such as viscosity and thermal conductivity, are estimated with an extended corresponding-state principle.  Mass diffusivity is obtained by the Takahashi method calibrated for high-pressure conditions.  Turbulence closure is achieved using a large-eddy-simulation (LES) technique, in which large energy-carrying structures are computed explicitly and effects of unresolved motions on the resolved scales are modeled.  Modified Smagorinsky models extended to compressible flows is used to treat interaction with subfilter-scale.  The resultant governing equations are calculated numerically using a preconditioned, density-based finite volume method along with a dual-time-stepping integration algorithm.  All of the numerical relations, including the Jacobian matrices and eigenvalues, are derived from fundamental thermodynamics theories that can accommodate any equation of state.  The resultant algorithm has been proven to be robust and efficient.  Further numerical efficiency is achieved by utilizing a parallel computation scheme that involves the message-passing interface (MPI) library and multi-block treatment.\nThe theoretical model and numerical scheme were first validated against experimental data of cryogenic nitrogen fluid injection under supercritical conditions.  Both two- and three-dimensional simulations were conducted.  Reasonably good agreement was obtained in terms of the mean density distribution and the jet spreading angle, with a maximum deviation of 8%.  The jet dynamics were largely dictated by the local thermodynamic state through its influence on the fluid thermophysical properties.  When the fluid temperature transited across the inflection point on an isobaric density-temperature curve, the resultant rapid property variations might qualitatively modify the jet behavior compared with its counterpart at 1 atm.  Increasing ambient pressure produced an earlier transition of the jet to the self-similar region in the simulations.\nWe also examined the flow and flame dynamics of a shear coaxial injector using liquid oxygen and methane.  Emphasis was placed on the effects of momentum flux ratio on the near-field flow evolution.  An increase in momentum flux ratio enhanced the turbulent mixing between two streams, and gave rise to a shorter liquid oxygen jet core.  The dynamics of liquid oxygen injection through a swirl injector was investigated systematically.  The flow development inside the swirl injector could be divided into developing, steady, and acceleration regimes.  The influences of various injector geometric parameters and flow conditions on the swirl injector performance were investigated through a parametric study.  Results indicated that both the liquid film thickness and the spray cone angle, representing the most important design parameters of a swirl injector, were strongly influenced by the swirling strength of the injected fluid.  Those parameters, however, did not depend strongly on the mass flowrate.  Therefore, a larger oxidizer swirl element with greater mass flowrate than that of the shear coaxial injector still could obtain the required intraelement mixing efficiency.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4783], "author_name_tesi": "Zong, Nan ", "last_name_ssi": "Zong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vigor Yang", "Andre Louis Boehman", "James Gordon Brasseur", "Robert John Santoro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vigor Yang, Committee Chair", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member", "James Gordon Brasseur, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["General Fluid Thermodynamics", "Supercritical Jet", "Mixing Layer", "Preconditioning Method"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Multicriteria Approach to Spare Parts Inventory Problem with Obsolescence", "id": "26578", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11267", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis considers multi-criteria optimization models to solve the spare parts inventory problem which are prone to obsolescence.

Next, a bi-criteria optimization problem is formulated on the basis of a continuous review inventory policy with two criteria: minimizing the Weighted Expected Total Cost (ETC) and maximizing the Weighted Cycle Service Level (CSL). The weights for the spare parts are calculated using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with three main criteria: Stockout Implication, Type of Spare Part and Carryover Potential. The efficient frontier of the bi-criteria optimization problem is generated using the \"constraint\" approach.

The theoretical framework grounding this research was critical public pedagogy, influenced by both critical theory and Stuart Hall\u2019s systems of representation (1997).  This framework attempts to understand the learning and unlearning that takes place through various texts and in public venues.  The study aimed to further understand adult education for critical consciousness through art as evidenced in the work of Camnitzer.  There is limited literature on critical public pedagogy because it is a nascent branch in the adult education field.  For data collection, this qualitative research study used interviews with conceptual artist Luis Camnitzer and with others familiar with his work as well as textual analysis of his work.  \n     The findings of the study indicated that Camnitzer exemplifies the connection between art and adult education for critical consciousness.  First, his work encourages interaction and critique of ideas and social conditions of society, and he hopes that his art will help re-present reality in ways that the audience may not have expected.  Secondly, it promotes exploration of the relation between art and politics, and art as a communicator and mediator of culture.  Third, Camnitzer uses a variety of media to foment challenges to the status quo while also involving the audience in a unique role of co-creator of meaning.  It is in this role that the audience awakens to a social responsibility drowned out by the conventionalities of the structures.  All of these are hallmarks of critical consciousness and adult education.

This process typically occurs at chemical synapses, where presynaptic release of chemical neurotransmitters leads to excitation or inhibition of the postsynaptic cell.  Neurotransmitter release is triggered by calcium influx through presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels. In Drosophila, the molecular basis of presynaptic calcium channel function has been defined through our analysis of a temperature-sensitive (TS) paralytic mutant of the calcium channel alpha1 subunit gene, cacophony (cac).  This mutant, referred to as cacTS2, has also served as a starting point for further genetic analysis. To broaden our understanding of the functions and interactions of cac-encoded calcium channels, we have conducted a screen for genetic modifiers of cacTS2. Of ten mutations recovered, four were intragenic and six were extragenic. Analysis of intragenic modifiers has broadened our understanding of intramolecular interactions within the calcium channel alpha1 subunit.\nHere we report characterization of three extragenic enhancers of cacTS2, which map to a single locus designated as e(cac)A. Genetic analysis, sequencing analysis, complementation tests, immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry have shown that e(cac)A is futsch, the homolog of microtubule-associated protein 1 (MAP1) in Drosophila. Electrophysiological analysis of synaptic transmission has revealed that futsch mutations enhance the synaptic phenotype of cacTS2. Furthermore, immunocytochemical analysis indicates that the localization of presynaptic calcium channels, microtubules and actin as well as the distribution of synaptic vesicles is normal in futsch mutants, suggesting a role for dMAP1/FUTSCH in synaptic function. Accordingly, dMAP1/FUTSCH exhibits a punctate distribution along microtubules within presynaptic boutons and extending to active zones. Taken together, our findings have implicated novel molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmission, in which a specialized form of presynaptic microtubule-based cytoskeleton may function in synaptic transmission through interactions with presynaptic calcium channels.\nA part of this work has revealed posttranslational proteolytic processing of a dMAP1/FUTSCH protein precursor as demonstrated previously for mammalian MAP1s. A ~20kD fragment of dMAP1/FUTSCH was specifically detected using a newly developed anti-LCf antibody and this was shown to be a dMAP1/FUTSCH light chain by colocalization with the heavy chain at the neuromuscular synapses and co-immunoprecipitation of the heavy and light chains. These findings demonstrated a structural conservation among MAP1 proteins. Further molecular and functional characterization is expected to define the in vivo roles of MAP1 in synaptic transmission and the underlying mechanisms. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [818], "author_name_tesi": "Zou, Beiyan ", "last_name_ssi": "Zou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Beiyan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener", "Gong Chen", "Kyung An Han", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Richard W Ordway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener, Committee Chair", "Gong Chen, Committee Member", "Kyung An Han, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["synaptic transmission", "MAP1", "presynaptic calcium channel", "cacophony", "futsch", "Drosophila"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Development and Application of the ReaxFF Potential for Heterogeneous Catalysis and Metal Oxidation: Toward the Dynamic Sampling of Large Free Energy Surface", "id": "23613", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10636", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A ReaxFF force field has been developed to describe the complex catalytic chemical reactions on the surface of the iron/iron carbide Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts. Based on fitting parameters against an extensive training set containing data obtained from both ab-initio calculations and experimental measurements, the ReaxFF potential can reproduce reasonably well the potential energy surface of a relevant Fe/C/H/O atomistic system. The force field is first validated by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to describe the dissociative adsorption and desorption of hydrogen molecules on iron and iron carbide surfaces. It was found that the existence of carbon atoms at the subsurface sites tends to increase the hydrogen dissociation barrier on the surface, and also stabilizes the adsorbed surface hydrogen atom. \nWe then used this force field to study the complex catalytic surface chemistry as one will typically encounter at the initial stage of the FT synthesis. By performing MD simulations using relevant atomistic systems, the carbon monoxide methanation and the hydrocarbon chain initiation processes were studied. It was found that the catalytic methanation initiates from the undissociated CO molecules absorbed on the surface of the catalyst. This process leads to the generation of surface absorbed CHx- groups which initiate the synthesis of methane and the hydrocarbon chain growth. Direct hydrogenation of the surface carbide was not observed in the simulation. Coordination analysis of the carbon atoms in the system shows that the surface carbon atoms tend to diffuse toward the subsurface sites. This diffusion indicates the tendency of the formation of iron carbide at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, MD simulations enable us to investigate the various reaction pathways of key intermediates under FT conditions. We found that the surface CH- groups can dissociate into surface carbon atoms or be further hydrogenated into CH2- groups. The latter is an important intermediate species in the synthesis of methane as well as the chain initiation. Results from the C-C coupling simulation suggested the preference of coupling between CH- and CH2- groups. These results agree with the available experimental observations and ab-initio based study. This study demonstrates that the ReaxFF reactive potential can efficiently probe the catalytic heterogeneous interface, generate complex reaction networks, and hence improve our mechanistic understanding of heterogeneous catalysis.\nDuring catalytic surface reactions, the metal materials will also experience oxidation and corrosion under realistic working conditions at high temperature. In order to study the metal oxidation phenomenon, we have developed a new ReaxFF potential for the Ni/O system. The force field was validated by performing MD simulations of self-diffusion of nickel and the interstitial diffusion of oxygen. The predicted diffusivity and the activation energy achieved quantitative agreement with their respective published values. Furthermore, this force field enables us to study the effects of vacancies on the diffusion of interstitial oxygen and the successive initiation of internal oxidation. A new oxygen diffusion mechanism is proposed in which the oxygen atom diffuses via the movement of the oxygen-vacancy pair. In addition, our MD simulation results suggest that the voids at the grain boundaries can induce local oxygen segregation due to the strong oxygen-vacancy binding effect. This segregation is responsible for the formation of nickel oxide particles in subsurface voids. These results demonstrate that the ReaxFF MD study can contribute to bridging the gap between the QM calculations and the experimental observations in the study of metal oxidation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10270], "author_name_tesi": "Zou, Chenyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Zou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chenyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Michael John Janik", "Donghai Wang", "Lasse Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin, Dissertation Advisor", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Chair", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ReaxFF", "Heterogeneous Catalysis", "Metal Oxidation and Diffusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Flow Classifier with Tamper-resistant Features and an Evaluation of Its Portability to New Domains\n\n", "id": "11581", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2119", "abstract_tesi": "Flow classification techniques can be applied to network and end-host security, e.g., a flow whose\ndestination port number indicates one application type, but whose features reflect another, is\nan anomaly that may indicate malicious activity.

Although, conventional granular activated carbon (GAC) has a very limited capacity for removing arsenic, it was found that tailoring GAC by preloading iron could enhance its bed life, when the iron tailored GAC was coupled with precorroded iron, the GAC\u2019s bed life could greatly enhanced.  \nFor carbon tailoring, incipient wetness method and organic-iron preloading method were employed. 1-3% Fe loading was achieved with organic-iron preloading method and 3-6% Fe loading was achieved via incipient wetness method. Compared with virgin GAC, the citric acid-iron preloaded GAC could extend the GAC\u2019s bedlife by over 20 times to 7000 bed volumes of 50 ppb arsenic containing water processed before 10 ppb breakthrough. The incipient wetness method could further extend the GAC\u2019s bedlife by 2 times. \nPrecorroded iron material, coupled with Organic carboxyl-Fe preloaded granular activated carbons (GAC), have been appraised as an innovative technique for removing arsenic from groundwater. The effective precorroded iron materials have included Galvanized Steel Fittings and Perforated Steel Sheets. Rapid Small Scale Column Tests (RSSCT\u2019s) and mini column tests had been conducted to evaluate the arsenic removal capacity of the procorroded iron coupled with tailored carbon. The arsenic was found to be removed by both the iron column and the GAC column, with GAC column as the major absorber. The pH, idling and precorrosion protocol affect the iron release and arsenic removal. The combination of a precorroded iron column followed by a iron \u2013 tailored GAC column removed arsenic to below 10 ppb for as much as 248,000 bed volumes (BVs) at pH 6. These tests employed Rutland, MA groundwater with native As of 47 ~ 55 ppb. Idling the system for one time extended the bed life of by 2 time, but caused a short period arsenic breakthrough after column restart. \nArsenic removal in the GAC column was proportional to the iron amount accumulated in the GAC column. The iron amount accumulated in the GAC column was generally controlled by the operating pH, but was also affected by the precorrosion conditions of the iron and the idling of the system. The arsenic removal in the iron column was generally higher with lower pH. Moreover, as the column just started up, the removal was also controlled by the iron pre-corrosion condition. A longer precorrosion period has promoted arsenic removal in the iron column. The arsenic removal was generally lower with aged PSSs as the column just started, this was attributed to the release of iron (hydr)oxides particles from the iron column; but with longer aging period of more than 10 days, arsenic removal by aged PSSs could be greatly increased. \nThe precorrosion protocol influenced the formation of surface corrosion layer of the iron, which in turn, affected how the iron was released and accumulated in the GAC column, especially when the column just restarted. The morphology and structure of surface corrosion products on precorroded steel sheets were studied via scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) method. The results showed that the morphology of surface corrosion products was highly related to iron release and arsenic removal. Fresh precorroded steel sheets have a uniform surface, while aged precorroded steel sheets exhibited a heterogeneous surface with some areas covered with thick, porous scales. Lepidocrocite (&#947;-FeOOH), humboditine (FeC2O4(H2O)2) and clinoferrosilite (Fe1.5Mg0.5Si2O6) are the mainly component on the fresh precorroded steel sheet, while goethite (&#945;-FeOOH), lepidocrocite and magnetite (Fe3O4)are the primary component of the aged precorroded steel sheet surface. After they were employed in the column for arsenic removal, the primary phase on precorroded steel sheet changed to goethite and magnetite, calcite was also detected. Arsenic extracted from precorroded steel in iron columns contain only As(III) when the column was operated at pH < 7 and had been idled. XAFS study of the GAC in pH 7.5 column indicated the presence of reduced iron phases such as FeO and green rust, some As(V) has also been reduced to As(III). Idling the columns for 7 days is promoted a reduction reaction in both the iron and the GAC columns. \n      \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3282], "author_name_tesi": "Zou, Jiying ", "last_name_ssi": "Zou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon", "Fred Scott Cannon", "Brian Dempsey", "John Michael Regan", "Paul C Painter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon, Dissertation Advisor", "Fred Scott Cannon, Committee Chair", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Paul C Painter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Arsenic removal", "activated carbon", "precorroded steel", "iron release"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Cis-elements for Notch-dependent expression and autoregulation of Drosophila AP-2 in developing leg and antenna", "id": "6402", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3245", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Transcription factor AP-2 family genes have important roles in limb, orofacial and nervous system development in vertebrates and Drosophila. Null mutations in dAP-2, the sole AP-2 gene in Drosophila, cause severe leg shortening, loss of tarsal joints, and defects in proboscis, antenna, and central nervous system development. Drosophila is an excellent model system for genetic and bioinformatic analysis of regulatory gene networks within which AP-2 transcription factors function in developing tissues. \nThis doctoral thesis describes research I have carried out using molecular genetic, transgenic, and comparative genomics approaches to identify cis-elements in dAP-2 that mediate its expression in developing leg and antenna (i.e., leg and antennal imaginal discs) of Drosophila. Previous studies showed that dAP-2 is expressed along the proximodistal (PD) axis of the developing leg in a segmental pattern representing future leg joints, and that dAP-2 expression in presumptive tarsal joints (4 distal-most joints) was dependent on Notch signaling. I have extended these findings by showing that dAP-2 is expressed in leg and antennal discs in nine and eight PD-axis domains, respectively; and that, in both disc types, the four distal-most dAP-2 expression domains require Notch signaling, while the remaining more proximal domains do not. I have identified two enhancers on dAP-2 genomic fragments BXE and E6 that activate reporter gene expression in distal (BXE) or proximal regions (E6) of leg and antennal discs in patterns coincident with endogenous dAP-2 expression. Both enhancers function preferentially with the dAP-2 exon 1a promoter. BXE contains multiple sub-fragments that act synergistically to mediate Notch-dependent activation and positive autoregulation by dAP-2 itself. Two essential binding sites for Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H), the transcription factor which transduces target gene effects of Notch signaling) and one essential binding site for dAP-2 were identified by phylogenetic footprinting, electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA), site-directed mutagenesis and in vivo reporter gene analysis. These findings prove that dAP-2 is a direct target of Notch signaling in presumptive tarsal joints. Genome wide searches for other genes that conserve sequences found in BXE and E6 may identify gene batteries with roles in morphological diversification of proximal versus distal regions of the leg and antenna. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3232], "author_name_tesi": "Zou, Jizhong ", "last_name_ssi": "Zou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jizhong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Scott Gilmour", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Pamela J Mitchell", "Kyung An Han"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Pamela J Mitchell, Committee Chair", "Kyung An Han, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["comparative genomics", "Drosophila", "enhancer", "Notch signaling", "leg development", "transcription factor AP-2"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Transport studies of mono-, bi- and tri- layer graphene", "id": "15783", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8013", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation focuses on the transport studies of mono-, bi- and tri- layer graphene. Although these two-dimensional forms of carbon differ by only one atomic layer, their transport properties are dramatically different. Monolayer graphene is a gapless material with a linear band dispersion. Bilayer graphene has four hyperbolic bands and a band gap tunable by a perpendicular electric filed. ABC stacked trilayer graphene shows a cubic band dispersion near the charge neutrality point and a tunable band gap, while ABA trilayer graphene is a semi-metal with monolayer-like and bilayer-like subbands. Studies in this dissertation reveal some of the unique transport properties of mono-, bi- and trilayer graphene. \n\nChapter 1 introduces the band structures of mono-, bi- and trilayer graphene. We show the hallmark of mono- and bilayer graphene in a perpendicular magnetic field, i.e., their unique quantum Hall effect. The main scattering mechanisms and the effect of electron-electron interaction are also introduced in this chapter.\n\nIn Chapter 2, we give a brief description of fabrication procedures for devices shown in this dissertation. The equipments and methods used for measurements are also introduced.\n\nThe effect of surface oxide (SO) phonon scattering in graphene transistors is studied in Chapter 3. The effect of the dielectric materials is critical for any gated devices. We demonstrate the atomic layer deposition of high-quality dielectric HfO_2 films on graphene, which results in one of the highest reported carrier mobility 20,000 cm^2/Vs among graphene field effect transistors (GFETs). We study the effect of SO phonon scattering in two dielectric materials, namely, SiO_2 and HfO_2, at both low and high source-drain (s-d) bias. At low s-d bias, the contribution to resistivity and the mobility limit set by SO phonons from SiO_2 and HfO_2 are experimentally determined. When both HfO_2 and SiO_2 gate oxides are used in the same GFET, SO phonon scattering from HfO_2 dominates at high temperature and sets the mobility limit to ~20,000 cm^2/Vs at room temperature. At high s-d bias V_sd, the current I_sd in a graphene channel tends towards saturation in both single- and dual-gated GFETs. We have examined GFETs using a SiO_2 single-gated or SiO_2/HfO_2 dual-gated structure. Comparing theory and experiment, we show that the inclusion of SO phonon scattering is crucial to explain the experimental I_sd(V_sd) and account for the heat dissipation in graphene transistors. These studies illuminate the critical role played by gate oxide in graphene transistors.\n\nIn Chapter 4, we demonstrate the control of the tunable band gap in bilayer graphene and study the conduction mechanisms when the Fermi level lies in the band gap. The presence of a band gap is crucial to many modern electronics and photonics applications. In bilayer graphene, the band gap is tunable by an electric field perpendicular to the sheet. We fabricate high quality SiO_2/HfO_2 dual-gated GFETs to control the band gap \\Delta in bilayer graphene. The resistance at the charge neutrality point R_CNP increases with increasing perpendicular electric field, which demonstrates the opening of the band gap. To study the conduction mechanism in the band gap, the temperature T-dependence of R_CNP(T) is measured. R_CNP(T) exhibits two thermally activated processes and exp[(T)^{-1/3}] temperature dependence in different temperature regimes. Based on the existence of the potential energy fluctuations in GFETs, we develop a simple model which uses localized states related conduction mechanisms to explain the data. The high-temperature conduction is attributed to thermal activation to the mobility edge with an activation energy approaching \\Delta/2 at large band gap. At intermediate and low temperatures, the dominant conduction mechanisms are nearest-neighbor hopping and variable-range hopping through localized states. Our study clarifies conduction mechanisms in gapped bilayer GFETs, which is critical for its actual applications.\n\nThe band asymmetry between electrons and holes and the effect of electron-eletron interaction in bilayer graphene are studied in Chapter 5. We accurately determine the effective mass m* by the temperature dependence of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. Within common experimental density range, both the hole mass m*_h and the electron mass m*_e increase with increasing carrier density, which proves the bands of bilayer graphene are not parabolic but hyperbolic. The hole mass m*_h is approximately 20-30% larger than the electron mass m*_e. The tight-binding parameter controlling the electron-hole band asymmetry v_4 = 0.063, is extracted accurately from the difference of m*_h and m*_e. Both m*_h and m*_e are significantly suppressed compared to single-particle values, providing clear evidence for the strong renormalization from electron-electron interaction.\n\nIn Chapter 6, we study transport properties of both ABA and ABC stacked trilayer graphene with band structure tuning by a HfO_2/HfO_2 dual-gated structure. The high efficiency and large breakdown voltage of the HfO_2 gates enable independent tuning of the perpendicular electric field and the Fermi level over an unprecedentedly large range. We observe that resistance at the charge neutrality point increases by six orders of magnitude in the ABC trilayer, which demonstrates the opening of a band gap. The gap size appears to saturate at a large displacement field of D ~ 3 V/nm, in agreement with density functional theory calculations. In contrast, the ABA trilayer remains gapless but the band structure of the ABA trilayer continues to evolve with increasing D. We observe signatures of two-band conduction at large D fields. Our self-consistent Hartree calculation reproduces many aspects of the experimental data, but also points to the need for more sophisticated theory for the exact screening in ABA trilayer graphene.\n\nIn Chapter 7, we give a summary of the studies discussed in this dissertation and provide some future research interests in mono-, bi- and tri- layer graphene.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7959], "author_name_tesi": "Zou, Ke ", "last_name_ssi": "Zou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ke", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Zhu", "Jun Zhu", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Nitin Samarth", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Zhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Jun Zhu, Committee Chair", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["graphene", "bilayer graphene", "trilayer graphene", "transport", "dielectrics", "band structure"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "design methodologies of three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs)", "id": "24781", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10984", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The continuous technology scaling results in the growing delay gap\nbetween transistors and  interconnects because of the significant increase inparasitics.

Different from previous system-in-package (SiP) designs that stack multiple chips and use wires or bumps for connections, the emerging 3D integration provides finer granularity integration thanks to the vertical interconnects inside chips. In general, 3D ICs provide numerous advantages over traditional 2D IC designs, such as smaller footprint, high bandwidth and short latency interconnects, and the capability of heterogeneous stacking.\n\nNevertheless, there are several challenges in 3D ICs that need to be solved before this technology is applied in commercial designs with high volume production, such as higher fabrication cost, compromised system reliability, the lack of\nmature electrical design automation tools, the elevated chip operation temperature, and\nthe insufficient understanding on chip testings.

As the cost is the primary driving force\nfor the new technology adoption, reducing the system cost\nbecomes the one of the primary concerns in 3D designs. On the other hand,\nthe success of this emerging technology\nshould be guaranteed by its functionality correctness. However, a few factors influence the\n3D reliability: fabrication limitations, thermal mechanical stresses, interconnect electrical\nfailures, degraded signal integrity, and IR droop in power networks.\nAs a result, these factors should be considered and properly addressed in 3D designs to ensure the chip reliability.\n\nThis dissertation proposes novel design methodologies to optimize\n3D designs emphasizing the challenges of cost and reliability. In the first part, a cost model\nis adapted and applied in our analysis framework to evaluate the 3D system cost.\nThen cost-aware design methods are proposed to reduce the cost from fabrication level to\nchip design level. The second part of this dissertation handles the chip reliability\nproblems. Three studies are introduced from diverse aspects\nto manage the interconnect electromigration, thermal mechanical stresses, and the signal integrity issues.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10564], "author_name_tesi": "Zou, Qiaosha ", "last_name_ssi": "Zou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qiaosha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yuan Xie, Mary Jane Irwin", "Yuan Xie", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Donghai Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yuan Xie, Mary Jane Irwin, Dissertation Advisor", "Yuan Xie, Committee Chair", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Chair", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Integrated circuits", "design methodologies", "three-dimensional circuits", "cost-aware designs", "reliability-aware designs"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "DESIGN OF AN AUTOMATIC SYSTEM BASED ON FLEXIBLE MICRO SPRING ARRAYS FOR VIABLE CANCER CELL ENRICHMENT", "id": "13897xzz5251", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "13897", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Curing cancer has remained to be quite challenging although significant progresses have been made over the past decades.

Proposed space-based observatories such as NASA\u00a1\u00a6s Terrestrial Planet Finder \u00a1V Coronograph (TPF-C) may make it possible in the near future to detect the presence of oceans on nearby extrasolar planets (exoplanets) by studying the polarization of visible, infrared, or ultraviolet radiation reflected from the planet.  In this dissertation, we model and analyze light scattering properties of various notional exoplanets, including brightness and polarization state versus wavelength and position in the orbit (orbital  longitude, OL) in order to predict the potential observability of distant oceans. Our initial working hypotheses are:\n\n1. With simulations we can anticipate terrestrial planet signatures in light scattered from distant star systems; \n2. Future instruments will gather sufficient information on terrestrial exoplanets to draw useful conclusions about the planet surfaces and atmospheres;\n3. TPF-C will have a baseline wavelength range of 500 \u00a1V 1000 nm, and will have some capability to observe in spectral sub-bands;\n4. Polarized and unpolarized orbital light curves, possibly combined with broad-band spectral information, will provide enough information to discriminate between terrestrial-class planets with and without large oceans;\n5. Observation of polarized light curves of exoplanet systems may provide other useful information about the systems beyond that from unpolarized brightness curves.\n\nWe find that total flux light curves from Lambertian and Rayleigh scattering dominated planets peak at full phase, OL = 180\u201ea, whereas ocean planets with thin atmospheres exhibit peak flux in the crescent phase near OL = 30\u201ea.  The polarized results for ocean planets show that clouds, wind-driven waves, aerosols, absorption, and Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere and within the water column, dilute the polarization fraction and shift it away from the OL = 74\u201ea predicted by Fresnel theory. On planets for which Rayleigh scattering dominates, the polarization peaks near an orbital longitude of 90\u201ea, but clouds and Lambertian surfaces dilute and shift this peak to smaller OL, and a shifted Rayleigh peak might be mistaken for a water signature unless data from multiple wavelength bands are available.  \n\nWhen observing over the baselined TPF-C wavelength range (500\u00a1V1000 nm), Rayleigh scattering alone from an atmosphere as thick as Earth\u00a1\u00a6s is enough to shift the polarization peak to an orbital longitude of 83o, closer to the Rayleigh peak at 90o than to the Fresnel peak at 74o. Ocean radiance in this wavelength band caused by scattering within the water column also dilutes the polarization peak, limiting the polarization fraction to a maximum of slightly over 0.9. Water aerosols shift the peak to even higher OLs and add a rainbow peak near OL = 140\u00a2X. Clouds also have a strong effect in masking the ocean surface polarization, and water clouds can exhibit the rainbow peak as with water aerosols. The high albedo and multiple scattering of Earth water clouds tends to dilute any liquid polarization signature, and other clouds such as Earth\u00a1\u00a6s ice clouds and the sulfuric acid clouds of Venus can produce many different types of signatures depending on composition and particle size and shape. Wind over an ocean surface causes waves and sea foam, both of which tend to dilute the water polarization signal. The magnitude and polarization of exozodiacal light (exo-zodi) is another large unknown, because we have only limited measurements of zodiacal light in our own Solar System, and instrumentation is not yet sensitive enough to measure exo-zodi in mature exoplanet systems. Exo-zodi is expected to be polarized, so will likely contribute an additional competing \u00a1\u00a7noise\u00a1\u00a8 polarization peak.\n\nIn addition to end-member planets dominated by Lambertian or Rayleigh scattering, we simulate variations of \u00a1\u00a7water Earths\u00a1\u00a8; these are planets similar to Earth but completely covered by oceans, disturbed only by light winds. For these models, we also include US 1962 Standard Atmosphere absorption, and maritime aerosols using the standard 5 km low visibility and 23 km high visibility aerosols, and some other much higher visibilities for comparison. The polarization fraction for cases with Earth-like aerosols peaks at only about 0.15 at OL = 100\u201ea for the 5 km case, and at less than 0.35 at OL = 95\u201ea for the 23 km case. With more and more transparent aerosols, the polarization peak for water Earth cases approaches that of a Rayleigh-only atmosphere over an ocean surface.  \n\nOur model supports the idea that Rayleigh effects are mitigated by observing at longer wavelengths, taking advantage of the dependence of Rayleigh scattering on the inverse fourth power of wavelength. For example, our simulations show that the polarization fraction for an ocean surface hidden by a Rayleigh-only atmosphere can be increased by using only the longer wavelength portion of the TPF waveband, from 900-1000 nm. However, this would result in a loss of much of the available signal, and it would do nothing to reduce the dilution of the polarization signal by other factors. In particular, the aerosols included in our higher fidelity water Earth model dominate scattering for visibility of 23 km, which represents a clear day on Earth. Still, if multiple wavebands are available on TPF-C, as baselined, then comparing the results of different wavebands from an exoplanet observation, with the above in mind, may be useful. \n\nThe net effect of clouds, aerosols, absorption, atmospheric and oceanic Rayleigh scattering, waves, and exo-zodi may severely limit the percentage of ocean planets that would display a significant polarization signature, and may also generate a significant number of false positives on dry planets. Attempting to use the orbital position and strength of the polarization peak to determine whether or not an exoplanet surface is water-covered or dry is risky because so many factors can reduce the strength of the polarization peak, or shift it to higher or lower orbital longitudes. The result is an inversion problem which, for many planets, may be ill-posed. All of this suggests that polarization measurements by a TPF-C type telescope may not provide a positive detection of surface liquid water on exoplanets. On the other hand, the strength and placement of the polarization peak in the orbit relative to the cases we model, combined with the magnitude of the total flux and shape of the orbital flux curve, may give strong evidence of exoplanet surface and atmospheric composition for some nearby Earth-like planets, if they exist.  \n\nWe have also suggested that polarization could be used to help determine whether an object which appears to be near a star is in fact a planet in orbit around the star, or a background object. If the object exhibits polarization perpendicular to the line between object and the star, then the object probably is a planet and the polarization is likely due to Rayleigh scattering in the planet\u00a1\u00a6s atmosphere, reflection from a liquid surface, or a combination of the two effects. This method has the advantage that it can be used to show probable association with a single observation. For some exoplanet observations, this technique could be implemented immediately by ground-based observatories.\n\nThis work is novel in including a more complete atmosphere in simulations of exoplanet light scattering than previous models. The resulting simulations of Earth-like and diffuse scattering planets highlight the potential difficulties in detecting exoplanet oceans, which are not as apparent when using simpler models. The work also includes new ideas on using polarization to help determine planetary association, as well as a novel graphical method of showing different planetary polarization types.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4091], "author_name_tesi": "Zugger, Michael E.", "last_name_ssi": "Zugger", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Russell Philbrick", "C Russell Philbrick", "Timothy Joseph Kane", "James Kasting", "Charles Lee Croskey", "Karl Martin Reichard", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Russell Philbrick, Dissertation Advisor", "C Russell Philbrick, Committee Chair", "Timothy Joseph Kane, Committee Chair", "James Kasting, Committee Member", "Charles Lee Croskey, Committee Member", "Karl Martin Reichard, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["extrasolar planets", "atmospheric light scattering", "polarized light", "oceans on other planets"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Development and Intial Assessment of an Instrument for Human Capital Planning\n", "id": "7364", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3452", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The shift in The United States economy from a manufacturing powerhouse to a service driven economy has placed a great emphasis on planning within organizations in order to remain competitive in a new global economy.

It provides a promising method for producing sustainable bio-energy as well as simultaneously degrading organic waste and wastewater. Corn stover is currently the largest residual biomass source in the US, and it therefore has a great potential as a sustainable and renewable energy source. Two corn stover hydrolysates (acid and neutral) were demonstrated here to produce electricity in\nsingle-chambered air-cathode MFCs, with a maximum power density of 371 mW/m2 for neutral hydrolysate and 367 mW/m2 for acidic hydrolysate. All sugar (monomeric or oligomeric) components were utilized, resulting in ~93% BOD removal efficiency and 20 to 30% of Coulombic efficiency (CE). After applying a diffusion layer onto the cathode surface and increasing the medium conductivity from 10 to 20 mS/cm, the power density could be further improved to 933 mW/m2 (neutral ydrolysate) or 971 mW/m2 (acidic hydrolysate).\nMicroorganisms capable of transferring electrons outside the cell to insoluble electron acceptors, such as metal oxides and the anodes of MFCs, are called exoelectrogens. Very few exoelectrogens have been directly isolated from MFCs, and most exoelectrogens known to produce power in an MFC are dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria (DMRB, e.g. Shewanella and Geobacter) initially isolated using agar plates containing metals. However, isolation methods based on dissimilatory metal\nreduction potentially limit the diversity of possible exoelectrogenic bacteria. A special U tube-shaped MFC was therefore developed to enrich exoelectrogenic bacteria based on electricity production, with isolation based on dilution-to-extinction methods. A pure culture was obtained and identified as Ochrobactrum anthropi YZ-1 that was unable to respire using hydrous Fe(III) oxide but produced 89 mW/m2 using acetate as the electron donor in the U-tube MFC, demonstrating a greater diversity of exoelectrogenic bacteria than simply DMRBs. Strain YZ-1 used a much wider range of substrates as carbon sources for current production than many DMRBs, including acetate, lactate, propionate,\nbutyrate, glucose, sucrose, cellobiose, glycerol, and ethanol.\nTo use MFC-based technologies for real applications in waste and wastewater\ntreatment processes, one of the greatest challenges is creating a scalable architecture that provides large surface areas for oxygen reduction at the cathode and bacterial growth on\nthe anode. A scalable cathode was therefore constructed by coating a tubular ultrafiltration membrane with conductive graphite paint and a non-precious metal catalyst (CoTMPP). Using a graphite brush anode with high surface area (Aan,s=7700 m2/m3) and two tube cathodes placed inside the reactor (Acat,s= 93 m2/m3), the MFC produced 18 W/m3 with a CE = 70 - 74%. Further increases in the surface area of the tube cathodes to 54 cm2 (120 m2/m3) increased the total power output (from 0.51 to 0.83 mW), but the increase in volume resulted in a constant volumetric power density (~18 W/m3).\nMore cost-effective materials including anion (AEM) and cation (CEM) exchange membranes were also evaluated as the scalable cathode material and compared to the ultrafiltration (UF) cathode. These membranes were made electrically conductive using graphite paint and a non-precious metal catalyst (CoTMPP) was used. The best performance in single-chamber MFCs using graphite fiber brush anodes was achieved using an AEM cathode with the conductive coating facing the solution, at a catalyst loading of 0.5 mg/cm2 CoTMPP.

Beyond entertainment, games are increasingly the target of serious research, from learning to \u201cserious play\u201d, training, therapy, and communication. Alongside the expansion of game applications has come the expansion of game media. Games are now incredibly complex and expressive multimedia platforms that rival the highest fidelity tools of film or television. Independent of their applications, most games are visual works and any researcher or entertainer interested in games must first purposefully control and manipulate the visual substance of a game to achieve a goal. Therefore, this dissertation presents a focus on one factor that is inseparable from the visual experience of a game: lighting.\n<p>\nOur real world visual experience is shaped by light. The very structure of modern life is possible because we have transcended the constraints of natural day and night cycles and can effectively operate 24 hours a day. Games too are now shaped by light. Modern computer visualization, the process of generating an image of a virtual thing, now offers a physically realistic illumination model. Virtual illumination can produce nearly photorealistic images (literally, images that look like a photograph).\n<p>\nHowever, successful lighting in video games requires more than a physically realistic illumination model. Aesthetics and function are of equal or greater importance. Lighting can control visual focus, directing a player\u2019s gaze to important objects. It can also control mood and perceived emotion, communicating a narrative and engaging a player in a game world. The role of a lighting designer in games is therefore crucial.\n<p>\nLighting designers control and purposefully manipulate light. A lighting designer in film will carefully control lighting, scene by scene and even frame by frame, to precisely convey emotion, control visual perception, and communicate intent. Game lighting designers face a challenge however, in that omniscient knowledge of a game\u2019s state at any time is not available to them in advance. A player can make many decisions that change the game world. For example, a film lighting designer might carefully arrange lighting to strike a specific visual cue when the lead actor crosses the threshold of a front door. However, a game lighting designer might also need to predict and accommodate a player coming in through a bedroom window, a player destroying the front door, a player never coming to the house at all, or a player coming to the house at a point in the story where the visual cue is no longer appropriate.\n<p>\nUnder an assumption that game lighting designers require tools to design light that assist with the challenge of adapting to player interaction at runtime, this dissertation presents the design, development, and final product of research into a lighting design tool, the System for Automated Interactive Lighting (SAIL). The goal of this research was to develop an adaptive system that maintains lighting design goals (aesthetic and functional) in the context of unpredictable, interactive experiences. \n<p>\nThis dissertation makes several contributions. As an artifact, SAIL offers functionality not available in existing automated lighting systems. As a design tool, SAIL may be useful as a pre-visualization or storyboarding tool. As an experimental instrument, SAIL offers the possibility of simplifying existing experiments into automated lighting and facilitating new types of experiments. SAIL\u2019s contributions are discussed in depth in Chapter 8. These contributions are supported by a qualitative study discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. These chapters also present several other interesting observations that may be useful in general to the field of automated lighting.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2543], "author_name_tesi": "Zupko, Joseph Aaron", "last_name_ssi": "Zupko", "middle_name_ssi": "Aaron", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian Smith", "Brian K Smith", "Magy Seif El Nasr", "David J Hall", "Mary Beth Rosson", "Matthew C Kenyon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian Smith, Dissertation Advisor", "Brian K Smith, Committee Chair", "Magy Seif El Nasr, Committee Chair", "David J Hall, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Rosson, Committee Member", "Matthew C Kenyon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Experimental Instruments", "Video Games", "Interaction", "Lighting", "Design Tools"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Transmission Electron Microscopy Investigation Of Defects And Domains In Epitaxial Films Of Aurivillius And Ruddlesden-Popper Phases\n", "id": "6033", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4002", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-03-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "      Three types of domains in epitaxial films of layered perovskites have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM).

Two domain types, growth twin domains and out-of-phase domains, exist in epitaxial films of layered complex oxides, and the ferroelectric phases also have ferroelectric domains.  <BR>\n      The morphology, nucleation mechanisms, and effects on properties of two types of domains, growth twin domains and out-of-phase domains, were determined.  Growth twin domains occur in complex oxide films grown on substrates for which multiple, equivalent epitaxial orientations exist, and are the result of local continuation of the perovskite sublattice of the substrate, resulting in one, two, and three possible growth twin variants on (001), (110), and (111) perovskite substrates.  Out-of-phase domains are common in complex oxides due to their highly anisotropic crystal structure.  Out-of-phase domain boundaries (OPBs) are shown to impact material properties, and to have a range of possible offsets as a result of multiple nucleation mechanisms, three during growth and one post-growth, in layered complex oxides.  Steps on substrates or at internal surfaces can cause misregistry along the long unit cell direction between neighboring regions of an epitaxial film, resulting in the generation of an OPB.  In phases with multiple structurally-equivalent occurrences of the preferred nucleation layer, OPBs are generated at the film substrate interface by the preferred nucleation-growth order mechanism.  Substrate surface features of only one or two atomic layers can result in the generation of OPB defects that propagate through an entire film of over 0.5 \u00b5m in thickness.  In epitaxial films with the long unit cell axis inclined to the substrate surface, mismatch of the coincident-site lattice generates OPBs.  Post-growth, loss of a volatile component through evaporation at elevated temperature leads to the generation of OPBs by crystallographic shear.<BR>\n      The ferroelectric domain structure of SrBi<sub>2</sub>Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, a unique zero-strain oxide ferroelectric, has also been determined.

Thus, it serves as an end point in the spectrum of oxide ferroelectric materials.

However, the recalcitrant nature of the biomaterial has perplexed scientists for decades; lignocellulosic fuels still cost two to five times more to produce than their petroleum-derived counterparts. A novel class of bioprocess designs are necessary to overcome the costs associated with conversion of this obstinate feedstock. An intensified processing scheme, termed consolidated bioprocessing, was touted as an economically feasible bioprocessing strategy where consolidation of processing steps was thought to enhance both process and economic efficiencies. Yet no single organism has been discovered or engineered that is capable of efficient consolidated bioprocessing. On the other hand, nature executes what may be the ultimate consolidated bioprocess through conversion of plant material to carbon dioxide and methane as part of the global carbon cycle. The concerted action of numerous naturally-occurring microorganisms overcomes many of the issues encountered in industrial, single-organism lignocellulose bioprocessing. In this dissertation, based on a nature-inspired design, a two-member microbial consortium was developed for the conversion of cellulose to fuel. Cooperation is induced between the cellulolytic, anaerobic bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae via oxygen diffusion, controlling consortium populations and promoting fuel production. S. cerevisiae consumes oxygen to protect C. phytofermentans which in return degrades cellulose providing soluble carbon for the yeast. This symbiotic design improves ethanol and/or hydrocarbon production from purified cellulose over two-fold. Detailed analyses of C. phytofermentans biofilm formation and fermentation characteristics revealed that glucose and ethanol are robust inhibitors of C. phytofermentans surface attachment and growth, respectively. Ethanol tolerance was improved via strain evolution and metabolic engineering was applied to overcome an adaptive reduction in ethanol yield. Finally, a comprehensive mathematical framework was developed to model the consortium and provide insight into the intricate cooperation toward improving system productivity. In summary, inspired by naturally occurring microbial ecosystems, this dissertation describes the application of scientific and engineering principles to improve the viability of microbial consortia for industrial-scale conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fuel.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9789], "author_name_tesi": "Zuroff, Trevor Roman", "last_name_ssi": "Zuroff", "middle_name_ssi": "Roman", "first_name_ssi": "Trevor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis", "Howard M Salis", "Thomas Keith Wood", "Katriona Shea", "Manish Kumar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis, Dissertation Advisor", "Howard M Salis, Committee Member", "Thomas Keith Wood, Committee Member", "Katriona Shea, Committee Member", "Manish Kumar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lignocellulose", "biofuels", "Clostridium phytofermentans", "cellulose", "microbial consortia"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "MODIFIED QUINONE ACCEPTORS IN PHOTOSYSTEM I", "id": "6041", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "727", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The function of the A1 acceptor in cyanobacterial Photosystem I (PS I) complex was probed \u2013 using EPR and optical spectroscopies \u2013 by: i) interrupting phylloquinone biosynthesis; ii) replacing phylloquinone with foreign quinones; iii) introducing point mutations in amino acids within the A1 quinone binding site.\n\tMajor findings include that: i) interruption of the menA (phytyl transferase) or menB (naphthoate synthase) genes in the phylloquinone biosynthetic pathway results in a functional PS I complex in which plastoquinone-9 replaces phylloquinone in the A1 quinone binding site; ii) forward electron transfer from A1 to FX is endergonic in a PS I complex that contains plastoquinone\u00ad9; iii) plastoquinone\u00ad9 is loosely bound in menA and menB mutant PS I complexes, thus it is readily exchanged with both substituted and unsubstituted foreign quinones in vitro; iv) forward electron transfer in cyanobacterial PS I \u2013 as determined by studying the site\u00addirected mutants W697F (PsaA) and W677 (PsaB), S692C (PsaA) and S672 (PsaB), and R694A (PsaA) and R674A (PsaB) \u2013 proceeds predominately through the PsaA-branch of cofactors.\n\tBackward electron transfer from A1- to P700+ is biphasic, with lifetimes of ca. 10 \u00b5s and ca. 300 \u00b5s, in a PS I complex that contains plastoquinone-9.

This thesis deals with two extensions of this setting: either replacing the modular group PSL(2,Z) with a cocompact torsion-free Fuchsian group, or working with three-dimensional hyperbolic space and relating the boundary maps to continued fractions of complex numbers.\n\nThe Fuchsian results are joint with Svetlana Katok and build on results of Katok and Ugarcovici, who studied a family of maps generalizing the Bowen-Series boundary map. When the parameters satisfy the short cycle property, i.e., the forward orbits at each discontinuity point coincide after one step, the natural extension map has a global attractor with finite rectangular structure. In this thesis, we generalize several results of Adler and Flatto, describing a conjugacy between the geometric and arithmetic maps and showing that the attractor parameterizes an associated arithmetic cross-section. This allows us to represent the geodesic flow as a special flow over a symbolic system. In cases where the cycle ends are discontinuity points, the resulting symbolic system is sofic.\n\nIn the final chapter, we consider three-dimensional real hyperbolic space, in which the boundary is the Reimann sphere (C with a point at infinity) and the boundary maps use generators of Kleinian groups. Here the endpoints of geodesics can be described by complex continued fractions, which have been studied from the number theoretic perspective by Doug Hensley, S. G. Dani, and Arnaldo Nogueira, among others. In this thesis, a new \"partition property\" is described, substituting for the cycle property seen in the modular and Fuchsian literature. We state some results that apply to a wide range of boundary maps satisfying this partition property, and we discuss several specific algorithms in more detail.

Each text is framed as a narrative by a woman who writes her story. These narrative techniques are used both to present stories that concern and prompt reflection on the Hispanic Caribbean and its Diasporas \u2014Dominican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican, respectively\u2014and also to help us understand the unique position of the female subject in each text and each context.\nThe first chapter begins with a discussion of the terms female character, female subjectivity and agency and their application to this study. Female character in this study does not denote personality trait, but rather the fictional representation of the female figures that populate the texts under examination. Further, I view subjectivity as constituted through discourse, and therefore I examine whether the female characters have the power to control discursive vehicles. In the same vein, agency is dependent upon the ability of the characters to act in spite of restrictions, to seize authorship and to counter the traditions to which they are expected to submit on a daily basis. This work is nourished by theories and research on subjectivity, feminism, and post-colonialism presented by Paul Smith, Debra Castillo, Adrienne Rich, Teresa de Lauretis, and Hommi Bhabha, among others. Their stance on subjectivity, agency, feminism and post-colonialism help inform this study\u2019s examination of an array of issues, particularly those involving gender, race and ethnicity.\n Ultimately, this study traces a trajectory as the female characters claim agency through their own writing. This trajectory begins with a discussion of Vega\u2019s text, where the protagonist uses the diary as a platform to voice, sway and resist her condition in a patriarchal society. I argue that in this work Vega awards the protagonist the narrative of the diary in order to give her a subject position from which to rewrite nineteenth century Puerto Rican history. Next, I continue with Garc\u00eda\u2019s text, where an array of female characters located in Cuba and in the United States attempt to seek agency, but only a few enjoy the ability for self-narration and self-reflection. I argue that Garc\u00eda\u2019s agenda is to award agency of first-person narration specifically to the younger generation of Cubans and Cuban-Americans, so that they can resist established beliefs handed down by previous generations. Lastly, this comparative study culminates with \u00c1lvarez\u2019s text, where all female characters narrate in first-person recounting their stories. In \u00c1lvarez\u2019s text, I perceive an urgency to seek agency, beginning with the novel\u2019s title !Yo!,  and continuing throughout the text in which all the female characters yearn for  and take control of their first-person narration to negotiate agency and authority. Lastly, the conclusion examines differences and similarities within various communities of female figures discussed in the thesis and underscores the ways their recounting brings to light their marginal voices as they search for ways to cope with challenges and deal with their lives.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6473], "author_name_tesi": "Zylo Watkins, Valbona ", "last_name_ssi": "Zylo Watkins", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Valbona", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Laurence E Prescott", "Laurence E Prescott", "Javier Escudero", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt", "John Andres Ochoa", "Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Rosalia Cornejo Parriego"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Laurence E Prescott, Dissertation Advisor", "Laurence E Prescott, Committee Chair", "Javier Escudero, Committee Member", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt, Committee Member", "John Andres Ochoa, Committee Member", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member", "Rosalia Cornejo Parriego, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["female subjectivity", "Spanish Caribbean Literature", "Female agency", "agency and narrative"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "EVALUATION OF COMMISSIONING METHODS ON BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEM OF DEDICATED OUTDOOR AIR SYSTEM", "id": "4b29b596v", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12986", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Building Automation Systems (BAS) are widely used in large commercial buildings to assist in the management of the building HVAC system.

One reason for lack of energy conservation for BAS\tis that the settings in building automation system are not optimized according to the operation building system condition and load requirements. To address this issue, studies focused on commissioning for BAS, which can be called building re-tuning, have been developed by PNNL to provide optimized solutions for building operators. However, the building re-tuning solutions having been promoted are mainly for the Variable Air Volume system, problems may persist when the BAS for a different type of system needs to be commissioned, for example a Dedicated Outdoor Air System (DOAS).

Inspired by the biological motors at the micron and nanoscale, scientists have developed artificial machines that self propel in solutions and are on the same length scale as biological motors. However, motion at such low length scales is fraught with many challenges. The focus of this thesis is on devising some field free and autonomous strategies for addressing those challenges.\nThis dissertation starts with a literature review of the field with a discussion about the various self-propelled prevalent in the scientific community. Then the different challenges of motion at low Reynolds number and their applicability to the motors are discussed.\nOne of the more popular categories of catalytic micromotors is Janus motors which move in a solution of hydrogen peroxide due to the catalytic activity of Platinum. However it is very hard to introduce directionality in these motors due to the Brownian randomizations prevalent in low Reynolds number regime. The first chapter of this thesis introduces a method of overcoming this challenge by exploiting the interaction of Janus micromotors with physical features. It was observed that Janus micromotors could move linearly in geometric \"tracks\" as long as they have fuel available for their motion, thus overcoming Brownian diffusion rotations. \nThe second system discussed here takes its inspiration from biological motors and is based on cilia and flagella seen in microorganisms. A design for synthesizing artificial cilia is outlined. This system consists of polymeric rods with a catalytic disk on top which undergo oscillations due to reversible chemical reactions. These synthetic ciliary systems represent an efficient way of mixing fluid at the microscale and overcome the challenges associated with laminar flow at such regimes.\nThe discussion then moves to the nanoscale with the introduction of enzyme nanomotors in Chapter 4. Enzyme molecules not only show enhanced diffusion in the presence of their substrate such as urea for Urease or hydrogen peroxide for catalase; but they also show chemotactic behavior towards their substrate gradient. This is directly parallel to the chemotactic behavior shown by bacteria. This property is exploited to design a system of separating two enzymes with the same mass and isoelectric point. The separation is observed within a two-inlet, five-outlet microfluidic network, designed to allow mixtures of active (ones that catalyze substrate turnover) and inactive (ones that do not catalyze substrate turnover) enzymes, labeled with different fluorophores, to flow through one of the inlets. Substrate solution prepared in phosphate buffer was introduced through the other inlet of the device at the same flow rate. In the presence of a substrate concentration gradient, active enzyme molecules migrated preferentially toward the substrate channel leading to separation of the enzymes.\nAs discussed above enzyme molecules undergo enhanced diffusion in the presence of their substrate. Additionally immobilizing these enzymes on a surface leads to a pump which can pump fluid in all directions in the presence of the respective substrate of the enzyme. This concept has been utilized in Chapter 4 to make a directional microscale pump which can move fluid from one specific point to another. An asymmetrical pattern of enzyme pumps was developed and a substrate gradient was introduced.  Due to the asymmetry of the pattern, the fluid being pumped had a particular direction to it which was determined by the direction of gradient. This kind of architecture overcomes the problem of directionality seen in microscale pumps. \nFinally, the principle above was adapted for use in nano-biosensors. The above enzyme based pump can be used to drive fluid from point A to point B, thus it can also drive analytes in the system from point A to point B. Therefore the analytes could be concentrated at a particular point increasing the signal at that point.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12551], "author_name_tesi": "das, sambeeta ", "last_name_ssi": "das", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "sambeeta", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen", "Ayusman Sen", "Thomas E Mallouk", "John V Badding", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen, Dissertation Advisor", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Micromotor", "nanomotor", "Active Matter", "colloid", "Enzymes"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Fragmentary Images, Fragmentary Selves: Reframing the Photographic Portrait as a Fr\u00fchromantik Fragment", "id": "13215ard213", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13215", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates claims \u2013 made by scholars such as Elizabeth Eastlake, Walter Benjamin, and Roland Barthes \u2013 that photographic portraits are somehow superior to their painted or drawn counterparts. The analysis of works by these scholars will lead to the suggestion that this superiority lies in the photographic portrait\u2019s ability to communicate ipseity, and the remainder of the dissertation will consist of an enquiry as to the nature and legitimacy of that ability. With the help of Jacques Derrida\u2019s Demeure, Ath\u00e8nes, I will argue that this ability to communicate ipseity can be best explained if the portrait is understood as a romantic fragment, in the sense proposed by Friedrich Schlegel and Novalis: a work of art whose wit suggests multiple interpretations and whose irony prevents the audience from declaring any one interpretation as superior and final. This solution depends on an understanding of ipseity as inherently and irreducibly heterogeneous, and it will be shown that this is precisely how Barthes and Schlegel understood it. \nHowever, by arguing that ipseity can be best communicated through a fragmentary work, we will have simply shown that any fragmentary portrait (photographic or otherwise) is capable of communicating ipseity.  If the claims of Barthes, Benjamin, and Eastlake are to have any merit, then there must be a property peculiar to photographic portraits which facilitates that communication. The last chapter of this dissertation will argue that photographic portraits can indeed effect such a communication more easily as long as the viewers accept a particular version of photographic realism: the realism of transparency. \nWith the help of Kendall Walton\u2019s counterfactual defense of photographic realism, as well as Barbara Savedoff\u2019s investigations of the effect of the belief in such realism in the interpretation of photographic works of art, I will argue that the superiority of fragmentary photographic portraits lies in their ability to demand that viewers identify what (or who) was photographed regardless of how witty or ambiguous the image is. We will conclude with an investigation of the effects of digital manipulation on the widespread belief in photographic realism, and its consequences for the power of photographic portraits.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13114], "author_name_tesi": "de Avillez, Andre Rosenbaum", "last_name_ssi": "de Avillez", "middle_name_ssi": "Rosenbaum", "first_name_ssi": "Andre", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonard Richard Lawlor", "Leonard Richard Lawlor", "Amy Rebekah Allen", "John Philip Christman", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Dennis Schmidt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonard Richard Lawlor, Dissertation Advisor", "Leonard Richard Lawlor, Committee Chair", "Amy Rebekah Allen, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Outside Member", "Dennis Schmidt, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Photography", "Ipseity", "Fragment", "Realism", "Transparency", "Roland Barthes", "Walter Benjamin", "Elizabeth Eastlake", "Barbara Savedoff", "Kendall Walton", "Jacques Derrida", "Schlegel", "German Romanticism", "Portrait"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "NEWCOMER SOCIALIZATION AND ONBOARDING AT AN AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING COMPANY: EXAMINATION OF FEEDBACK SEEKING BEHAVIORS OF NEW HIRES", "id": "13919scj5091", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13919", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It\u2019s important for businesses to understand why employees seek feedback and the effects that feedback has on newcomer\u2019s adjustment during the onboarding phase.

Existing research focuses on feedback seeking correlation with goal orientation, but there is limited published research that provides findings beyond the feedback seeking relationship. This study analyzes if the relationship between goal orientations and feedback seeking leads to the socialization outcomes of organizational adjustment, work engagement and role self-efficacy. The moderating effect of perceived supervisor support on employee\u2019s feedback seeking behaviors are also explored. A survey distributed to 390 members of a rotational leadership program within a global American industrial manufacturing company asked new hires of their experience with the independent and dependent variables. The data analysis of 133 participants providing complete responses revealed significant findings between goal orientation (learning goal orientation and avoid failure orientation) and the purpose of feedback seeking, moderated by the presence of supervisor support. Feedback seeking was also found to lead to significant organizational outcomes.

In the first study, a multi-finger isometric force-moment task was used for studying the nature of force and moment unintentional drift, and the force-moment stabilizing synergies. In this experiment, subjects were utilizing visual feedback to maintain a certain amount of force and moment. At some point after subjects had stabilized their performance at the target, either force, or moment, or both feedbacks were turned off. The finger forces were studied under the uncontrolled-manifold and referent configuration hypothesis. This study showed that the absolute value of force and moment drops without visual feedback. However, drifts in individual finger forces could be in different directions; in particular, fingers that produced moments of force against the required total moment showed an increase in their forces. The force/moment drift was associated with a drop in the index of synergy stabilizing performance under visual feedback. The drifts in directions that changed performance (non-motor equivalent) and in directions that did not (motor equivalent), were of about the same magnitude. The results suggest that control with referent coordinates is associated with drifts of those referent coordinates toward the corresponding actual coordinates of the hand \u2013 a reflection of the natural tendency of physical systems to move toward the minimum of potential energy. The interaction between drifts of the hand referent coordinate and referent orientation led to counter-directional drifts in individual finger forces. The results also demonstrate that the sensory information used to create multi-finger synergies is necessary for their presence over the task duration.\nIn the second study, subjects performed a set of force-moment tasks with different levels of force and moment. These data were used to compute a cost function using the analytical inverse optimization method. Then, the subjects were asked to produce accurate force-moment tasks with a non-preferred sharing among the fingers. This was done by asking the subjects to reduce the middle finger force to half of its magnitude during the comfortable task performance. Adding this new constraint to an ongoing task resulted in a drop of variance within the uncontrolled manifold leading to a decline in the synergy index. Then, the visual feedback was removed for one, two, or all three of the main variables (force, moment, and middle finger force). The studies showed that the observed drift in performance variables was due to two processes, a drift of the referent coordinate toward the actual coordinate leading to a decrease in the finger forces, and a movement in the space of finger forces in a direction that did not affect the performance, but it reduced the cost of performing the task. Overall, these results fit naturally the scheme of hierarchical control using changes in referent coordinates for relevant variables.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12285], "author_name_tesi": "parsa, Behnoosh ", "last_name_ssi": "parsa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Behnoosh", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark L.
