This thesis consists of two major parts - classical and quantum. In the classical part we provide boundary conditions on the variables of the theory with a negative cosmological constant. We consider two boundaries, one at spatial infinity and one internal boundary. The internal\nboundary conditions are chosen to represent a horizon of a stationary black hole. One of the interesting results in this part are explicit quasi-local formulae for energy and angular momentum of a black hole as well as for the whole space-time.\n\n In the second part, we investigate the canonical quantization of 2+1 gravity. We begin with analysis of different classical formulations as points of departure for quantization. Next, we\naddress the issue of constructing the physical Hilbert space of states. For this purpose we construct certain important operators in quantum gravity, including a new regularization of the\nHamiltonian constraint.

The purpose of this thesis is to grow these superlattices by molecular beam epitaxy and independently verify these claims. We begin by developing a growth protocol to grow films on a thickness scale that would allow for the measurement of thermal transport through the film. A comprehensive characterization procedure for each sample was paramount to improving the quality of these films. By characterizing the samples with x-ray diffraction, x-ray reflectivity, and transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate the growth of superlattices with well-defined interfaces and superlattice period.\n\nAfter growth and characterization, we perform electrical and thermal transport measurements on the samples. We use the standard Hall bar geometry for electrical transport to determine resistivity, carrier concentration, and carrier mobility as a function of temperature.

We used minirhizotrons to observe root production and lifespan over four years.\nMinirhizotrons are used to nondestructively observe roots.  We tested the  important assumption that tube material does not influence root behavior using butyrate and acrylic tubes in plots of three hardwoods and three conifers.  Root survivorship near acrylic tubes was shorter for the conifers and longer for the hardwoods, indicating that multi-species lifespan data can be influenced by tube material.  Compared to butyrate, acrylic tube standing crop data were more similar to standing crop estimates from soil cores, suggesting acrylic tubes provide the more accurate data in our study systems.\nOur species had one peak of root production in summer, while the site experienced no summer drought.  Maximum peak production shifted similarly for all species from year to year indicating a strong influence of external factors.\nThough the eleven tree species exhibited a wide range in leaf and fine root lifespans, leaf lifespan was not correlated with fine root lifespan.  Root nitrogen:carbon ratio was inversely correlated with root lifespan.  Other root traits, such as diameter and specific root length, were not correlated with root lifespan.  Our studies show that tissue structure and patterns of longevity aboveground can contrast markedly with patterns belowground.

Previous studies show that galls are induced in young plant tissues and suggest that the morphological, hormonal and metabolic characteristics of galls are similar to fruits and seeds, including well-ordered tissues with high levels of cytokinins, proteins and carbohydates. Based on these observations, I tested the hypothesis that galling insects identify existing meristematic cells or dedifferentiated cells as sites for gall induction. In addition, I hypothesized that the insect can redirect the development of meristematic or minimally differentiated cells of normal plant tissue by ectopically inducing suites of developmental genes necessary for fruit or seed development. Using the phylloxera gall (Daktulospharia vitifoliae (Fitch)) on grapevine (Vitis riparia) I characterized gall induction and development using cytological and molecular techniques. I first examined the characterized the cellular structure of the gall throughout development using light and scanning electron microscopy to show that the insect\u2019s stylet is inserted in a radial pattern. I visualized cytokinin distribution, which is critical for meristematic activity and cell division. I show that zeatin, a cytokinin, accumulates in specific gall tissues during gall development. To show whether galling insects achieve gall development through ectopic induction of meristem, fruit and seed genes, I show that transcription of fruit and seed specific MADS-box genes occurs in galls but not the surrounding leaves. I also examine carbohydrate accumulation. By combining cytological observations with gene expression profiles, I developed a model for gall development that is based on atypical expression of normal fruit and seed developmental pathways.

Many of these devices produce regions of stagnant flow or low wall shear stress, making these areas especially prone to clotting.  To better understand the process of coagulation in artificial devices, the fluid mechanics that promote stagnant, recirculating flow are studied using a backward-facing step (BFS) model.  Using digital surface reconstructions of 15-minute thrombi from previous studies, model thrombi are constructed from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), coated with collagen to act as a procoagulant to promote thrombosis, and inserted into the recirculation region of the BFS model.  An in vitro flow loop is constructed and whole bovine blood is used to grow thrombi on the surface and downstream from the PDMS models.  Flow loop operation is at 0.76 L/min for run times of 15 and 45 minutes, which when added to the 15-minute model produce thrombi of 30 and 60 minute size, respectively.  Volume and surface data of formed thrombi are obtained using magnetic resonance imaging.  These thrombi are then removed from the model, paraffin embedded, and analyzed histologically through Carstairs\u2019 staining procedure.  Surface reconstructions from MRI data are used for steady, computational simulations to analyze flow over and wall shear stresses that develop on thrombi surfaces.  Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) are used to characterize the recirculation zone produced by the BFS model and are compared to simulations performed on an empty BFS model.  WSS analysis of PDMS models shows high regions of stress near the location of the step where little thrombus deposition occurs.  Deposition is observed to occur on the PDMS model where lower WSS values are present.  Small vortices are observed over the surface of these downstream PDMS regions, suggesting that recirculation is necessary for thrombosis even on procoagulant surfaces.  The average volume and exposed surface area of thrombi formed in the 30 minute experiments were 0.119 cm3 and 1.24 cm2, respectively, and for the 60 minute experiments were 0.189 cm3 and 1.46 cm2, respectively.  Volume and exposed surface area for 30 minute studies from previous work were 0.0765 cm3 and 1.18 cm2, respectively, and for 60 minute studies were 0.103 cm3 and 1.44 cm2 for volume and surface area, respectively.  The current results yield higher values of volume and exposed surface area than the previous thrombus studies, but showed more repeatability amongst experiments.  The increase in volume and surface area could be due to the presence of the collagen procoagulant on the PDMS surface which enhances platelet activation and thrombosis.

The GRIPV model verified a neutral or slightly positive influence to the power production with thermal integration between green roofs and PV arrays in an integrated environment. It has been observed that the slight efficiency gains occur during the peak heat of summer when electricity networks are most strained and most likely to fail, slightly alleviating this risk.

In this system the interior vesicle is filled with catechol that can be detected electrochemically as it is released in a fashion akin to cellular exocytosis. The experiments presented in the second chapter have led to the conclusion that the final stages of exocytosis can proceed on biological timescales without protein intervention and seem to suggest that if proteins are indeed involved in the final stages, they may be inhibitory.  In addition, the second chapter also contains a lipid nanotube based explanation for neurotransmitter release through the fusion pore.\nIn the course of doing the experiments described in the second chapter, it was noticed that not all of the catechol released from the interior vesicles was being detected amperometrically.  So, the third chapter deals with a quantitative explanation of why and how much catechol escapes the membrane-electrode gap undetected, depending on vesicle size and the size of the detection electrode.  The membrane-electrode interface in this model system is much like a cellular synapse, with the liposome as the neurotransmitter-releasing presynaptic cell and the amperometric electrode functioning as the postsynaptic cell by \u201ccapturing\u201d the released molecules.  This kind of treatment allowed inferences to be made about the nature of neurotransmitter escape from synapses in vivo as well as predictions to be made about coulometric efficiency of amperometric detection of exocytosis in vitro from a variety of cell types.\nAnother goal of the work with the artificial cell system was to determine how the kinetics of release can be altered and controlled by incorporation of new lipids to the liposome preparation or by changing the liposome\u2019s solution environment. In chapter 4 a method of accelerating release from the liposomal system is described.  Addition of short chain alcohols, for example, ethanol and propanol, accelerates the release process in a manner dependent on the alcohol type and concentration. Follow-up experiments to characterize this effect included compression isotherms of lipid monolayers, which showed a marked decrease in lipid packing density in alcoholic solutions. The increase in lipid disorder due to alcohol exposure is most likely the root cause of the accelerated membrane distention because previous work has shown that an increase in disorder is correlated with an increase in membrane flexibility. This would result in a membrane that would undergo distention on shorter timescales.\nChapters 5 and 6 of this thesis relate to exocytosis from living PC12 cells.  PC12 cells synthesize, store and release dopamine and are very useful as neuronal models. In these two chapters, PC12 cells are treated with drugs to manipulate the size of the secretory vesicles as well as incubated in high osmolarity solutions to lower the tension on the plasma membrane.  Experimental results obtained with these pharmacological manipulations have led to the development of a model of neurotransmitter release through the fusion pore that takes into account transpore membrane tensions.  This model assumes the fusion pore in some cases takes on a transient, nanotubular geometry and behaves like a lipid nanotube in liposome micropipette aspiration experiments.\nChapter 7 outlines future directions in modeling exocytosis. This chapter includes preliminary data as well as suggested experiments.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4636], "author_name_tesi": "Wittenberg, Nathan James", "last_name_ssi": "Wittenberg", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Nathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing", "Mary Beth Williams", "Nicholas Winograd", "Erwin A Vogler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing, Committee Chair", "Mary Beth Williams, Committee Member", "Nicholas Winograd, Committee Member", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["membrane biophysics", "liposomes", "PC12 cells", "amperometry", "exocytosis"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Theoretical and Experimental Studies of Aerosol Particle Drag Mixing in Turbulent Flow", "id": "15332", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7324", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An experimental and theoretical study of the mixing of aerosol particles with high-pressure gas under turbulent conditions to further the understanding of two-phase mixing is conducted.

This computational study focuses on gas-particle drag models, which are a critical part of accurately describing mixing phenomena in turbulent flow. The drag forces acting on the particles determine their entrainment relative to the gas medium, and determine how quickly they adjust to changes in the gas they are contained in. The availability of experimental data allows for testing of existing and refined drag models for their application to high-pressure, turbulent flow.\nComparisons were made between three model formulations: single-phase, multi-phase, and Lagrangian analysis.

Changes in chromatin state are directed by reversible modifications of histone tails and DNA bases.  Because these modifications or marks are heritable they are termed epigenetic, factors beyond the DNA sequence which can be passed through mitosis or meiosis.  This transcriptional gene silencing plays important roles in normal development, environmental responses, plasticity, and phenotypic diversity among other things.  The maize pericarp color1 (p1) pigment gene has served as a useful model for studying transcriptional gene silencing.  P1 is an R2R3 MYB transcription factor which activates the expression of enzymes needed for production of dark red flavonoid pigments called phlobaphenes in floral tissues.  There is astounding diversity of tissue specific expression patterns in different p1 alleles which has been accounted for by differential transcriptional gene silencing of regulatory elements.   Some alleles of p1 also participate in the epigenetic phenomenon paramutation, where transcriptional gene silencing and the ability to cause transcriptional gene silencing is passed from one allele to another allele of the same gene in trans.  That is when a silent paramutagenic allele is heterozygous with an expressing paramutable allele, the expressing allele is turned into a silent paramutagenic allele.  Paramutation is quite interesting because it is a violation of Mendel\u2019s first law that alleles segregate unchanged.  An unlinked dominant mutation in maize, Unstable factor for orange1 (Ufo1), releases the transcriptional gene silencing of several p1 alleles including paramutagenic ones.  The interaction of Ufo1 and p1 alleles is notable for the accumulation of ectopic phlobaphene pigments in vegetative tissues causing plants to appear red or orange.  However, the only known allele, Ufo1-1, has a high degree of instability, frequent sectoring, incomplete penetrance, and poor expressivity.  Additionally, Ufo1-1 plants display a range of pleiotropic defects such as reduced growth, bending, and abnormal leaf development.   The mechanisms involved in Ufo1-1 phenotypes and interactions with p1 are not well understood. \nIn chapter 1, I describe the identification of a candidate gene for Ufo1, GRMZM2G053177 (B73 RefGenV3, 5b+).  Using RNA-seq data from three tissues of Ufo1-1 it was found that the candidate gene, located in the mapping region for Ufo1, was expressed more than 50-250-fold over the wild type controls.  Additionally, we find that the candidate has a novel CACTA transposon insertion in the first intron that is not found in other inbred lines.  The CACTA appears to act as an enhancer of expression, but is also subject to transcriptional gene silencing.  Taken together these molecular features support the genetic behaviors of Ufo1-1 such as dominance, incomplete penetrance, and poor expressivity, making GRMZM2G053177 the most likely causal gene.  GRMZM2G053177 is unique to a few grass species and appears to be rapidly diverging.  It also lacks any sequence homology based annotations making its function hard to determine.  I discuss some possible roles based on protein structural homology from protein modeling software.\nI also show that thousands of genes are misregulated in Ufo1-1 seedlings, leaves, and pericarps.  Tests for GO enrichment reveal a few broad categories of genes affected in Ufo1-1 seedlings and leaves.  Stress response genes are broadly upregulated, while DNA replication and ribosome biogenesis are downregulated.  These are markers of a response to stress, however it is unclear whether Ufo1-1 plants are under stress or if Ufo1-1 directly regulates or interferes with normal stress responses.  The metabolic costs of constitutively activating stress responses and downregulating normal processes needed for growth likely explains the reduced height of Ufo1-1 plants.  \nThe involvement of siRNAs and Ufo1-1 in regulating paramutagenic and non-paramutagenic alleles of p1 was studied in chapter 2.  First, we find production of siRNAs from sequences required for paramutation in both a paramutagenic and a non-paramutagenic allele in leaves, immature tassels, immature cobs, and pericarps.  This indicates that siRNAs alone are not sufficient to initiate paramutation at p1.  Second, we show that Ufo1-1 does not alter global accumulation of siRNAs and its effects on siRNAs in different p1 alleles cannot explain its effects on DNA methylation at these alleles. In another set of experiments it was found that Ufo1-1 is not required for establishing paramutation at either P1-rr or B-I.  Additionally, we find that double mutants of Ufo1-1 and siRNA biogenesis mutant gene mediator of paramutation1 (mop1) have increased B\u2019 expression compared to mop1 mutants alone.  This indicates that Ufo1-1 does not function via a siRNA mechanism like mop1 does.  These results indicate that Ufo1-1 does not primarily regulate p1 through an epigenetic mechanism involving siRNA.  Alternate mechanisms may involve direct or indirect changes in DNA methylation via enzymes regulated by Ufo1.  While the exact mechanism remains unknown, here we have generated hypotheses about stress regulation of flavonoid genes and also identified the likely causal gene of Ufo1 allowing for future studies of this interesting locus.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16650], "author_name_tesi": "Wittmeyer, Kameron Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Wittmeyer", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Kameron", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Surinder Chopra", "Surinder Chopra", "Dawn Luthe", "Majid R Foolad", "Michael Axtell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Surinder Chopra, Dissertation Advisor", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Chair", "Dawn Luthe, Committee Member", "Majid R Foolad, Committee Member", "Michael Axtell, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ufo1", "Ufo1-1", "Unstable factor for orange1", "Maize genetics", "RNA-seq", "maize epigenetics", "paramutation", "p1", "pericarp color1", "P1-wr"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "FLOW FIELD MEASUREMENT IN THE PENN STATE 12 CC PVAD USING PARTICLE IMAGE VELOCIMETRY (PIV)\n\n\n", "id": "9267", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "662", "abstract_tesi": "Pulsatile cardiac assist pumps have been used with success in adult patients, but scaling down these pumps for the pediatric population has been troublesome.

Two dimensional velocity profiles were taken of flow in the center of the chamber.  Planes parallel and perpendicular to the diaphragm, which included both the inlet and outlet ports, were collected. These profiles were then examined throughout the cardiac cycle.  Regions of low fluid velocities were monitored to see if they persisted for extended periods of time, as these could contribute to clot formation.\nComparisons between a Newtonian and Non-Newtonian human blood analog were made, as well as comparisons of varying hematocrit and a goat blood analog. There were significant differences in the flow fields produced in Newtonian and Non-Newtonian blood analogs in this device.  These differences were most apparent in the velocity profiles of the inlet and outlet jets, but also lead to differences in the rotational flow that occurs in the device. The effect of hematocrit on the flow through the device was less apparent. The higher hematocrit fluid had more uniform inlet and outlet jets, a sustained major and minor orifice inlet jet and a delayed onset of rotational flow. A comparison of our goat blood analog and our 20% HCT human blood analog showed differences in both the strength and shape of the inlet and outlet jets. The recirculation in the outlet port during systole occurred much later in the cycle when using the goat blood analog. This led to lower velocities in the outlet port during outflow.  \n\tOur studies showed marked differences in flow profiles compared to our larger VADs.  It is important to use a blood analog that accurately mimics human blood in order to get meaningful data. A number of design modifications should be investigated. Either enlarging the outlet valve or placing the outlet valve outside the body of the pump may help reduce flow separation upstream of the valve occluder.  Further consideration should be taken regarding valve choice, valve orientation, and systolic duration in order to improve flow performance.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [658], "author_name_tesi": "Wivholm, Brandon David", "last_name_ssi": "Wivholm", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Brandon", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Keefe B Manning"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Keefe B Manning, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["PIV", "Pediatric Ventricular Assist Device", "PVAD"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "FLOW FIELD STUDY COMPARING DESIGN ITERATIONS OF A 50 CC LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE\n\n\n\n", "id": "9262", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2527", "abstract_tesi": "Due to the limitations of conventional therapy for heart failure patients, mechanical circulatory support devices are essential.

In V-3 the outlet port has been rotated away from the inlet port, with the intention of minimizing the amount of turning the fluid would have to do prior to exiting the device.   With V-4 the outlet port has been moved to the center of the pump in order to prolong the desirable rotational flow.  PIV data were taken at 6 planar locations within the pump.

There are generally two experimental designs employed for tracer (1) slug injections (SI), where a relatively large mass of dissolved tracer is instantaneously released into the stream to label a single parcel of stream water; and (2) constant rate injections (CRI), where a relatively small load of dissolved tracer is continuously introduced to the stream at a constant rate for a known duration of time, labeling (to a lesser extent than the SI approach) many parcels of stream water passing the injection location. However, relatively few studies have investigated the effect of experiment design on model parameter sensitivity and identifiability. We conducted slug injection and constant-rate experiments in a low-gradient, alluvial, headwater tundra stream in northern Alaska. Each experimental data set was simulated with the One- dimensional Transport with Inflow and Storage (OTIS) model, and analyzed with Monte Carlo- based techniques to investigate differences in parameter sensitivity and time-varying identifiability. Slug injection data showed sensitivity to the longitudinal dispersion parameter, while constant-rate injection data exhibited sensitivity to the storage zone area parameter. Constant rate injection data shows heightened identifiability for the storage zone area and storage zone \u2013 main channel exchange rate parameters during rising and tailing portions of the breakthrough curve, whereas slug injection data only show heightened identifiability to these parameters during the tailing portion of the breakthrough curve. Results show that experimental design affects parameter sensitivity and time-varying identifiability, and that experimental data may be easily analyzed to understand information contents associated with each parameter in a 1D transient storage model. \n(Chapter 2)\nAdvection, dispersion, and transient storage are three dominant solute transport processes in natural stream channels. One-dimensional numerical transient storage models are often used to\nsimulate these processes along with stream flow gains and losses, in order to understand the relative spatial and temporal scales of each process. Here we describe a new approach to determine the influence of advection, dispersion, transient storage, and longer-term exchanges by directly analyzing the solute data collected from stream tracer experiments, with no parametric modeling required. The inherent challenges of using solute transport models include issues related to model appropriateness and parameter identification. Using this new approach, we are able to parse the timescales and quantity of labeled water (i.e., tracer mass) that experience each process. We are better able to discern the relative influence of advection/dispersion, transient storage, and long time-scale exchange across conditions in a single stream, and across different stream systems. We apply our approach to many slug injections of dissolved salt in lake-inlet and lake-outlet stream reaches in arctic Alaska, and are able to compare and contrast the characteristic transport processes of each reach.\n(Chapter 3)\nLakes have been shown to alter basic geomorphic and hydrologic characteristics of outlet streams, compared to inlet streams. However, it is not well understood how lake-influenced differences in channel structure, open-channel hydrology, and subsurface hydrology affect solute transport mechanisms in inlet and outlet streams. Two arctic headwater streams, underlain by continuous permafrost, on Alaska\u2019s North Slope were intensively monitored from June to September 2011. Sites were selected to focus on the influence of a single high arctic lake, known as I8-Lake. I8-Inlet, a 555m reach directly upstream of the lake is un-influenced by any upstream lakes, while I8-Outlet is a 386m reach located directly downstream of the lake. Width:depth ratio at I8-Outlet was 33 and 20 at I8-Inlet. I8-Outlet had consistently higher Manning\u2019s n values at all discharge conditions. Water temperatures along I8 Outlet were consistently higher than water temperature along I8 Outlet. Outlet:inlet discharge ratio declined from 4 to 1 over a 4 month period (June through September of 2011) as lake storage from snowmelt drained throughout the thawed season. Shallow groundwater table dynamics at I8-Inlet were largely controlled by precipitation events, whereas I8-Outlet had a more stable shallow groundwater table, which rose quickly in the spring and remained relatively stable throughout the season. A non-parametric analysis based on objective breakthrough curve decomposition methods was used to analyze many small conservative slug injections from each stream to characterize solute transport differences. We found that more tracer mass was associated with the transient storage timescale on I8-Outlet compared to I8-Inlet (p = 0.005), while more tracer mass was associated with advection/dispersion timescales on I8-Inlet compared to I8-Outlet. we concluded that 1) a high arctic lake imposes measurable hydrologic and geomorphic changes along the down-valley river continuum, and 2) hydrogeomorphic differences amongst streams above and below a small arctic lake create significantly different solute transport environments. More specifically, the contribution of transient storage in I8 Outlet is greater than was observed in I8 Inlet.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8112], "author_name_tesi": "Wlostowsk, Adam Nicholas", "last_name_ssi": "Wlostowsk", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Michael N Gooseff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Michael N Gooseff, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrology", "Alaska", "solute transport", "sensitivity analysis", "numerical modeling", "surface water groundwater interaction"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Temporal evolution of magma sources and surface deformation at Pacaya Volcano, Guatemala revealed by InSAR", "id": "13581kcw156", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13581", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Pacaya Volcano, Guatemala is a continuously active, basaltic volcano whose western flank is unstable.

The use of the total variables in the equations rather than the perturbed (acoustical) variables allow for the extension of the model to include wind, temperature profiles, and other frequency independent conditions. The method of including sources in the model also allow for the incorporation of multiple spatially and temporally complex sources.\n\nTwo numerical methods are used for the solution of the constitutive equations: a dispersion relation preserving scheme, which is shown to be efficient and accurate but unsuitable for shock propagation; and a weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme which is shown to be able to stably propagate shocks but at considerable computational cost. Both of these algorithms are utilized in this investigation because their individual strengths\nare appropriate for different situations.\n\nIt is shown that these models are able to accurately recreate many acoustical phenomena.

The amplification factors determined in the test demonstrate a qualitative similarity with\ndiscussions in the literature and explosion data. The ability of the algorithm to propagate jet noise is then investigated using full scale jet noise as the input into the algorithm. The\nwaveforms predicted by the model are compared to a Burgers equation algorithm and using a weak shock theory analysis of the shock propagation speeds, an under-prediction of shock coalescence is noted in the Burgers equation algorithm.

Tumors are composed of a heterogeneous population of cells surrounded by a dynamic microenvironment. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subpopulation of cells within a tumor, are believed to be the main initiators of tumors and are thought to drive tumor growth and recurrence.

The results suggest that, without proper training, novices are ineffective at using multi-dimensional data visualization and visual steering tools to solve a design problem.  The training protocols developed in this analysis were effectively able to teach the novices valuable design decision-making strategies.  This was demonstrated, through controlled experiments, to provide substantial improvement in their average performance when using trade space exploration to solve a complex engineering design problem.

However, little research into the social environment of art classrooms has been conducted\nand constructing community in the art classroom as a way to improve classroom practice has yet\nto be thoroughly theorized (Cosier, 2001).\nClandinin and Connelly (2000) describe their three-dimensional methodological approach\nto narrative inquiry as one that emphasizes that the researcher is constantly looking inward and\noutward, at time, and at place.

The diseases caused by these bacteria are clinically indistinguishable, but pertussis toxin, which is only expressed by B. pertussis, has a variety of effects on the host immune response and hinders the clearance of B. pertussis from the respiratory tract.  This led us to investigate the host factors that overcome the effects of pertussis toxin.  In a mouse model of infection, Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u00e1 was required to limit leukocyte accumulation and survive during infection by B. pertussis, but not a pertussis toxin-deficient strain of B. pertussis.  Interferon-\u00e3 combatted the effects of pertussis toxin by contributing to the recruitment of leukocytes and the antibody-mediated clearance of B. pertussis.  Interestingly, B. parapertussis does not express pertussis toxin but causes the same disease in the same host.  We sought to elucidate the host factors that protect against B. parapertussis infection and how this bacterium may evade host immunity.  Antibodies, T cells, and neutrophils were crucial to the elimination of B. parapertussis from the respiratory tract.  However, B. parapertussis did not stimulate an early Toll-like receptor-4-mediated recruitment of leukocytes to the site of infection, resulting in the evasion of rapid clearance.  Interferon-\u00e3 overcame the lack of Toll-like receptor-4 stimulation by contributing to the inflammatory response, but Interferon-\u00e3 production was inhibited by Interleukin-10, facilitating the persistence of the infection.  Ultimately, both B. pertussis and B. parapertussis infections induce protective immunity.  Since ecological theory predicts that two closely related immunizing pathogens can not coexist in the same host population, we assessed the cross reactivity of immunity to these pathogens.  Immunity induced by B. parapertussis protected against both species while immunity induced by B. pertussis only protected against B. pertussis.  O antigen enabled B. parapertussis to avoid cross immunity and may be a key protective antigen.

One method to protect the bacteria is encapsulation within a solid fat.  \n\n\tA procedure to make mm-size solid fat beads containing water droplets was developed by using a syringe pump to drop a hot water-in-oil emulsion into cold water.  Brilliant blue dye (FD&C Blue 1) was encapsulated in the internal phase of the emulsion, and release kinetics were investigated as a function of temperature or various fat composition (100%, 80% and 60% hydrogenated palm stearine with soybean oil).  When the beads remained solid there was very little release, but as the solid fat content of the beads decreased the dye was release increased.  Complete release from the molten beads took up to 24 hours in the system studied.  However, solid fat content was not the sole factor determining release kinetics as two different compositions at the same solid fat content had different release profiles and the harder fat blend had higher release.\n\n\tThe encapsulation system developed using dye was modified slightly to encapsulate a probiotic bacterium, Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb-12.  A lower melting point fat blend was used (palm kernel oil with hydrogenated palm stearine) so the bacteria were not thermally inactivated during formation of the W/O emulsion (i.e., 50\u00b0C).  Beads were formed by dropping the hot emulsion from a syringe onto a chilled plate.  A result of changing the method for production was that there was a small population of bacteria remaining on the surface of the beads after production that could be readily washed off (7.1 log CFU per gram of beads compared to 8.6 log CFU per gram of unwashed beads or 8.4 log CFU per gram of washed beads.

Utilization of low density materials is advantageous from a design standpoint, because lower weight translates into improved performance of engineered products (i.e., notebook computers are more portable, vehicles achieve better gas mileage, and aircraft can carry more payload). Despite their low density and high strength to weight ratio, however, the widespread implementation of magnesium alloys is currently hindered by their relatively poor corrosion resistance. The objective of this research dissertation is to develop a scientific basis for the creation of a corrosion resistant magnesium alloy.\n\nThe corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys is affected by several interrelated factors. Among these are alloying, microstructure, impurities, galvanic corrosion effects, and service conditions, among others. Alloying and modification of the microstructure are primary approaches to controlling corrosion. Furthermore, nonequilibrium alloying of magnesium via physical vapor deposition allows for the formation of single-phase magnesium alloys with supersaturated concentrations of passivity-enhancing elements. The microstructure and surface morphology is also modifiable during physical vapor deposition through the variation of evaporation power, pressure, temperature, ion bombardment, and the source-to-substrate distance.\n\nAluminum, titanium, yttrium, and zirconium were initially chosen as candidates likely to impart passivity on vapor deposited magnesium alloys. Prior to this research, alloys of this type have never before been produced, much less studied. All of these metals were observed to afford some degree of corrosion resistance to magnesium. Due to the especially promising results from nonequilibrium alloying of magnesium with yttrium and titanium, the ternary magnesium-yttrium-titanium system was investigated in depth.\n\nWhile all of the alloys are lustrous, surface morphology is observed under the scanning electron microscope. The corrosion rate of the nonequilibrium sputtered alloys, as determined by polarization resistance, is significantly reduced compared to the most corrosion resistant commercial magnesium alloys. The open circuit potentials of the sputter deposited alloys are significantly more noble compared to commercial, equilibrium phase magnesium alloys. Galvanic corrosion susceptibility has also been considerably reduced. \n\nNonequilibrium magnesium-yttrium-titanium alloys have been shown to achieve passivity autonomously by alteration of the composition chemistry of the surface oxide/hydroxide layer. Self-healing properties are also evident, as corrosion propagation can be arrested after initial pitting of the material. \n\nA clear relationship exists between the corrosion resistance of sputter vapor deposited magnesium alloys and the amount of ion bombardment incurred by the alloy during deposition. Argon pressure, the distance between the source and the substrate, and alloy morphology play important roles in determining the ability of the alloy to develop a passive film. Thermal effects, both during and after alloy deposition, alter the stress state of the alloys, precipitation of second phases, and the mechanical stability of the passive film. An optimal thermal treatment has been developed in order to maximize the corrosion resistance of the magnesium-yttrium-titanium alloys. \n\nThe significance of the results includes the acquisition of electrochemical data for these novel materials, as well as expanding the utilization of magnesium alloys by the improvement in their corrosion resistance. The magnesium alloys developed in this work are more corrosion resistant than any commercial magnesium alloy. Structural components comprised of these alloys would therefore exhibit unprecedented corrosion performance. Coatings of these alloys on magnesium components would provide a corrosion resistant yet galvanically-compatible coating. The broad impact of these contributions is that these new low-density, corrosion resistant magnesium alloys can be used to produce engineering components for vehicles that have greater acceleration, longer range, heavier payloads, lower life cycle costs, and longer inspection intervals.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5114], "author_name_tesi": "Wolfe, Ryan Curtis", "last_name_ssi": "Wolfe", "middle_name_ssi": "Curtis", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Shaw", "Russell Messier", "Howard W Pickering", "Mark William Horn", "Elzbieta Sikora"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Shaw, Committee Chair", "Russell Messier, Committee Member", "Howard W Pickering, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member", "Elzbieta Sikora, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["corrosion", "magnesium", "passivity", "vapor deposition", "ion bombardment", "dealloying"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "REWRITING TRUJILLO, RECONSTRUCTING A NATION: DOMINICAN HISTORY IN NOVELS BY MARCIO VELOZ MAGGIOLO, ANDRES L.

From the beginning of Trujillo\u2019s political career, the dictator\u2019s team of spin-doctors, carefully selected from among the Dominican intelligentsia systematically, exploited the media, poetry, prose narrative, and even popular music to construct a public persona that would eventually grow to mythological proportions.  \nGiven the trujillato\u2019s notorious use of literature in mythologizing Trujillo, it is hardly surprising that, in the years immediately following his death, Dominican writers would also employ narrative in their efforts to de/re-mythologize him. The present study examines how four prominent novelists\u2014Marcio Veloz Maggiolo, Andr\u00e9s L. Mateo, Viriato Senci\u00f3n, and Mario Vargas Llosa\u2014use literature to reexamine and rewrite Trujillo\u2019s 30-year rule over the Dominican Republic. These writers also typify the evolution of the Dominican novel over the last 40 years. Like other Latin American \u201cdictator novels,\u201d the texts studied here\u2014which include De abril en adelante (1975), La balada de Alfonsina Bair\u00e1n (1985), Los que falsificaron la firma de Dios (1992) and La fiesta del chivo\u2014call attention to both the hegemonic processes that empower and the rhetorical structures that help to shore up authoritarian rule. Building upon the ideas of Ross Chambers, Ren\u00e9 Girard, Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda and others, this thesis examines how these writers\u2019 works attempt to create \u201croom for maneuver\u201d between the discourse of dictatorship and the dictatorship of narrative convention. My primary assertion is that the rhetorical \u201cfree space\u201d created by oppositional texts, when inserted into the dictator\u2019s system of signification, creates the potential for readers\u2019 desires to be shifted away from the dictator and toward a dissenting (frequently the narrative) voice. While large-scale social change brought about via readers reading novels such as those studied here is unlikely, these works chip away at the dictator\u2019s power structure by targeting and changing his constituency one reader at a time.

To control cost, hemodialyzers are typically reprocessed using chemical agents such as bleach or peracetic acid, allowing a single dialyzer to be used as many as 10 or 20 times by a given patient.  However, several studies have suggested that reprocessing reduces the clinical effectiveness of hemodialysis.  The overall objective of the research presented in this thesis was to develop an improved fundamental understanding of the effects of dialyzer reprocessing on both the mass transport characteristics and surface properties of synthetic hemodialysis membranes. Experimental data were obtained for the membrane ultrafiltration coefficient, the solute clearance and sieving coefficients (using urea, vitamin B12, polydisperse dextrans, and bovine serum albumin as model solutes), and the membrane zeta potential using several polysulfone-blended dialyzers.  The solute clearance and sieving data were used to determine the effective membrane pore size using appropriate membrane models and available hydrodynamic analyses.  \nBleach exposure caused a significant increase in the membrane ultrafiltration coefficient with corresponding increases in clearance and sieving coefficients, particularly for the larger molecular weight dextrans.  Bleach also increased the net negative charge of the membrane surface.  These alterations are associated with the leaching of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) from the membrane co-polymer, an effect that was quantified by evaluating the nitrogen level in the membrane surface using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).  These changes in pore size and surface properties provide important insights into the effects of reprocessing on dialyzer performance, and they also suggest new approaches to develop high flux membranes for cytokine removal in the treatment of sepsis.\nPeracetic acid reprocessing caused no observable degradation in the membrane, but it was largely ineffective at removing residual protein from the membrane surface.  This led to significant reductions in solute clearance, sieving coefficients, and membrane ultrafiltration coefficient, consistent with a reduction in the effective membrane pore size due to residual plasma proteins on or within the membrane pore structure.  Interestingly, a significant fraction of the cleaning occurred during the storage of the dialyzers in the peracetic acid disinfectant solution, which is the first time this effect has been reported in the literature.\nRecently, Novaflux Technologies developed a cleaning process that uses a two-phase (gas-liquid) flow to achieve high levels of protein removal from the membrane surface and within the membrane pore structure.  Experimental studies demonstrated that the Novaflux reprocessing system can effectively restore the properties of clinically-used dialyzers.  However, results obtained using a low level of bleach in the cleaning solution showed a significant amount of membrane degradation, while the use of a bleach-free sodium hydroxide solution was unable to completely remove residual protein from the membrane.  The results obtained in this thesis provide fundamental insights into the effectiveness of different reprocessing methods, with these results having important implications for the clinical application of reprocessing in the delivery of cost-effective hemodialysis.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5599], "author_name_tesi": "Wolff, Susanne Hawthorne", "last_name_ssi": "Wolff", "middle_name_ssi": "Hawthorne", "first_name_ssi": "Susanne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney", "Michael V Pishko", "Darrell Velegol", "Erwin A Vogler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney, Committee Chair", "Michael V Pishko, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bleach", "peracetic acid", "polysulfone hemodialyzers", "transport characteristics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Hygro-Thermal Performance of Imperfectly Protected Below-Grade Walls with Interior Insulation\n\n", "id": "10733", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "751", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigates the performance of three different types of insulation installed in the interior of a basement wall system in a below-grade wall system.

Carbon nano\u001cfiber composites in particular have demonstrated excellent mechanical strength coupled with good thermal and electrical conductivity. High axial dependence of carbon nano\u001cfiber thermal conductivity, coupled with multiple manufacturing issues regarding composite production in unique geometries, has limited their utility in composite materials for thermal dispersion systems. The objective of this thesis is to develop a radial composite heat sink with a high thermal conductivity\nto weight ratio (compared to copper/aluminum). Research will be performed to study the thermal conductivity of carbon nano\u001cfiber composites as a function of fiber orientation and will be compared to typical heat sink materials.\nResults from the \u001cfiber orientation analysis showed that heat transfer in the transverse direction of the Hex-Tow\u00ae IM7 carbon nanofiber corresponded to a drop in thermal conductivity of 47% from the axial orientation. Small angle off\u001bsets of 5\u00b0, 10\u00b0, and 15\u00b0 also showed rapid decrease in thermal conductivity from the fully axial orientation of 11.8%, 15.9%, and 21% respectively. A radial heat sink prototype was developed approximating a fully radial setup by limiting \u001cfiber orientation angle to 10\u00b0 maximum o\u001bset. This prototype was produced as a 60\u00b0 wedge with inner radius of 1.0 inch and 3.0 inch outer radius using four prepreg patterns to vary ply connection points and \u001cfiber orientation between successive layers using a unidirectional prepreg roll of HexTow\u00ae IM7 carbon nano\u001cfiber and the HexPly\u00ae 8552 anime cured epoxy resin. Testing of the prototype showed an overall thermal conductivity corresponding to approximately a 25\u00b0 average \u001cfiber orientation. It is assumed that\nthis low thermal conductivity is due to the inner surface being modified from the cylindrical geometry to a \u001dflat\n1.0 inch long surface for contact with the heat source. This re-orientation of heat flux increased the overall \u001cfiber orientation from between 5 and 10\u00b0 to between 20 and 30\u00b0. Results from this approximation match well with a near radial heat sink estimation, however further work is required before production of a full heat sink.

The pressor effect of increased sodium intake is mediated by central mechanisms and depends on increased sympathetic nerve activity (SNA). Both peripheral and central administration of hyperosmotic NaCl increases blood pressure through differential regulation of multiple sympathetic vascular beds. \nA region of the forebrain lamina terminalis near the anterior ventral 3rd ventricle, known as the AV3V region, has been identified as an integral part of the brain involved in mediating the sympathoexcitatory and hypertensive response to increased sodium intake.  This region is comprised of several brain centers known to contain osmosensitive neurons including the organum vasculosum lateral terminals (OVLT), subfornical organ (SFO), and the median pre-optic area (MePO).  Multiple studies have shown that lesioning of the AV3V region can attenuate many of the responses to increased sodium intake including increased fluid intake, and vasopressin release as well as hypertension and sympathoexcitation.   \nThe OVLT, a circumventricular organ with an incomplete blood brain barrier, has also been shown to be involved in regulating many of the responses to increased sodium intake.  Specific ablation of the OVLT alone attenuates the increased drinking and vasopressin release in response to sodium load and has been implicated in the regulation of SNA in response to intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered NaCl.  However, the exact contribution of the OVLT and its effects on various sympathetic vascular beds in response to ICV sodium loading has not been fully characterized.  Therefore, the purpose of this study was twofold:  1. to determine the effect of lesioning of the OVLT on the sympathoexcitatory and hypertensive effects in response to increased central sodium levels and to compare this to the effect seen with the much larger AV3V ablation, and 2. to characterize the effects of OVLT ablation on the responses of the individual sympathetic vascular beds mediating the response to increased central sodium loads.  \nIn chloralose anesthetized, vasopressin blocked rats, ICV infusion of 5ul of 1.0M NaCl over 10min. increased ABP, HR and lumbar SNA compared to baseline. Renal and splanchnic SNA initially decreased during NaCl infusion, but showed a delayed increase to above baseline values following cessation of the infusion.   AV3V ablation resulted in almost complete attenuation of these effects as compared to control.  Alternatively, OVLT ablation only partially attenuated the effects on ABP, heart rate (HR) and SNA as compared to AV3V ablation levels.                 \nThese results suggest that the AV3V region is integral in the body\u2019s ability to respond to increases in central sodium levels and the OVLT mediates, at least in part, the sympathoexcitatory and hypertensive effects of increased central sodium loading through changes in lumbar sympathetic activity.  However, the fact that the OVLT ablation only partially attenuates lumbar SNA and ABP compared to that seen with AV3V ablation suggests brain regions other than the OVLT are also likely involved.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8494], "author_name_tesi": "Wolfgang, Lawrence Louis", "last_name_ssi": "Wolfgang", "middle_name_ssi": "Louis", "first_name_ssi": "Lawrence", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sean D Stocker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sean D Stocker, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["salt", "hypertension", "OVLT", "AV3V", "stimulus triggered averaging", "ablation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Personal Troubles and Public Issues as Master Frames\n\n\n", "id": "9074", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3348", "abstract_tesi": "This study considers if it is possible to identify characteristics which differentiate between those who categorize social problems as personal troubles and those who see social problems as public issues.

Studies suggest that the D2R both affects and is affected by intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and these actions are most likely through interactions with components of the D2R signalplex.  A disruption in the interaction between the D2R and proteins within the signalplex may promote the onset of these disease states.  Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) directly interacts with the D2R and is a proven modulator of neurosecretion by regulation of Ca2+ signaling.  The result of the D2R/NCS-1 interaction is attenuation of agonist-induced internalization of the D2R by inhibition of G-protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) phosphorylation of the D2R.  This inhibition of D2R internalization promotes continued signaling of the D2R, which may have disease related consequences.\nThe hypothesis of this dissertation is that the interaction between D2R and NCS-1 is dependent on ion binding and structural features of NCS-1.  This dissertation presents a method for production and purification of recombinant NCS-1 to be used in biochemical experiments, enabling the characterization of NCS-1 and the D2R/NCS-1 interaction.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the immediate precursors to osteoprogenitors, are found in the marrow, and likely in numerous other sites throughout the organism.  Differentiation of these progenitors, when placed into culture under appropriate conditions, proceeds through characteristic stages of commitment, proliferation, matrix secretion, and mineral deposition during a period of 3-4 weeks.  We have developed an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived osteogenic culture system.  ESCs are allowed to form embryoid bodies (EBs) that are then disrupted after two days and plated as single cells at densities as low as 25 cells/cm2.  By eight days post plating, a significant percentage of the colonies have morphology characteristic of other types of osteogenic cultures.  By three weeks in culture, these colonies go on to form layered nodules.  Generally 60% of the colonies are layered, mineralized nodules.  \nThis thesis provides three lines of evidence for osteogenesis in these ESC-derived cultures:  (i) cell and colony morphology as revealed by phase contrast microscopy, (ii) mineralization of extracellular matrix as revealed by von Kossa staining, and (iii) QRT-PCR analysis of cDNA from entire plates and individual colonies revealing expression of genes characteristic of, and specific for, osteoblasts.  For QRT-PCR analysis, we have isolated RNA from entire plates and individual colonies at different stages of the differentiation process to investigate the expression of genes characteristic of the osteoblast lineage, as well as genes characteristic of other lineages and stem/progenitor cells.  Analysis of gene expression in the first week revealed that brachyury, Twist-2, Runx2, and Sox-9 are up-regulated by day 4 of the osteogenic culture, with osterix expression increasing by day 7.  Runx2, osterix, type I collagen, and Bglap1, all important for osteogenesis, are transcriptionally up-regulated by day 14 and continue to increase in expression out to 21 days.  QRT-PCR analysis of amplified RNA from individual colonies indicates that it is the morphologically osteogenic colonies that are expressing mRNA characteristic of the osteoblast lineage and allows us to further categorize colonies into hematopoietic, osteogenic, adipogenic, myogenic or a mixture of mesenchymal lineages.  \nThe goal of this project has been to define the timing and molecular basis of commitment in ESC-derived osteogenic cultures.  We hypothesize that there is a critical decision point involving mesenchymal lineages that occurs somewhere before day 3 of the osteogenic culture.  In order to investigate the commitment of progenitor cells to the osteogenic lineage, we have developed methods permitting overexpression and knockdown of Runx2 mRNA.  Runx2 is a transcription factor necessary for bone formation and is postulated to be the transcriptional switch of osteoblast differentiation.  Three methods of inducing Runx2 expression have been utilized: (i) up-regulation of Runx2 by bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), (ii) constitutive overexpression of Runx2 constructs, and (iii) tetracycline-inducible overexpression of Runx2 constructs.  For the knockdown of Runx2 mRNA expression, we have utilized both a constitutive and tetracycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) system, which employs components of the pSUPERIOR RNAi System\u201e\u00a7.  The overexpression studies suggest that before cells commit to the osteogenic lineage, overexpression of Runx2 is detrimental to the osteogenic lineage.  The loss-of-functions studies suggest that there is a critical time point between the ESC and day 2 embryoid body (D2EB), in which induction of shRNA for Runx2 is also detrimental to osteogenesis.  \nThis method of initiating osteogenesis from murine ESC cultures, where individual EB-derived progenitors are plated at a low density such that the potential and differentiation of a single cell can be determined, is the only described method that allows for the observation and manipulation of the commitment stage of mesengenesis from single murine embryonic progenitors.  It also shows great promise for unraveling the mechanisms of commitment to the osteogenic lineage, as well as exploring the therapeutic potential of cells of this lineage.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4646], "author_name_tesi": "Woll, Nicole Leanor", "last_name_ssi": "Woll", "middle_name_ssi": "Leanor", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Bronson", "Mala Chinoy", "Henry Joseph Donahue", "Ralph Lauren Keil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Bronson, Committee Chair", "Mala Chinoy, Committee Member", "Henry Joseph Donahue, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["embryonic stem cells", "osteoblasts", "bone", "differentiation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Reliability and Validity Evidenc for the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS) when used in Rural Homes", "id": "18903", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9035", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of the current study was to examine reliability and validity of scores from the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS; Matheny, Wachs, Ludwig, & Phillips, 1995).

Suburban liberalism in Silicon Valley arose out of an almost century-long process of progressive reform led by professional and middle-class residents and, although ultimately taken up by the Democratic Party, its early origins lay with liberal Republicans in the Progressive Era.\n \nThis dissertation makes three primary contributions to recent US political history. First, it identifies and describes an overlooked suburban strand of modern liberalism. In doing so, it challenges several of the tenants of the so-called \u201cRise of the Right\u201d narrative held by many historians and contemporary political commentators. The coalescence in the 1970s of a suburban liberal municipal order in Silicon Valley belies the common belief that the coalition underlying postwar \u201cgrowth liberalism\u201d collapsed entirely in the face of an ascendant New Right. Second, this dissertation undercuts the assumption that suburban environments in the US invariably fostered a conservative political orientation among residents during the postwar decades. Silicon Valley provides an example where a majority of residents wanted government action to improve their quality of life, protect the environment, and enhance the livability of their communities. They were also socially liberal and supportive of civil rights, as demonstrated by the high number of female officeholders elected in the region during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nFinally, by using the city of San Jose and the surrounding Santa Clara County as a case study, this dissertation also offers an economic and political history of Silicon Valley that expands our understanding of the region beyond the narrow time frames and small set of players focused on by many other scholars and commentators. This study reveals how three successive waves of progressive middle-class reform movements \u2013 one in the Progressive Era, one in the postwar decades, and one in the 1970s \u2013 laid the foundation for, and ultimately sustained the viability of, the Silicon Valley political economy. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8382], "author_name_tesi": "Wolpern, Steven F", "last_name_ssi": "Wolpern", "middle_name_ssi": "F", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Scott Cross", "Nan Elizabeth Woodruff", "Daniel L Letwin", "Benjamin Jared Schreier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Scott Cross, Dissertation Advisor", "Nan Elizabeth Woodruff, Committee Member", "Daniel L Letwin, Committee Member", "Benjamin Jared Schreier, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Silicon Valley", "San Jose", "Santa Clara County", "suburban", "liberalism", "suburban liberalism", "Janet Gray Hayes", "Norman Mineta", "reform"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Conserving natural resources through local land use decisions: knowledge and attitudes of planning commissioners", "id": "7697bjw229", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7697", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In Pennsylvania, municipal planning commissioners are tasked with administering current land use plans and regulations, as well as updating those plans and regulations to manage the changing needs of development, environmental protection, and quality of life within a municipality. It has been thought these leaders lack the knowledge of the full set of regulatory and non-regulatory tools available to balance development and conservation. As primary actors in local land use decisions, their knowledge about and attitudes toward local natural resource conservation have not been well understood or studied. Focusing on four counties in northeastern Pennsylvania, this study aimed to investigate municipal planning commissioners\u2019 knowledge about and attitudes towards local regulatory tools (e.g., zoning, subdivision and land development ordinances), and non-regulatory tools (e.g., comprehensive plans, land acquisition strategies, partnerships) for conserving natural resources.\n\nThis mixed methods study used key informant interviews to develop an understanding of the social context of natural resource conservation as well as land use planning and regulatory policy in the study area. Building on the results of the interviews, a mail survey instrument was developed to assess planning commissioners\u2019 knowledge and attitudes toward land use planning and its use for natural resource conservation. Results of the survey were used to determine what factors influenced the attitudes of planning commissioners with two multivariate regression models. One model focused on attitudes towards planning for natural resource conservation while the second model focused on attitudes towards zoning for natural resource conservation. \n\nThe regression models indicated support of social class and environmental concern theories, with political orientation predicting attitudes of planning commissioners toward both planning for and regulation of natural resource conservation. Conservative planning commissioners were more likely to disagree with both planning for and regulating conservation of natural resources in their municipalities. Gender was also a factor influencing agreement with regulation of natural resource conservation, but not for planning. Female planning commissioners were more likely to agree with regulation of natural resource conservation in their municipalities. Training for planning commissioners was also significant in explaining attitudes of planning commissioners in the models. Those indicating agreement with training for planning commissioners were more likely to agree with both planning and regulation of natural resource conservation in their municipalities.\n\nIn addition to a better understanding of the knowledge and attitudes of planning commissioners, the results of this study also provided other interesting insights on planning commissioners. There was a substantial gender imbalance among planning commissioners with over four-fifths of respondents being male. Also, almost two-thirds of planning commissioners thought they had not received adequate training. \n\nThe important information provided by the results of this study improved understanding of how planning commissioners think about natural resource conservation in Pennsylvania. This study moved forward this understanding by surveying planning commissioners directly, adding to a limited body of research on what is an important role in municipal government in Pennsylvania.

Thus, indium surfactant can modify the growth mode of GaN films by changing surface energy and surface kinetics of adsorbed Ga and N adatoms. In this thesis research, the effect of indium surfactant on Ga-polar and N-polar GaN films grown at 950 oC by MOCVD on various substrates such as Si-face SiC, bulk GaN, Si(111), and C-face SiC was studied to investigate the stress relaxation mechanism, structural, and optical properties of GaN films which were modified by the indium surfactant. \nThe effect of indium surfactant on GaN films grown on SiC was studied first. In the 1.8 &#61549;m thick Ga-polar GaN films grown on lattice-mismatched Si-face SiC substrates utilizing indium surfactant at 950 oC, inverted hexagonal pyramid surface defects, so-called V-defects which consist of six  planes, formed at threading dislocations on the GaN surface, which gave rise to the relaxation of compressive misfit stress in an elastic way. Simultaneously, enhanced surface mobility of Ga and N adatoms with indium surfactant lead to improved 2D growth, which may be contradictory to the formation of surface defects like V-defects. In order to find the driving force for V-defect formation in the presence of indium, a nucleation and growth model was developed, taking into consideration the strain, surface, and dislocation energies modified by indium surfactant. This model found that the V-defect formation can be energetically preferred since indium reduces the surface energy of the  plane, which gives rise to the V-defect formation and growth that can overcome the energy barrier at the critical radius of the V-defect. These Ga-polar GaN films were found to be unintentionally doped with Si. Thus, an investigation into the effect of intentional Si doping at a constant TMIn flow rate on GaN films was also performed. Si turned out to be another important factor in the generation of V-defects because Si may be captured at the threading dislocation cores by forming Si \u2013 N bonds, acting as a mask to locally prevent GaN growth. This behavior appeared to assist the initiation of the V-defect which enables V-defects to easily grow beyond the critical radius. Thus, introduction of indium surfactant and Si doping was found to be the most favorable conditions for V-defect formation in Ga-polar GaN films grown on Si-face SiC substrates.\nThe nucleation and growth model predicted that V-defects may not form in homoepitaxy because the energy barrier for V-defect formation approaches infinity due to zero misfit stress. When indium surfactant and Si dopant were introduced simultaneously during the homoepitaxial growth, V-defects did not form in 1.8 &#61549;m thick Ga-polar GaN films grown at 950 oC on bulk GaN that had very low threading dislocation density, as predicted by the nucleation and growth model. Ga-polar GaN films grown on Si(111) substrates using indium surfactant showed that additional tensile stress was induced by indium with respect to the reference GaN. Since cracking is known to be a stress relaxation mechanism for tension, the In-induced additional tensile stress is thus detrimental to the GaN films which experience the tensile thermal stress associated with the difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between GaN and the substrate during cooling after growth. The generation of tensile stress by indium seemed correlated with a reduction of V-defects since a high density of V-defects formed under the initial compressive stress at the GaN nucleation stage and then V-defect density decreased as the film grew. Even though the initial misfit stress of the GaN film grown on Si(111) was lower than that of GaN grown on SiC, a high density of V-defects were created under the initial compressive stress. Therefore, the high density of threading dislocations was believed to strongly drive the V-defect formation under In-rich conditions.\nConsequently, without using high quality bulk GaN substrates, V-defects could not be avoided in Ga-polar GaN films grown on foreign substrates such as Si-face SiC and Si(111) in the presence of indium surfactant and Si dopants during growth. Thus, N-polar GaN films were investigated using vicinal C-face SiC substrates because a theoretical study utilizing first-principles calculations predicted that V-defects are not energetically favored on the N-face GaN. When indium surfactant and Si doping were used during N-polar GaN growth, V-defects did not form, as predicted by theory. This observation suggests that V-defect free N-polar InGaN alloys also can be achieved, which may enable stable green laser diodes with long lifetime to be fabricated using the high indium composition N-polar InGaN films. Fundamental studies of N-polar GaN growth with varying growth parameters such as growth temperature, two-step process, and AlN buffer layer thickness, were conducted to optimize the surface morphology and structural properties of N-polar GaN epilayers for future N-polar InGaN growth.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1597], "author_name_tesi": "Won, Dong Jin ", "last_name_ssi": "Won", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dong Jin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Christopher Muhlstein", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Francesco Costanzo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Dissertation Advisor", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Chair", "Christopher Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Francesco Costanzo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["GaN", "AlN", "nitrides", "MOCVD", "Indium surfactant", "epitaxy", "heteroepitaxy", "XRD", "PL", "AFM", "Raman"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE MEASUREMENTS OF SHEET CONDUCTANCE OF METALLIZED SILICON SURFACE BY TWO POINT TUNNELING PROBE", "id": "8825", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2304", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We made measurements of the sheet conductance of the Si(111) 7 $\times$ 7 reconstructed surface and its metallization with Ag-overlayers.

In the low frequency range, most of the mechanical power injected into the plate is confined to and travels in the plate.  In the high frequency range, i.e., above the coincidence frequency, the mechanical power in the plate transfers to the acoustic medium.  The plate is excited by either an infinite line force or a point force, and the corresponding expressions of the structural intensity are derived.  One or several controllers on the plate control the structural intensity or the radiated acoustic power following the Steepest Gradient Algorithm.  \n\tWhile controlling the structural intensity at a reference point in a line-excited plate, a line-force controller located at multiples of a half fluid-loaded structural wavelength from the source reduces the structural intensity in the far-field and at the reference point.  The radiated acoustic power below the coincidence frequency is reduced when the controller is located within a quarter fluid-loaded structural wavelength of the source.  Above the coincidence frequency, a controller located at a distance of multiples of a half fluid-loaded structural wavelength achieves larger reduction of the radiated acoustic power than controllers placed at other locations.  The number of controllers becomes important when controlling the structural intensity or the radiated acoustic power from a point-excited plate.  In order to achieve global reduction of the structural intensity, a system of four synchronous controllers should be located within a quarter fluid-loaded structural wavelength from the source.  With the controller(s) at multiples of a half fluid-loaded structural wavelength, larger reductions of structural intensity are observed than when the controllers are placed at other locations.

If these molecules remain bound by the food they will not be perceived. One method to ensure protection and proper delivery of these ingredients to the desired active site is by microencapsulation in an emulsion-based delivery system. This work will demonstrate enzyme-triggered release of a hydrophobic compound from a water-dilutable delivery system. The hydrophobic compound is protected and less active in a supercooled liquid lipid droplet but enzyme treatment triggers droplet crystallization and the compound is released. While the focus of the work is on the release of an aroma, other reactive compounds (e.g. antimicrobials, drugs) could be used in a similar manner.\nThe effects of trypsin on a 1% casein-stabilized, 10% eicosane emulsion with 0.01 \u03bcl/ml added ethyl octanoate (EO) was studied at 28\u02daC. In the absence of trypsin, emulsions were stable over the course of the experiment (t=5 days). In the presence of trypsin, droplet size increased gradually over time (t=3 hours), suggesting protein hydrolysis results in progressive droplet coalescence. During protein digestion, supercooled liquid droplets eventually crystallize (t=18 hours), at which point the headspace concentration of EO increases suddenly. The headspace data are successfully modeled in terms of the partition coefficients with the bulk phases.\nThe effects of changing other parameters in the system (i.e., added protein, small molecule type and lipid type) are considered. Increased sodium caseinate solution concentrations led to a decrease in headspace ethyl octanoate (EO) concentration.

Production and consumption theories are often used to explain the emergence of gentrification as either an economic or sociocultural process; however, it has been observed that both perspectives are important in explaining, understanding, and dealing with gentrification.  Consumption-side explanations focus on understanding the growth and behavior of the middle classes in terms of their tastes and values, and how those are represented through gentrification.  Often disregarded as having any significant social merit, hipsters are multifaceted social characters who seek authenticity and individuality through adopting fashions from other cultures.  As gentrifiers, they could be conducive to the coexistence of longtime residents and newcomers, and contribute to the slowing of gentrification of a neighborhood.\n\nThis case study analysis explores the process of gentrification in terms of the role and impact of hipsters as gentrifiers in facilitating or hindering the coexistence of longtime residents and newcomers in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District.  Two perspectives are used in this analysis, geographical/spatial (urban morphogenesis) and sociological (expression of authenticity).  Taken from geography, the concept of urban morphogenesis lends to the understanding of gentrification by examining the physical and spatial changes to the urban landscape that occur as a result.  From a sociological standpoint, the concept of authenticity describes how groups exert power over space through gentrification.\n\nThe primary data come from qualitative interviews and field observations.  Individual interviews were conducted to ascertain the viewpoints of the residents, both longtime and new, as well as the perspectives of visitors to the neighborhood.  Field observations were conducted to record existing conditions and physical changes to the built environment as well as social characteristics. \n\nThe study revealed three key findings: 1) the presence of hipsters as gentrifiers hinders the coexistence of longtime residents and newcomers, 2) there is a physical and social \u201cdivide\u201d between longtime residents and newcomers, and 3) hipster wannabes play a large role in the current gentrification of the Mission District.

Chapter 1 critically analyzes the reclamation of emotion and affect in feminist epistemology as valuable resources for progressive theorizing by showing how even experiences of \u201coutlaw emotions\u201d\u2014such as anger and rage at racism\u2014can evidence the same problematic desire to make righteous knowledge claims that can be found in dominant discourse. Chapter 2 explores how the debilitating and disempowering effects of oppression are not merely psychological but also manifest in one\u2019s physiological body. I stress the need to address the embodied consequences of oppression presented in negative affects as a mechanism of oppression. Chapter 3 critically highlights positive psychology\u2019s therapeutic method of treating negative affects by cultivating positive affects while cautioning against its individualistic emphasis, which lacks sensitivity for larger ethical and political contexts. My argument culminates in Chapter 4, which combines the therapeutic method of positive psychology with feminist political projects to develop a conception of \u201cpositive philosophy.\u201d I argue that the unique mode of philosophical reflection in \u201cpositive philosophy,\u201d which entails taking pleasure in one\u2019s cultivated ability to think without certainty, can generate positive affective experiences that undo the negative psychosomatic and affective effects of oppression and discourage the production of righteous knowledge claims.

Ranging from microscopic particle suspensions to nanoscale molecules, these systems transduce chemical energy into mechanical motion across multiple length scales following a variety of mechanisms. Understanding the energy transduction processes and the subsequent nature of particle dynamics offers unprecedented opportunities to explore the physics of small-scale colloidal systems and to harness their behavior in many useful applications.\n\tHowever, over a decade after the initial discovery of autonomous bimetallic nanorods, we continue to struggle to bring such systems into real-world applications. Part of the setback has been the in-depth research into hydrogen peroxide fuel. While the studies have built up the fundamental knowledge necessary for the advancement of the field, we have yet to do the same for other systems that employ alternate fuels. This dissertation aims to fill that void by developing nano- and micromotor and pump systems that does not rely on traditional hydrogen peroxide fuel, uses novel material by taking inspiration in other areas of research, and complete in-depth studies to provide a clear understanding of such systems. \n\tChapter 1 provides a general overview of the research into chemically powered nano- and micromotors and pumps, the motivation behind my interest, and concise descriptions of the individual research projects discussed in this dissertation. \n\tChapter 2 and 3 discusses a highly efficient silver-based nanomotor and micropump system that operates in iodine media. It is a significant step in the development of a new type of system as it is extremely efficient in fuel conversion as well as being a light-modulated system. \n\tChapter 4 utilizes an established biopolymer to fabricate an acid-sensitive micropump and a proof-of-concept micromotor. This work provides the fundamentals that can be applied to converting other types of polymer into active colloidal systems. \n\tChapter 5 puts forth a novel biodegradable dual-mechanism micropump made of zinc and iron. The pump is controlled by both electrokinetics and density driven flows. This new system is undaunted by high electrolyte environments and is not limited to one type of chemical fuel, as it is capable of fluid pumping in acid, salt, and buffered solutions. \n\tThis dissertation concludes with a brief perspective on the future advancement in nano- and micromachine development. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13475], "author_name_tesi": "Wong, Flory ", "last_name_ssi": "Wong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Flory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen", "Ayusman Sen", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen, Dissertation Advisor", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanomotors", "micropumps", "electrophoretic", "electrokinetic", "active colloids", "self-electrophoresis", "density-driven flows", "self-powered"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Employment and Daily Experiences: Does Retirement Represent the Golden Days?\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "11061", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2646", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines how retirement affects the daily experiences of well-being. Using the Life Course Daily Stress perspective as a framework, three studies were conducted utilizing data from the National Study of Daily Experiences, which is the daily diary portion of the National Survey of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS). The first study described the associations between employment status (worker vs. retiree) and several domains of daily experiences (time use, psychological distress, and stressors). Results showed that working men reported spending the least amount of time on daily household chores when compared to their working and retired counterparts. Older working men and younger retired men exhibited the greatest vulnerability to daily psychological distress and risk that daily stressors posed to daily routines, finances, personal health or safety, and plans for the future. Using longitudinal data, the second paper assessed the associations between retirement transition (stayed working vs. transitioned into retirement) and daily experiences across a 10-year span. Older individuals who transitioned into retirement reported the greatest stressor exposure, and working individuals with a high school or less education reported the greatest stressor severity. The third paper moved past the use of self-report assessments of daily experiences to the biological marker of health, salivary cortisol. On all study days, older retirees displayed the highest cortisol level at 30 minutes after awakening while younger retirees exhibited the lowest cortisol level. There was an interactive effect of retirement status and gender on awakening cortisol on stressor days with retired men exhibiting the highest awakening cortisol level. Lastly, cortisol level at bedtime on stressor days was significantly higher for younger retirees and older workers than for older retirees and younger workers. These findings suggest that the retirement experiences are complex and cannot be characterized as entirely positive or negative. Findings also indicate that aspects of daily experiences are best explored through the interactive effect of retirement and life course influences rather than a simple main effect of retirement. Especially important to the study of retirement and daily experiences are the characteristics of the person (timing and gender) and environment (social embeddedness). \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2639], "author_name_tesi": "Wong, Jen D.", "last_name_ssi": "Wong", "middle_name_ssi": "D.", "first_name_ssi": "Jen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Manuel Almeida", "David Manuel Almeida", "Steven Howard Zarit", "Denis Gerstorf", "Linda Ann Wray"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Manuel Almeida, Dissertation Advisor", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Chair", "Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Member", "Denis Gerstorf, Committee Member", "Linda Ann Wray, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cortisol", "employment", "retirement", "time use", "daily well-being", "stressors"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Essays in Applied Game Theory", "id": "c821gj77m", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12904", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of three chapters, each applies game theoretic modeling techniques to understand incentives in an economic or political environment.\nThe first chapter studies a model of R&D race in the exponential-bandit learning framework (Choi 1991; Keller, Rady, and Cripps 2005), in which two heterogeneous firms, each endowed with an independent R&D process, choose when to irreversibly exit the R&D race. Each R&D process can be either good or bad. In the absence of a research breakthrough (innovation), a firm becomes more pessimistic about its R&D process over time. I show that strict patent protection may lead to excessive duplication of research efforts, while the lack of patent protection leads to free riding and under-experimentation of research opportunities. The choice of optimal patent system involves a trade-off between duplication in the early stage of R&D when both firms are optimistic and under-experimentation in the later stage when one firm has already exited and the remaining firm is pessimistic. Unless the firms are homogeneous, the optimal patent system is inefficient. Nevertheless, we propose an asymmetric distribution policy that implements the social optimum.\nThe second chapter studies a persuasion game between a decision maker (DM) and an expert. Prior to the communication stage, the expert exerts costly effort to obtain decisive information about the state of nature. The expert may feign ignorance but cannot misreport. We show that monitoring of information acquisition hampers the expert's incentives to acquire information. Contrary to everyday experiences, monitoring is always suboptimal if the expert's bias is large, yet sometimes optimal if the expert's bias is small.\nThe third chapter studies elections in non-democracies. Authoritarian rule requires teamwork of political elites. However, elite class members may lack incentive for the contribution of their efforts. We developed a model to study the decision of authoritarian rulers to introduce elections. Our model suggests that elections can motivate the ruling class to devote more effort to public good provision. Excessive electoral control hinders the introduction of elections, but mild electoral control facilitates it. Our findings offer a new perspective on understanding authoritarian elections and explain many stylized facts in authoritarian regimes. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12377], "author_name_tesi": "Wong, Tsz Ning ", "last_name_ssi": "Wong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tsz Ning", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Vijay Krishna", "Edward James Green", "Duncan Fong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Dissertation Advisor", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Member", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "Duncan Fong, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Strategic Experimentation", "Patent", "Persuasion Game", "Authoritarian Elections"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Optimization and Statistical Estimation for the Post Randomization Method", "id": "18869", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8930", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The field of Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) aims at developing methodology that balances the objectives of providing data for valid statistical inference and safeguarding confidential information. One of the SDC methods for categorical variables is the Post Randomization Method (PRAM). The basic idea underlying PRAM is to misclassify values of the categorical variables, via a known probability mechanism captured by a PRAM matrix. This thesis focuses on three primary methodological developments that enable PRAM to become a more theoretically and practically viable SDC method.\n\nFirst, we focus on the issue of obtaining valid statistical analysis with data subject to PRAM. The application of PRAM is known to produced biased parameter estimates in generalized linear models (GLMs). We develop and implement EM-type algorithms that take into account the effect of PRAM and obtain asymptotically unbiased estimators of parameters in GLMs, when both covariates and response variables are subject to PRAM. The basic ideas are based on the ``EM by method of weights\" in the missing data literature. Second, we extend the proposed methodology in order to deal with dependent covariates when estimating parameters in GLMs by relaxing the assumption of independence of covariates. This is done by modeling the distribution of the covariates subject to PRAM as a product of univariate conditional distributions. This approach advances the PRAM methodology by making it more applicable in practice and results in more accurate estimators of the regression parameters. Results from simulation studies and application to the 1993 Current Population Survey are presented. Lastly, we address the issue of obtaining optimal PRAM matrices which produce safe files and maximize data utility with respect to a widely-used utility measure for PRAM: entropy-based information loss, EBIL, a variant of Shannon's entropy. We show that for a certain class of PRAM matrices, EBIL displays monotonic properties, which implies the minimum of EBIL occurs at an extreme point of the convex region that satisfies a pre-determined rule for safe files. Using these properties, we present an algorithm that obtains PRAM matrices which produce safe files with higher data utility when compared to PRAM matrices obtained using built-in numerical methods and routines.

The relationship between the context of problem behaviors and social skills was hypothesized to better fit the data than the relationship between problem behaviors and social skills. Participants included 185 students from a rural school in Central Pennsylvania who were rated by 19 teachers. Due to limitations with sample size and constriction of range, the structural equation modeling models were not viable and canonical correlation analyses (CCA) were conducted to test the hypotheses. Results of the CCA found that problem behaviors and social skills were associated with specific academic settings. Students with behavior problems in academic or peer settings were more likely to have problems with cooperation and self-control; while students who exhibited behavior problems in teacher settings were more likely to have problems with assertiveness. In summary, findings from this study need to be viewed with caution given the homogeneous composition of the sample and the sample size of teachers and students, which resulted in a constricted range of scores and suspect findings about the measurement models.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2895], "author_name_tesi": "Wood, Jean Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Wood", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Jean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "School Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Schaefer", "Barbara Schaefer", "Beverly Vandiver", "Brian A Rabian", "Pamela S Wolfe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Schaefer, Dissertation Advisor", "Barbara Schaefer, Committee Chair", "Beverly Vandiver, Committee Chair", "Brian A Rabian, Committee Member", "Pamela S Wolfe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Problem Behaviors", "Social Skills", "Situtypes"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "THE EXPERIENCE AND MEANING OF POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN\u2019S SEXUAL DESIRE: A GROUNDED THEORY STUDY", "id": "6241", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2900", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Much of the research on women\u2019s sexual desire adopts a biomedical approach to the study of women\u2019s sexuality.  Feminist thought has been critical of this approach because it posits women\u2019s biology as the sole determinant of women\u2019s sexual experiences, such that sexual response is represented as universal, static, and unmalleable.  This essentialist approach to women\u2019s sexuality is especially problematic for midlife and older women due to institutionalized ageist medical ideology, in which postmenopausal women are viewed as deficient and diseased.  This research on women\u2019s sexual desire has been primarily quantitative, and therefore there is currently a dearth of information on women\u2019s experiences and meanings of sexual desire.  Based on these perceived shortcomings of the research on women\u2019s sexual desire, especially among postmenopausal women, this research project was developed.  A qualitative grounded theory research design, situated within a feminist paradigm, was used to fulfill the goals of this study.  Twenty-two postmenopausal women participated in semi-structured telephone interviews, and the resulting data were analyzed in Nvivo 2.0 using the constant comparison method (developed by Glaser & Strauss, 1967).  The results of this study suggest that postmenopausal women\u2019s experience and meaning of sexual desire is intrinsically related to their negotiation of their sexual agency.   Feminist scholars and theorists use the term sexual agency as a concept that describes the degree to which women are able to act on behalf of their own needs, desires, and wishes in terms of sexual behavior, sexual decision making, and even in terms of how women\u2019s sexuality is viewed within society (e.g. Brumberg, 1997; Fine, 1988; Vance, 1992; Wolf, 1998).  Similarly, feminists make a distinction between women as sexual subjects and as sexual objects.  Theoretically, as sexual subjects (much like as sexual agents), women are in control not only of their own bodies, but also in charge of how sexual desire is constructed in terms of gender roles and who sexual behavior and activity benefits and disempowers.  This research found that women negotiated their sexual agency within three sites:  within themselves, within their relationships with partners, and within their interactions with the medical system.   Women\u2019s negotiation of sexual agency was central to their experience of sexual desire, as well as the meanings that were attached to their experience.  Findings are discussed with regard to how women\u2019s sexual desire is deeply embedded in the sociocultural and politically charged context of their lives.  One significant result of this research was that women rarely discussed their sexual desire, even when they were repeatedly and directly asked about it. The \u201cstill missing discourse of desire\u201d (a term borrowed from Fine, 1988) indicates that women\u2019s own sense of themselves as sexual agents is entrenched within sociocultural meanings about what it means to be a woman who embodies sexual desire.  When women\u2019s sexual desire is appropriated by and for others (e.g. male partners, physicians) women\u2019s ability to negotiate sexual agency is curtailed.  In other words, when women\u2019s sexual desire is stigmatized and associated with pejorative terms (e.g. \u201cslut\u201d) the discourse of women\u2019s sexuality is constructed as negative and taboo, thereby making women\u2019s ability to negotiate sexual desire in light of such negative messages more difficult.  \nImplications of this study include the need to reconsider the current conceptualization and definition of sexual desire, as well as the need for researchers to acknowledge the effects of the political climate and sociocultural messages (often rooted in institutional sexism) that shape women\u2019s experience of sexual desire and the various meanings associated with women who embody their sexual desire.  Additionally, current models of sexual response may be limited, and the results of this research suggest that the treatment of women\u2019s low sexual desire as a sexual dysfunction or disorder may be inappropriate.  Recommendations for future research are also discussed with regard to the need for more (feminist) research that acknowledges the politically charged nature of women\u2019s sexuality.  Future work on women\u2019s sexual desire must address and critique the limitations and assumptions of much of the work on women\u2019s sexual response and sexual desire.  Without critical scholarship, additional research may stray further and further from women\u2019s perceptions and lived experiences.  Without understanding women\u2019s experiences of sexual desire (and other aspects of sexual response), realistic and applicable models of sexual response cannot be developed.  Utilizing feminist scholarship, since it focuses on women\u2019s power and the politics of knowledge and sexuality, is likely the first necessary step in critically thinking about the \u201cstill missing discourse of desire\u201d for women.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2894], "author_name_tesi": "Wood, Jill M", "last_name_ssi": "Wood", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Jill", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Barthalow Koch", "Phyllis Kernoff Mansfield", "Linda Ann Wray", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Barthalow Koch, Committee Chair", "Phyllis Kernoff Mansfield, Committee Chair", "Linda Ann Wray, Committee Member", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sexual desire", "qualitative research", "menopausal transition"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Causal inference in traffic safety research: comparison of the empirical Bayes and propensity scores-potential outcomes methods", "id": "28774", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12331", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Accurate estimation of safety treatment effectiveness is an important part of the transportation engineering and research profession.

Due to ethical and cost constraints, traffic safety research is limited to observational studies.

However, process models are typically applied only to intensive data collected over relatively short periods of time (seconds, minutes).

Measurement burst designs combine collection of intensive longitudinal data that provides for description of short-term process with collection of longitudinal panel data that provide for description of how different aspects of those processes change over time. This paper illustrates an application of a multilevel process model to measurement-burst data, to examine interindividual differences and intraindividual change in intraindividual process dynamics.\nRatings of affect arousal were collected from 150 adults age 18 to 90 years during three 21-day measurement bursts of intensive data collection, spaced approximately evenly over the course of a year.

Older age (relative to others) was related to higher arousal attractor positions but less demonstrated BPSC-related reactivity. Experience of major life events was associated with higher arousal inertia, as well as higher BPSC-related reactivity at both the inter- and intraindividual level.\nThese analysis and results illustrate how a multilevel model, cast in a process model framework, can be utilized by researchers to identify sources of inter- and intraindividual differences on multiple timescales.

Little however, is known about how farm internships meet these objectives and therefore a better understanding is needed of how this practice functions as both a learning and labor process, the meaning assigned to the experience by farm interns. This thesis explores themes associated with the structure of farm internships and the value of the experience from the perspective of women and men who interned on farms in Pennsylvania and the Northeast region of the US. The three exchanges primary to the structure of farm internships investigated in this study were the labor, learning and social exchanges. It specifically addresses the ways in which social exchanges organized the farm internship and the meaning interns assigned to the experience. The value of farm internships was assessed by focusing on the motivations and perceived benefits assigned to the practice by farm interns. The demographic characteristics of farm interns are presented, which is one of the first attempts to profile this population. In addition, this thesis explored whether farm internships establish socially responsible practices on sustainable farms.\n\tBoth qualitative and quantitate data were utilized to collect data for the purposes of studying farm internships. An understanding of agrarian political economy guided the theoretical approach to how the farm internship is structured; Weber\u2019s conceptualization of substantive rationality is used to investigate the subjective perspective of interns\u2019 participation in the structure. Results indicated that training during farm internships focuses on the intern\u2019s ability to learn from their labor, with minimal instruction provided by farm mentors. Farm tasks were substituted as a learning tool according to a farm\u2019s labor demands during the farm internship. Consequently, farm interns received the most instruction on topics that involved manual labor on farms. Farm interns were compensated during the internship with food and a small stipend. Farms in rural areas provided housing as remuneration; the conditions of such housing arrangements varied widely among participants. Resources identified by participants as instrumental in allowing them to take a salary sacrifice were a college education and support from family members. The informal nature of farm internships makes the social context of such arrangements important. Three different types of relationships between farm interns and farmers are identified that influence the structure and experience of farm internships. This typology includes the farm intern treated as a member of the family, the farm intern learning beside a farm manager, and a farmer who supervises farm interns in more managerial capacity. \nThe meaning that participants assign to their experiences focused on social and individual values unrelated to capital returns. Working and learning on farms provided participants the opportunity to live out social values promoted by the local food movement and dealing with social justices issues such as equitable food access.   Individual values that motivated farm interns to participate in an internship included exploring farming as a profession and becoming more aware of how food is grown on sustainable farms. Individual benefits that farm interns valued dealt with healthy eating, working in nature, and using one\u2019s body to accomplish work tasks. Nevertheless, farm interns recognized that their function as cheap labor force, justified by alternative motives and benefits, was an inequitable exchange in traditional renderings of the labor process. Implications of these findings for responsible and just treatment of farm interns and laborers on sustainable farms are advanced. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9257], "author_name_tesi": "Wood, Kathleen Faye", "last_name_ssi": "Wood", "middle_name_ssi": "Faye", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Internships", "agricultural labor practices", "sustainable agriculture", "vocational training"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Using Narrative Inquiry to Investigate Persistence Challenges for  African American Males in Education", "id": "13667mcw220", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13667", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many of the socioeconomic barriers facing minority students begin with a lack of preparation or under-preparedness at the elementary and secondary levels.

If no action is taken to remedy this disparity, large numbers of males will be left behind both socially and economically. In a commensurate fashion, however, post-secondary institutions may enable and continue to provide opportunities that allow students to ensure their long-term educational success. According to key indicators of academic achievement, educational attainment and school success, African-American males consistently cluster at the bottom of all rankings (Palmer, Wood, Dancy, & Strayhorn, 2014). Since post-secondary education is one focus of this study, I have ascertained how African American males matriculate and develop non-cognitive skills as well as deploy an anti-deficit achievement framework for them to succeed academically. Qualitative analyses were conducted on successful African American males attending Mid-Atlantic Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Predominately White Institutions (PWIs). As such, this study provides additional insight into the lived experiences of African American male collegians at HBCUs and PWI. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13884], "author_name_tesi": "Wood, Michael C", "last_name_ssi": "Wood", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edgar I.

In addition, the thermal decomposition of a monomeric polyphosphazene precursor was examined.  Chapter 5 of this thesis describes the control of the water uptake of sulfonimide substituted polyphosphazenes by the introduction of a silicate network.  Chapter 6 describes the synthesis and characterization of pendant cyclic polyphosphazenes for use as proton exchange membranes.  Chapter 7 describes the synthesis and characterization of anion-conductive polyphosphazenes for use as anionically conductive membranes.  Chapter 8 outlines the investigation of the state of water in hydrated proton exchange membranes by use of solid-state NMR techniques.  A study of the thermal decomposition of trichloro-N-trimethylsilylphosphoranimine is described in the appendix.\nChapter 5 details the synthesis and characterization of composite materials composed of a sulfonimide substituted polyphosphazene and silicate networks prepared through the sol-gel technique.  Substituted, hydrophobic, non-covalently attached silicate networks were prepared by the in-situ sol-gel condensation of trifluoropropyl trimethoxysilane, and the incorporation of the silicate network ranged from 5 to 20 weight percent.  Samples of the composites were also exposed to between 5 and 20 MRad of gamma radiation to crosslink the polyphosphazene, and form inter-penetrating networks.  Large decreases in the water uptake were observed in these materials.  Composite materials that incorporated an unsubstituted silicate network were likewise prepared from tetraethyl orthosilicate, and were found to increase the water uptake.\nChapter 6 discusses the synthesis of proton conductive membranes based upon organic polymers with pendant cyclic phosphazenes.  A 5-norbornene-2-methoxy substituent was introduced into the cyclic phosphazene, which was then polymerized via ring-opening metathesis polymerization.  Hydrogenated polymers were substituted with 3-methylphenoxy groups, which were subsequently sulfonated to yield sulfonic acid functionalized polymers.  The proton conductivity and methanol permeability of these materials were assessed.  A maximum proton conductivity of 4.81 x 10-4 S cm-1 was measured, which is relatively low.  However the minimum methanol permeability was 1.47 x 10-7 g cm-2 min-1, which is very low, thus making these materials candidates for direct methanol fuel cell membranes.\nChapter 7 describes the synthesis of anion conductive membranes.  Polymers substituted with arylphosphonium ions were synthesized, and their water uptakes and ionic conductivities were measured.  Although the ionic conductivities of these materials were low, they had low water uptake values, and thus may be useful in fuel cell applications.\nChapter 8 outlines the use of solid state NMR techniques to evaluate the state of water in proton exchange membranes.  Samples of a sulfonimide substituted polyphosphazene and the commercial proton exchange membrane Nafion were hydrated with deuterium oxide, and the 2H T1 relaxation times were measured.  These data indicated that solid, ice-like water is present in small quantities in these materials and, although the polyphosphazene absorbed much more water than Nafion, the amounts of ice-like water were similar.  Consequently, it is concluded that the role of water in these two polymers is similar.\nThe appendix is a study of the thermal decomposition of trichloro-N-trimethylsilylphosphoranimine.  The stability of this phosphoranimine in several solvents at room temperature and at -3 oC was examined through the use of phosphorus NMR, and preliminary experiments indicate that suitable medium term storage conditions are in diethyl ether at -3 oC.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5264], "author_name_tesi": "Wood, Richard M", "last_name_ssi": "Wood", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Richard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock", "Alan James Benesi", "Karl Todd Mueller", "Ian Roland Harrison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock, Committee Chair", "Alan James Benesi, Committee Member", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Member", "Ian Roland Harrison, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer", "fuel cell", "phosphazene"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Curvature Scalar Diagnostics and Progress on a Chern-Simons Initial Value Formulation\n", "id": "10148", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5748", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the recent past, many numerical relativity groups have gained the\nability to perform fully relativistic simulations of black hole mergers.\nOne of the key aims of these simulations is to compute gravitational\nwaveforms.  Such waveforms are interesting not only from a theoretical\nstandpoint, but also because they are necessary for the ongoing\neffort to detect gravitational waves.  Current numerical methods for\ncomputing gravitational waveforms depend on assumptions made about\nthe background spacetime, typically via a choice of\ntetrad.  Such methods require additional checks to insure the\nassumptions are correct.\n\nIn this dissertation, we first present the results of a project to use\nscalars which can be computed using only contractions of the curvature\ntensor as diagnostic tools in numerical relativity simulations.  The scalars\nhave been shown to contain information about the background spacetime\nand gravitational radiation, and are independent of any choice of tetrad,\nbackground, or coordinates.  The Baker Campanelli speciality index\nis used to determine when the spacetime separates into\nbackground and radiation, subject to the conditions that the radiation\nbe weak and be purely outgoing.  We find that at least the second\ncondition is not satisfied in the simulations we perform.\nThen, the Beetle-Burko radiation scalar is used\nto check the assumption that the tetrad used to compute gravitational\nwaveforms represents the principle null directions of the background\nspacetime.  It is essential that two vectors of the tetrad are\nparallel to the two principle null directions of the background in order\nto interpret the Newman Penrose scalar $Psi_4$ as the outgoing gravitational\nwave.  We find the tetrad passes this test whenever it can be\napplied in our simulations.  While this does not permit us to conclude\nthat the scalar $Psi_4$ is the outgoing gravitational wave, the\ntest can be used in more generic simulations to catch\nerrors in the $Psi_4$ calculation.\n\nNext, we present an attempt to write Chern-Simons modified gravity as\nan initial value problem.  Chern-Simons modified gravity is an\nextension to general relativity in which a parity violating term is\nadded to the action.  One effect the modification has is to enhance\nor suppress the different polarizations of gravitational radiation.\nTherefore, there is great interest in simulating binary black hole\nmergers in the theory and computing the resulting gravitational\nradiation.  We provide an incomplete set of constraints and evolution\nequations for the theory, and discuss difficulties of finding a\ncomplete set.  Projections of the modified field equations are also\nprovided.  Once a complete initial value formulation is found and\nsimulations are performed, gravitational wave detection can\nprovide a strong test of Chern-Simons modified gravity.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5744], "author_name_tesi": "Wood, Shaun Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Wood", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Shaun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Abhay Vasant Ashtekar", "Abhay Vasant Ashtekar", "Pablo Laguna", "Martin Bojowald", "Nigel David Higson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Abhay Vasant Ashtekar, Dissertation Advisor", "Abhay Vasant Ashtekar, Committee Chair", "Pablo Laguna, Committee Member", "Martin Bojowald, Committee Member", "Nigel David Higson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["general relativity", "numerical relativity", "Beetle-Burko scalar", "Chern-Simons gravity"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Wilson\u2019s Mantra: Sensemaking, Loose Coupling, and the Intramural Economic Engagement Interface at the University Of Massachusetts\n\n", "id": "22926", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10512", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Public research universities face increasing pressure from policy makers and the public to demonstrate economic relevance. As a response to this pressure, universities are adopting an \u201ceconomically engaged\u201d orientation, taking up and renewing commitments to technology-based economic development, workforce expansion, and cultivation of place through social, cultural, and community development. \n\nResearch on university-engaged economic development has generally focused on external aspects of engagement, leaving internal organizational changes largely unexamined. When such research has been internally focused, it has been concerned with specific organizational units or functions within the research mission of the university, such as technology transfer operations or interdisciplinary research centers. In practice, engagement bridges internal and external aspects of the university. University economic engagement must employ aspects of the institution\u2019s teaching and service missions as well as that of research, and it must include efforts across university units, departments, and functions. The lack of research on university adaptation to economic engagement from both an internal and institution-wide perspective has limited our understanding of this continually evolving aspect of university mission. Understanding internal and institution-wide dynamics around economic engagement will help university leaders and other practitioners, as well as researchers and policy makers, to shape more effective models of university-engaged economic development.\n\nExamining how a public research university adapts to a mission orientation of economic engagement provides the opportunity to see what kinds of organizational dynamics are at play. This study closely examined three universities within a public university system\u2014the University of Massachusetts\u2019s flagship institution in Amherst, its Medical School in Worcester, and its Lowell campus. Twenty-nine participants from these three institutions, the system president\u2019s office, and the state government were interviewed. Using a conceptual framework adapted from the literature on universities and regional development, these interviews were explored through a new concept called the Intramural Economic Engagement Interface (Intramural EEI). This idea encompasses organizational/structural and functional dynamics that play in the university\u2019s move toward an economically engaged orientation. Using an inductive and descriptive research design, the analysis of interview data led to development of case studies for each of the three UMass institutions. In a cross-case analysis, organizational theoretical concepts of sensemaking and loose coupling were applied, through which the characteristics of the Intramural EEI at these UMass institutions were interpreted. The research design and data analysis led to a detailed picture of the interrelationships between rhetoric, structure, and activities\u2014and between the teaching, research, and service missions\u2014and how these interrelationships facilitate adaptation to university-engaged economic development efforts.\n\nThe Intramural EEI comprises three domains that were the focus of the study\u2014rhetoric, structure, and activities\u2014and the study yielded key findings in each of these domains. One key finding was that university rhetoric enacts institutional identity interpretation. University actors engaging in identity interpretation focus particularly on reconciliation of institutional identity with institutional image. UMass system President Jack Wilson presented an image to external stakeholders as well as the university community through his mantra: \u201cThe path to social and economic development in the state of Massachusetts runs through the University of Massachusetts.\u201d Participants at each campus sought to resolve this image with the individual identity of their institution. With regard to organization and structure, a key finding was that collaborative models were increasingly important, and coordinating mechanisms were more important than positions, titles, or departments for facilitating such collaborative models. With regard to the activities undertaken by institutions in support of economic engagement goals, an important finding was that there were differential emphases on inputs, processes, and outcomes among campuses when participants described their economic engagement efforts. This finding provides an opportunity to examine how different campuses and campus identities relate to views on economic engagement activities. \n\nBased on the findings of this dissertation study, propositions for further research and institutional policies and practices related to economic engagement are offered. Recommendations for further research focus not only on deeper examination of the rhetoric, structure, and activities that comprise the Intramural EEI, but also a closer look at the kinds of connections and linkages that are necessary to establish and maintain the interface. Ideas presented related to institutional policy and practice emphasize a campus-level focus on developing definitions and narratives related to economic engagement, and a focus on establishing coordinating mechanisms rather than centralization mechanisms. The propositions and recommendations can support ongoing research as well as policy development in university-engaged economic development.

The High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) is a second-generation extensive air shower detector that primarily observes very high-energy (VHE) photons, where VHE is defined as hundreds of GeV to hundreds of TeV. HAWC is built near the peak of Sierra Negra in Mexico at an altitude of 4100m. The high altitude allows the detector to observe air showers when more information is available for reconstruction. Due to its wide field of view (~2 sr) and high duty cycle (>90%), the HAWC observatory is sensitive to gamma rays in the sub-TeV to TeV energy range and can constrain the shape and cutoff of high-energy GRB spectra, especially in conjunction with observations from other detectors such as the Fermi LAT satellite. We present a likelihood-based search for VHE emission from the Fermi LAT GRBs that occurred in the field of view of HAWC during the last two years of its construction.

Although virus filters remove viruses primarily on the basis of size, the extent of virus retention can vary significantly over the course of the filtration or in response to changes in operating conditions.  Several studies have reported a significant decline in virus retention during constant pressure virus filtration with certain filters.  More recently, limited experiments showed that a temporary release in the transmembrane pressure caused a significant increase in transmission of both porcine parvovirus (PPV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV).  However, there is currently no detailed understanding of the factors controlling this phenomenon or the underlying physical basis for the observed increase in transmission.\n    The objective of this work was to obtain quantitative data for the effects of a pressure release on filtration of a model bacteriophage through the Ultipor DV20 membrane.  In addition, confocal microscopy was employed to visualize the capture of fluorescently labeled bacteriophage within the membrane.  Results showed a transient increase in bacteriophage transmission by approximately a factor of 10 (one log) immediately after the pressure release, with the transmission then decreasing back to a value similar to that in a control experiment.

Traditional, vertically-structured government institutions are now inadequate to solve the \u201chorizontal problems\u201d they face.  The Department of Defense (DoD), one of many public organizations, has long faced challenges trying to solve complex, horizontal problems in the national security realm.  Traditional service (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine) solutions to military problems have long been unacceptable.  This condition precipitated the 1986 landmark national security legislation known as the Goldwater-Nichols Act (GNA).  Recent changes in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2005 modified the GNA mandates and changed policy regarding how DoD conducts joint professional military education for its senior military officers.  The policy\u2019s intent focused on further enhancing joint acculturation\u2014the desired change in cultural behavior and thinking of senior officers from each of the services through contact with officers from the other services\u2014through changes in DoD\u2019s senior service colleges for their resident students.  The U.S. Army War College, one of DoD\u2019s schools and the focus of this study, entered its inaugural year of the policy\u2019s implementation as it transitioned to the new structure in Academic Year (AY) 2006.\nIdentity theory provided a useful framework to assess the impact these changes had on the students attending the U.S. Army War College.  Both the sociological (macro) and social psychological (micro) literature on identity theory were used to establish the theoretical foundation for this study.  In addition to the identity theory literature, numerous Goldwater-Nichols Act studies are reviewed and gaps in the research identified.\nThe identity theory foundation was used to study the impact organizational change, stemming from the NDAA 2005 mandates, had on the U.S. Army War College resident class in 2006.  A mixed-methods study was designed to test four hypotheses to measure the effect the organizational changes in professional military education had on the identity, commitment, interorganizational perceptions, and behavior of the resident students.  298 students were invited to respond to one of two surveys.  The usable responses, amounting to 57%, were used to inform the quantitative analysis with sixty-one interviews conducted providing the basis for qualitative analysis in testing the four hypotheses.\nIn assessing the impact the organizational changes had on joint acculturation, the study determined that the changes did have a positive impact on some students\u2019 identities as well as positive shifts in student perceptions of service members from other services.  The study also found, that while changes in identity and interorganizational perceptions were malleable, changes in commitment were more stable and less adaptable in response to organizational changes.  In addition, the study found behavioral changes demonstrated significant results, but in directions not predicted by identity theory.\nAlthough the findings of this study advance the body of knowledge with regard to the impact organizational change can have on the identity, commitment, interorganizational perceptions, and behavior of its members, gaps still remain.  The study\u2019s design, although appropriate for conditions pertinent to the U.S. Army War College, can be improved and used not only to better assess the impacts changes like these have on similar public organizations (i.e. other senior service colleges), but can also be used to assess the impact similar change strategies have in other public organizations.  Such studies can assess the impact legislative, policy, and/or organizational changes have on vertical organizations\u2019 efforts to better achieve horizontal solutions in today\u2019s complex, interdependent world.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2042], "author_name_tesi": "Woods, III, George J", "last_name_ssi": "Woods, III", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "George", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Public Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Truman Ziegenfuss Jr.", "Stephen Patrick Schappe", "Frances T.

Estrogen hormones, one class of EDCs have been found to elicit a feminization effect in male aquatic organisms, and some studies have documented a near collapse of certain species as a result. To better understand estrogen behavior in the environment, numerous laboratory studies have focused on estrogen interactions with solid and solution matrices. Though, to date, most of these studies have been conducted on soils in the laboratory spiked with a known estrogen, and few studies have been done on field soils that have been amended with animal and/or human waste. \n     The main goal of this study was to increase understanding of estrogen behaviors in the environment by sampling soils that have been amended with 25+ years of wastewater effluent application at Penn State\u2019s Living Filter site. Three estrogen hormones, two natural (estrone and 17\u03b2-estradiol) and one synthetic (17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol), were analyzed. In order to quantify estrogen concentrations and accumulation in the field soils, two preliminary objectives were evaluated: (1) the determination of an estrogen extraction procedure that identified method parameters yielding the largest maximum estrogen recoveries, and (2) the characterization of estrogen sorptive behavior.\nFor the first objective, recoveries were established for the following parameters: optimal extractant, length of extraction time, number of extractions, storage method and length of time in designated storage method. Looking at three solvents: EA, DCM and MeOH, whether in pure form or in a 50/50 solvent/water ratio, MeOH yielded the highest mass recoveries (>70%). HPLC and LC-MS-MS results supported the use of a 1 hr extraction time period, and HPLC results showed that for all three estrogens all of the mas recovered appeared in the first extraction only. The LC-MS-MS results showed that for all three estrogens multiple extractions did recover additional mass (~20%). To increase mass recoveries, future extraction methodology should consider using a second extraction. Similar recoveries were obtained whether samples were stored in the refrigerator or the freezer (40-81%), suggesting that either storage method would be appropriate for samples waiting to be extracted. The amount of sample storage time has a greater effect on estrogen recovery than the actual storage method; recoveries tended to decrease between 1 week and 1 month of storage. \n     For the second objective, estrogen sorption data was fit with a linear model. Kd values tended to increase with an increase in equilibration time. Average Kd values from the 192 hour linear graphs were used to calculate Koc and log Koc. Calculated results for Koc were comparable to reported literature values: 3.06, 3.02 and 3.17 for 17\u03b2-estradiol, estrone and 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol, respectively. Estrogen recoveries varied depending on equilibration time and hormone being analyzed. Recoveries tended to decrease as much as 13% with an increase in equilibration time from 24 to 192 hours. \n     Measured estrogen concentrations in the wastewater effluent ranged from 5-13 ng/L for 17\u03b2-estradiol, 11-29 ng/L for estrone and 0-11 ng/L for 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol. Using the highest measured effluent concentration for each hormone, the maximum possible application amounts were calculated. Results comparing the calculated storage values to the maximum possible application showed that (1) natural background could be a source of 17\u03b2-estradiol and estrone at the Living Filter site, (2) degradation of 17\u03b2-estradiol to estrone could be occurring at the site and/or (3) there is accumulation of 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol occurring in the non-irrigated areas, but this accumulation is unexplainable at this time.\n     Results from the preliminary work were used to address the primary project objective: quantification of all three estrogens in the effluent irrigated field soils. Results from the field study showed that irrigation had some effect on EC and pH, for both variables, measured values were higher in soils that had been irrigated. The application of effluent also affected estrone and 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol concentrations in the soil, both estrogens were found in higher concentrations in the non-irrigated site, 4.13 and 1.11 ng/cm3 respectively, than in the irrigated areas. Estrone and 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol concentrations also increased between a two day and three week sampling time events. 17\u03b2-estradiol concentrations were similar in the irrigated and non-irrigated sites, and slightly decreased between the 2 day and 3 week sampling events. Measured estrogen concentrations from soils collected at different land uses showed no clear difference.  \n     Laboratory studies fail to capture some of the complexities seen in the natural environment. There is a need for an increase in field soil sampling analyses. This will help better characterize estrogen mobility and degradation in the environment. Future studies should focus on establishing natural background concentrations for estrogens. Quantifying these background levels will help determine whether land and water management practices are contributing to the increase in estrogen presence in the environment.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7712], "author_name_tesi": "Woodward, Emily Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Woodward", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Earl Watson", "Patrick Joseph Drohan", "Herschel Adams Elliott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Earl Watson, Thesis Advisor", "Patrick Joseph Drohan, Thesis Advisor", "Herschel Adams Elliott, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Estrogen transport", "Effluent irrigation", "Sorption", "Estrogen extraction methodology"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Optimization of estrogen analyses and quantification of environmental samples from Pennsylvania water systems", "id": "27604", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11976", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The increase in the presence of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting hormones (EDCs) in the environment has had a direct impact on aquatic organisms in the environment. Estrogen hormones, one class of EDCs, have been quantified in natural soil and water systems at concentrations as low as parts per trillion (ng L-1). The presence of three estrogen compounds in particular, estrone (E1), 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), and 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol (EE2), have been linked to human and animal waste disposal methods including land application of manure, wastewater irrigation, leaking septic systems, and direct stream discharge of wastewater effluent. To better understand estrogen behavior in the environment, numerous laboratory studies have focused on estrogen interactions with solid and solution matrices. \nThe goals of this dissertation were to (1) determine an optimal estrogen extraction solvent that yielded the largest E1, E2, and EE2 recovery percentages, (2) optimize separation of ten estrogen and estrogenic compounds using different stationary and mobile phase combinations and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), (3) characterize E1, E2, and EE2 sorption in soils varying in organic carbon content and in sorption systems where pure water was used to equilibrate soils versus effluent,  and (4) evaluate the possible presence of E1, E2, and EE2 in two different geographic regions within Pennsylvania: the Sinnemahoning Creek Watershed and the Penn State Living Filter Wastewater Irrigation Site\n\nFor the first objective, four organic solvents and three solid phase extraction (SPE) loading ratios were evaluated in order to determine an optimal method to extract estrogens from an agricultural soil (1.09 %TOC).  Solvents used to extract the soil included methanol (MeOH), dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EA) and 50:50 MeOH:DCM. The three SPE loading ratios tested were 0:100, 5:95, and 10:90 MeOH:water. This study also tested different soil sterilization methods to see if sterilization had any effect on estrogen recoveries from soil: sodium azide (NaN3) at varying concentrations (100, 250 and 350 mg L-1) and autoclaving. Extraction results indicated that either a MeOH extraction combined with an SPE procedure that uses a 10:90 MeOH:water loading ratio or a DCM extraction would be the optimal method. These methods yielded extraction recoveries ranging from 25.76 to 39.54%. Results from the microbial inhibition study indicated that out of the two inhibition methods tested, autoclaving the soil is the optimal soil sterilization method; autoclaving yielded the highest estrogen recoveries.\n\nFor the second objective, standard solutions containing ten estrogenic compounds were separated using six different stationary phase and mobile phase combinations. Three stationary phases were evaluated, C18, biphenyl, and RP-Amide, and two mobile phase organic modifiers were evaluated, ACN and MeOH. Results indicated that the combination of C18 and ACN provided the greatest separation. When C18 and ACN were used to analyze the combined standard there were no issues associated with peak co-elution. \n\nFor the third objective, results indicated that sorption varied between E1, E2, and EE2 and between the three soils studied. Partition coefficient values, Kd and Kf, increased with an increase in soil organic carbon concentration and vice versa, and for the most part, the organic carbon normalized Koc values also indicated that partitioning to organic carbon in the soil was the key sorption mechanism. The rank in sorption from highest to lowest for all three soils was E1 > E2 > EE2. When wastewater was used to equilibrate the cropped B soil, estrogen sorption did decrease as was expected. Extraction recovery of each estrogen decreased when the soil organic carbon content increased. \n\nFinally, E1, E2, and EE2 baseline data was established for the Penn State Living Filter wastewater irrigation site, and the Sinnemahoning Creek Watershed. At the Living Filter, all three compounds were detected in groundwater well samples. However, all three estrogens were not quantified. E1 was quantified in all fourteen wells, E2 was only quantified in one well on site, and in all fourteen wells, concentrations of EE2 were either not detected (ND) or were quantified in trace amounts (T). In the Sinnemahoning Creek Watershed, both E1 and E2 were detected in the water samples. However, while E1 was quantified in all but one location (ranging from 9.86 to 37.11 ng L-1); E2 was quantified in only two of the twenty locations (23.02 and 32.47 ng L-1). The synthetic estrogen, EE2, was below instrument detection limits (ND) in all samples. \n\nFindings from this dissertation can be used to improve upon the current methodology used to extract and analyze environmental samples for estrogen hormones, increase our understanding of how estrogens interact with soil and water environments, and better predict transport of estrogen compounds in the environment. Overall, this information can be used to ensure that the sustainability of soil and water environments is maintained, especially in areas where waste sources are being used to fertilize and irrigate crops and recharge groundwater supplies. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11415], "author_name_tesi": "Woodward, Emily Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Woodward", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Earl Watson", "Patrick Joseph Drohan", "Herschel Adams Elliott", "Franklin Lewis Dorman Jr.", "Dr Clinton Williams"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Earl Watson, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick Joseph Drohan, Committee Member", "Herschel Adams Elliott, Committee Member", "Franklin Lewis Dorman Jr., Committee Member", "Dr Clinton Williams, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Estrogen Hormones", "Soils", "Effluent", "Sorption"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Aluminum Cluster Anion Reactivity: Applications in Energetic Materials and Catalysts\n\n", "id": "12336", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6515", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The research presented in this dissertation focuses on the size-selective properties of aluminum clusters and their applications in catalysis and energetic materials.

The folk imaginary that American folklorists and fiction writers drew from and contributed to consists of an array of representations, attitudes, languages, symbols, myths, and stereotypes that was dynamic, evolving, fiercely contested, persistent, and potent, influencing the dominant culture\u2019s conception of the folk and of race and ethnicity.\n\nThe pressures for preservation and reform were negotiated by Alice Callahan, William Jones, and Zitkala \u0160a\u2014the Native American writers considered in the first chapter\u2014who could not argue for the continuation of Indian lifeways and worldviews without also contesting the government\u2019s assimilation policies, allotment laws, vicious massacres, and bureaucratic corruption. The dominant society\u2019s representation of Appalachian people as peculiar and primitive is analyzed in the second chapter, which claims that Rebecca Harding Davis and Olive Tilford Dargan portrayed mountain people not as dependent and backward, but as refuge-providers, reformers, tellers of history, and participants in modernity. As Native American writers reformulated programs of assimilation and Americanization, and as Appalachian writers critiqued similar \u201cmountain work\u201d campaigns, so African American writers like Frances Watkins Harper and James Weldon Johnson challenged uplift ideologies and initiatives.

Selective emitters are highly\u2013doped regions beneath front metal contacts which enhance collection, shield contacts from minority carriers, and lower device series resistance for an overall increase in device efficiency. Between the metal contacts, low doping is desirable to increase lifetime and blue-response. \nLaser processing with high-power, fast repetition rate lasers makes fast throughput and production adaptation feasible. By using lasers, selected areas or regions on cell surfaces can be heavily doped while maintaining light doping between these contact areas.

These Developmentally Appropriate Symbols (DAS) were then compared with a commercially available graphic symbol system (Picture Communication Symbols [PCS]) for accuracy of identification and identified preference with young children. Forty, typically developing 2 \u00bd to 3 \u00bd -year-old children received a brief training in either of the two different types of representation systems: (a) DAS and (b) PCS. Following the training session, the participants were assessed using a symbol identification task and a preference task. \nChildren in the DAS condition correctly identified more symbols than children trained with the PCS symbols. With regard to preference, there was no evidence of a preference between the symbol sets; the children were most likely to select as preferred the symbol system for which they had not received training, suggesting that novelty may have had an influence on young children\u2019s stated preferences. The results provide evidence that the representations of early emerging concepts that are based on children\u2019s reported conceptualizations may significantly improve identification performance.

This unexpected recall would catapult an unknown company into the headlines of newspapers throughout the global community and soon spark a chain of recalls, specifically of products with the label \u2018Made-in-China.\u2019 This dissertation adopted a transnational framework and conducted an international comparative content analysis of press releases and news stories disseminated during the Menu Foods recall. \nAnalysis of the press releases disseminated during the pet food recall revealed organizations predominantly adopted excuses and defense of innocence strategies to protect their images. When it came to how organizations presented the situation to media outlets, practitioners highlighted the issue of responsibility. Furthermore, the press releases used the conflict frame by criticizing other organizations, and drawing attention to the economic aspects of the recall. \nComparison of the news sources in domestic, international and U.S. ethnic newspapers indicated experts and government officials dominated the coverage of the recall, ultimately leading to the disappearance of the corporate voices. Regarding the selection of frames by the various newspapers during the recall, the most frequently used frames were attribution of responsibility, conflict, and economic. The framing process suggest journalists shifted the focus from the actual events to the political issues that resulted from the distribution of tainted food products, specifically the issues surrounding U.S. and China relations and the effects of globalization. Based on the findings, it appears the country\u2019s role in the crisis, geographical proximity, and the nature of the crisis may  have influenced the selection of frames during the recall. \nOverall, the findings demonstrated a strong relationship between the way organizations framed the unfolding crisis and frames selected by domestic international and ethnic newspapers, specifically when it comes to the way the situation was being framed for the readers. However, the findings indicated organizations were not effective in getting journalists to adopt their image restoration strategies. \nThis dissertation offers both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, this dissertation provides evidence that the agenda-building process does not only apply to political campaign coverage but can be extended to corporate crisis situations, specifically the way the crisis is being presented. Additionally, this dissertation extends the research scope of the current literature on ethnic media by providing insights into the similarities and differences Chinese ethnic newspaper share with American and Chinese newspapers.\nThe practical implications for public relations practitioners include taking into consideration the organization\u2019s perceived involvement in the crisis in order to select appropriate image restoration strategies. Additionally, organizations may benefit from taking a closer look at the media coverage during a crisis, domestically and internationally. From the journalists\u2019 perspective, the findings reaffirm that during a crisis situation, newspapers heavily rely on government officials and experts for information. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6539], "author_name_tesi": "Worawongs, Worapron Tina", "last_name_ssi": "Worawongs", "middle_name_ssi": "Tina", "first_name_ssi": "Worapron", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Amit Schejter", "Amit Schejter", "Colleen Connolly Ahern", "Bu Zhong", "Roxanne Louise Parrott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Amit Schejter, Dissertation Advisor", "Amit Schejter, Committee Chair", "Colleen Connolly Ahern, Committee Chair", "Bu Zhong, Committee Member", "Roxanne Louise Parrott, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ethnic media", "nationalism", "globalization", "news coverage", "image restoration strategies", "crisis", "framing", "comparative study", "Content analysis", "agenda-building", "press releases", "headlines", "news sources", "China", "United States", "Canada", "Media Systems", "geographical proximity"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The development of L2 writing teachers' pedagogical content knowledge in teaching activity", "id": "26218", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11690", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the field of TESOL, research in teacher cognition has contributed to a better understanding of teachers\u2019 mental lives and how they influence their teaching practices (Freeman & Johnson, 1998), yet little of this research has focused on L2 writing teachers (Borg, 2006). As a result, we know relatively little about the mental lives of L2 writing teachers (Hirvela & Belcher, 2007; Lee 2010), including what knowledge they possess and how they draw on and develop this knowledge in teaching practice. Furthermore, though the general education literature has theorized a bi-directional relationship between teacher knowledge and teacher reasoning (Shulman, 1987), this relationship has not been adequately researched (Hashweh, 2005).

TNBC accounts for approximately 15% of all breast cancers diagnosed worldwide, and frequently affects younger women, women of color, and those from lower socioeconomic countries. TNBC has an increased likelihood of recurrence and a twofold greater mortality risk compared to other types of breast cancer, as well as a tendency to metastasize outside the breast. The financial burden for patients with TNBC is considerable, as costs are increased by 50% compared to other breast cancers.\nThe median survival rate for patients with metastatic TNBC is only 13 months. Lack of hormone receptors and frequent de novo or acquired chemotherapy resistance renders almost all therapies ineffective. Thus, there is a critical need to develop TNBC treatments that target the underlying biology of tumor growth. A novel biological pathway has been studied in a wide variety of human cancers that may provide knowledge on progression of TNBC and serve as an effective treatment. \n\nThe opioid growth factor \u2013 opioid growth factor receptor axis is a determinant of cell proliferation in both normal cells and neoplasia. OGF inhibits cell proliferation by upregulating the cyclin dependent inhibitory kinases p16 and p21, arresting cells in the transition from G0/G1 phase to S phase of the cell cycle and halting DNA synthesis. \nThe proposed experiments investigated the presence of the OGF-OGFr axis in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo and assessed whether expression of peptide or receptor changes with cancer progression, and whether OGF serves as an effective treatment for TNBC. For cell culture studies, log phase cells were compared with confluent and post-confluent cultures to mimic early and advanced stages of cancer growth. \n\nSemi-quantitative immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis comparing log phase and confluent cells, as well as small and large tumors, revealed that both OGF and its receptor are significantly reduced in advanced stages of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, as well as ovarian, cancers. These observations were extended and confirmed in human breast cancer using MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines grown in vitro and in vivo. A mechanism of action involving OGF inhibition of growth was demonstrated utilizing BrdU incorporation that indicated a decrease in DNA synthesis in TNBC cells treated with OGF. Confluent cells were less responsive to OGF treatment than log phase cells. \n\nThe data suggest that OGFr expression is reduced in TNBC with tumor progression, and that tumor progression may lead to deficits in the OGF-OGFr axis. Nonetheless, OGF was shown to significantly decrease cell growth relative to controls, indicating its potential as an effective biological treatment for TNBC. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10594], "author_name_tesi": "Worley, Beth Lorraine", "last_name_ssi": "Worley", "middle_name_ssi": "Lorraine", "first_name_ssi": "Beth", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia J Mc Laughlin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia J Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["triple negative breast cancer", "breast cancer", "MDA-MB-231", "MCF-7", "opioid growth factor", "OGF", "opioid growth factor receptor", "OGFr"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Comparing the Coverage of Virtual Marches and Hacktivism Over Sixteen Years: A Qualitative Frame Analysis of News Discourse", "id": "28606", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12234", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using a combination of qualitative frame and discourse analysis methods, this research analyzes sixteen total years of news coverage related to the online direct action tactics of virtual march and hacktivism.

The findings of this research suggest that despite being different in their contentious nature, the external attention these two protest tactics have received in the form of news discourse serves to delegitimize, marginalize and stigmatize participants and movements, as well as the online direct action tactics they employ.

However, a better understanding of the dynamic structural behavior of these products is necessary if optimal utilization of their structural characteristics is to be realized.  An effective model of floor system dynamic response would provide an important tool for effective and efficient serviceability criteria.  Such criteria are critical tools for engineers to develop floor system designs with acceptable dynamic performance.  However, models rely on experimental data, and, as such, rely on the quality and precision of that experimental data.  The development of tools to provide high quality data input to these methods, in the form of careful data acquisition system design and signal processing technique development and implementation, is a first step in and essential to the effective and efficient implementation of these model development techniques.\n\nThe objectives of this study were to: (1) accurately measure and record the vertical and horizontal responses of an I-joist based wood floor system, (2) utilize existing or develop new signal processing techniques to maximize the quality of the experimental data, (3) perform both time and frequency domain modal analyses, and (4) experimentally evaluate the lateral bracing effects of overall system response.\n\nAn experimental program evaluated the free response of four I-joist floor specimens, each without any lateral bracing applied to the joists and each with three levels of lateral bracing, to impact loading.  Impact force and accelerations at the joist bottom flanges were measured in two directions.  Measurements were taken at the center point of the floor, the \u00bc-points of the center joist, and midspan of an outboard joist.  Measurements were recorded and processed using a package of tools assembled from existing techniques with the inclusion of a novel data set selection technique.  This technique reduced the data set size and reduced noise levels without altering the data set and without prior knowledge of system response.  Bias correction via the moving average, normalization, and zero padding were used to optimize the input file for the frequency domain analysis.\n\nThe frequency domain analysis was based on the frequency response function (FRF) and estimates of natural frequency, corresponding modal magnitude, damping, and response linearity were determined.  Inspection of graphic data, simple statistics, and ANOVA were used to discover patterns and correlations in the data.\n\nThe frequency domain analysis did not rise to the level of a modal analysis and the time domain modal analysis was not implemented.  Despite considerable effort, convergence was never achieved with the modal analyses.  The lack of convergence may likely be due to the higher than expected levels of floor system damping and non-linearity.\n\nThe effectiveness of lateral bracing at the joist mid-span was also evaluated.  Four bracing conditions: baseline (no bracing added), solid blocking, tension strap, and solid blocking with a tension strap were examined.\n\nThe average experimental first vertical natural frequency of the floor was 24.8 Hz with a high degree of confidence for all bracing treatments.  Of the vertical response, only the magnitude associated with the first natural frequency was dependent on test factors, namely the measurement location.  For the horizontal responses, both first natural frequency and the corresponding magnitude were strongly dependent on bracing treatment.  No apparent link between the horizontal and vertical responses was found in the frequency and magnitude data.  However, the nonlinearity of the vertical response increased as the bracing level increased.\n\nDamping was evaluated for the first vertical natural frequency and found to range between 3 and 6 percent.  Linearity was tested.  In all test cases, the response from ten repetitions of the same test varied from the mean response by more than \u00b12.5 percent of the mean.  Overall, 48 test cases varied from the mean by \u00b12.5 to \u00b15.0 percent of the mean and 80 tests varied more than \u00b15.0 percent from the mean.  This level of variability in the response with respect to excitation arguably violates the linearity assumption of normalization, the FFT, and the FRF.  The level of damping is also near the limit of what can be classified as lightly damped.\n\nBased on the results of this study, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) the test procedures and the experimental apparatus employed in this study were adequate and provided high quality initial data, (2)the signal conditioning modules were effective in reducing errors and otherwise improving the quality of data sets, (3)the novel data set selection module successfully selected appropriate data subsets while reducing the noise content without distorting the frequency or magnitude of the signal and with no resolution limitations, (4) the observed lateral response of the I-joists to impact excitation was significant (p<0.05) in magnitude, (5) There was no discernable pattern in the spacing between the first and second vertical natural frequencies, but the spacing between the first and second horizontal natural frequencies increased with the addition of bracing, (6) there was a weak interaction between the vertical response and lateral bracing treatments as indicated by the increase in non-linearity of the vertical response with the addition of bracing\n\nFurther research into the impact of lateral responses on overall floor system response is warranted.  Future efforts to develop an experimental model of system response must consider non-linear and more heavily damped response.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5647], "author_name_tesi": "Worley, Stacy Kenneth", "last_name_ssi": "Worley", "middle_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "first_name_ssi": "Stacy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harvey Bright Manbeck", "John Jack Janowiak", "Virendra Puri", "Joseph Irudayaraj"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harvey Bright Manbeck, Committee Chair", "John Jack Janowiak, Committee Member", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member", "Joseph Irudayaraj, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dynamic testing", "dynamic analysis", "signal processing", "wood structures", "I-joist", "structural vibration"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Immigrant Integration In New US Destinations: The Prevalence, Function, And Networks Of Informal Work", "id": "13691ejw224", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13691", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Starting in the early 1990s, immigration settlement patterns in the United States underwent an unprecedented shift. For a variety of reasons, immigrants, primarily from Mexico and Latin America, who had traditionally settled in five states began to disperse more widely throughout the entire country. Relatively suddenly, cities and small towns that had little previous experience with immigration saw significant increases in their Latino immigrant populations, and Hispanic populations in many of these places have continued to grow since. Not only did this open a new area of research \u2013 new Hispanic destinations \u2013 but it also threw into question much of what sociologists understood about assimilation and integration. This research contributes to both bodies of research by using the informal work as a proxy for the assimilation process of Latino immigrants in new, U.S. destinations. Moreover, by considering the development and use of networks of informal work, this research also relies heavily upon, and contributes to, the literature in both informal work and social networks.  \n\nBecause there is no one source of data that can speak directly to the complicated and evolving sociological phenomena of interest, this paper uses a three-paper dissertation format and employs a mixed-methods approach. The first paper uses national-level survey data on informal work to examine the role of this work in U.S. households generally. The second paper looks at the formal economic integration of Latinos in traditional and several categories of new destinations using the U.S. Census and American Community Survey data. The final paper uses a case study to examine the inter- and co-ethnic networks of informal work in a new, rural Hispanic destination in Oregon. \n\nBeing positioned at the nexus of multiple established literatures and theory \u2013 assimilation and integration, new destination migration, informal work, and social networks \u2013 this research has the ability to contribute not only to a better understanding of each of these areas separately, but also to how they interact with one another in a way that has not been considered in the past. Findings highlight the role of informal work as a potential protection against poverty and its non-economic community building role, and they call into question the understanding that participation in informal work relies on labor force attachment and having a \u201cgood job.\u201d These findings also show that returns to work and human capital are lower in rural communities and nonmetropolitan new destinations for both Latinos and non-Hispanic whites, which may make the reliance on informal work more important, but may also slow assimilation. Several policy responses are suggested, including formalizing the system of informal work, addressing inequality in rural communities, and assisting in the assimilation process and community response to changing demographics in new destinations.

Alternatively, a_i, can be specified through a transport equation that provides a dynamic prediction of the interfacial area concentration through mechanistic models for bubble coalescence and breakup. Therefore, the focus of the present study is on the implementation and assessment of the interfacial area transport equation (IATE) into the nuclear reactor system analysis code TRACE.  \n\tAvailable TRACE frameworks are reviewed focusing on the constitutive relations for the interfacial area concentration.

With this in mind, the two-group IATE is derived in detail to establish new expansion source terms that correctly account for the effects of intergroup bubble transport. In addition to this theoretical effort, the state-of-the-art four-sensor conductivity probe is used to establish a reliable experimental database of local two-phase flow parameters to characterize one-group to two-group transition flows and to support model development.

Wake-dominated bubble transport characterizes the transition from one-group to two-group flows. Therefore, the necessary intergroup and intragroup wake entrainment source terms that are required for two-group interfacial area transport in transition flows are developed. Furthermore, an approach is developed to initiate the shearing-off source and reduce the one-group interaction mechanisms as an established two-group flow develops.

The model accurately captures the exchange of void fraction and interfacial area concentration between group-I and group-II in transition flows. Overall, the group-I void fraction and interfacial area concentration are predicted within \u00b16% and \u00b14%, respectively, of the experimental data.

National agricultural policies in particular have led to an environment in which unhealthy food items such as grain are overproduced, and fruits and vegetables are under- produced, thereby influencing consumer purchasing behaviors and the obesity epidemic. Many organizations interested in public health have thus disseminated promotional messages designed to persuade readers that agricultural policies negatively impact food related topics, including the obesity epidemic, the local food movement, and food aid in order to decrease voter support for renewal of these policies. While these messages may intend to persuade readers, little evidence exists suggesting the use of persuasion theories in their design. Language Expectancy Theory (LET) provides a useful framework to do so.\nFormative research was used to identify pre-existing 2012 Farm Bill promotional messages, to analyze them based on theoretical components derived from LET, and to construct theoretical variations of the stimulus messages. A pilot study was conducted with undergraduate students to further derive the messages. A 4 x 4 x 2 between-subjects posttest design was used to empirically test the persuasive outcomes of theoretically derived versions of messages related to the Farm Bill and food topics.\nPreliminary data analysis found that the manipulations of the theoretical message components based on LET were successful. Results revealed marginal support for the expectations of language use posited by LET, and data on perceptions of actual language used suggested that participants perceived that females were using more intense language whether the language they actually used was more intense or not. Some support was obtained for LET derived hypotheses. There were no significant findings suggesting LET components play a role in messages with more than one author; however, some support was found for the role of organizational credibility.\nThese results suggest marginal support for the enduring expectations of language use posited by LET, yet many of the LET derived hypotheses were unsupported. The lack of support for the sociological expectations and violations in the theory may stem from the fact that this study provides one of the first examinations of LET in the textual setting or that expectations of language use have change since the theory\u2019s inception. This study did not find support for results on LET and messages with multiple authors; however, initial results suggest that LET may be expanded to include propositions based on organizational credibility.

One means through which they may enact such influence is through sharing health information. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the question: Does a midlife adult\u2019s perception of responsibility to share health information about the benefits of outdoor physical activity with their overweight or obese child/aging parent in the near future influence their intentions to do so? In order to investigate this question, this dissertation conceptualizes responsibility and posits that attributions of solution, obligation, and agency influence responsibility. Responsibility from the Norm Activation Model (NAM) is then situated within the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and its extensions the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Integrative Model (IM) to extend these rational-choice frameworks into the moral domain. The indirect effects of perceptions of responsibility on intentions to share health information via anticipated emotions, including anticipated regret, guilt, pride, and hope, as well as physical activity mavenism, are also considered. Finally, this dissertation investigates potential iatrogenic effects of perceptions of responsibility, including regret, guilt, self-blame, and obesity stigma beliefs.\n\tParticipants (N = 334) were recruited from Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk. After providing informed consent, participants read a brief message about the benefits of outdoor exercise for young adults (those in the adult child condition) or older adults (those in the aging parent condition). Participants then completed measures for the theoretical variables of interest. Bivariate correlations and structural equation modeling using the hybrid approach was used to test the hypotheses and research questions.\n\tResults indicated that attributions of solution and agency predict a midlife adult\u2019s perceptions of responsibility to share information about the benefits of outdoor physical activity with a child or aging parent. Perceptions of responsibility were also positively related to generative concern and negatively related to psychological reactance. Attitudes and responsibility significantly predicted a midlife adult\u2019s intentions to share information. Responsibility significantly predicted anticipated regret, guilt, pride, and hope, but these anticipated emotions did not predict information sharing intentions. Likewise, responsibility significantly predicted mavenism, but mavenism did not predict information sharing intentions.\n\tThe results from this dissertation have important theoretical and practical implications. First, the results on predictors of responsibility provide an important step in contributing to the theoretical design of responsibility messages. To increase a midlife adult\u2019s perceptions of responsibility to share health information with a family member, health messages should focus on content cues that elicit attributions of solution, particularly for those sharing health information with an aging parent. Second, the results of this dissertation support the theoretical integration of responsibility from the NAM with the TRA/TPB/IM frameworks to predict intentions to perform a behavior that impact\u2019s another\u2019s welfare. Variables from each significantly predicted information sharing intentions, including attitudes from the TRA/TPB/IM and responsibility from the NAM. Responsibility was the strongest predictor of information sharing intentions, which suggests that perceptions of responsibility should be integrated into communication theories on information sharing. Third, this dissertation has important implications for theoretical advancement within intergenerational communication, as it underscores specific cognitions and beliefs (i.e., attitudes and responsibility) that lead midlife adults to enter into intergenerational contact with their family members.\n\tThe contributions of this dissertation to communication science should be considered in light of several limitations. The sample was not representative of the general population, and thus future work should endeavor to recruit a more diverse participant sample. Additionally, the study design was limited by the cross-sectional, observational nature of the data, the measures used, and the lack of replication. Future work should thus attempt to replicate these findings, as well as study the relationships proposed in this dissertation with a longitudinal or experimental design.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14439], "author_name_tesi": "Worthington, Amber Kelly", "last_name_ssi": "Worthington", "middle_name_ssi": "Kelly", "first_name_ssi": "Amber", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jon F.

In order to understand these biochemical processes it is vital to comprehend the mechanism of macromolecular interactions via two key characteristics: structure and dynamics.  I chose to investigate fast dynamics on two systems which were already structurally characterized: the processing of microRNAs (miRNAs) precursors by dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) in humans and the intrinsically disordered protein FCP1 binding to RAP74, which is involved in termination of transcription and recycling of RNA polymerase II.\n  miRNAs, a large class of small ssRNAs, are involved in gene regulation by base-pairing with messenger RNA (mRNA).  Maturation of miRNAs occurs in two independent and spatially separated steps.  In the nucleus, the ssRNA tail of primary miRNA is cleaved by the \u201cmicroprocessor\u201d, which is composed of a RNase III enzyme (Drosha) and its cofactor (DGCR8).  Next, the precursor miRNA is exported to the cytosol, and the terminal loop is cleaved by another RNase III enzyme (Dicer), which is aided by a cofactor (either TRBP or PACT).  Afterwards, the miRNA is loaded into the argonaute (Ago) protein generating the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).  Maturation of miRNA is accomplished by total of ten dsRBDs over five proteins in the pathway.  This dissertation specifically focuses on understanding the fast dynamics of four of them: DGCR8-dsRBD1, DGCR8-dsRBD2, Drosha-dsRBD and Dicer-dsRBD.\nThe dsRBD is one of the most common RNA-binding motifs, found in all organisms and in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.  The dsRBD forms an \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 topology, where the two \u03b1-helices lie on one face of three anti-parallel \u03b2-strands, with the other surface of the sheet being solvent exposed.  The preferred binding partner of dsRBDs is A-form double-helix RNA, where a minimum of 11 base pairs of dsRNA interact with a dsRBD generally without sequence specific RNA interactions.\n  A dynamic profile was obtained for the dsRBDs through MD simulations and NMR spin relaxation along with binding assays to determine functionality of the dsRBDs.  To start, the two dsRBDs in tandem from DGCR8 were explored through MD simulations (chapter 2), motivated by the pre-organization observed in crystal and verified by preliminary NMR data.  The results demonstrate that correlated motions impacting the conformation of the RNA-binding surface are mediated by a few interfacial interactions.  Next, MD simulations in connection with NMR spin relaxation experiments were performed on Drosha-dsRBD, DGCR8-dsRBD1, and Dicer-dsRBD (chapter 3 and 4) revealing a dynamic profile where loop 2 is dynamic in all dsRBDS.  Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) of the dsRBDs showed that isolated Drosha-dsRBD is the only dsRBD studied that does not bind dsRNA, which is attributed to Drosha-dsRBD having increased flexibility in loop 1.  Together, the data illustrates that flexibility in loop 2 of the dsRBDs allows for binding of dsRNA, but flexibility in loop 1 hinders binding.\n  To further study macromolecular interactions via MD simulations, the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of FCP1 bound to the winged helix domain of RAP74 was investigated.  Unlike ordered protein complexes, which involve polar interactions over a small fraction of the protein surface, disordered proteins complexes like the RAP74-FCP1 complex involve large hydrophobic interactions.  Additionally, FCP1 in the complex retains significant flexibility throughout the simulation.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7453], "author_name_tesi": "Wostenberg, Christopher William", "last_name_ssi": "Wostenberg", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott A Showalter", "Scott A Showalter", "Philip C.

The direct-storage method has been adapted to the pressure-based incompressible algorithm and implemented in \\foam, an open-source C\\tss{++} computing package. The boundary condition is applied to various two-dimensional test cases to demonstrate its effectiveness at producing a more cost-effective alternative to the transient full-wheel simulation. Overall, the phase-lag cases reproduce the chorochronic fluctuations associated with the RSI. \nFirst, a series of benchmark cases compare a phase-lagged model to a full-wheel model and a model subject to standard periodic constraints; for these cases, the computational domains are intentionally designed such that the PLBC is not a necessary condition. The phase-lagged simulations converge to a comparable solutions to the control cases with a notable advantage in computational cost requirements. Further, as a supplemental case, a phase-lagged simulation comprising of a supersonic wedge under compressible conditions verifies that the phase-lagged simulation and the full-wheel simulation agree.\n\nIn a second series of benchmark cases, the PLBC becomes a necessary condition because the standard numerical methods insufficiently resolve the conflicting constraints of the cascading blade rows. The phase-lagged cases exhibit minor pressure fluctuations, but agree well with the full-wheel benchmark cases. In more complex cases, the PLBC is assisted by an upwind technique available through the blended Dirichlet-Neumann structure of the PLBC algorithm to facilitate better accuracy across the phase-lagged mesh interface.

Yet, scarce empirical evidence exists to either support or cast doubt upon this supposition.  My dissertation, in which I delve into this fundamental issue, consists of two major sections.  In the first essay, I focus on a basic question: Do higher-paid CEOs outperform their lower-paid CEO peers?  Finding no consistent evidence of a meaningful relationship, I then examine whether contextual factors at the industry and organization levels moderate the link between pay and subsequent performance.  I find little evidence that the pay-performance relationship is accentuated by the industry- or firm-level attributes incorporated in my analyses.  In the second essay, I shift the focus to more proximal outcomes of CEO actions, investigating how pay influences firm outcomes other than performance.  I specifically examine the associations between persistent CEO underpayment and three organizational outcomes: unrelated diversification, corporate attention to non-shareholder stakeholders, and corporate misconduct.

Larger temperature gradients produce higher output power.\nTypically, thermal harvesters have a lower power to volume ratio than vibrational harvesters.\nDue to their simplistic design, however, a higher power to mass ratio is not unusual.\n\n\nOverall, single crystal energy harvesters were shown to be reliable producers of usable\nelectrical energy for short and extended periods of time. Performance was reduced at elevated\ntemperature, however, different chemical compositions can abate this effect. A wide range of\npower was available for varying base accelerations. At all vibration levels, however, the PMNPT\nharvester produced over twice the power as a PZT-based device.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8487], "author_name_tesi": "Wozniak, Michael Vincent", "last_name_ssi": "Wozniak", "middle_name_ssi": "Vincent", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Clarke Conlon", "Edward Smith", "Karl Martin Reichard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Clarke Conlon, Thesis Advisor", "Edward Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Karl Martin Reichard, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["PMN-PT", "Single Crystal", "Energy Harvester", "Piezoelectric", "Rotorcraft", "Wireless Sensor", "Lead", "Magnesium", "Niobate", "Titanate"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "LIFE-LONG VITAMIN A SUPPLEMENTATION HAS NO DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON TRABECULAR AND CORTICAL BONE OR BONE STIFFNESS", "id": "10421", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "110", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vitamin A (VA) is a fat-soluble dietary component required for vision, cellular differentiation, proliferation, as well as normal growth and bone development. The principal biologically active metabolite of VA, retinoic acid (RA) acts through retinoid specific receptors to modulate gene expression. \n\nMore than 50% of US adults report use of a dietary supplement, which can result in VA intakes that are more than 200% of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). Recent data suggest a much smaller changes in VA intake than previously suspected might result in alterations in skeletal fracture risk. VA is fat soluble and cleared by cells within bone marrow, and thus VA and its metabolically active metabolite RA have access to this highly sensitive hematopoietic environment. It is hypothesized that alterations to VA intake (both high and low) will result in changes in cortical and trabecular bone, and resistance to fracture. \n\nDosing of 25-day-old rat pups for 14 days with VA established that retinol does indeed travel to both the tibia and femur, with an increase in VA intake. Long-term evaluation in a chronic model of marginally VA-deficient, control and VA-supplemented animals, evaluated at three different ages (2-3, 8-10 and 20-22 months), provided a larger picture than previously described as to the effect of both marginally deficient VA intake and VA supplemented intake on bone health. Though both low and high VA resulted in increased medullary cavity size and decreased cortical thickness (as analyzed by micro-computed tomography) at 2-3 months, no changes were noted at 8-10 or 20-22 months. There was also no difference in resistance to fracture later in life, as analyzed by material testing system and bone loading. Taken together, these data indicate that alterations to normal VA intake over the lifespan, within the range of marginal to supplemented intakes, do not have measurable detrimental effects on several parameters related to bone health. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [111], "author_name_tesi": "Wray, Amanda  Ellen", "last_name_ssi": "Wray", "middle_name_ssi": "Ellen", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross", "A Catharine Ross"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross, Thesis Advisor", "A Catharine Ross, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bone", "Vitamin A", "VA", "Mechanical Testing", "Longitudinal", "Murine", "Trabecular", "Cortical", "Bone Mineral Density", "BMD", "Physiology"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Game Theoretic Approach to Multi-agent Systems in Highly Dynamic, Information-sparse, Role Assignment Scenarios", "id": "16056", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7840", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The wide array of problems found in the field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) require rapid coordination toward a desired system state amidst the often limited and inaccurate information observed by the agents within. This thesis investigates the conditions surrounding this kind of emergent coordination. We focus primarily on a problem entitled Defender and provide a solution that leverages game theory in its agents' construction. Defender is a multi-predator multi-prey problem in which the predators seek to capture as many prey as possible before any of the prey reach their haven. The problem itself is a continuous noisy version of scenarios found throughout the MAS literature, particularly in the RoboCup, an annual robotic soccer competition. As such, it defines two sides as goal regions with its agents restricted to observational noise and a limited field of view. It specifically examines dynamically changing versions of learning algorithms like fictitious play, rational learning, and regret matching, in addition to baseline algorithms following minimax regret and greedy strategies. These algorithms operate in an anti-coordination game, which only rewards agents that select different actions from one another. Furthermore, this thesis presents optimizations to these algorithms and tests their robustness in ad hoc team scenarios. Results show that fictitious play outperforms all other algorithms and tends toward strong cooperative behavior.\n\nIn order to improve the algorithms in these kinds of problems, we also developed an adaptive communication architecture. The Distributed Communication Architecture (DCA) algorithm addresses the common issue found in real-world systems, specifically the message passing structure between agents. It is able to dynamically assign time slots to agents in a completely distributed manner. We apply this algorithm to Defender and show that while communication is not required to achieve emergent cooperation, it can improve the quality of agent's observations and subsequent decisions. Overall, this thesis investigates these primary topics to address the problem of constructing a team of agents seeking to cooperatively behave in a highly dynamic environment.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7771], "author_name_tesi": "Wray, Kyle Hollins", "last_name_ssi": "Wray", "middle_name_ssi": "Hollins", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Benjamin Berry Thompson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Thesis Advisor", "Benjamin Berry Thompson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multiagent Systems", "Game Theory", "Fictitious Play", "Anti-Coordination Games", "Predator Prey", "Uncertainty", "Robotics", "Cooperation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Altruists and Egoists: A Local Interaction Model of Imitation in Social Graphs", "id": "18948", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9076", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The imitation dynamics within large societies of agents are a growing topic of interest to game theorists and multiagent researchers.

We present a formal mathematical model for the problem domain, as well as demonstrate that it extends the original problem. We show numerical bounds on the social cost for altruism based on the graph structure. We define the concept of power players, who are altruist or egoist players that are supported by communities of altruists. These power players can greatly influence others as a result of their high utilities. We state the exact bounds of their stability as a function of their \"power level\" and the cost of playing altruism. With both mathematical rigor and experimentation, we demonstrate that there are specific configurations of agents within a society that can induce either altruistic or egotistical strategies in others, and therefore define stability regions for which altruism can successfully survive iteration.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8904], "author_name_tesi": "Wray, Kyle Hollins", "last_name_ssi": "Wray", "middle_name_ssi": "Hollins", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eli Christopher C Byrne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eli Christopher C Byrne, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["imitation dynamics", "prisoner's dilemma on graphs"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Development of Social Responsibility in Adolescence: Dynamic Socialization, Values, and Action\n\n", "id": "10926", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3739", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Promoting adolescents\u2019 development as socially responsible citizens is a shared goal of researchers, practitioners, and parents. Recent revisions to value socialization theory argue that parental strategies for cultivating values are flexibly adapted, value messages are content-specific, and adolescents are active agents in the process. This dissertation advanced theory by investigating change in value socialization messages over time, the role of socialization in shaping adolescents\u2019 values, and value-behavior links in the context of health promotion. Data came from a three-year longitudinal and socioeconomically diverse sample of adolescents (ages 10 to 18) and their mothers. Study 1 explored correlates of mothers\u2019 value messages using mother and adolescent reports across three years (N =1638). Two fundamental socialization dimensions were assessed: messages of compassion (e.g., looking out for the good of others) and messages of caution (e.g., being wary of others). Separate multilevel models revealed distinct between-person and within-person correlates for mothers\u2019 compassion and caution messages. Compassion messages were predicted by the family context (e.g., mothers\u2019 knowledge of friends and concerns for their child\u2019s future) and neighborhood climate; compassion also declined in concert with adolescents\u2019 experiences of being bullied. Caution messages were predicted by mothers\u2019 education levels, race/ethnicity, and marital status, and increased in relation to mothers\u2019 concerns and perceptions that illegal substances were easily attainable. Study 2 examined the ways in which adolescents\u2019 reports of value messages of compassion and caution predicted adolescents\u2019 self-interest and public-interest values and beliefs using data from two waves (N = 2516). Results from multiple regression models indicated that adolescents\u2019 perceptions of parental compassion messages positively predicted their self-transcendent values, social responsibility beliefs, and public health beliefs, and negatively predicted self-enhancement values and private health beliefs. In addition, democratic parenting consistently predicted adolescents\u2019 public-interest orientations across outcomes and waves. Caution messages were best understood in relation to compassion messages. When caution was coupled with compassion, self-transcendent values were enhanced, yet when caution messages were emphasized without compassion, self-enhancement values were more likely to result. Study 3 tested a process model of maternal socialization of adolescents\u2019 social responsibility values and behaviors using mother and adolescent reports across three waves (N = 1870). Structural equation models supported a theoretically-derived sequential process of value internalization: The link between mothers\u2019 compassion messages and adolescents\u2019 values of social responsibility operated through adolescents\u2019 perceptions of compassion messages. Adolescents\u2019 social responsibility values predicted greater willingness to intervene in the substance use of friends as well as lower personal use of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana one year later. The dissertation\u2019s contributions to science were strengthened by the use of longitudinal data and multiple reporters, the reduction of missing data bias through quantitative strategies, and the integration of disparate literatures from multiple disciplines. Conclusions suggest that compassion and caution are distinct yet complementary value messages that parents communicate. Furthermore, adolescents\u2019 social responsibility values, developed in part through the socialization of compassion, may facilitate health promotion behaviors. Understanding adolescents\u2019 values and the role of parental strategies in cultivating these values has implications for parent-child communication, positive youth development, and substance use prevention.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3720], "author_name_tesi": "Wray-Lake, Laura ", "last_name_ssi": "Wray-Lake", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Constance A Flanagan", "Constance A Flanagan", "Jennifer Lianne Maggs", "Ann Caverly Crouter", "D Wayne Osgood"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Constance A Flanagan, Dissertation Advisor", "Constance A Flanagan, Committee Chair", "Jennifer Lianne Maggs, Committee Chair", "Ann Caverly Crouter, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["socialization messages", "value development", "social responsibility", "parental communication", "compassion", "caution", "substance use", "adolescent development", "family processes", "flexible parenting", "peer intervention"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Chasing Desires and Meeting Needs: Filipinas in South Korea, Mobile Phones, Social Networks, Social Support and Informal Learning", "id": "28848", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12386", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As in most countries, transnational workers in South Korea face many difficulties living and working in their host country, including communication problems, cultural conflicts, discrimination, and abuse in the workplace. While attempting to navigate the difficult terrain of their host country, transnational workers are physically distant from their usual sources of social support in their communities of origin. Many transnational workers live in social worlds which are split between the expat communities in South Korea and their families and friends back home. To deal with these difficult circumstances in their host country as well as to stay connected with family and friends at home transnational workers are increasingly turning to mobile phone technology as a way to access sources of social support and to engage in informal learning. \nThis mixed-methods study, employing social network analysis and phenomenology, investigated a) how five Filipina transnational domestic workers used their mobile phones to develop and maintain mobile phone ego  networks (MPENs), b) how the participants used their mobile phones to access social support, c) how the participants engaged in informal learning in the MPENs and d) what meaning these participants made of accessing social their MPENs. This study followed the explanatory sequential mixed methods design. I began the study by working with each participant to construct an MPEN of her 20 most important relationships maintained by mobile phone. This early quantitative phase informed a series of three in-depth semi-structured interviews which were informed by phenomenology. The MPENs were analyzed using descriptive statistics to identify overall trends in the composition and structure of the participants\u2019 MPENs. Using quantitative data and the qualitative interviews, each participant\u2019s MPEN was then treated as a case to explore how the participant used her MPEN to access social support and to engage in informal learning. And finally, I completed a phenomenological analysis to identify the meaning the participants made of the experience of accessing their MPENs.\n\tThe quantitative data showed that the participants\u2019 MPENs were populated with people similar to themselves both in terms of nationality and socioeconomic status. The majority of MPEN members living in South Korea were friends, while those living overseas were almost exclusively family members. The participants used their MPENs to access emotional support as well and information and resources needed to meet their needs and pursue their desires. The case studies revealed the unique and creative ways these women used their MPENs to meet their needs and pursue their desires as well as to overcome some oppressive circumstances. The participants used their MPENs to maintain relationships with family and friends, to engage in informal learning, and to find resources to run a business, access linguistic and cultural knowledge, find employment, and exert their independence. Three themes were identified in the phenomenological analysis: security, being there, but not there, and to get the good, you have to take the bad. Security highlights participants\u2019 efforts to adjust to a linguistic and cultural landscape where they have incomplete knowledge. The theme of security contains two subthemes: security derived from the ability to function unimpeded and security derived from a sense of belonging. The theme of being there, but not there deals with the complicated nature of maintaining relationships with loved ones at a distance. Being there refers to the ability to use mobile phones to reach across distance, while but not there acknowledges the emotional turmoil that maintaining relationships at a distance entails. To get the good, you have to take the bad describes how being available to their MPENs often involved conflicting desires: the desire to maintain some valued relationships may necessitate unwanted communication and obligations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11755], "author_name_tesi": "Wrigglesworth, Jonathan Wayne", "last_name_ssi": "Wrigglesworth", "middle_name_ssi": "Wayne", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Davin Jules Carr Chellman", "Susan Mary Land", "Priya Sharma", "Lawrence Christopher Ragan", "Adnan A Qayyum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Davin Jules Carr Chellman, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Mary Land, Committee Chair", "Priya Sharma, Committee Member", "Lawrence Christopher Ragan, Committee Member", "Adnan A Qayyum, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transnational workers", "social networks", "social support", "informal learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Comparing Methods to Model Stability and Change in Personality and its Pathology", "id": "15091", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7600", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As it stands now, the psychopathology of personality disorders (PD) is at a crossroads, and there is little agreement on the best way to conceptualize and define PD.

The current work builds on past cross-sectional work that has shown that PD and personality traits are consistently and significantly related, and longitudinal work that has shown that both PD and personality are plastic and change across time. Three studies using the Longitudinal Study of Personality Disorders were conducted to address questions about the long-term stability of interpersonal aspects of personality, the implications of PD symptom distribution on models relating personality and PD, and the longitudinal relationship between personality and PD. Each of these questions has important bearing on the manner in which we understand the development of personality, PD, and the relationship between the two. The results of these studies demonstrate that 1) interpersonal style is highly stable but mutable, depending in part on how change and stability are operationalized; 2) non-normal distributional assumptions provide a better fit for models of the relationship between PD and normative personality structure; and 3) individual growth in personality is associated with concurrent growth in avoidant PD symptoms.
