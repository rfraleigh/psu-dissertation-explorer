In this thesis, an energy balance model, the Diffusive Ocean Energy balance CLIMate model (DOECLIM) was calibrated to match the output from 639 simulations of the MIT Integrated Global System Model (IGSM), where each IGSM simulation has a different set of values for three key climate parameters: climate sensitivity, vertical ocean diffusivity and aerosol forcing. The energy balance model estimates the globally averaged climate state based on simplified model physics. The IGSM estimates the zonal mean state of the atmosphere and ocean based on physics in higher complexity climate models, and estimates climate changes that include significant internal variability. The DOECLIM parameters were estimated for each IGSM run to find the parameter settings for the simpler model that would best match results from the more complex model. This allows for the simpler model to be used as an emulator over a range of parameter settings. Two model calibration techniques were used and compared. These techniques are Differential Evolution (DE), a genetic algorithm that produces a single set of parameters providing best fit values, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which produces a joint probability distribution for the parameters. The study analyzed the statistical skill, including potential biases, that exist when calibrating the energy balance model to IGSM output. In particular, the estimated DOECLIM climate sensitivity values tended to be lower than their corresponding IGSM values, particularly for runs with low ocean diffusivity. The parameter estimates also vary depending on the choice of noise model, AR(1) or AR(0) for the atmosphere and ocean temperatures.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8983], "author_name_tesi": "Warner, Ashley Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Warner", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Ashley", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chris Eliot Forest"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chris Eliot Forest, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["climate models", "climate sensitivity", "differential evolution", "markov chain monte carlo"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Structural Study of Bacterial Rna Polymerase Conformational Changes During Transcription Elongation", "id": "15113", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7677", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) is the enzyme responsible for the initial step of gene expression in all domains of life. This process of transcription is composed of three stages; initiation, elongation and termination.

The X-ray crystal structure of the bacterial transcription elongation complex (TEC) has been solved to 2.5 \u00c5 and provides important details concerning the architecture and mechanism of transcription elongation and RNAP translocation [1].\nThis thesis describes ongoing work to elucidate the mechanism of transcription elongation, with particular attention being paid to important mobile elements of the bacterial RNAP, the bridge helix (BH) and trigger loop (TL). These elements of RNAP have been shown to play a role in the nucleotide addition cycle and translocation, though specifics concerning their cycle movements as well as order of events are not currently defined. Additionally, there are currently three major models describing RNAP translocation; the power stroke model, Brownian ratchet model, and a shelf/core ratcheting model. We hypothesize that bacterial RNAP translocates according to the shelf/core ratcheting model, which is the only model that accounts for the tremendous force RNAP is capable of generating during elongation. The BH/TL movements, as well as the various models of RNAP translocation will be discussed here and considered with respect to new experiments conducted using Raman crystallography and time-resolved X- ray crystallography. This combination of approaches is effectively used to view a translocation event in real time, and thereby provide direct evidence for the mechanism and order events during transcription elongation.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7612], "author_name_tesi": "Warner, Brittany A", "last_name_ssi": "Warner", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Brittany", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katsuhiko Murakami", "David Scott Gilmour", "Tae Hee Lee", "Paul Lee Babitzke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katsuhiko Murakami, Thesis Advisor", "David Scott Gilmour, Thesis Advisor", "Tae Hee Lee, Thesis Advisor", "Paul Lee Babitzke, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["RNA polymerase", "translocation", "Thermus thermophilus", "X-ray crystallography"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Policing Civil Disobedience: Physical Intervention Protest Events and State Social Control\n\n\n\n", "id": "8437", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1211", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When groups of people gather to articulate a grievance, the police are often called upon to do the complicated job of balancing competing interests.

The vast majority of these prisoners are eventually released, and each year approximately 700,000 convicted offenders leave prisons and return to communities across the country. Where they go after prison is an important part of the community reentry and reintegration process. Ex-inmates who move frequently after prison or who live in poor and disadvantaged neighborhoods are more likely to recidivate and return to prison. While it is generally recognized that housing and residential characteristics are important during reentry, little is known about the actual residential mobility patterns of individuals with a history of incarceration. The current study uses nationally representative longitudinal data to examine how incarceration (and especially life after release) impacts individual residential mobility behavior. I draw on core perspectives of stratification and attainment to place incarceration alongside other life events known to be correlated with residential mobility. I find that, like many life events, incarceration creates short-term residential mobility. However, in contrast to events like marriage and homeownership, which foster residential stability, incarceration contributes to long-term patterns of residential instability. The difference in observed mobility between survey respondents with and without a history of incarceration becomes larger across time. With this information in mind, I then examine if ex-inmate mobility patterns are associated with upward or downward social mobility (or locational attainment). Housing careers of non-inmates generally move in an upward direction, as individuals and households use residential mobility to match their residences to evolving housing needs. I argue that incarceration might block or even reverse this process, ultimately trapping ex-inmates in poor and disadvantaged neighborhoods. I find that incarceration is associated with downward mobility into poor neighborhoods, but is unrelated to upward mobility out of them.

Delegitimization is defined as invalidating a claim in the eyes of an actual or implied reference group (e.g., Zelditch, 2000). The inability to properly control emotions, which is believed to invalidate a claim, is one of the most salient stereotypes of women in the West, and thus calling a woman emotional will be more believable than calling a man emotional. Participants (N=127) evaluated vignettes of two characters in which one (the observer) either calls the other (the target) emotional or disagrees with the target.

In southeastern PA, more than 2.7 M m3 of spent mushroom compost, the nitrogen-rich byproduct of a mushroom crop, is produced annually. Disposal of SMC off the farm is relatively expensive and growers often seek beneficial uses of SMC to help offset the cost of disposal.  The objective of this study was to investigate the reuse of SMC as an ingredient in the preparation of fresh mushroom compost.  Three mushroom crops (Crops 1,2,3) were grown from compost made with and without SMC as an ingredient at the Mushroom Research Center of The Pennsylvania State University.  Three compost types were prepared for each crop as follows: 1) 100% control formula (no SMC, Ctl), 2) 20% SMC + 80% control formula (80Ctl), and 3) 20% SMC + 80% lignocellulose formula (80LC).  Compost types 1 and 2 were based on straw-bedded horse manure while the third formula was prepared with comparatively higher lignocellulose-rich materials including corn stover, corn cobs, cottonseed hulls and wheat straw (80LC).  At spawning, the three composts were supplemented with various nutrients, including corn gluten feed, Grit-O\u2019Cobs\u00ae 80, corn bran, and Lambert Full House\u00ae T6 (a commercial nutrient), to determine their single or interactive effect with compost type on mushroom yield and biological efficiency (BE).   Bulk densities of the three composts were also measured at spawning to determine if SMC addition to formulations significantly affected the mass to volume ratio of the compost types.\nCompost type was a significant factor for BE of mushroom production in two out of three crops (Crops 1,2).  In Crop 1, BE was equivalent for Ctl and 80LC, while the BE of the 80Ctl was significantly lower.  In Crop 2, BE was significantly higher for the 80LC compost compared to the Ctl and 80Ctl.  These results suggest that at least 20% SMC, depending on the formulation, may be incorporated as a bulk ingredient in the preparation of compost without adversely affecting mushroom yields.   This could be an advantage to commercial growers who are experiencing increasing costs for compost raw materials and SMC disposal. Since SMC is relatively high in nitrogen (N), organic content and minerals, reclaiming nutrients left over in SMC for compost preparation might be an economical prospect for growers. \nType of nutrient supplement added at spawning was a significant factor for all three Crops.  When used at the same rate (approximately 3.7% of compost dry wt), none of the supplements stimulated yield more than the commercial supplement T6.  However, supplementation of compost at spawning with Grit-O\u2019Cobs\u00ae 80, consistently resulted in lower yields and BEs compared to T6.\nSMC addition to phase I compost significantly increased bulk density of phase II compost. Mean bulk density (kg/m3) increased by 19.2% (from 110.8 to 132.1 kg/m3) in the 80Ctl compared to the Ctl compost. There was no significant difference between the 80LC and 80Ctl formula in relation to bulk density, suggesting no significant major structural differences between the 80Ctl and 80LC formulations. \nAnalysis of bacterial populations of two-phase II composts (Ctl, 80LC) revealed greater variability among crops than among compost types. Of the 15 known bacterial phyla detected in Ctl and 80LC formulas, 72% of amplifiable DNA from Ctl compost (Crop 1- 73.5%; Crop 2- 72.5%; Crop 3- 70.1%) and 69.6% of amplifiable DNA from 80LC compost (Crop 1- 76.3%; Crop 2- 66.8%; Crop 3- 65.6%) were from four phyla: Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Chloroflexi. The Gemmatimonadetes was the only phylum of bacteria statistically different according to metagenomic analysis of the two compost types, comprising only 0.03% of the bacterial populations in the Ctl treatment and 0.002% of populations in the 80LC treatment.  Bacterial populations of the genus Truepera showed the largest differences in amplifiable DNA extracted from the composts, but still accounted for only 2% of the total population in the Ctl compost.  This suggests the post-pasteurization microbial communities may not be different in compost containing SMC vs the control. If this is the case, then selection of raw materials to complement SMC would be more important than particular profiles of microbial populations in the compost.  More research is needed in this area, and our work with quantification of bacterial populations may be a useful beginning.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8927], "author_name_tesi": "Warnstrom, Emmie Lynne", "last_name_ssi": "Warnstrom", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynne", "first_name_ssi": "Emmie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Durwood Davis", "Daniel J Royse"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Durwood Davis, Thesis Advisor", "Daniel J Royse, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Agaricus bisporus", "mushrooms", "spent mushroom substrate", "spent mushroom compost", "white button mushroom"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of the Experimental Set-up for Lead Zirconate Titanate Irradiation with Fission Fragments", "id": "14341mvw5502", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14341", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Piezoelectric materials convert mechanical to electrical energy, due to dipoles in their crystal\nstructure.

It is an investigation of culture in action and community as interactivity. Here learning and culture are both examined \u201cas\u201d performance, as a happening only understood in hindsight, as an event that becomes known through experience. By employing queer criticism, I engage in a process of re-considering, re-investigating, and re-examining what I thought was familiar about the cultures that are near me. In this study I ask how various performances of my art classroom are and are not related to one another. \n\nIn this report queer theory is combined with performance theory to articulate alternative notions of subjectivity. The combination of queer and performance theory is useful because it forces knowledge to be understood as activity. On the one hand queering is about the use of direct address to gain insight through the inclusion of the other. And, on the other hand, performance theory is about the development of subjectivity through critical reflections on what has been done. In the space of performance art new meanings for the relationships between subjects can erupt. This work with queering and performance is an attempt to understand how experiences of difference can be used as sites for learning in the art classroom. The intention of this paper is to push us to find those queered points of engagements between ourselves and the students, the curriculum and our experiences in the world. It must be understood however that knowing is always difficult because it is the learned application of a particular relationship to a subject. There is nothing that we just \u201cknow.\u201d\n\nAll of the events cited in this writing come from performance works done in and around my university art classes. Performance art is a useful medium for the critique of difference because it forces individuals to confront the responsibility of being present. The interdisciplinary nature of performance invites individuals (on their own terms) to participate in an evolving critique of culture, genre, identity, and the very idea of knowledge. The texts, criticism, and performances that have been included in this paper deal explicitly with the challenges of visibility and the oppressive results of social invisibility. Like knowing, seeing is also difficult. Here, performance art is used to make visible the terms and conditions of our relationships to each another. \n\nThis dissertation explores how performance art undertakes the process of decontextualizing concepts, ideas, or observations in order to recombine them into new ways of perceiving and including the other in the body of the self. As such viewer-participants are compelled to see themselves in a polymorphic vision with the performance. Here it is argued that with the use of performance, the artist and audience, teacher and student, or author and reader can be queerly re-positioned so that they both feel as though their presence matters in conversation.\n\nSpecifically, this study mixes ideas from critical theory, race criticism, and feminist pedagogy with practices of performance pedagogy. I have also tried to create a lively interplay between the writings of gay theorists, media philosophers, art educators, sociologists, performance artists, and queer theory. The exploration of social invisibility through the observation of being in conversation is the one common characteristic of all the texts mentioned in this work. \n\nAs curriculum researchers, this study pushes us away from an obsession with what will be learned and how it will be taught, and toward an investigation of the process of identification within the classroom. This study demonstrates that the meaning of identity must be performed. Through this work it is clear that identification is always a process pushing and pulling between what is and is not. Identities are spaces of difference-between subjects. It is the perpetual movement of identity that makes knowing difficult. \n\nAn important conclusion of this study is that self-awareness combined with a subjective understanding of otherness is a necessary part of experiencing the world critically. And, critical experiences are required for bringing about change and learning to see differently. It should be understood that I believe education is about learning to see others as well as ourselves differently. \n\nThis work is involves learning to love the process of understanding, because it is through understanding that we become participants, not bystanders, in each other\u2019s fight for life.

A significant fraction of the administered antibiotics is excreted in manure rather than being metabolized by the animal.   Commonly, livestock manures are stored in lagoons or stockpiled prior to disposal by land application.  In recent years, the prevalence of veterinary antibiotics and their fate in the environment has become a topic of concern.  The environmental impacts of manure-borne antibiotics have not been fully elucidated.  The major concerns are the development of antibiotic resistance and direct toxic effects on organisms in the terrestrial and aquatic environments. The occurrence and fate of monensin in the environment related to dairy manure management has not been fully studied.\n\nMonensin is an ionophore antibiotic used widely in dairy production. Monensin\u2019s classification as a growth amplifier allows it to be considered a marker for agricultural pollution when found in the environment. Therefore, the focus of this research was to quantify the degradation of monensin in stored dairy manure using composting and stockpiling. First, stockpiles were left undisturbed (SP treatments).  The second treatment involved turning the piles at day-6 to simulate composting management (CP treatments). Additional turning of piles was initially planned, however, was not done because of pile size and the risk of losing additional pile heat prematurely.\n\nThe dairy manure was initially blended with oat straw and wood chips to achieve moisture content and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of approximately 60% and 28, respectively. These conditions are considered ideal for microbial activity and, in turn, degradation of compounds like monensin.  Amended manure was segregated into piles roughly 2.3 m3 (3 yd3) each and the monensin concentration was monitored over a 50-day period. Total monensin (water extractable plus methanol extractable) analysis was conducted using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis.  Pile temperature and organic matter content were also recorded periodically over the experimental period.  \n\nA reduction in monensin concentration was observed with time for both treatments.  Assuming first-order monensin degradation, the calculated average half-lives were 57.8 d (compost) and 13.6 d (static).  Monensin seemed to dissipate by day 10 in the methanol extractable fraction but the water extractable concentration persisted to day 16.  There were only three piles (CP2, CP4, and SP1) that had measurable concentrations of water extractable monensin on the last day of sampling (day 50).  Overall, the water extractable form made up 77.9% (compost) and 83.8% (static) of total monensin.  \n\nThe original intent of this study was not to quantify runoff.  But due to heavy rainfall and elevated MC, runoff was observed from both treatments.  Monensin was detected in runoff from both treatments.  Runoff from the compost treatments averaged 4.04  ng mL-1, while static treatments averaged 3.98 ng mL-1.  These values were in the lower range of concentrations reported in literature for runoff containing monensin.  Approximately 142 mm of rainfall occurred between sampling days 16 \u2013 50.  The runoff volume from the compost was 1,852 L and 1,701 L from the static treatments.  A mass balance estimate revealed that runoff losses accounted for < 2 % of monensin remaining at day 16 in both the compost and static treatments.  Therefore, even though runoff did occur, the majority of the monensin lost from the piles between days 16 and 50 can be attributed to degradation.\n\nPrevious studies have used spiked manure samples which resulted in higher and more easily measured monensin levels.  In contrast, this study used manure with monensin at levels actually excreted from dairy cattle.  The finding of a longer half-life for the compost treatment was unexpected.  It is likely a reflection of the difficulties experienced in measuring monensin at extremely low, but environmentally relevant, levels.  These results suggest monensin may be an environmental concern in the aqueous phase.  Monensin levels can be degraded using manure management before land application, but piles should be covered to prevent runoff generation.  Understanding the degradation behavior of monensin in dairy manure will contribute to our understanding of its fate in environmental systems and could provide insights into practical manure management methods that can be used in dairy production.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4365], "author_name_tesi": "Washington, Maurice  Taylor", "last_name_ssi": "Washington", "middle_name_ssi": "Taylor", "first_name_ssi": "Maurice ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["monensin", "degradation", "compost", "stockpile", "runoff"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "DETERMINATION OF OXIDE SURFACE REACTIVITY VIA SOLID-STATE NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND AB INITIO METHODS\n", "id": "7720", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4695", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although a mature field, the study of oxide surface speciation and reactivity is still open to scientific investigations endeavoring to elucidate the chemical species involved in various forms of reactivity. Silicates, aluminosilicates, and aluminas are unarguably the most important oxide materials for industrial uses, in addition to comprising a large percentage of environmentally important oxides, e.g., quartz, feldspars, clays, gibbsite, etc.  We have used solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and ab initio computational methods to probe the surface reactivity of several [alumino]silicate materials. Cohesion for this work is provided by studying the effects of chemically modifying oxide surfaces with a monochlorosilane, either experimentally through the use of NMR, or computationally, through the use of Density Functional Theory (DFT) investigations of the reaction pathways. \nFor two suites of natural aluminosilicate glasses, the number of accessible and reactive sites for covalent attachment of a fluorine containing chlorosilane probe molecule was determined by quantitative 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  The first set of samples consists of six rhyolitic and dacitic glasses originating from volcanic activity in Iceland and one rhyolitic glass from the Bishop Tuff, CA. For this suite of samples the rate of acid-mediated dissolution (pH approximately 4) does not correlate to geometric surface area or BET measured surface area, but does depend directly on the number of reactive sites as measured by solid-state NMR. These data imply that the M-OH species bonded to (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)dimethyl-chlorosilane (TFS) represent loci accessible to proton-mediated dissolution. The chemisorption site for TFS on silicates is known to be non-hydrogen bonded Q3 groups, and therefore these sites are implicated as regions that control or influence the rate of acid-mediated dissolution. The second suite of rhyolites, from Kozushima Japan, constitutes a chronosequence, and is comprised of four rhyolites that have weathered for 1.1, 1.8, 26, and 52 thousand years.  For both suites of samples the number of reactive sites on a per gram basis is shown to increase as a function of laboratory and field weathering time. These new data provide a chemically specific and quantifiable proxy for reactive surface area, and our interpretations offer a testable hypothesis for the mechanism of acid-mediated dissolution for aluminosilicate minerals and glasses.  \nThe implication that the chlorosilane binding site on aluminosilicate glasses was potentially the rate-determining site for dissolution led to an investigation of the surface species involved in chlorosilane binding. The low surface area of the volcanic glasses precluded their use as samples for detailed surface characterization via NMR, and therefore a set of six [alumino]silicate gels with high surface area were used as models for the natural glasses. This set of six samples included pure silica gel, pure mesoporous alumina, and four aluminosilicate samples with different weight percent Al2O3, ranging from 11 to 58 percent. The gels were modified with 3,3,3-(trifluoropropyl)dimethylchlorosilane (TFS) followed by a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the binding sites via NMR. The number of TFS binding sites as determined by 19F direct polarization NMR decreased as Al2O3 weight percent increased in the samples, which is posited to be a function of the increasing amount of AlVI relative to AlIV. As the proportion of AlVI rises in the sample, phase separated aggregates composed of pure alumina begin to dominate the aluminum speciation, which we hypothesize is less reactive to TFS binding than the AlIV sites. The Cross-Polarization Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CP-CPMG) pulse sequence was used to determine the identity of the surface sites involved in TFS binding. The center of mass in the spikelet pattern was assigned to a specific spikelet and taken to represent the two end members, silica gel (12 ppm) and mesoporous alumina (8 ppm). The spikelet pattern of the mixed aluminosilicate gels clearly indicates a center of mass shift to lower frequencies with a concomitant change in spikelet intensity. Ratios of the 12 to 10 ppm spikelets were taken from the measured intensities and compared to ratios predicted by a binomial probability function weighted by the probability of a given Qn silicon site being present on the surface.  The model compares very well with experiment, and may be a useful tool for predicting the reactive surface species on aluminosilicates. \nOur predictive model does not address the etiology of the differences exhibited by these complex materials, and cannot due to its qualitative nature. To-date, experimental methods are incapable of generating a molecular level picture of changes to surface reactivity accompanying isomorphic substitution at the silicon center. However, computational methods are particularly well suited to this endeavor, and have been utilized here in a preliminary investigation of chlorosilane binding to silica surfaces.\nThe gas-phase reaction pathways for condensation between mono-functional organosilanols (TFS and Trimethylsilanol (TMS)) and Q3Si or Q2Si sites have been investigated with DFT. The condensation is known to occur via an SNi mechanism, which is a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution that retains the stereochemistry at the metal center. Three condensation mechanisms were studied for each QnSi species: the neat reaction (i.e., no solvent or additional molecules), an HCl inclusive reaction, and an HCl/ H2O inclusive reaction. The calculated activation energies were higher than predicted for all reactions with the exception of the Q2Si/HCl pathway having a calculated value of 118 kJ/mol. Analysis of the calculated values for &#61508;Grxn  indicate that all of the reaction pathways containing Q3Si species are favorable, but for the Q2Si species only the HCl inclusive pathway is favorable.  Addition of solvent effects via the polarizable continuum model (PCM) to the &#61508;Grxn  calculations increases the loss in free energy upon condensation for the Q3Si, while the opposite is true for the Q2Si pathways. Based on these data the Q2Si is the most energetically favorable site for chlorosilane condensation. However, this is inconsistent with the experimental findings that the Q3Si is the dominant species involved in condensation with mono-functional organosilanols. The origin of this discrepancy lies in the reaction mechanism and the chemical species participating in it. Chlorosilane condensation does not occur at temperatures below 300 oC in the absence of molecular water, and therefore the Q2Si/HCl reaction pathway is not physically feasible. Our data suggests that the Q2Si is the favored participant in the absence of water, which is not supported by experimental findings. Furthermore, these data imply that water is a necessary participant in the condensation step, a fact that has been previously suggested but not confidently based on experimental or computational evidence. In addition, once explicit water is included in the reaction pathways the Q3Si becomes the thermodynamically favored participant in the reaction, which is consistent with experimental findings. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4661], "author_name_tesi": "Washton, Nancy Maurer", "last_name_ssi": "Washton", "middle_name_ssi": "Maurer", "first_name_ssi": "Nancy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller", "Barbara Jane Garrison", "James David Kubicki", "John B Asbury", "Susan Louise Brantley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Chair", "Barbara Jane Garrison, Committee Member", "James David Kubicki, Committee Member", "John B Asbury, Committee Member", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chlorosilane", "surface modification", "reaction pathways", "ab initio", "aluminosilicates", "reactive surface area", "NMR"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Assessing Forested Riparian Buffer Ecological Integrity Using Lidar Data\n", "id": "15154", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7461", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Forested riparian buffers (FRB) provide numerous critical ecosystem services. However, the linear and often narrow spatial configuration of FRBs makes it difficult to identify broadscale spatial and temporal change in their characteristics. Remote sensing data are most often used to inventory and characterize FRB conditions. However, the spatial resolution of conventionally used remote sensing data (e.g., Landsat) is often larger than the average FRB corridor width yielding pixels containing mixed land cover types. There is a need to both develop cost effective methods to identify and analyze change in FRB vegetation structure and spatial configuration over time and to assess error surrounding these techniques, in support of understanding the influence of anthropogenic disturbance on FRB ecological integrity and ecosystem service provision. \nThis dissertation tests the use of high resolution, discrete return lidar data to quantify FRB vegetation structure and spatial configuration within a headwater watershed. It further assesses whether lidar data can be used to identify change in FRB vegetation structure and spatial configuration, and to quantify disturbance impacts on FRB systems. The objectives of this dissertation are to 1) assess error associated with leaf-off compared to leaf-on lidar derived estimates of riparian buffer vegetation height and fractional cover within a variety of riparian vegetation types throughout a headwater watershed, 2) to assess the influence of anthropogenic development in the form of \"edge effects\" on riparian buffer structure at both the corridor / adjacent landuse edge, the stream edge and throughout the buffer corridor and 3) quantify differences in width and fragmentation estimates derived from leaf-on lidar data, leaf-off lidar data and moderate resolution Landsat data within corridors of varying width and adjacent to varying landuse types.\t\nResults of this dissertation demonstrate that leaf off lidar derived estimates of vegetation height (H) are similar to leaf-on lidar derived H estimates and further are within 1 \u2013 2 m of field measurements within all vegetation types assessed. Similarly, leaf-off lidar estimates of fractional cover are within 10 \u2013 20 % of measured within mixed and conifer canopies. Leaf-on lidar derived  estimates of H and FC are similar to field measures within all canopy types assessed. This dissertation also demonstrates that FRB vegetation is 1) taller within wider buffers adjacent to undeveloped landuse types and 2) taller at the naturally occurring stream edge compared to the matrix edge (the edge / adjacent landuse interface). Throughout the FRB corridor, vegetation fractional cover is consistently high (> 80 % on average, suggesting a consistently closed canopy) regardless of adjacent landuse type or FRB corridor width. This dissertation also demonstrates that both leaf-on and widely available leaf-off lidar can be used to accurately estimate FRB corridor width (with estimate accuracy better than 5 m on average), and degree fragmentation within agricultural, undeveloped and developed landuse types. Landsat derived width estimates may under and overestimate FRB width by 10 \u2013 20 m or more on average, particularly within narrow and developed corridors, significantly influencing ecological assessment. Largest differences between lidar and Landsat width estimates and validation widths (difference > 5 m) are observed within developed types where landcover is more heterogeneous, confounding forest classification and in turn FRB edge detection. Thus, this research demonstrates that lidar can bridge the gap between grain (data resolution), area extent and 3-dimensional analysis of vegetation structure in ecological analysis of FRBs that exists using conventional RS methods. It also demonstrates the use of existing lidar data to map FRB corridor vegetation structure and spatial configuration, which will significantly reduce data collection costs in support of broadscale mapping efforts.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7405], "author_name_tesi": "Wasser, Leah Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Wasser", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Leah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan Taylor", "Rick Lane Day", "Robert Brooks", "Ken Davis", "Laura Chasmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan Taylor, Committee Chair", "Rick Lane Day, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Brooks, Committee Member", "Ken Davis, Committee Member", "Laura Chasmer, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Riparian Forests", "Lidar", "Remote Sensing", "Landscape Ecology", "Leaf-on Leaf-off", "Riparian Buffer Width", "Ecosystem Services"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "One team, one goal: A qualitative analysis of labor-management partnership at the General Motors Lansing Delta Township Assembly plant", "id": "10779", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4377", "abstract_tesi": "In the throes of the automotive industry\u2019s collapse, General Motors (GM) and the United Auto Workers (UAW) agreed to a plan for making the company\u2019s U.S. assembly plants more competitive through greater labor-management collaboration.

BPD is costly, painful, debilitating, and deadly, and thus, represents a serious clinical and public health concern. Across multiple studies of Axis I psychopathology, alliance has been shown to be a robust predictor of outcome. In addition, formation of an alliance has been written about extensively in theoretical descriptions of the treatment of BPD. However, little systematic research has been conducted to determine the relationship between alliance and outcome in BPD. The maximization of efficacy in the treatment of BPD depends upon understanding the specific mechanisms that characterize the disorder and that determine clinical change. Here, we examined working alliance in BPD, with a well standardized observer-rated measure (WAI) and a well characterized and representative sample of reliably diagnosed patients. We used archival data from a randomized clinical trial, including well characterized and standardized treatments to minimize competence as a confound for alliance. Through direct investigation of the alliance in a well controlled study of treatments for BPD, we begin to answer important questions regarding the role of alliance in therapeutic change with this population. The long-term goal of this research program is to elucidate the technical, relational, and contextual mechanisms of change in the treatment of specific psychological disorders, and to facilitate the translation of these findings into the validation and dissemination of efficacious treatments. Three foundational questions regarding the alliance in BPD were posed: 1) do treatment differences exist in the formation of early alliance, in line with emphasis on supportive and validating techniques early in treatment? 2) is alliance predictive of treatment retention/termination in this population? And 3) is alliance predictive of treatment response in BPD? Analysis of variance, survival analysis and hierarchical linear models were used to address these questions. It was found that working alliance was positive and equivalent treatments indicating that despite technical differences in approach, that therapists in all three treatment conditions were able to foster generally positive working relationships with their patients in the initial sessions of therapy. With respect to early termination, treatment type was found to be marginally associated with risk of dropout while working alliance was found to be significantly predictive of treatment retention. Hierarchical linear models were used to investigate the relationship of working alliance to initial symptomatic distress and functional impairment as well as to change during treatment. Consistent with predictions, working alliance was found to be associated with functional impairment but not symptomatic distress at the start of treatment. Working alliance was predictive at trend levels of change in global severity of symptoms across treatments. In addition, with respect to global assessment of functioning a trend level three way interaction among working alliance, treatment condition and time was found indicating that working alliance is significantly more related to change in global functioning in TFP than in SPT and marginally more related to change in global functioning in DBT than SPT. Working alliance was not found to predict change in the four other outcome variables investigated. Implications of these findings, strengths and limitations, and future directions for research are discussed. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5420], "author_name_tesi": "Wasserman, Rachel H.", "last_name_ssi": "Wasserman", "middle_name_ssi": "H.", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Levy", "Kenneth Levy", "Aaron Lee Pincus", "Louis Georges Castonguay", "Peter Cm Molenaar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Levy, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth Levy, Committee Chair", "Aaron Lee Pincus, Committee Member", "Louis Georges Castonguay, Committee Member", "Peter Cm Molenaar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["borderline personality disorder", "alliance", "psychotherapy research", "HLM"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Data Compression and Fractal Dimension for Measures", "id": "26517", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11750", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ability to distinguish between data generated by random versus deterministic processes is necessary for scientific discovery.

The research questions were: (1) to determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining a sample of obese adolescents (11-17 years of age) with and without-OSAS, (2) to pilot test a protocol that incorporates a 1-week measurement period for physical activity and sleep to assess for complete data rates and participant acceptability of instrumentation, (3) to explore executive function impairments as measured by the Global Executive Composite (i.e., overall summary score) and three subscales (i.e., Behavior Regulation Index, Emotion Regulation Index, and Cognitive Regulation Index), within groups, compared to published normative data, and explore differences in executive function impairments between groups (obese adolescents with and without-OSAS), and (4) to describe differences in activity levels (frequency, intensity, time) and sleep duration (major sleep bout total sleep time), measured by 1-week actigraphy (objective measure of rest/activity and sleep) and self-report, between obese adolescents with and without OSAS and explore the relationship between activity levels and sleep duration with executive function (Global Executive Composite scores).\nMETHODS: A two-cohort, prospective study design was employed with a target population of adolescents with obesity (cohort 1) and obesity+OSAS (cohort 2). Participants were recruited, enrolled and consented/assented from an academic, tertiary medical center\u2019s sleep center and weight management clinic. Inclusion criteria were: age 11-17 years, BMI-for-age \u226595th percentile, presence or absence of OSAS determined by overnight PSG (diagnostic or split night study within the last year), apnea-hypopnea index \u22651.5 events/hour for clinically significant OSAS, parental consent and adolescent assent, reading level \u22655th grade, ability to read English, and anticipated performance of usual activities over a 1-week period after enrollment (e.g., no planned vacations, acute illnesses). Exclusion criteria were: age <11 or \u2265 18 years, BMI-for-age <95th percentile, overnight PSG >1 year ago, change in BMI greater than \u00b1 2 kg/m2 since overnight PSG, acute or chronic physical injury or disability that impedes participation in physical activity, intellectual disabilities/learning disabilities that impact independent ability to respond to questionnaires, current treatment of OSAS, established diagnosis of other sleep-wake disorders that may disrupt sleep duration, including insomnia, restless legs syndrome, and narcolepsy, uncontrolled diabetes, disruptive behavioral disorders such as Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), established diagnosis of psychological disorders, including anxiety, schizophrenia, or personality disorders, or current use of psychotropic medications, uncontrolled mood disorders (depression, anxiety), and regular use (>3 days/week) of over the counter or prescribed medications that interfere with sleep. After baseline characteristic variables were collected by self-report questionnaire, one-week wrist-worn actigraphy and daily sleep and physical activity diaries were employed as measures of total nightly sleep time and physical activity including duration, frequency and intensity (tertiary outcomes). Executive function, the secondary outcome, was measured using the BRIEF\u00ae2. Feasibility outcomes, primary, included rates of recruitment, enrollment, retention and complete data; an end of study questionnaire measured participant acceptability of study protocol and instrumentation.  Descriptive statistical analysis and correlation tests were employed. Because of difficulty recruiting a group of obese adolescents\u2019 without-OSAS, no tests for group differences were conducted. \nRESULTS: It was not feasible to recruit obese adolescents without-OSAS given the recruitment plan; the study sample therefore included only a single cohort, adolescents with OSAS+obesity (n=20). Participants were largely white (n=15, 75%), non-Hispanic (n=19, 90%), adolescent (median= 14 years) males (n=11, 55%), with moderate obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (AHI median= 5.85, IQR 9.60). Face-to-face recruitment resulted in higher enrollment rates than mailed initiation letters. Complete data rates for one-week measures ranged from 75-90%. Ninety-five percent of participants completed the protocol and 90% of participants were interested in participating in another similar study. Obese adolescents with OSAS (n=20) had significantly worse executive function (by self- and parent-report) than a normative sample (p\u22640.003); up to 30% had impaired executive function at thresholds considered clinically significant. No relationship was identified between sleep duration or physical activity and executive function.  Participants did not meet national recommendations for sleep duration or physical activity and there was relatively minimal variability across participants for sleep duration or physical activity.\nCONCLUSION: Alternative recruitment techniques are needed to obtain a sample of obese adolescents without-OSAS. Adolescents with obesity and OSAS have impaired executive function and do not meet recommended sleep or physical activity guidelines. Larger prospective studies are needed to determine if sleep duration and/or physical activity are associated with executive function in adolescents with OSAS and obesity.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14742], "author_name_tesi": "Watach, Alexa Justine", "last_name_ssi": "Watach", "middle_name_ssi": "Justine", "first_name_ssi": "Alexa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Amy M Sawyer", "Amy M Sawyer", "David E Conroy", "Ann Marie Kolanowski", "Tonya Sharp King", "Carole Marcus"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Amy M Sawyer, Dissertation Advisor", "Amy M Sawyer, Committee Chair", "David E Conroy, Committee Member", "Ann Marie Kolanowski, Committee Member", "Tonya Sharp King, Outside Member", "Carole Marcus, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adolescent", "obesity", "obstructive sleep apnea syndrome", "OSAS", "physical activity", "sleep", "executive function", "feasibility"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Mechanistic Studies on Selective Adsorption of Thiophenic Compounds on TiO2-CeO2 Oxides", "id": "7277", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5884", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The adsorption of thiophene in liquid hydrocarbons was investigated over TiO2-CeO2 oxide-based adsorbents.

The goal of this study is to develop a better understanding of the nature (e.g., the types, abundances, and distributions) of organisms and the connections between the biosphere and Earth\u2019s surface environments, including the redox state of the oceans and atmosphere during the late Archean. This goal has been approached through multidimensional investigations on two different types of organic carbon-rich rocks that are almost the same age (~2.7-2.6 Ga). The first set of samples includes the 2.7 Ga shales from the Kidd Creek area in the Abitibi district, Canada that were deposited under the influence of submarine hydrothermal activity in a deep (>1.5 km) ocean.  The second set of samples are ~2.6 Ga soils from the Schagen area, East Transvaal district, South Africa that formed on land under a semi-arid climate. We have investigated the various characteristics (occurrence, chemical and isotopic composition) of the organic matter and its host rocks utilizing a variety of petrological, mineralogical, and geochemical techniques. \nThe 40 shale samples from the Kidd Creek area we investigated were collected from five shale units (each 2- 50 m thick) that deposited in small depressions (< 2km diameter) within the period 2717-2690 Ma. We investigated the petrographical and mineralogical characteristics (especially the modes of occurrence of organic matter and sulfide minerals), the contents of 60 elements (major elements, heavy metals, and REEs), the contents of C, H, N and S in the bulk rock and extracted kerogen, the d13C value of extracted kerogen, the d13C and d18O values of carbonates, and the d34S value of sulfides.\nThe d13C values of kerogen range from \u201338.8 to \u201317.0\u2030, and the organic carbon contents range from 0.03 to 11.63 wt%. Well-defined positive correlations have been recognized among the following parameters: (a) the d13C of kerogen, (b) the organic C content of shale, (c) the occurrence mode of organic matter in shale (e.g., dissemination, seams), (d) the C/P ratio of shale, (e) the Zn content of shale, and (f) the d13C of carbonate. We also compared the relationships between parameters (a) and (b) in shales from other parts of the 2.7 Ga greenstone belts in the Superior Province, Canada. Quantitative analyses of the correlations among the above parameters have led us to present the following suggestions for the nature of the biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere 2.7 Ga ago: (1) the dominant primary producers in the oceans were most likely cyanobacteria with d13C values around \u201328 \u2030; (2) the kinetic carbon isotopic effect accompanying the photosynthesis, DCO2-CH2O value, was about 8 \u2030 greater than today due to higher pCO2 in the Archean atmosphere; (3) the normal, open oceans were oxygenated throughout the water column, thereby preventing the accumulation of organic carbon- and sulfide-rich sediments; (4) submarine depressions with anoxic bottom water were created locally and regionally in many parts of the oceans, especially in regions with active tectonics and volcanism; (5) many of the submarine depressions became sites of hydrothermal fluid discharge; (6) the plumes of hydrothermal fluids enhanced the recycling of phosphate between the anoxic bottom water and the oxic surface water, causing an increased activity of cyanobacteria, while an increased flux of the remnants of cyanobacteria in depressions caused an increased activity of anaerobic, heterotrophic, and mat-forming microbial communities; (7) the submarine microbial communities developed in depressions under the influence of low temperature, Zn-rich hydrothermal fluids were composed primarily of fermentative bacteria, methanogens, and sulfate-reducing bacteria with d13C values between \u201355 and \u201335 \u2030; and (8) the submarine microbial communities developed in depressions under the influence of high temperature, Cu+Zn-rich hydrothermal fluids were inhabited primarily of thermophiles with d13C values between \u201320 and \u201310\u2030. These suggestions further lead to the following proposals: (9) contrary to the current popular theory, the productions of methane and organic matter with very low d13C values (<-35\u2030) did not occur globally in the Archean oceans; they were restricted to local (and regional) basins under the influence of low temperature hydrothermal fluids; and (10) because the O2 content of the bottom ocean water is dependent on the atmospheric pO2 level, suggestion (3) suggests that the pO2 level 2.7 Ga was already greater than ~0.5 PAL.\nThe 2.6 Ga paleosols at Schagen, which developed on serpentinite, are characterized by relatively high contents of reduced-C (0.1 \u2013 1.4 wt %) in the upper ~8 m section where thick (1-3 m) zones of massive carbonate (Fe-rich dolomite and calcite) are interbedded with 1-3 m-thick zones rich in clays (talc, chlorite, and ferri-stilpnomelane). We have carried out a systematic investigation of the petrographical, mineralogical, and geochemical characteristics of the carbonaceous matter and its host rocks on 34 samples collected from a 17 m profile. Mineralogical investigations have included XRD, EPMA, SEM, and TEM analyses of rocks, minerals, and extracted kerogen.  Geochemical investigations have included chemical analyses to identify 60 elements (major, trace, and REE) and Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios, isotope analyses of carbonates (d13C, d18O, 87Sr/86Sr), chemical analyses of the kerogen extracts (C/H/S/N ratios), and carbon isotope analyses of extracted kerogens. Thermodynamic analyses of the formational conditions for the pertinent minerals (serpentine, talc, dolomite, calcite, and siderite) were also performed.\nThe carbonaceous matter in the soils is intimately associated with clays (talc, chlorite, and ferri-stilpnomelane) and occurs mostly as seams (20 to 100 mm thick and a few cm long) that parallel the soil layers. These occurrences, along with the crystallographic structure (amorphous graphite), H/C ratios (0.02-0.05), and d13C values (-17.4 to \u201314.4 \u2030) of the carbonaceous matter, suggest remnants of in-situ microbial mats developed during soil formation. After correcting for metamorphic effects, the original d13C values of the microbial mats are estimated to be around \u201318 \u2030. The microbial mats, which may have been mostly composed of cyanobacteria, probably formed on the surface of silicate-rich soils under air. However, the microbial mats in the carbonate-rich soil zones probably formed at the bottom of an evaporitic, alkaline, and anoxic pond (or lake) and were probably composed mostly of anaerobic heterotrophs that utilized the remnants of cyanobacteria from the oxygenated surface water.\nThe results of various investigations suggest the ~8m carbonaceous matter-rich soil section primarily grew upward from the original serpentinite surface through a combination of two major processes. The processes were (i) the precipitation of carbonates (mostly Fe-rich dolomite) by locally discharged groundwater and (ii) the accumulation of silicate-rich rock fragments (and minerals) transported from local sources (serpentinite and granite) by fluvial and/or aerial processes. The relative importance of these two processes fluctuated during soil formation due to changes in groundwater flow regimes. The groundwater probably originated from a granite-gneiss terrain and discharged in the serpentinite area, thereby creating an evaporating, alkaline pond where Fe-rich dolomite precipitated; the Fe-rich carbonates suggest the bottom water was reduced. During periods when groundwater was not discharging, the silicate-rich rock fragments from granitic sources were converted to clay-rich soils by the local rainwater. The enrichment of iron as ferric-bearing aluminous silicates (stilpnomelane) at the uppermost part of the soil section suggests this silicate-rich soil formation occurred under an oxygenated atmosphere, rather than under a water body.  \nAll results obtained from the above two types of research are consistent with an atmospheric evolution model that postulates an early (>2.7 Ga) development of an oxygenated atmosphere and complex biosphere in the oceans and on land.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6869], "author_name_tesi": "Watanabe, Yumiko ", "last_name_ssi": "Watanabe", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yumiko", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Blair Hedges", "Hiroshi Ohmoto", "Katherine Haines Freeman", "Michael Allan Arthur"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Blair Hedges, Committee Member", "Hiroshi Ohmoto, Committee Chair", "Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Member", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["geochemistry", "biosphere", "organic matter", "shale", "Archean", "paleosol"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Model Testing for Partially Linear Models", "id": "15425", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7873", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In a partially linear model some covariates have a linear effect, while the effect of others may be nonlinear.

In general, sexual violence includes attempted or completed nonconsensual touching or penetration (oral, vaginal, or anal) that occurs through verbal coercion, incapacitation, or physical force. Addressing sexual violence requires a focus on the entire translational spectrum from discovery science on the development of risk and protective factors to large scale dissemination of effective preventative interventions and policy changes. In the current dissertation, I present research from two different stages of the translational spectrum to inform sexual violence prevention. \n\nIn the first paper, I focus on the Type 0 stage of translational research, that is, discovery science about the etiology of sexual violence. I use structural equation modeling to explore longitudinal associations between beliefs about alcohol\u2019s role in sexual experiences, drinking in large group contexts such as bars and parties, and sexual violence during college among female college students. Findings indicated that women who had been the victims of sexual violence before college were more likely to be victims of sexual violence during college. Women with more positive sex-related alcohol expectancies tended to drink alcohol in large group contexts more frequently than women with less positive expectancies. However, contrary to previous cross-sectional research, women with more positive sex-related alcohol expectancies at the beginning of college were no more likely to be victims of sexual violence during college than women with less positive sex-related alcohol expectancies. \n\nIn the second paper, I focus on Type 1 translation, or intervention development. A current challenge facing the field of prevention science is scaling up, or disseminating preventative interventions on a large scale. In this paper, I discuss the application of the desirability, feasibility, viability framework to the development of preventative interventions with the potential for large scale impact. Then, in a case study, I present a method for evaluating the desirability, feasibly, and viability of preventative interventions. \n\nImplications from the current dissertation indicate a need for longitudinal research on sexual victimization risk factors, because risk factors that precede the social problem may be targeted with preventative interventions. I propose that preventionists may use the desirability, feasibility, viability framework to increase the potential of their interventions for large scale impact. In addition, I suggest that future sexual violence prevention efforts should focus on preventing revictimization, vary intervention settings, and disseminate effective preventative interventions prior to the college transition. Preventionists should consider the multiple stages of translational research in their work to rapidly turn scientific findings into public health impact.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14871], "author_name_tesi": "Waterman, Emily Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Waterman", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eva S.

In particular, we assess the capabilities of an atmospheric GCM for detecting large scale and localized conditions for TCG across the North Atlantic Main Development Region (MDR: 9\u00b0-21\u00b0N, 20\u00b0-80\u00b0W) on 10-day and 15-day timescales.  We also evaluate sub-seasonal variability, estimated as the standard deviation of daily data, as a predictive tool for TCG likelihood. Using the NCEP/NCAR and ERA-40 reanalysis datasets as a benchmark this study assesses GCM daily output from a 4-member ensemble of the Community Atmospheric Model version 3.1 (CAM3.1) forced with observed monthly sea-surface temperatures over the period June-September 1981-2000.\nWe identify 17 thermodynamic and dynamic TCG variables as potential predictors. From these variables, we create four categories: thermodynamic-convective, dynamic-environmental, dynamic-rotational, and combined thermodynamic-dynamic. Overall, the GCM ensemble exhibits skill at simulating large-scale TCG environments on the seasonal scale and localized TCG environments on the daily scale. To assess sub-seasonal variability of each TCG variable, MDR-averaged 10-day and 15-day standardized deviation anomalies are calculated across the CAM3.1 and ERA-40 datasets.  Comparisons of results from a principal component analysis (PCA) applied to CAM3.1 and ERA-40 data indicate that CAM3.1 identifies similar independent predictors for the thermodynamic-convective and dynamic-environmental categories. However, in the dynamic-rotational category, CAM3.1 is unable to capture vertical relative vorticity gradient variability. When the thermodynamic-dynamic category is evaluated, dynamic-rotational terms show larger variance in CAM3.1 compared to other categories while equal levels of variance are seen in ERA-40. To assess predictive skill of TCG occurrences, a logistic regression technique is implemented on the ERA-40 data and corresponding TCG events. Sub-seasonal variability on 15-day timescales performs well as a diagnostic tool for TCG occurrences, yielded high accuracy (68.1-78.8%) and moderate precision (37.5-71.4%) totals, however, threat scores are considerably lower (5.6-42.4%).

In a review of the literature comparing traditional dissection and vivisection lessons to alternative lessons designed to reduce the time spent dissecting or the numbers of animals used, we conclude that it is difficult to come to any conclusion regarding the efficacy of different approaches. An analysis of the literature is confounded because many studies have very low statistical power or other methodological weaknesses, and investigators rely on a wide variety of testing instruments to measure an equally varied number of course objectives. Additional well designed studies are necessary before educators can reach any informed conclusions about the efficacy of traditional versus alternative approaches to laboratory education. In our experiments, we compared a traditional cat dissection based undergraduate human anatomy lesson to an alternative where students sculpted human muscles onto plastic human skeletons. Students in the alternative treatment performed significantly better than their peers in the traditional treatment when answering both lower and higher order human anatomy questions. In a subsequent experiment with a similar design, we concluded that the superior performance of the students in the alternative treatment on anatomy exams was likely due to the similarity between the human anatomy representation studied in lab, and the human anatomy questions asked on the exams. When the anatomy questions were presented in the context of a cat specimen, students in the traditional cat dissection treatment outperformed their peers in the alternative treatment. In a final experiment where student performance on a human anatomy exam was compared between a traditional prosected human cadaver treatment and the alternative clay sculpting treatment, no significant difference were detected, suggesting that the complexity or simplicity of the anatomy representation is less important than the similarity between the learning experience and the testing experience.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2987], "author_name_tesi": "Waters, John R", "last_name_ssi": "Waters", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Bruce Mitchell", "Richard Cyr", "Simon Gilroy", "Peggy Noel Van Meter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Bruce Mitchell, Committee Chair", "Richard Cyr, Committee Member", "Simon Gilroy, Committee Member", "Peggy Noel Van Meter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["clay", "prosection", "laboratory education", "alternative", "dissection", "teaching", "attitudes"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "PEPTIDE-MHC-STABILITY DETERMINES THE SIZE OF THE CD8+ T CELL RESPONSE TOWARD AN IMMUNORECESSIVE TUMOR ANTIGEN DETERMINANT\n", "id": "11971", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "306", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "CD8+ T cells recognize peptide-determinants bound to major histocompatibility complex class-I (MHC-I) molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells.  Differences in the number of T cells responding to various peptide-determinants often results in the establishment of an immunodominance hierarchy in which T cells specific for one or more determinants predominate the overall response.  T cells specific for determinants that mount a strong response are termed immunodominant whereas weaker responses are termed subdominant, cryptic or immunorecessive.  A relationship between the affinity of peptide-determinants for MHC molecules and the size of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses has been well established since the early 1990\u2019s.  Specifically, a few studies have established that the dissociation rate of peptides from their MHC complex (pMHC-stability) correlates strongly with immunodominance; those determinants that have a slow dissociation rate (high pMHC-stability) are generally dominant while rapid dissociation rates (low pMHC-stability) are often subdominant.  However, the mechanism(s) that connect pMHC-stability and immunodominance is largely unknown.  \n\nUsing the virus-derived oncoprotein SV40 Large Tumor-Antigen (TAg) as a model we have addressed the relationship between pMHC-stability and immunodominance.  TAg encodes four H-2b-restricted CD8+ T cell determinants, sites I, II/III, IV and V.  Upon immunization with TAg, a well characterized CD8+ T cell immunodominance hierarchy is established such that IV>I>II/III; responses to site V TAg (489-497) are only detected following the deletion or inactivation of the other three determinants.  The availability of T cell antigen receptor (TCR) transgenic mice that produce T cells specific for sites I and V make these determinants well suited for characterizing the differences between immunodominant and immunorecessive determinants. \n \nThe immunorecessive nature of site V is due in part to inefficient cross-priming of na\u00efve site V-specific T cells such that only a fraction of na\u00efve site V-specific T cells undergo priming.  In contrast, nearly all site I-specific T cells undergo cross-priming in response to the same immunization.  The cause of this discrepancy is unknown.  However, site V forms low-stability pMHC whereas site I forms high-stability pMHC.  Thus, it may be the low-stability of site V that results in inefficient cross-priming.  The contribution of pMHC-stability to the regulation of na\u00efve T cell cross-priming has never been directly addressed in the TAg system or others.  Thus, in this study we have investigated whether the pMHC-stability of site V affects site V-specific T cell cross-priming.\n\nIn order to address this question, we identified two point mutants, Q489A and G490A, which enhanced the pMHC-stability of site V and conserved epitope recognition by site V-specific T cells.  We incorporated the mutations into TAg and produced immortalized cell lines.  Immunization with Q489A or G490A cell lines resulted in a detectable endogenous site V-specific T cell response.  This is the first time that an endogenous site V-specific T cell response has been observed following immunization with cell lines expressing the three dominant TAg determinants.  Thus Q489A and G490A overcame the immunorecessive nature of site V.  Our data suggest that this novel phenotype results from two distinct mechanisms:\n\n1) As pMHC-stability increases, so does the efficiency of na\u00efve T cell cross-priming such that a greater fraction of na\u00efve site V-specific T cells undergo activation.\n\n2) As pMHC-stability increases, so does the duration of site V-specific T cell cross-priming, driving enhanced accumulation of responding T cells.\n\nOur results indicate that following immunization with TAg immortalized cell lines approximately one-third of TCR transgenic T cells specific for site V (TCR-V cells) undergo cross-priming.  In contrast, immunization with cell lines expressing Q489A or G490A TAg results in a two fold increase in the number of TCR-V cells that undergo cross-priming.  Using a highly sensitive T cell magnetic-enrichment protocol, we demonstrate for the first time that TAg immortalized cells prime previously undetectable populations of endogenous site V-specific T cells.  Although technical limitations hinder direct determination of the efficiency of endogenous site V-specific T cell priming, extrapolation of our data suggests that endogenous site V-specific T cells also experience inefficient cross-priming.  Altogether, our results suggest that pMHC-stability determines the fraction of site V-specific T cells that is cross-primed.\n\nOur results also suggest that the size of the site V-specific T cell response increases as the duration of detectable cross-priming increases.  Our results indicate that the window for cross-priming of TCR-V cells is limited to approximately 24-48 hours.  In contrast, cross-priming of TCR transgenic T cells specific for site I (TCR-I) is detected for at least seven days.  We demonstrate that the Q489A and G490A substitutions resulted in an increase in the duration of site V-specific T cell cross-priming.  Using two independent methods, our results suggest a direct relationship between the duration of site V-specific T cell cross-priming and the size of the site V-specific T cell response.  We find that the duration of cross-priming determines the size of the T cell response via enhanced T cell accumulation of site V-specific T cells.  Thus, our results suggest that pMHC-stability determines the size of the site V-specific T cell response by determining the duration of site V-specific T cell cross-priming.\n\nThe results presented in this study suggest that pMHC-stability determines the size of the site V-specific T cell response by first determining the efficiency of na\u00efve T cell cross-priming and subsequently facilitating the accumulation of activated T cells.  Thus, the low peptide-MHC stability of site V contributes to its immunorecessive nature by reducing the fraction of T cells that are cross-primed and limiting their expansion.  Our findings have implications for the optimization of T cell responses toward subdominant and immunorecessive determinants in the context of multivalent vaccines.  Such optimization is critical for the successful development of tumor immunotherapy strategies and progress toward viral vaccines that limit immune escape.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [302], "author_name_tesi": "Watson, Alan Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Watson", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Alan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Todd Schell", "Todd Schell", "Neil David Christensen", "David Joseph Spector", "Mary E Truckenmiller", "Ronald Paul Wilson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Todd Schell, Dissertation Advisor", "Todd Schell, Committee Chair", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Mary E Truckenmiller, Committee Member", "Ronald Paul Wilson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Antigen Presentation", "Cross-Priming", "Peptide MHC Stability", "Peptide", "T cell", "SV40 T Antigen", "Tumor", "Cancer", "Mouse"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Thalamostriatal Circuit Mechanisms for Controlling Sensorimotor Habits and Related Behaviors", "id": "n296wz12m", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12271", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent studies demonstrate that the integrity of thalamostriatal projections are compromised in a number of complex movement disorders and suggest the thalamus as a possible site for therapeutic interventions.

However, the influence these thalamic nuclei exert on the basal ganglia system, and whether any brain regions coordinate these nuclei in any causal fashion is unknown.  An anatomical study from our laboratory illustrates that whereas Pf projects ubiquitously throughout the striatum, thalamostriatal projections from POm exclusively project to the sensorimotor sector, or the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) in rodents.

A follow-up study found that the superior colliculus exerts bilateral opposing influences on these thalamic nuclei by activating Pf concomitant with suppression of activity in POm.  Inhibiting thalamic projection neurons from POm attenuate sensory-evoked responses in DLS.  Stimulating these thalamostriatal projections from POm causes inhibition of spontaneous activity in SNr putatively by activating direct pathway medium spiny neurons in caudal DLS.  Additional neuroanatomical tracing experiments provided a potential circuit mechanism explaining the inhibition seen in SNr when stimulating POm in that striatonigral neurons do not intermingle with striatopallidal neurons in caudal DLS, with the former set of neurons potentially subserving the direct pathway.  Collectively, our findings demonstrate that POm is an important thalamic contributor of somatosensory information to DLS and could constitute a circuit that acts through the direct pathway of the basal ganglia to initiate and maintain sensorimotor habits.  Placement of DBS electrodes in ZI, therefore, could enhance the interactions between POm and DLS to reinstate voluntary movements and automated behaviors found to be disrupted in Parkinson\u2019s patients.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12857], "author_name_tesi": "Watson, Glenn ", "last_name_ssi": "Watson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Glenn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin Douglas Alloway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin Douglas Alloway, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Habits", "superior colliculus", "zona incerta", "thalamus", "Posteromedial nucleus", "Parafascicular nucleus", "Thalamostriatal", "basal ganglia", "Parkinson's", "Dorsolateral striatum"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Increasing Vocolization in Students with Autism\n", "id": "11850", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2903", "abstract_tesi": "The Kaufman word series program is a set of techniques that involves reinforcement of successive approximation and employs phonological processes to simplify words to teach the adult form.

This is no different in reactor safety analysis.  The problem of analyzing a nuclear reactor for design basis accidents is performed by a handful of computer codes each solving a portion of the problem.  The reactor thermal hydraulic response to an event is determined using a system code like TRAC RELAP Advanced Computational Engine (TRACE).  The core power response to the same accident scenario is determined using a core physics code like Purdue Advanced Core Simulator (PARCS).  Containment response to the reactor depressurization in a Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA) type event is calculated by a separate code.  Sub-channel analysis is performed with yet another computer code.  This is just a sample of the computer codes used to solve the overall problems of nuclear reactor design basis accidents.  Traditionally each of these codes operates independently from each other using only the global results from one calculation as boundary conditions to another.  Industry\u2019s drive to uprate power for reactors has motivated analysts to move from a conservative approach to design basis accident towards a best estimate method.  To achieve a best estimate calculation efforts have been aimed at coupling the individual physics models to improve the accuracy of the analysis and reduce margins.  The current coupling techniques are sequential in nature.  During a calculation time-step data is passed between the two codes.  The individual codes solve their portion of the calculation and converge to a solution before the calculation is allowed to proceed to the next time-step.  This thesis presents a fully implicit method of simultaneous solving the neutron balance equations, heat conduction equations and the constitutive fluid dynamics equations.  It discusses the problems involved in coupling different physics phenomena within multi-physics codes and presents a solution to these problems.  The thesis also outlines the basic concepts behind the nodal balance equations, heat transfer equations and the thermal hydraulic equations, which will be coupled to form a fully implicit nonlinear system of equations.\n\nThe coupling of separate physics models to solve a larger problem and improve accuracy and efficiency of a calculation is not a new idea, however implementing them in an implicit manner and solving the system simultaneously is.  Also the application to reactor safety codes is new and has not be done with thermal hydraulics and neutronics codes on realistic applications in the past.  The coupling technique described in this thesis is applicable to other similar coupled thermal hydraulic and core physics reactor safety codes.  This technique is demonstrated using coupled input decks to show that the system is solved correctly and then verified by using two derivative test problems based on international benchmark problems the OECD/NRC Three mile Island (TMI) Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) problem (representative of pressurized water reactor analysis) and the OECD/NRC Peach Bottom (PB) Turbine Trip (TT) benchmark (representative of boiling water reactor analysis).\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2756], "author_name_tesi": "Watson, Justin Kyle", "last_name_ssi": "Watson", "middle_name_ssi": "Kyle", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "John Harlan Mahaffy", "Yousry Y Azmy", "Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov", "Vicent A Mousseau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Dissertation Advisor", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Chair", "John Harlan Mahaffy, Committee Chair", "Yousry Y Azmy, Committee Member", "Maria Nikolova Avramova, Committee Member", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov, Committee Member", "Vicent A Mousseau, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multi-Physics", "Time-Integration", "Implicit", "Coupled Codes"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Executive Overconfidence and Financial Reporting of Unrecognized Tax Benefits", "id": "19726", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9344", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I examine how executive overconfidence influences mandatory financial accounting estimates using a powerful setting containing significant managerial discretion: the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs).

As an added benefit, the organic matter used in the system can come from waste streams that would need to be treated, often by energy consuming processes. There are several studies investigating power production from pure culture communities as well as studies using mixed cultures for power production, but very few studies actually comparing power production from both mixed culture and pure culture communities. The dissimilatory metal reducing bacterium (DMRB) Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 has been used as a model bacterium in MFC studies, but there may be a bacterium (or consortia of bacteria) that is better suited for power production in MFCs.\nIn this study, power densities from undefined mixed cultures obtained from a wastewater treatment facility, as well as from a pure culture of the facultative anaerobe S. oneidensis MR-1, were compared in cube shaped, 1-bottle, 2-bottle, and 3-bottle batch-fed MFC reactor configurations. Results show that the mixed culture produced 68 to 480% more power than S. oneidensis MR-1 in MFCs. The mixed culture produced the maximum power density of 858\u00b19 mW m-2, while the MR-1 culture produced a maximum of 332\u00b121 mW m-2 in a 1-bottle MFC. The difference in power production was the result of the decreased internal resistance in the mixed culture MFC compared to the internal resistance obtained with the MR-1 anode community.  \nOxidation-reduction potentials (ORP) were measured to help analyze the environmental conditions within the MFCs during power production. The results show that the environment that the bacteria are subjected to in the anode chamber can fluctuate from a reductive to an oxidative environment during the batch cycle. Power production decreased as the redox environment became more positive at the end of each cycle. However, the mixed culture MFCs produced more power than the MR-1 MFCs even though the redox environment was less negative. Considering this significant difference in power production as well as the limitations of substrate oxidation encountered by MR-1, there may be microorganisms that are more important for power production than S. oneidensis MR-1. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6400], "author_name_tesi": "Watson, Valerie J", "last_name_ssi": "Watson", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Valerie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microbial Fuel Cell"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Characterization and Performance of Activated Carbon Catalysts and Polymer Membrane Layers for Microbial Fuel Cell Cathodes and an Analysis of Power Overshoot", "id": "16939", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8510", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a promising technology for treatment of wastewater streams in combination with electricity production. Commercialization and implementation of MFCs could eliminate the large energy consumption common in traditional wastewater treatment and allow for the utilization of this untapped renewable energy source. Polarization curves from microbial fuel cells (MFCs) often show unexpectedly large drops in voltage with increased current densities, leading to a phenomenon in the power density curve referred to as \u201cpower overshoot\u201d. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV, 1 mV s\u22121) and variable external resistances (at fixed intervals of 20 min) over a single fed-batch cycle in an MFC both resulted in power overshoot in power density curves due to anode potentials. Increasing the anode enrichment time from 30 days to 100 days did not eliminate overshoot, suggesting that insufficient enrichment of the anode biofilm was not the primary cause. Running the reactor at a fixed resistance for a full fed-batch cycle (~1 to 2 days), however, completely eliminated the overshoot. These results show that acclimation at low fixed resistances are needed to stabilize current generation by bacteria in MFCs, and that even relatively slow LSV scan rates and long times between switching circuit loads during a fed-batch cycle may produce inaccurate polarization and power density results for these biological systems. \nMembrane separators reduce oxygen flux from the cathode into the anolyte in MFCs, but water accumulation and pH gradients between the separator and cathode reduces performance. To avoid these problems, air cathodes were spray-coated (water-facing side) with anion exchange, cation exchange, and neutral polymer coatings of different thicknesses to incorporate the separator into the cathode structure. The anion exchange polymer coating resulted in greater power density (1167 \u00b1 135 mW m\u22122) than a cation exchange coating (439 \u00b1 2 mW m\u22122). This power output was similar to that produced by a Nafion-coated cathode (1114 \u00b1 174 mW m\u22122), and slightly lower than the uncoated cathode (1384 \u00b1 82 mW m\u22122). Thicker coatings reduced oxygen diffusion into the electrolyte and increased coulombic efficiency (CE = 56 \u2013 64%) relative to an uncoated cathode (29 \u00b1 8%), but decreased power production (255\u2013574 mW m\u22122). Electrochemical characterization of the cathodes using abiotic anodes in separate reactors showed that the cathodes with the lowest charge transfer resistance and the highest oxygen reduction activity produced the most power in MFC tests. The results using hydrophilic cathode separator layers revealed a tradeoff between power and CE. Cathodes coated with a thin coating of anion exchange polymer showed the most promise for controlling oxygen transfer while minimally affecting power production.\nPlatinum is commonly used as the catalyst in MFC cathodes, but platinum is an expensive and limited resource.  Activated carbon (AC) is a promising material for the replacement of platinum catalysts because it is inexpensive and can be made from renewable waste sources, but its catalytic performance in neutral solutions used in MFCs in not well understood. Commercially available AC powders made from different precursor materials (coal, peat, coconut shell, hardwood, and phenolic resin) were evaluated as oxygen reduction catalysts, and tested as cathode catalysts in MFCs. Carbons were characterized in terms of surface chemistry, specific surface area, and pore volume distribution, and kinetic activities were compared to carbon black and platinum catalysts using a rotating disk electrode (RDE). Cathodes using the coal\u2013derived AC had the highest maximum power densities in MFCs (1620 \u00b1 10 mW m\u20132) even though this AC had only average catalytic activity, measured by reduction onset potential (Eonset = 0.09 V),  and selectivity, based on number of electrons transferred (n = 2.4). This coal\u2013based AC also had the lowest specific surface area (550 m2 g\u20131) among the ACs tested. Peat\u2013based AC performed similarly in MFC tests (1610 \u00b1 100 mW m\u20132) but had the best catalyst performance (Eonset = 0.17 V, n = 3.6) in RDE tests and a lower than average specific surface area (810 m2 g\u20131). Hardwood based AC had the highest number of acidic surface functional groups and a higher specific surface area (1010 m2 g\u20131), but it had the poorest performance in MFC and catalyst tests (630 \u00b1 10 mW m\u20132, Eonset = \u20130.01V, n = 2.1).  There was a strong inverse relationship between onset potential and the quantity of strong acid (pKa < 8) functional groups, and a larger fraction of microporosity was negatively correlated with power production in MFCs. These results showed that surface area alone was a poor predictor of catalyst performance, and that a high quantity of acidic surface functional groups was detrimental to oxygen reduction and cathode performance.\nFour of the commercially available AC powders (peat, coconut shell, coal, and hardwood) were treated with ammonia gas at 700 \u00b0C in order to improve their performance as oxygen reduction catalysts. Ammonia treatment resulted in a decrease in oxygen (by 29 \u2013 58%) and an increase in nitrogen content (total abundance up to 1.8 atomic %) on the carbon surfaces, which also resulted in an increase in the basicity of the bituminous, peat, and hardwood ACs. The kinetic activity and selectivity of ammonia\u2013treated carbons were evaluated using a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE), and compared to untreated ACs and platinum. All of the ammonia\u2013treated ACs exhibited better catalytic performance than their untreated precursors, with the bituminous (treated, Eonset = 0.12 V, n = 3.9; untreated, Eonset = 0.08 V, n = 3.6) and hardwood (treated, Eonset = 0.03 V, n = 3.3; untreated, Eonset = \u20130.04 V, n =3.0) based samples showing the most improvement. These ACs were tested in MFC cathodes made by sandwiching the AC catalyst and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder mixture between two current collectors, one coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) diffusion layers on the air\u2013side, and the second one on the solution\u2013side used to improve power. Cathodes made from the ammonia\u2013treated coal-based AC had the one of the highest maximum power densities (2450 \u00b1 40 mW m\u20132). Even though the ammonia\u2013treated peat\u2013based AC had the greatest ORR activity in RRDE testing, the untreated sample had higher power production in the MFC tests (2360 \u00b1 230 mW m\u20132). The treated coconut and hardwood derived ACs outperformed the untreated precursor ACs in both electrochemical and MFC testing. These results show that reduction in oxygen abundance and increase in nitrogen functionalities on the surface of ACs can increase the catalytic performance for oxygen reduction in neutral media. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8405], "author_name_tesi": "Watson, Valerie J", "last_name_ssi": "Watson", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Valerie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "John Michael Regan", "Fred Scott Cannon", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Peggy Ann Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Dissertation Advisor", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Fred Scott Cannon, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microbial Fuel Cells", "Activated Carbon", "Oxygen Reduction", "Membrane-Cathode Assembly"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Targeting Sphingolipid Metabolism in Natural Killer Cell Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia\n", "id": "12502", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5221", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a rare disorder characterized by clonal expansion of cytotoxic lymphocytes.  LGL cells play an integral role in the immune system and are divided into two major lineages of CD3- NK cells and CD3+ T cells that circulate throughout the blood in search of infected cells, in which they make contact through a receptor ligand to induce cell death.  LGL cells are also programmed to undergo apoptosis after contact with an infected target cell; however they continue to survive in individuals with LGL leukemia.  This unchecked proliferation and cytotoxicity of LGL in patients results in autoimmunity or malignancy.  Although rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune condition seen in individuals with LGL leukemia, it is also associated with a wide spectrum of other autoimmune diseases.  Patients may also suffer from other hematological conditions including hemolytic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, and neutropenia which lead to fatigue and recurrent bacterial infections.  Currently, the only established treatment involves a low dose of an immunosuppressive regimen in combination with Methotrexate, approximately 40-50% of patients are either resistant or do not respond.  As a result, no effective treatment exists, thus producing the need for novel therapeutics to be identified.  \nThe sphingolipid metabolism network has been identified as deregulated in LGL leukemia.  Lipidomic studies revealed deregulated sphingolipid metabolism as evidenced by decreased levels of overall ceramide species and increased levels of glycoslyated ceramides in leukemic NK cells, concomitant with increased glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) expression. GCS, a key enzyme of this pathway, neutralizes pro-apoptotic ceramide by transfer of a UDP-glucose.  Thus, we treated both rat and human leukemic NK cells in combination with: 1) exogenous C6-ceramide incorporated into nanoliposomes in order to target mitochondria and increase physiological pro-apoptotic levels of long chain ceramide, and 2) 1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP), an inhibitor of GCS.  Co-administration of C6-ceramide nanoliposomes and PPMP elicited an increase in endogenous long-chain ceramide species, which led to cellular apoptosis in a synergistic manner via the mitochondrial intrinsic cell death pathway in leukemic NK cells.  These results suggest that targeting ceramide metabolism may be an effective and novel strategy for treatment of NK-LGL leukemia.    \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5196], "author_name_tesi": "Watters, Rebecca Jean", "last_name_ssi": "Watters", "middle_name_ssi": "Jean", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Loughran", "Thomas Loughran", "Xin Liu", "Charles H Lang", "Lisa M Shantz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Loughran, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Loughran, Committee Chair", "Xin Liu, Committee Chair", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["NK LGL Leukemia", "nanoliposomes", "ceramide", "sphingolipid"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Predicting Free Time Activity Involvement of Adolescents:The Influence of Adolescent Motivation, Adolescent Initiative, and Perceptions of Parenting", "id": "6368", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "979", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Guided by Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the purpose of this study was to examine the influence of adolescent motivation, adolescent initiative, and perceptions of parenting practices on adolescent activity choices.

The structure and rules that parents enact are most beneficial when they are highly involved and supportive of their child\u2019s autonomy in free time. This type of environment is linked to internal motivation styles, or the internalization of motivation styles, that are conducive to the development of initiative.

Multiple facets of environmental change, such as climatic shifts and increases or declines in large fauna, can interact to produce additive or counteracting effects on vegetation. Altered composition and dominance patterns in plant communities can, in turn, have consequences for ecosystem functioning through, for example, modification of biogeochemical processes or regional climate patterns. Global scale climate change has already strongly impacted the makeup and dynamics of ecological systems. The northern tundra biome is expected to undergo large changes, which previously have and likely will affect human wellbeing into the future. Thus, the tundra ecosystems of the Low Arctic provide the context within which my dissertation expands our understanding of ecological responses to environmental change.\nUnderstanding how facets of global change, such as warming or human overexploitation of animal resources, affect plant communities in arctic tundra requires understanding responses across life history stages. In this dissertation, I have sought to address gaps in our knowledge related to the role of reproductive processes in contributing to the dynamical patterns that have become evident. In the chapters that follow, I identify the importance of accounting for individualistic species responses to change, and I further suggest that the similar patterns among arctic plant species within a functional group may be the consequence of different underlying processes.\nI begin this dissertation by providing some background on global change and the ensuing shifts in the Arctic biome. I then discuss how a warming climate influences the niches of arctic plants and what the consequences of these changes are for biodiversity in tundra ecosystems. One key demographic parameter that can mediate species\u2019 responses to change is the regeneration niche. In Chapter 2, I addressed two of the earlier stages of the regeneration niche, the production of viable seed and germination, in an experimental context to bridge the gap between the effects of environmental change on established and establishing individuals. I hypothesized that the reproductive responses of arctic plant species to change would be species-specific and poorly predicted by plant functional type. I manipulated temperature and precipitation over three years in a factorial design and also sampled grazed and exclosed plots. The interannual variation in seed mass and germination appeared to reflect weather in those years for several species, and the effect sizes of this variation were similar to those of the warming, watering, and herbivore exclusion treatments. Grazing only affected graminoid species, but these effects were positive for some graminoids and negative for others. Both warming and watering as well as their interaction led to individualistic effects among species belonging to several different functional types, suggesting that some uses of these latter classifications are unlikely to result in reliable predictive generalities. Additionally, a few species demonstrated contrasting effects of warming and watering across years, suggesting these species are near thresholds for successful sexual reproduction. Such thresholds can occur when environmental conditions preclude plants or plant parts from attaining a minimum size required to complete reproduction.\nThe potential existence of such thresholds indicates that amelioration of abiotic stressors, such as temperature minima that can reduce survival or fecundity, as a result of warming in the Arctic may lead to increases in sexual reproduction and recruitment. In Chapter 3, I addressed the relative contributions of sexual recruitment and asexual spread in populations of Salix glauca, a deciduous shrub increasing in abundance in many tundra landscapes, distributed along an environmental gradient comprising a shift maritime to continental climates. I hypothesized that landscapes with warmer summers would have greater evidence of sexual recruitment. To test this, I located sites that appeared to have increased in shrub cover in recent decades and collected leaf samples from neighboring ramets (stems). I found evidence that sexual recruitment occurs universally across this gradient, but the proportion of sexual recruits, inferred from the uniqueness of their genotypes, was greater in the inland landscapes that experience a continental climate, supporting my hypothesis. Additionally, I demonstrated that the probability of a ramet arising from clonal growth increases where neighbors are larger and vegetative cover is greater, suggesting light is a limiting factor for recruitment from seed.\nThe above results suggest that the responses of arctic plant communities to climatic change are shaped by the variable responses in growth and reproduction among species. This interspecific variation can lead to shifts in patterns of plant community diversity. While recent syntheses suggest species diversity at small spatial scales has not declined in a range of ecosystems in recent years, I documented the potential for notable declines in the diversity of local assemblages of mixed shrub-graminoid tundra. In Chapter 4, I demonstrate that warming increases the accumulation of biomass, resulting in eventual declines in taxonomic diversity approximately one decade after a disruptive caterpillar outbreak. In particular, shrub abundance was negatively associated with forb richness under warming, but only when large herbivores were experimentally excluded. Additionally, the nature of the relationship between biomass and taxonomic richness went from positive in grazed and unwarmed plots to unimodal in exclosed, warmed plots. Warming thus led to increased biomass, but this only resulted in decreased local diversity in the absence of ungulate herbivory.\nThe expansion of woody shrubs in the Arctic has become a particular focal point of research, but there remain many unknowns. In Chapter 5, I highlight the contributions of these studies to our current understanding and put them in the context of ongoing research on the causes and consequences plant community responses to global change. This dissertation adds to our understanding of the possible changes in tundra vegetation that may ensue in a warmer Arctic.

The latter are potential sources of biofuel; however, the extraction of lignin from PCWs, which must occur before biofuel production, is costly and difficult. Lignin formation involves abiotic, random free radical additions of phenylpropanoids. Better understanding the structure, formation, and interactions of lignin could aid in PCW degradation during biofuel production. This work used density functional theory (DFT) computational chemistry calculations to study the structure and formation mechanisms that can occur in lignin, and the ability of DFT methods to predict energetically favorable hydrogen bonding and other intermolecular interactions for PCW materials.\nOne study calculated accurate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts of common lignin linkages. These results showed that mPW1PW91/6-31G(d) NMR calculations, when used in conjunction with a multi-standard approach (benzene for sp2 C and H and methanol for sp3 C and H) produced results that accurately matched the experimental chemical shifts for common lignin linkages. A second study proposed reaction mechanisms for the formation of non-cyclic \u03b1-linkages; the most favorable mechanism matched the one predicted by experimentalists.

An incubation pull-down assay was devised by mixing various concentrations of trypsinized BNC with a constant amount of functionalized sepharose beads conjugated with hyaluronic acid (HA). Following incubation of BNC digests with the HA-derived beads, a fractional binding profile was established for a range of digest-to-bead proportions. Elution of the beads with 2M NaCl and 4M GCl showed most HABP binding activity coming off with 2M NaCl. Total protein and fractional binding values were determined with Bradford assay and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, respectively. From these results, a mass elution scheme was prepared to follow a step-wise washing pattern proportional to ionic strength. This allowed protein yield and specific binding amounts to be calculated. Conjugation efficiency of the derived sepharose beads was determined by measuring the difference in refractive index (RI) between the supernatant and the initial solution concentration of added 64kDa HA. The refractive indices of a stock solution of HA were used to construct a standard curve to calculate HA (w/v) % of the supernatant. Calculation of HABP binding values was determined using the protein concentrations eluted with 2M NaCl as they were found to be statistically more significant than the 4M GCl rinses (P<0.01).\nA minimum of three percent conjugation was calculated from a standard conjugation assay with non-degraded 64kDa HA and functionalized sepharose beads. Trypsinized HABPs from BNC were found to have a MWw of 53.4 kDa, a Kd of 7.235x10-8M and a total binding-site concentration ([TBS]) of 1.775x10-6M with most of the binding activity residing in the 47kDa link protein. Total specific binding activity gave a yield of 1.18% deduced from the mass-elution procedure.\niii\nThe current project was focused around methods and results previously reported (Tengblad, 1978). Using conventional liquid affinity chromatography, specific binding activity was washed out in the 4M GCl fraction. Two species are commonly found to bind to HA after being extracted from trypsinized BNC: a 45kDa link protein and a 90kDa proteoglycan monomer. Three bands were analyzed with the current incubation pull-down method that contributed to the overall calculation of the weighted molecular-weight average: 97kDa, 65kDa and 47kDa. This approach was derived from previous reports, and MW differences were due to the higher concentration of acrylamide used to run the reducing PAGE. Liquid chromatography remains to be the best procedure in order to enhance the purity of the sample for proper in-vivo experimentation and interpretation of conjugative biochemical results.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [743], "author_name_tesi": "Weaver, Bret Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Weaver", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Bret", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herbert Herling Lipowsky", "Herbert Herling Lipowsky"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herbert Herling Lipowsky, Thesis Advisor", "Herbert Herling Lipowsky, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bovine Nasal Cartilage", "Hyaluronic Acid Binding Proteins"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Growth Rate of Periodic orbits for Geodesic Flows on Surfaces with Regions of Positive Curvature", "id": "8519", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "631", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We construct a Margulis measure on the unit tangent bundle of compact surfaces that have regions of positive curvature.

Within the U.S., depression the rate of depression is on the rise, affecting more than 16 million adults each year (National Institute of Mental Health, 2016), many of whom are actively involved in the workforce. Employees who have depression may experience limitations at work as a result of their disorder, which in turn can affect organizational effectiveness in terms of increased rates of absenteeism and presenteeism (Sanderson & Andrews, 2006). Recent estimates posit that employees with depression create an economic burden for employees to the tune of billions of dollars each year. \nDespite mounting evidence that depression reflects a serious concern for both employers and employees, organizational scholars have thus far paid inadequate attention to the study of employees with depression. That is, there exist very few empirical studies in the industrial and organizational (I/O) psychology or management fields that have focused exclusively on employees with depression. If meaningful progress is to be made in reducing the individual and economic workplace-related costs of depression, increased scholarly attention to this group of employees is critically needed. This dissertation aims to lay a foundation for the study of employees with depression, thereby drawing attention to this population of workers that has traditionally been excluded from the organizational literature.\nUtilizing a mixed method design, this dissertation examined the work experiences of employees with depression as a means to better understand how having depression affected their work-related behaviors. The first study of this dissertation explored the extent to which depression was integrated into individuals' personal identities at work, the strategies by which this identity was managed in the workplace, as well as the motives for why certain strategies are enacted by individuals with depression. To address these research objectives, a qualitative methodology involving in-depth interviews with employees with depression was applied. Both data collection and analysis were guided by a grounded theory approach which allowed for in-depth understanding of the \"lived experiences\" of those who suffer from depression. The results of the first study extended theoretical conceptualizations of identity management processes and strategies related to concealable identities. From the data analysis process, three distinct disclosure decisions emerged: non-disclosure, partial disclosure, and full disclosure. Within each disclosure decision, specific strategies through which individuals managed their depression at work were identified. In addition to disclosure decisions, the results demonstrated that motives for disclosure or concealment could be categorized as either approach- or avoid-focused depending on the outcomes on which participants concentrated. Importantly, approach and avoid motives were employed across disclosure decisions, such that individuals, at times, concealed for positive reasons and disclosed for negative reason. These results challenge existing assumptions that disclosure is always enacted for positive reasons or is beneficial to all individuals. \nThe second study of this dissertation built upon the findings from Study 1 and drew upon the theory of approach-avoidance motivation (Elliott, 1999) to quantitatively test how employees' motives for managing their identities at work influencde work-related behaviors (i.e., presenteeism, engagement). Further, Study 2 tested the extent to which organizational factors shaped employees' identity management motives, thereby implicating organizations as influential in the formation of employees' identity management motives and subsequent behaviors. The results demonstrated that for individuals who disclosed or concealed, approach motives were related to work engagement, while for those who disclosed, avoid motives predicted presenteeism. Such findings help to support the notion that motives for disclosure and non-disclosure may be instrumental in shaping employees' outcomes (as compared to only considering the actual disclosure decision). Even more, the results from Study 2 showed that organizational factors were instrumental in shaping whether or not individuals employed approach or avoid-based motives for disclosure and non-disclosure. The organizational environment may, therefore, influence employees' beliefs about gains and losses associated with disclosure decisions, and is important in helping employees with depression to positively manage their identities at work.\nTogether, Study 1 and Study 2 increased our understanding of employees' disclosure decisions, strategies by which those decisions are enacted, and motives for either disclosing or not disclosing one's depression at work. Both theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed in detail. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15407], "author_name_tesi": "Weaver, Kayla B", "last_name_ssi": "Weaver", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Kayla", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kisha Shannon Jones", "Kisha Shannon Jones", "Samuel Todd Hunter", "Alicia Ann Grandey", "Stanley Morris Gully"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kisha Shannon Jones, Dissertation Advisor", "Kisha Shannon Jones, Committee Chair", "Samuel Todd Hunter, Committee Member", "Alicia Ann Grandey, Committee Member", "Stanley Morris Gully, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["depression", "employees with mental illness", "identity management", "stigma", "disclosure"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Masculinity and the Justification of Social Inequality", "id": "18752", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8807", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Existing theory and research suggest that masculinity is a precarious identity, which when threatened can lead to aggressive and hostile behaviors, especially toward nontraditional women and gay men.  Relatedly, endorsement of traditional masculinity norms has been found to predict negative attitudes toward women and gay men and greater acceptance of group-based inequality.  The current research expands on these previous findings by examining how threats to masculinity may lead to acts of discrimination (Study 1) and greater acceptance of social inequality (Study 2) regarding women and gay men.  Across studies, male college students were asked to take a test about gender knowledge and feedback was altered to either threaten or assure their masculinity.  Following the test, men either allocated money to different student organizations (Study 1) or indicated their acceptance of discrimination and group-based inequality in society (Study 2).  In both studies endorsement of traditional masculinity norms and identification with gender were measured as potential moderators.  The results of Study 1 showed an interaction such that when men who did not highly identify with their gender were threatened, they cut more money from a women\u2019s or gay men\u2019s organization than when they were assured.  The results of Study 2 showed that masculinity threat only directly led to denial of discrimination against gay men, though this effect seemed to be related to the salience of masculinity rather than threatened masculinity.  There were also interactions indicating that (a) men who were assured in their masculinity and highly endorsed traditional masculinity norms denied more discrimination against women and (b) men who were threatened and highly identified with their gender accepted more group-based inequality.

Across six studies, I examined how masculinity is implicated in how men embrace gamer identity, conceal gamer identity, and negatively treat women in gaming. In a correlational pilot study, gamer identity correlated with less gender role conflict and less acceptance of men\u2019s harassment of a female gamer, whereas concealment correlated with greater sexism and more acceptance of harassment. In Studies 1a and 1b, higher gamer identity prevented men from reacting to masculinity threats with increased acceptance of the harassment of a female gamer, and higher concealment again predicted more acceptance of harassment. In Studies 2 and 3, male gamers generally showed more positive treatment of female game developers, critics, and gamers, whereas concealment predicted mixed reactions and more gender stereotyping. In Study 4, gamer identity correlated with more positive views of gamers regardless of gender, whereas concealment correlated with more negative views of gamers and in particular a diminishment of female gamers\u2019 competence.

Teaching-as-Research involves using methods similar to those used in research (hypothesizing, implementing, analyzing, and modifying) to develop and apply teaching strategies. The case study involved thirteen instructors of undergraduates in a science department at a research university participating in an academic community of practice. \n\nWeick\u2019s theory of sensemaking (1993, 1995) provides the theoretical foundation for this study. Major concepts in the conceptual framework include individual characteristics, professional identity, community of practice, and sensemaking, both individual and collective. The study proposes relationships among these concepts, and explores how, over time, they interact to effect changes in the professional identities of individual instructors. The three research questions that are addressed include 1) How do the individual characteristics of participants in the community of practice, including rank, gender, ethnicity, experience and their professional identities affect communication within the community of practice; 2) How do characteristics of the community of practice, including norms, values, relative power of members, and the topics and types of communication, influence individual and collective sensemaking; and 3) How, if at all, are the professional identities of individual members modified by individual and collective sensemaking about a concept new to the community of practice? \n\nData collection involved interviews and observations. Initial interview questions focused on the individuals\u2019 personal characteristics, professional identities, and the characteristics of the group. Twelve sessions of the community of practice were observed, and during one of these sessions, members were introduced to the concept of Teaching-as-Research by an outside speaker. Final interviews elicited information about individuals\u2019 identity as a teacher, researcher, and integrated professional. Individuals were asked to define the term \u201cTeaching-as-Research\u201d during both interviews. In the final interviews, participants were also asked to discuss their opinions about how discussing the concept of Teaching-as-Research affected the community of practice as a whole.\n\nCommunication utterances were coded according to topic and type of communication as well as rank, gender, ethnicity, and experience. Data analysis involved construction of a profile for each participant, including their personal characteristics, perceptions of themselves as professionals, perceptions of the group process, and who they considered influential. Individual profiles also included summaries of communication patterns, including percent of contribution to total communication and percent of own communication by type and topic. Any changes in the participants\u2019 professional identities were ascertained from responses to identical questions during both the first and final interviews and then compared to observations of changes in their participation in the group over the duration of the study. Interviews were analyzed for individuals\u2019 perceptions about norms, values, communications, power, and sensemaking in the community of practice. \n\nFindings from this study related individual characteristics to participation in the community of practice; nature of participation to relative power within the community of practice; nature of group communication to collective sensemaking; and sensemaking to self-reported changes in professional identity. First, instructors in the midst of their careers participated more actively than those who were at the beginning or near the end of their careers. Second, instructors who were at their highest academic rank participated more actively in the community of practice than those members who were emeritus faculty members or tenure-ineligible. Third, an individual in a community of practice who initiated and contributed new conversations more than other members informally set the agenda by influencing which topics were discussed within the group. Fourth, collective sensemaking was more likely to occur when members of the group believed they needed to make and justify a decision. Finally, even though no consensus emerged from collective sensemaking about Teaching-as-Research, introduction to, and discussion of the concept encouraged individual sensemaking about the topic which led to self-reported change in professional identity among a majority of participants.  Those individuals who indicated they experienced some change in their professional identities because of conversations about Teaching-as-Research talked about the personal impact for them. Those who stated that the discussions about Teaching-as-Research had no effect on their professional identities did not talk about a connection between the concept and their teaching.\n\nBased on these findings, the research discusses implications and future research. For administrators who are trying to get a group of faculty members to adapt the concept of Teaching-as-Research, opportunities should be provided for the group to engage in collective sensemaking about the concept; e.g., the group should be encouraged to develop and commit to a plan of action that they can share explicitly and publicly.    \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3719], "author_name_tesi": "Weaver, Lisa Dawn", "last_name_ssi": "Weaver", "middle_name_ssi": "Dawn", "first_name_ssi": "Lisa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Carol L Colbeck", "Dr Lisa R Lattuca", "Peggy Noel Van Meter", "Renata S Engel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Carol L Colbeck, Committee Chair", "Dr Lisa R Lattuca, Committee Member", "Peggy Noel Van Meter, Committee Member", "Renata S Engel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sensemaking", "community of practice", "professional identity"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "HYDROLOGIC CONTROLS OF NUTRIENT FLUXES IN GLACIAL MELTWATER\nSTREAMS AT INTER-ANNUAL, SEASONAL, AND DAILY TIMESCALES\nIN THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS, ANTARCTICA\n\n\n\n", "id": "11568", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4343", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, glaciers are hydrologically linked to closed-basin lakes at the valley floor by glacial meltwater streams.  Streams flow through porous, well-defined channels with extensive chemically active hyporheic zones.  Temporally varying dynamics of meltwater generation and sub-stream thaw depth are thought to control the potential for the hyporheic zone and benthic communities to influence transport of nutrients and dissolved ions downstream.  Using the McMurdo LTER database, patterns in stream discharge, electrical conductivity (both with 15-minute sampling intervals), and solute chemistry (weekly sampling intervals) were examined on eight MDV streams from 1990-2008.  Discharge and electrical conductivity values were highly variable among streams.  Discharge values were highly dependent upon glacial source area, but meteorological and topographical complexities create large variability at all time scales.  The longer streams were found to have much higher electrical conductivity values than the shorter streams, suggesting that there are more opportunities for hyporheic weathering reactions along longer stream reaches.  Weekly sampled water solutes from each stream\u2019s entire record were plotted against the discharge recorded at the time when the sample was taken.  Silicate concentrations displayed a decreasing logarithmic relationship, while nutrient concentrations had no apparent relationship.  This suggests that with the exception to bioreactive solutes, the majority of hyporheic interactions could possibly be characterized by electrical conductivity and discharge.  To attain information on in-stream nutrient dynamics and nutrient fluxes, glacial source water at the upper reach of Green Creek and stream outlet water at the lower reach of Green Creek were sampled hourly for two separate diel periods during the 2008-09 austral summer.  Both dates were in late January under two distinct flow conditions (~0.5 L/s and ~10 L/s).  Under low flow conditions, nutrient cycling was found to be uptake dominated.  High flow conditions showed both uptake and regeneration with much higher nutrient loads, but as in the low flow conditions, no apparent temporal trends were found.  Nutrient concentrations could not be predicted using the two parameters of discharge and electrical conductivity with in-stream nutrient dynamics likely too complicated at the sub-daily scale.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4315], "author_name_tesi": "Weaver, Mitchell R", "last_name_ssi": "Weaver", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Mitchell", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael N Gooseff", "Michael N Gooseff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael N Gooseff, Thesis Advisor", "Michael N Gooseff, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["biogeochemistry", "chemical weathering", "hyporheic", "polar desert", "glaciers", "water chemistry", "solute chemistry", "stream chemistry", "nutrients", "nutrient fluxes", "hydrology", "glacial melt", "Antarctica", "McMurdo Dry Valleys", "MCM LTER", "streamflow", "discharge", "electrical conductivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Heat Transfer And Pressure Drop\nAugmentation In Micro Channels With Pin Fins\n\n\n\n", "id": "10757", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5512", "abstract_tesi": "Omitted for proprietary reasons\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5503], "author_name_tesi": "Weaver, Stephen A", "last_name_ssi": "Weaver", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Stephen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole, Thesis Advisor", "Karen Ann Thole, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["None"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Wampum As Social Practice\n", "id": "9414", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6449", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The return of thousands of Native American objects from museum collections to Native American communities was mandated by Public Law 101-601, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA, 104 STAT 3048, 1990).

As a result of NAGPRA, some museum artifacts indicating a past presence are now reinterpreted as living objects of cultural patrimony to contemporary Native American cultures.  The shift from past to present and from artifact to object of cultural patrimony suggest that objects like wampum are imbued with social practices.      \nMy research investigated the perspectives of five Native members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy for the purpose of identifying how wampum is interpreted within their community.  Through the methods of critical pedagogy, I analyzed traditional function of wampum, its use, and interpretations within the Mohawk and Onondaga communities of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Three themes arose from my study.  The first theme identified wampum as an object attached to the social practices through which the Haudenosaunee Confederacy sustain their beliefs, values, and history. Secondly, wampum is considered a living object within the community and therefore one that can relate to its environment much like other living entities. The final discovery was the identification of new interpretations of how wampum is used to represent contemporary cultural identities.    \n\tThe implications of my research are significant to my field of art education because art educators use objects to teach about Native American art and culture.  The reclassification of wampum from artifacts to living objects of cultural patrimony suggests that current pedagogy should be revisited to assure that contemporary information about wampum and the people who constructed it are authentically represented in art classrooms.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6448], "author_name_tesi": "Weaver, Victoria Valerie", "last_name_ssi": "Weaver", "middle_name_ssi": "Valerie", "first_name_ssi": "Victoria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christina Thompson & Kimberly Powell", "Brent Guy Wilson", "Joyce Henri Robinson", "Dr Christine Thompson", "Dr Kimberly Powell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christina Thompson & Kimberly Powell, Dissertation Advisor", "Brent Guy Wilson, Committee Member", "Joyce Henri Robinson, Committee Member", "Dr Christine Thompson, Committee Chair", "Dr Kimberly Powell, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["critical pedagogy", "Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation", "NAGPRA", "wampum", "artifact", "object of cultural patrimony", "Haudenosaunee Confederacy"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Evaluating the energy performance of historic and traditionally constructed buildings", "id": "13954alw350", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13954", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As newly constructed buildings are increasingly able to achieve very low and even net zero energy consumption targets, improving the energy performance of existing buildings has become a more pressing concern. Historic buildings represent a unique subgroup of the existing building stock. By definition, these buildings hold special societal significance. They were also constructed using materials and methods no longer common in contemporary building practice, and operated to meet thermal comfort conditions no longer considered acceptable. The need to maintain their significance and avoid damage to historic building fabric imposes additional constraints.\n\nSince the advent of building energy codes in the 1970s, the dominant approach to energy efficiency in historic buildings has been exemption. Early studies suggested that older buildings had lower energy consumption per square foot than newer ones, and preservationists have attributed this trend to the presence of \u201cinherent energy-saving features\u201d in these buildings. These findings, combined with the desire to preserve significance, led to the status quo in which historic buildings are exempt from energy codes, leaving open questions about appropriate target setting and energy retrofits.\n\nThis dissertation re-evaluates the dominant approach to energy efficiency in historic buildings using contemporary data and analysis methods. Each of the major parts of the established narrative are examined. First, the claim that older buildings use less energy is evaluated using a statistical model constructed from nationally representative data. Second, the concept of inherent energy-saving features is explored using a novel quantitative method. The method developed here combines building energy simulation with regionalized sensitivity analysis and tree-based classification models, and is demonstrated using a case study historic building on the Penn State campus. Third, the technical problems implementing energy retrofits in historic buildings are synthesized via a review of recent research. Overall, the findings from this dissertation suggest that the preservation community relinquish the argument that historic buildings are inherently energy efficient in favor of a more utilitarian approach to energy retrofits in these buildings.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14287], "author_name_tesi": "Webb, Amanda Laurel", "last_name_ssi": "Webb", "middle_name_ssi": "Laurel", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Treado", "Stephen Treado", "Thomas Boothby", "Donghyun Rim", "Matthew Reimherr", "Cynthia Howard Reed"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Treado, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Treado, Committee Chair", "Thomas Boothby, Committee Member", "Donghyun Rim, Committee Member", "Matthew Reimherr, Outside Member", "Cynthia Howard Reed, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Historic building", "Traditional building", "Historic preservation", "Cultural heritage", "Energy efficiency", "Energy retrofit", "Building simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A Cross-cultural Analysis of the Test of Science Related Attitudes", "id": "22723", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9892", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this research is to analyze the Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA; Fraser, 1981) for use with a Chinese population ranging in ages from 11-77.

For example, the ability to access, manipulate and make sense of large amounts of structured data stored in a database can be important in careers as diverse as health care, graphic design, and environment science. \nWith respect to gender and computer-based skills, research shows that both girls and boys express an interest in many different forms of technology throughout their childhood, but they tend to be attracted to different activities. For example, girls have been shown to enjoy creating stories where they can personalize the environment and work on role-playing scenarios (Kelleher and Pausch 2007). Boys and girls both enjoy creating games, but with boys their role-play tends to involve evil fantasy characters and situations where competition to race or be better than the next person is important (Kafai 1996).  Girls need an engaging learning environment which supports their creativity and interests.  When girls are able to work collaboratively on problems which are interesting to them and fun, their confidence increases and they also realize there are other girls who share their same interests in technology activities (Hughes 2005).  \nRecently, high schools in the United States have shifted their computer-based courses from traditional programming courses to a curriculum inspired by foundational computational concepts (Goode and Margolis 2011).  For example, instead of learning to sort bowling scores, students learn about computing and its relationship to the world around them; they do this by working on projects that produce computational artifacts.  Programming is still a part of the coursework, but instead of being a focus for skill development, programming is presented as a tool that aids in discovery of new ideas and concepts(CollegeBoard 2010) . More specifically, computational thinking (CT) skills and techniques have gained attention in K-12 education; CT includes problem solving, pattern recognition and algorithm design (Wing 2006). Thus far however, middle school education that includes CT concepts is not common; by the time students reach high school their beliefs about how computing fits into the world they live in may already have formed in an inaccurate fashion.\nMy dissertation examines the potential of teaching CT concepts to girls of middle school age. I chose to focus on girls because it is at this age that girls turn away from computing education, eventually contributing to a significant gender imbalance in the computing workforce. I explored a particular learning paradigm \u2013 scaffolded examples \u2013 as a technique for engaging young women from the very beginning in realistic programming activities. I discuss the result of this approach, including its impacts on the girls\u2019 CT self-efficacy and career attitudes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8726], "author_name_tesi": "Webb, Heidi C", "last_name_ssi": "Webb", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Heidi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Beth Rosson", "Mary Beth Rosson", "Lynette Marie Yarger", "Heng Xu", "Priya Sharma"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Beth Rosson, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Beth Rosson, Committee Chair", "Lynette Marie Yarger, Committee Member", "Heng Xu, Committee Member", "Priya Sharma, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["computational thinking", "middle school", "scaffolded example", "Scratch"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Bearing Witness: Informal Learning Among Critical Care Nurses in the Context of Traumatic Suffering", "id": "n009w229r", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12915", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "        Secondary traumatic stress (STS), also known as compassion fatigue (CF), is a recognized source of suffering among nurses and many other types of human service workers who help people during or after traumatic life events. With regard to nurses, the field of study still lacks both conceptual clarity and theoretical grounding for identifying and responding to STS. \n        The present research adopted a critically and psychodynamically enriched learning framework to examine the experience of STS in nurses. It sought to deepen and enhance the qualitative understanding of STS through a close phenomenological investigation not only of the experiences of a sample of critical care nurses, but also through the discernment of essential structures of mental constitution and informal learning that were evidenced among them.\n\tThe study employed an adaptation of Giorgi\u2019s (2009) modified Husserlian approach to phenomenological investigation. A triad of three critical care nurses who were employed in a single medical center were interviewed at length, both individually and in extended focus groups. Static data analysis was conducted consistent with Giorgi\u2019s method, followed by an iterative process of genetic analysis that encompassed temporal and intersubjective dimensions of the nurses\u2019 constitutional processes relative to their traumatic exposure. Essential structures of meaning were discerned and synthesized in relation to their experiences of STS. In addition, dynamic modes of informal learning were discerned.\n\tSTS in this sample of nurses was a shattering experience that resisted comprehension and necessitated sustained support by attentive and nonjudgmental peer companions in order for traumatic exposure to be integrated successfully in a nurse\u2019s consciousness. Helpful learning in response to STS involved a willingness to embrace the emotional dimension of life: gradually to claim traumatic events as one\u2019s own, while actively reevaluating and reconstituting their possible meanings and embracing the necessity of mourning in communion with trusted peers.

Thus, a more productive fusion in the classroom occur.\nThe instructional model researched here was offered through a major university, in Northeastern United States, to all prospective language teachers in a 2009-2011 cohort.  The curriculum included a two-year program of Methods courses for which assignments were submitted online.  Principal tools utilized by the undergraduates were MacBook (wireless, laptop) computers that had Internet capability and video software allowing for annotating frames.  Cohort members collaborated together and with instructors to design, teach, and reflect upon lessons for students in grades kindergarten through twelfth.  Many reflections were based upon the undergraduates\u2019 viewing and annotating audio-video footage of themselves after teaching their lessons that had been digitally recorded.  Additionally, some participants enrolled in an optional course, which required them to blog with one another during study abroad from their respective countries about certain topics in order to connect their cultural-linguistic and pedagogical knowledge to practical application in furthering their own and others\u2019 education.  \nParticipants\u2019 electronically submitted assignments from the four semesters were downloaded from online then reviewed several times by the principal researcher.  To determine the results of this instructional model, the following major question was addressed: What evidence is there that ubiquitous access to the tools previously listed facilitates participants\u2019 capacity to develop competence for language learning and teaching?  Specifically, the study sought to determine: A.) What can this type of technology use contribute to world language teacher development?  B.) Do specific uses of these tools have transformative potential for world language education?  C.) How is the use of technology in education perceived by these undergraduates?\nThe hypothesis was that ubiquitous access to these tools would facilitate participants\u2019 interaction with one another and with their instructors; this, in turn, would extend participants\u2019 capacity to develop cultural-linguistic, pedagogical, and technological competences as beginning language teachers.  Analysis of the aforementioned and additional data (initial survey, focus-group interviews, and exit survey) provide evidence that this kind of experience affords an environment in which prospective language teachers\u2019 development occurs largely on their own terms.  Participants articulate the meaning of competence and express the desire to increase theirs; through reflection, they pinpoint areas for improvement and envision ways to accomplish that.  As their successes in those areas increase, so does their confidence.  This appears to further motivate them to take risks, continuing to push their developmental limits; in turn, they are able to offer to their students some exceptional opportunities for learning as well.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8723], "author_name_tesi": "Webber, Dana E", "last_name_ssi": "Webber", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Dana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamie Myers", "Roy Clariana", "Simon Richard Hooper", "Heather Mccoy", "Brigid Burke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamie Myers, Dissertation Advisor", "Roy Clariana, Committee Chair", "Simon Richard Hooper, Committee Member", "Heather Mccoy, Committee Member", "Brigid Burke, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["synthecultural competence", "online collaborative reflection", "world languages", "teacher preparation", "intercultural competence"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Water Quality Condition Assessment of Streams in National Parks of the Mid-Atlantic USA Integrating Physical, Chemical, and Biological Datasets", "id": "14072", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7147", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this study was to comprehensively characterize water quality in 53 headwater stream reaches throughout nine National Park units of the Mid-Atlantic USA and to assess their current condition. Chemical water quality parameters (e.g., major cations and anions, nutrients, organics, trace metals, and water isotopes) and streamflow were measured in the 53 focal reaches six times during varying seasonal baseflow conditions from 2010 to 2011. Stream condition was evaluated by comparing the measured water quality values to existing federal and state water quality standards (in the context of the designated uses for each stream reach). The majority of the 53 reaches met all water quality criteria standards. Further, inventories of historical data from 511 headwater streams in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands Region were used to put the water quality of the park stream reaches into a regional context. \nHere, stream condition was classified on the basis of the chemical water quality monitoring data by applying criteria to identify high quality (reference) versus low quality (impaired) streams and to consider the causes of degradation. Similarly, the National Park Service classified condition of these stream reaches on the basis of ecological monitoring data. This study showed that the macroinvertebrate biotic integrity index accurately predicted stream condition as evidenced by the chemical water quality data of these 53 reaches. Information regarding the chemical, biological, and physical character of these streams provides a contemporary baseline against which future changes can be compared. This work contributes toward an initiative of the National Park Service aimed at systematically assessing the status and trends of natural resources in their managed lands.

It is understood that in acidic Andisols, P sorption occurs due to reaction with variable charge mineralogy developed from weathering of volcanic ejecta, soil organic matter content, and aluminum and iron (hydr)oxides. It has been demonstrated that because of the extremely high P sorption rates in these soils there is little residual effect of phosphorus fertilizer carrying over from an initial application into a second crop. As a result, managers of these soils, which are frequently found in semi-subsistent farming systems, find themselves obligated to apply high rates of P with every cycle: a situation much the opposite of those who are currently trying to reduce excess phosphorus runoff and leaching from their nutrient-laden fields in other parts of our world.\nThere have been numerous studies conducted on the P sorption mechanism of Andisols, and there have also been studies conducted on how to reduce phosphorus sorption in these soils with the obvious potential to benefit agronomic production, however, these studies remain inconclusive in their evidence on how to treat Andisols with high P-sorption which is attributed to the methods of study used, interpretation of results, and also because of the variable nature of the soils themselves. Andisols have variable OM content and mineralogy depending on stage of weathering and parent material, and phosphorus sorption response is highly dependent on these factors. Therefore, it is important to conduct further studies on the nature of soil and plant response to P-sorption in order to develop a technique for managing Andisols for better agronomic production.\nThe main goal of this study was to examine the interactive effects of lime and P fertilizer amendments on P sorption and plant P availability in a moderate pH, moderately low soil test-P Andisol from the central Andean highlands of Ecuador. A two-way factorial consisting of three rates (0, 90, or 180 kg ha-1) of P2O5 and three rates (0, 3, or 6 tons ha-1) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) were mixed with equal volumes of soil and seeded with barley (Hordeum vulgare, L.) in a greenhouse experiment. Soils were sampled two times during an initial incubation with lime and two times after fertilizers were added and barley seeded. Aboveground plant tissues were harvested at 53 days of growth.\nTo determine the treatment effect on phosphorus sorption in the soil, Mehlich-3 and Olsen extractable P, Al, and Ca and soil pH were determined on soil samples taken before liming and at 21, 32, 46, and 85 days after liming. The 46 and 85 day marks coincide with the 14th and 53rd days after planting (dap). Additional laboratory work was done in University Park, PA, to build sorption and desorption isotherms, study P fractionation, and identify soil mineralogy.\nTo quantify the impact of the treatments on plant P uptake and growth, biomass and physical response, as well as tissue P and other nutrient content were determined on whole barley plants harvested at 53 dap.\nObservations show that barley grown in this Andisol responded strongly to P fertilizer additions, and had smaller responses to lime, however there were no notable lime and P interactive effects. Lime did not cause any change in P uptake or P concentration with liming, however it did improve plant nutrition and increase biomass production. These findings suggest lime could be a beneficial addition to management practices for subsistence farmers in the Andean Highlands, however additional research should be done to further develop this information and to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of a liming effect on production.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9297], "author_name_tesi": "Webber, Kathleen Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Webber", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Charles Stehouwer", "Carmen Enid Martinez", "Jonathan Paul Lynch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Charles Stehouwer, Thesis Advisor", "Carmen Enid Martinez, Thesis Advisor", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["phosphorus", "Andisol", "Andic", "volcanic", "Ecuador", "Andes", "lime", "amendment", "soil", "soil fertility", "barley", "P", "sorption", "adsorption"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Heterosexist Events, Internalized Homophobia, and Substance Use Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Individuals: Implications for Counseling", "id": "6728", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2082", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study explored the relationship between heterosexist events, internalized homophobia, and substance use and abuse among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals.

I addressed this issue by integrating the relational turbulence model, functional theory, and literature on information exchange in small groups to develop specific predictions about the associations among relationship characteristics, couple communication, and treatment decision outcomes. Specifically, I hypothesized that decision-making quality would be positively associated with completing the fundamental tasks specified by functional theory (H1) and information sharing (H2), but negatively associated with information bolstering or discounting (H3b). Also, I predicted that information bolstering or discounting would be negatively associated with decision satisfaction (H3a). In addition, I reasoned that relational uncertainty (H4) would be negatively associated with fulfilling the functional theory tasks, information sharing, and information bolstering or discounting, but a partner\u2019s interference in everyday activities (H5) would be positively associated with these behaviors. \nThis dissertation employed a cross-sectional, two-group observational study design to test my hypotheses. Specifically, I had 113 marital dyads and committed domestic partners (N = 226) respond individually to a number of communication and relationship measures. Then, couples were assigned to either the functional theory condition or the control condition and were to make a decision about a treatment for a hypothetical diagnosis of breast cancer. Finally, individuals reflected on their treatment selection interactions. This research design allowed me to examine how mechanisms identified by the relational turbulence model and functional theory shape dyadic decision making.\nAlthough the findings for the associations among relational turbulence, communication functions, and information exchange between partners were not always consistent with my predictions, the results provided initial support for the use of marital qualities and couple communication as predictors for treatment decision outcomes. Results showed that couples who developed criteria generally perceived the quality of their decisions to be lower, but couples who assessed solutions perceived the quality of their decision to be higher. Although not statistically significant (.05 < p < .10), couples in which females shared more information were more likely to choose mastectomy surgery, rather than lumpectomy surgery. Also, individuals\u2019 bolstering was positively associated with subjective decision quality, but only approached a significantly positive association with decision satisfaction. Couples in which males bolstered more tended to choose mastectomy surgery, rather than lumpectomy surgery. Female relationship uncertainty positively predicted developing criteria, whereas male relationship uncertainty negatively predicted developing solutions. When information sharing was the outcome, female relationship uncertainty positively predicted male information sharing. Finally, a male\u2019s perceptions of partner interference negatively predicted female bolstering, and the path between male\u2019s perceptions of partner interference and male bolstering approached significance.\nThis dissertation makes theoretical contributions to the relational turbulence model and functional theory by demonstrating how relationship characteristics and couple communication contribute to treatment decision outcomes. For example, because partners in this study role-played being diagnosed with breast cancer or having a partner who was diagnosed with breast cancer, I was able to explore how relational uncertainty or a partner\u2019s interference might influence communication from different vantage points. In addition, this dissertation provides preliminary evidence that suggests relationship circumstances among group members might shape if a group is able to address the fundamental tasks put forth by functional theory.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3502], "author_name_tesi": "Weber, Kirsten Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Weber", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Kirsten", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Denise Haunani Solomon", "Denise Haunani Solomon", "Dennis Stephen Gouran", "Jon F Nussbaum", "Bonnie J Meyer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Denise Haunani Solomon, Dissertation Advisor", "Denise Haunani Solomon, Committee Chair", "Dennis Stephen Gouran, Committee Member", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member", "Bonnie J Meyer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Couple", "Communication", "Breast cancer", "Treatment decision", "Uncertainty", "Interference"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Acoustic Propagation Through Bubble Clouds", "id": "6885", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6151", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the underlying assumptions in the effective medium theory describing the propagation of acoustic waves through bubble clouds is that the probability of an individual bubble being located at some position in space is independent of the locations of other bubbles.

Culture plays a vital role in determining the level of health of the individual, family and community.  Recently, public health researchers have begun to recognize culture\u2019s position in health promotion by applying it to existing socio-behavioral variables to develop health-related interventions.  The purpose of this study is to conduct a secondary data analysis of socio-cultural findings from the evaluation of an STI/HIV/AIDS prevention effort \u2013 the Mpumalanga Female Condom Project (MFCP).  The study uses the PEN-3 model, a framework developed to centralize culture in health promotion interventions (Airhihenbuwa, 1995, 1999), to conduct a modified content analysis of phrases, words and issues from focus groups, open-ended questions, and key informant interviews to identify the relationship between culture and female condom acceptance and use in a peer education-focused community-wide STI/HIV/AIDS prevention effort. The PEN-3 Model helped describe the Mpumalanga peer educator, community member and MFCP staff knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to the female condom prevention effort. The analysis indicated that culture in the context of gender relations (the status of women in relation to men in society and community and the influence on sexual negotiation and decision-making) and communication are key factors in female condom acceptance and use in this community. Finally the Mpumalanga Female Condom Project helped to positively shape attitudes and norms that guide prevention behaviors related to STI/HIV/AIDS in the community. These findings support theory that critical analysis through a cultural framework is a key factor in promoting behavior change at the individual, family and community level. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2638], "author_name_tesi": "Webster, Jonas DeWitt", "last_name_ssi": "Webster", "middle_name_ssi": "DeWitt", "first_name_ssi": "Jonas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Collins O Airhihenbuwa", "Patricia Barthalow Koch", "Edward A Smith", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Collins O Airhihenbuwa, Committee Chair", "Patricia Barthalow Koch, Committee Member", "Edward A Smith, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HIV/AIDS", "South Africa", "female condom", "peer educators", "culture"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Poetics of Interruption: Media and Form in Twentieth-Century Literature", "id": "vm40xr57v", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13117", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Poetics of Interruption: Media and Form in Twentieth-Century American Literature examines twentieth-century literature\u2019s engagement with other media. The texts studied here use the sonic/aural to \u201ccut\u201d the visual, the image to disturb language. These other media\u2014jazz, photography, cinema\u2014exert an interruptive force in the texts, jolting, slowing down, and distorting the reading process, estranging and disorienting readers. This estrangement of form works to disrupt historiography and identity more generally. In examining these multimedia and intermedia texts, my project interrogates the relationship between aesthetics, radical politics, and identity and imagines the political possibilities of experimental literature. The first chapter examines jazz aesthetics, improvisation, and pragmatism in Claude McKay\u2019s Banjo: A Story without a Plot (1929), the second develops a genealogy of photographic poetics from Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes to contemporary Dark Room Collective poets, and the third chapter investigates CLR James\u2019 and Maya Deren\u2019s use of cinematic aesthetics in constructing a radical new kind of cultural studies. Ultimately this project not only suggests an alternative literary genealogy of twentieth-century African American and American literature, but it also illuminates and offers alternatives to shallow engagements with minority literature. \n\nPoetics of Interruption suggests that the disciplines of literary and cultural studies are hampered by our expectations that African American literatures (and minority literatures more generally) operate as vessels or data storage containers for information about black American subjects. Recently, a growing number of scholars have highlighted this tendency to evaluate minority literature for its accurate representation of minority communities as symptomatic of the narrow ways in which we yoke aesthetics and racial politics. Minority literature in particular bears the burden of racial-political representation, often conceived of as or yoked to uplift politics and the demand for positive portrayals of black characters and communities, leading to a curious obsession with authenticity policing. Such readings instrumentalize and flatten minority literature.\n\nWhile this instrumentalization is in many ways unique to the ways we read minority literature, the problem of flattening critical methodologies is in many ways extrapolatable to our profession more generally. Recent critical trends in humanities scholarship increasingly rely on positivism\u2014which favors the gloss or paraphrase rather than the elements of literature that cannot be paraphrased\u2014denying that literary texts are necessarily any different from historical or sociological artifacts. These positivistic approaches ignore what is specific about literary form, what exceeds the paraphrase. A commitment to what Tom Eyers calls \u201cpoetic unevenness\u201d exposes the gaps between literary and political forms, creating a productive dissonance.  Rather than evaluating texts for their mimetic or representational ability and viewing them as closed, fixed objects, my project views these engagements with other media as necessarily experimental, and, therefore, rough, uneven, marked by failures, inconsistent, unfinished, open. \n\nMost projects on media and literature trace literature\u2019s obsession with, desire for, or anxiety about technology and mediation. This project is not interested in developing a programmatic politics or viewing media writ large as either liberatory or enslaving. Instead, I trace texts\u2019 attempts to think through other media in order to estrange these forms and media, estranging us from and then reorienting us toward our assumptions, the givens of our disciplines. I want to focus on how such cross-media or multimedia experimental works are well equipped to interrupt, disrupt, and shift our reading practices and interpretive categories. They don\u2019t simply register our responses to technology, but they attempt to think through other media. They ask, What is the thought enabled by different media? How does temporarily inhabiting or playing with the techniques of other media open up new avenues and forms of thought? Poetics of Interruption explores the techniques of different media and the othering that occurs when literature thinks through the apparatus or uses the techniques of other media.  Mediums\u2019 techniques produce or tend toward certain approaches to the form, movement, and development of thought. Literature that seriously engages with the thought of other media is able to other itself\u2014to make the literary strange, to alter the ways that we read, and, by extension, the ways that we read history, identity, and political thought. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12870], "author_name_tesi": "Weeber, Susan Cooke", "last_name_ssi": "Weeber", "middle_name_ssi": "Cooke", "first_name_ssi": "Susan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aldon Lynn Nielsen", "Aldon Lynn Nielsen", "Kevin Michael Bell", "Benjamin Jared Schreier", "Nergis Erturk Lennon", "Linda Furgerson Selzer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aldon Lynn Nielsen, Dissertation Advisor", "Aldon Lynn Nielsen, Committee Chair", "Kevin Michael Bell, Committee Member", "Benjamin Jared Schreier, Committee Member", "Nergis Erturk Lennon, Outside Member", "Linda Furgerson Selzer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["American literature; African American literature; critical race theory; aesthetics; media"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Farm-level Evaluation of Implementing Feeding Best Management Practices on Pennsylvania Dairy Farms", "id": "23642", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10754", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Feeding best management practices (BMP) can have a significant impact on the environmental footprint of dairy farms. The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the environmental and productive effects of implementing feeding BMP on commercial dairy farms in Pennsylvania. Fifteen farms (124.8 \u00b1 20.5 ha, 169 \u00b1 39 cows, and 31.4 \u00b1 0.2 kg/d of milk yield) in central and southeast Pennsylvania participated in this study. A set of four background total mixed ration (TMR), forage, milk, feces, and urine samples, as well as feed intake and production data, were collected from each cooperator farm biweekly between January and March of 2013 (PreBMP period). Feeding BMP were chosen by the producer, including reduction of dietary crude protein (CP; n = 7) and phosphorus (P; n = 3) concentrations, adjusting rations for changes in forage dry matter (DM; n = 10), and group feeding of the lactating herd (n = 2). Following the implementation of applicable feeding BMP, another set of four sampling and data collection events took place between June and August of 2013 (PostBMP period). Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with farm as a random effect. Seven farms reduced dietary CP (from 17.2 to 15.8%; P < 0.001), which resulted in decreased total urinary N (0.75 vs. 0.57%; P < 0.001), urinary urea-N (544 vs. 461 mg/dL; P = 0.007), and milk urea-N (MUN; 16.8 vs. 13.7 mg/dL P < 0.001) from PreBMP to PostBMP, respectively. Three farms lowered dietary P (from 0.42 to 0.40; P = 0.06), which resulted in decreased fecal P concentration (0.83 vs. 0.69%; P = 0.001). Group feeding was implemented on 2 farms and average CP of the lactating rations decreased (from 15.7 to 14.7% (high) or 14.3% (low); P = 0.03 and P = 0.02), which resulted in decreased total urinary N (0.81 to 0.51% (high) or 0.51% (low); P < 0.001 and P < 0.001), urinary urea-N (594 to 398 mg/dL (high) or 384 (low) mg/dL; P < 0.001, respectively), and MUN (17.4 to 13.7 mg/dL; P = 0.03). Dry matter intake (DMI; 23.3 vs. 22.7 \u00b1 0.46 kg/d; P = 0.05), milk yield (32.7 vs. 31.9 \u00b1 0.76 kg/d; P < 0.001), bulk tank milk fat (3.91 vs. 3.56%; P < 0.001), and milk protein (3.13 vs. 2.98%; P < 0.001) decreased on all farms from PreBMP to PostBMP period, due to seasonal effects.\n\nEnvironmental effects of implementing feeding BMP were evaluated using the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM). On farms that reduced dietary CP, nitrogen (N) imported onto the farm (313 vs. 293 kg/ha; P = 0.02), N lost by leaching (53 vs. 49 kg/ha; P = 0.01), N lost by denitrification (15.3 vs. 14.7 kg/ha; P = 0.008), N lost in runoff (1.69 vs. 1.61 kg/ha; P = 0.008), and N concentrate in leachate (22.5 vs. 20.4 ppm; P = 0.01) decreased from PreBMP to PostBMP period. Greenhouse gasses (GHG) emitted by manure (196,083 vs. 191,960 kg/yr; P = 0.003) and feed production (201,207 vs. 195,256 kg/yr; P = 0.02) decreased for farms that reduced dietary CP. On farms that reduced dietary P, P imported onto the farm (24.6 vs. 22.1 kg/ha; P = 0.19), P lost in runoff leachate (1.67 vs. 1.53 kg/ha; P = 0.42), and P buildup in soil (4.43 vs. 2.47 kg/ha; P = 0.22) numerically decreased when evaluated using IFSM from PreBMP to PostBMP period. Environmental effects of implementing group feeding or monitoring forage DM when evaluated using IFSM were minimal from PreBMP to PostBMP period.\n\nMilk urea-N is a useful measurement to monitor dietary CP intake and N utilization in lactating dairy cattle. Two experiments were conducted to explore discrepancies in MUN results between three laboratories, one experiment to compare the effect of two preservatives (bronopol and Broad Spectrum Microtabs\uf8e8 II; BSM) on MUN, and one experiment to evaluate MUN with increasing levels of bronopol. In experiment 1, 10 milk samples, collected over five consecutive days, were sent to three milk processing laboratories. Average MUN differed (P < 0.001 to P = 0.05) between Laboratory A (14.9 \u00b1 0.40 mg/dL), Laboratory B (6.5 \u00b1 0.17 mg/dL), and Laboratory C (7.4 \u00b1 0.36 mg/dL). In experiment 2, milk samples were spiked with urea at 0, 17.2, 34.2, and 51.5 mg urea/dL of milk. Two 35-mL samples from each urea level were sent to three laboratories. Average analyzed MUN was higher than expected for Laboratory A (23.2 vs. 21.0 mg/dL; P = 0.001), Laboratory B (18.0 vs. 13.3 mg/dL; P < 0.001), and Laboratory C (20.6 vs.15.2 mg/dL; P < 0.001). In experiment 3, three samples of control (without preservative), milk preserved with bronopol, and milk preserved with BSM were sent to Laboratory A and two samples of both bronopol and BSM were sent to Laboratory B. Milk urea-N results from Laboratory A differed (P < 0.01) between control (9.2 mg/dL), BSM (9.7 mg/dL), and bronopol (11.2 mg/dL), however, no difference (P = 0.60) in MUN was observed between bronopol and BSM at Laboratory B. In experiment 4, milk samples contained 0 to 0.30 g of bronopol and ranged in MUN concentration from 7.7 to 11.9 \u00b1 0.27 mg/dL on Foss 4000 and from 9.0 to 9.3 \u00b1 0.05 mg/dL on CL10, respectively.\n\nIn summary, implementing one or more feeding BMP did not affect average DMI or milk yield of the cows, but reduced N and P excretions on commercial dairy farms in Pennsylvania, and consequently had a positive impact on the environment. Milk urea-N concentrations may vary depending on type and amount of preservative, analytical procedures, laboratory, and equipment used to measure MUN concentrations.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10376], "author_name_tesi": "Weeks, Holley Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Weeks", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Holley", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexander Nikolov Hristov", "Lisa Holden", "Clarence Alan Rotz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alexander Nikolov Hristov, Thesis Advisor", "Lisa Holden, Thesis Advisor", "Clarence Alan Rotz, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["dairy cattle", "best management practices", "crude protein", "phosphorus", "environment", "milk urea nitrogen"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Until all the pieces fit: A hermeneutic phenomenology of the informal learning of selected foster parents in northeastern Pennsylvania", "id": "23011", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10598", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "All fifty (50) states have a formal certification process for those seeking to become foster parents.

Pennsylvania, for example, has an annual requirement that foster parents undergo six (6) hours of approved formal training.  There are linear, detailed, measurable requirements for a person to become a foster parent, but becoming a foster parent and being a foster parent are not synonymous terms or concepts or experiences. How, in fact, does an adult learn to be a foster parent? The place of more formalized training in the process is well documented. The same cannot be said of informal learning that is integral to the lived experience of foster parenting. \n \tWhat is, then, this experience of informal learning for foster parents?  According to Eraut (2010), informal learning can provide a \u201csimple contrast to formal learning or training\u201d which allows \u201cgreater flexibility or freedom for learners\u201d and that \u201crecognizes the social significance of learning from other people\u201d as a means for utilization of greater individual agency (p. 247).  This may occur as foster parents talk with one another about the children in their care. This may take place when foster parents share their experiences with other foster parents in any number of settings. This may happen \u201con-the-job\u201d as foster parents literally figure out how to be foster parents through the daily lived experience of being foster parents. Informal learning can be powerful and personal, everywhere present and vital to the experience of being foster parents. To complete this study, I utilized a phenomenological research method in an attempt to uncover and describe the created meanings and meaning structures of the lived experience of foster parenting. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10238], "author_name_tesi": "Wehler, Bruce Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Wehler", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Bruce", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melody M Thompson", "Melody M Thompson", "Gary Kuhne", "Fred Michael Schied", "David Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melody M Thompson, Dissertation Advisor", "Melody M Thompson, Committee Chair", "Gary Kuhne, Committee Member", "Fred Michael Schied, Committee Member", "David Lee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["foster parenting", "informal learning", "hermeneutic phenomenology", "situated learning theory", "constructivist learning theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Electrochemical studies of separators and activated carbon cathodes in single-chamber, air-cathode microbial fuel cells", "id": "15436", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7398", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "         Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are devices that use bacteria to produce electricity which provides an alternative to consumption of fossil fuels as an energy source.  To gain an insight into these systems, various efforts worldwide from researchers have been made on the materials, configurations, and other related aspects of MFC construction. Power output is one of the fundamental aspects of MFCs, which can be characterized by varying resistances. In air cathode MFCs, which have an advantage of using passive air instead of forced air flow, the cathode plays an important role in determining power densities. \n         In order to better understand the factors that affect power generation in MFCs, current-voltage curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to obtain cathode polarization, solution-separator, charge transfer and diffusion resistances of clean and used separators in separator electrode assemblies (SEAs) in single-chamber, air-cathode MFCs. Cathode polarization resistance was reduced at lower cathode potentials. EIS results showed that at a set cathode potential of 0.3 V (versus a Standard Hydrogen Electrode, SHE), diffusion resistance was predominant and it substantially increased when adding multiple separators between the electrodes. At a lower cathode potential of 0.1 V, resistances did not show significant differences in the presence and absence of separators. Used SEAs had increased charge transfer and diffusion resistances when one separator was used, at a cathode potential of 0.1 V. However, charge transfer resistance increased and diffusion resistance did not appreciably increase with four separators in used reactors (after three months of operation). The addition of plastic mesh to compress four separators against the cathode improved the maximum power densities (by 21%), likely due to minimization of the trapped water between the electrodes. Based on these results, it was concluded that multiple wipe separators and biofilm formation had hindered ion diffusion, and that it was important to compress the separator against the cathode. \n\tThe catalyst is the main component of an air cathode MFC. Activated carbon (AC) is a promising candidate for large scale applications of MFCs as it has considerable catalytic activity for oxygen reduction, and it is commercially available. AC air cathodes were constructed using variable amounts of carbon (43 \u2212 171 mg/cm2) and an inexpensive binder (10 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE), and with or without a cloth diffusion layer (DL) that was sealed with PDMS to prevent water leakage. These cathodes were compared to commonly used, but much more expensive materials (carbon cloth, Pt, and Nafion binder) in MFCs, and by using different electrochemical tests. The cathodes with the highest AC loading of 171 mg/cm2, and no diffusion later, produced 1255 \u00b1 75 mW/m2. Slightly higher power densities were initially obtained using 100 mg/cm2 of AC (1310 \u00b1 70 mW/m2) and a PDMS/wipe diffusion layer, although the performance of this cathode decreased to 1050 \u00b1 70 mW/m2 after 1.5 months, and 1010 \u00b1 190 mW/m2 after 5 months. AC loadings of 43 mg/cm2 to 100 mg/cm2 did not appreciably affect performance (with diffusion layers). MFCs with the Pt catalyst and Nafion binder initially produced 1295 \u00b1 13 mW/m2, but decreased to 930 \u00b1 50 mW/m2 (1.5 months) and then 890 \u00b1 20 mW/m2 (5 months). Cathode performance was optimized for all cathodes by using the least amount of PTFE binder (10%, in tests using up to 40%). These results provide a method to construct cathodes for MFCs that use only inexpensive AC and a PTFE, while producing power densities similar to those of Pt/C cathodes. The method used here to make these cathodes will enable further tests on carbon materials in order to optimize and extend the lifetime of AC cathodes in MFCs.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7353], "author_name_tesi": "Wei, Bin ", "last_name_ssi": "Wei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Electrochemical resistances", "electrochemical impedance spectroscopy", "separator electrode assembly", "activated carbon", "PTFE binder", "air cathode", "microbial fuel cells"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Dietary vitamin A and growth stage as factors in tissue vitamin A accumulation, retinoid homeostatic gene expression, and immune cell populations in BALB/c mice", "id": "25587", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10809", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Introduction: Vitamin A (VA) plays critical roles in visual function, embryonic development, cell differentiation, growth, reproduction, and immune system actions. The BALB/c mouse is a commonly used animal model for immunological and cancer studies in recent years; however, there have been no comprehensive studies about its tissue response to dietary VA exposures and regulation of retinoid homeostasis to understand the absorption, storage, and utilization of VA. \n\nPurpose: To determine the effects of developmental stages (age) versus dietary VA exposures on retinoids levels in plasma and tissues, which include liver, lung, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and spleen, using the BALB/c mouse model. To examine retinoid homeostatic gene expression, including LRAT and CYP26 steady-state mRNA expression, in response to different levels of dietary VA exposures. And to identify whether dietary VA exposure alters lung and splenic immune cell populations. The findings are significant for understanding VA physiology and for future study references.\n\nMethods: A purified VA-marginal diet was fed to pregnant dams and postnatal neonates until pups were weaned at postnatal day 21. Post-weaning pups were randomly assigned to four diet groups, which were VA-deficient (VAD), VA-marginal (VAM), VA-adequate (VAA), and VA-supplemented (VAS) diet groups. Pups were euthanized at four developmental periods, which include newborn (day 0), neonatal (day 14), young adult (week 4), and adult (week 8), for plasma and tissue collection. Tissue retinoid levels were determined by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC); the expression of retinoid homeostatic gene was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); and the splenic and lung immune cell populations were determined by flow cytometric analysis. \n\nResults: A dose-response relationship between dietary VA exposures and tissue total retinol concentrations was observed in the liver, lung, BAT, and spleen, but not in plasma, indicating that the relationship between tissue VA storage and plasma retinol concentration is not linear. Under VAA and VAS conditions mice were capable of accumulating high levels of VA in tissues, especially in the lung, with some accumulation even on a VAM diet. In addition, consistent with findings from previous studies, a diet effect was observed in liver LRAT and CYP26 steady-state mRNA levels; however, the diet effect was only observed in lung LRAT and CYP26B1 but not CYP26A1 expression in young adult and adult mice. Lastly, small but significant differences were observed in the percentage of immune cell populations in lung and spleen between VAD- and VAS-fed mice, suggesting VA might play a role in affecting immune cell populations related to different immune actions, such as regulating immune responses in the VA-sufficient state and suppressing proliferation of effector T cells in the VA-deficient state.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10419], "author_name_tesi": "Wei, Cheng-Hsin ", "last_name_ssi": "Wei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cheng-Hsin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vitamin A", "retinoid", "accumulation", "gene expression", "immune cell", "BALB/c"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "INTERREGIONAL SHARING OF ENERGY  CONSERVATION TARGETS IN CHINA:  EFFICIENCY AND EQUITY\n\n\n", "id": "7704", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1674", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Energy conservation is a long-term strategic policy in China to support its economic and social development.  This policy strategy is important for saving resources, protecting the environment, and ensuring the secure supply of energy to all economic activities.  However, energy conservation often involves large amounts of investment and may also have dampening impacts on some local and regional economies.  Moreover, energy conservation and efficiency improvement have many features of a public good.  Therefore, government policy and intervention play a strong role to foster regional efforts and cooperative interregional actions on this issue.  This dissertation introduces and analyzes a promising policy instrument \u2013\u2013 an interregional energy conservation-quota trading system \u2013\u2013 to help China fulfill its national energy conservation objective in an efficient and equitable way.  \n\nTo analyze the workings of the energy conservation-quota trading system, trading entities are first determined.  In this study, statistical analyses (principal component analysis and cluster analysis) are applied to identify regional aggregations of provinces of China to act as the trading units.  The marginal energy conservation cost curves of these regions are developed using engineering-economic methods and regression analysis.  Simulations of interregional conservation-quota trading are undertaken after China\u2019s conservation goals in 2010 are allocated among regions according to several equity criteria.  Various equity criteria are applied and analyzed in this study because of the philosophical differences in the appropriate definition of the concept.  The trading simulations yield several important findings.  First, the introduction of an interregional quota trading system can minimize both regional net compliance costs and national total conservation costs, irrespective of how the conservation tasks are initially allocated among regions according to different equity rules.  Second, regional welfare implications differ across the applications of various equity criteria.  However, for the energy production-based sovereignty and egalitarian equity criteria, the poorest region (in terms of per capita gross regional product) can enjoy net profits from trading, while the clustered region of wealthy coastal provinces shoulders the highest cost.  This indicates that a conservation-quota trading system applying these two equity criteria is consistent with the national strategy in China to reduce regional income disparities and to develop the interior and western less-developed regions of the country.  Third, compared with trading among conventional regions, trading among statistically clustered regions can more sharply apply the equity criteria to burden sharing and utilize larger differences in marginal conservation costs between regions to achieve a lower total net cost for the country as a whole. \n\nIn sum, this research develops a useful methodology and identifies an operational way to attain energy conservation targets in China.  It offers insights for similar interregional burden-sharing or benefit-sharing policies for China in the future, such as greenhouse gas emission trading, which is closely related to the energy conservation issue.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1660], "author_name_tesi": "Wei, Dan ", "last_name_ssi": "Wei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adam Zachary Rose", "C Gregory Knight", "Brenton Yarnal", "James Samuel Shortle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adam Zachary Rose, Committee Chair", "C Gregory Knight, Committee Member", "Brenton Yarnal, Committee Member", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Equity", "Efficiency", "Quota Trading", "Energy Conservation", "China"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Models of Noncooperative Games", "id": "19866", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9363", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis is divided into three parts.\n\n In the first part,  motivated by Stackelberg differential games, we consider a ``nonclassical\" control system where the dynamics depends also on the spatial gradient of the feedback control function. \nGiven a probability measure on the set of initial states, we seek feedback controls which minimize the expected value of a cost function.

In response to alterations of ER homeostasis, PERK is activated to modulate specific mRNA translational upregulation as well as transient repression of global protein synthesis through phosphorylating eIF2&#61537; at serine 51. Loss-function mutations of PERK in humans and mice cause severe neonatal development defects, including diabetes, growth retardation, exocrine pancreatic atrophy and multiple skeletal dysplasias. \nTo investigate the physiological functions of PERK in regulation of mammalian skeletal development, comprehensive analyses were carried out on tissue, cellular and molecular levels in PERK-deficient mice and Perk-/- osteoblasts. Neonatal Perk-/- mice are severely osteopenic, which is in part caused by multiple defects in osteoblasts (bone forming cells), including a deficiency in the number of mature osteoblasts, impaired osteoblast differentiation, and reduced secretion of type I collagen. Further studies showed that compromised osteoblast differentiation and maturation in the absence of PERK is associated with decreased expression of Runx2 and Osterix, two key regulators of osteoblast development. Besides the differentiation defect, the low osteoblast mass phenotype in Perk-/- mice is also caused by reduced osteoblast proliferation. Perk-/- osteoblasts exhibit slow cell cycle progression along with reduced expression of key cell cycle factors including cyclin D, cyclin E, cyclin A, Cdc2, and CDK2. In addition, abnormal retention of procollagen I within the endoplasmic reticulum and reduced mature collagen production are manifested in Perk-/- osteoblasts. The imperfect collagen biosynthesis in Perk-/- osteoblasts is coincident with compromised ATF6 and IRE1/XBP1 UPR pathways. Normal osteoblast viability, normal global protein synthesis, low procollagen synthesis rate and no upregulation of ER stress markers are observed in Perk-/- osteoblasts, suggesting that the osteoblast defects are not due to persistent activation of the classical unfolded protein response. In addition, normal expression and activity of ATF4 seen in Perk-/- osteoblasts, together with its distinct role in controlling collagen synthesis, suggests that ATF4 is not a major target of PERK in regulation of osteoblast biology.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3219], "author_name_tesi": "Wei, Jianwen ", "last_name_ssi": "Wei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jianwen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhi Chun Lai", "Douglas Cavener", "Richard W Ordway", "Carol V Gay", "Pamela J Mitchell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Chair", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Carol V Gay, Committee Member", "Pamela J Mitchell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PERK", "osteoblast", "Runx2", "procollagen", "proliferation", "endoplasmic reticulum"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Gravity waves in moist baroclinic jet-front systems", "id": "25062", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11017", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ultimate goal of this dissertation is to characterize the dynamics, sources and impacts of the gravity waves generated in moist baroclinic jet-front systems through utilizing high-resolution simulations of idealized moist baroclinic waves along with analyzing real-case modeling and aircraft observations during past field campaigns. This dissertation seeks to explore the fundamental dynamics of the gravity waves and their interaction with moist convection and baroclinic waves.\n\nFirstly, a series of cloud-permitting idealized simulations are performed to study gravity waves in moist baroclinic jet-front systems with varying degree of convective instability. In experiment with small amount of initial moisture, the initiation of convection, despite weak, may considerably amplify gravity waves that are propagating away from the upper-level jet exit region crossing the ridge to the jet entrance region. In full moist experiment with further increase of initial moisture (up to 5 times), the convectively generated gravity waves are fully coupled with and hardly separable from the dry gravity wave modes under the complex background flow. Secondly, four-dimensional ray-tracing experiments are performed to investigate the propagating characteristics, source mechanisms, and wavenumber vector refraction budget analysis of the identified lower-stratospheric gravity waves. Budget analysis suggests that the thermodynamics shear effect may counteract, enhance, or even take over the wind shear effect for those wave packets crossing tropopause or frontal systems. Thirdly, in order to improve the moist jet/front gravity waves parameterizations, spectral characteristics are estimated with discrete Fourier transform. The negative center for the vertical transport of zonal momentum fluxes approximately corresponds to the estimated ground-based baroclinic wave phase velocity along zonal direction. Experiments with more initial moisture suggest a much wider spectrum, as well as a larger area for positive fluxes. In full moist experiment, the dipole structure distribution is seen in the relationship between phase speed and fluxes.

Previous studies had already documented that the actor is sensitive to the stability properties of the task dynamics and performs the rhythmic actions with a strategy where effects of perturbations converge back to steady state without requiring error-correcting racket movements. This behavior is consistent with the predictions from stability analyses of a dynamic model of the task. Experiment 1 continued to scrutinize this prediction by applying a range of perturbation magnitudes, designed to be within and outside of the model\u00a1\u00afs basin of attraction. Results showed that even small perturbations that were predicted to equilibrate passively were blended with active control flexibly responding to perceived errors. However, the time course of return to steady state performance was qualitatively consistent with predictions from passive stability. Experiment 2 investigated how the actor combined passive stability with active control when the dynamic stability of the task was manipulated by varying the coefficient of restitution at the racket-ball contacts. To quantify the degree of control the covariance structure of the state variables was compared with model predictions. These predictions were obtained from a model that was extended by stochastic components to yield predictions about the structure of fluctuations at steady state. Results revealed that, paradoxically, variability of performance decreased with decreasing stability, contrary to common expectations in motor control. This was explained by increasing compensatory variability in execution, a signature of control. Hence, actors rely on passive stability when the stability of the system is high and employ more active control when stability is reduced. Applying the same variability and stability analysis Experiments 3 and 4 revisited issues of acquisition, adaptation and transfer in the same skill. Both experiments clearly demonstrate that the performance improvement is correlated with increased sensitivity to passive stability. Variability was evaluated in a space spanned by execution and result variables by applying the TNC-decomposition of variability (Tolerance, Covariation, Noise). Results highlighted how learning and adaptation is a migration through the execution space combined with the fine-tuning of covariation between relevant variables and a reduction of noise. Sensitivity to passive stability forms some abstract knowledge that is easily transferable across effectors. Compared to the mere examination of outcome measures, the decomposition method provided finer-grained insights about learning, adaptation, and transfer. Taken together, the four studies extend our understanding about how coordinated performance is achieved by exploiting task stability and active control accompanied by changes in the structure of variability.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3645], "author_name_tesi": "Wei, Kunlin ", "last_name_ssi": "Wei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kunlin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dagmar Sternad", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Joseph Paul Cusumano", "Hermann M\u00a8\u00b9ller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dagmar Sternad, Committee Chair", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky, Committee Member", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Member", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member", "Hermann M\u00a8\u00b9ller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["variability", "stability", "motor control", "rhythmic task"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Fibrous Parylene-C Thin-Film Substrates for Implant Integration and Protein Assays\n\n", "id": "12567", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3938", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Polymeric biomaterials are used in medical devices that can be surgically implanted in human beings.

Sixty subjects participated, with half 25 years or younger (mean = 22.5, std. dev. = 1.7) and half 60 years or older (mean = 81.4, std. dev. = 7.1).\nThe side-by-side evaluation mode was employed to characterize perceived brightness. Subjects made a forced choice for each of 44 pairs of light settings that: were practice trials (4 pairs); differed in spectrum at equal illuminance (8 pairs); varied in both spectrum and illuminance (24 pairs); or were identical (i.e. null condition trials, 8 pairs). Light settings were set within a range of 240 to 330 lux and the rooms had neutral gray surfaces. Equal perceived brightness was inferred from the paired comparisons, and found to occur when the photopic quantity (e.g. illuminance, luminance) from the RevLF was 5% lower (younger subjects) or 8% lower (older subjects) than that provided by the SPX3K lamps.\nAt equal illuminance of 330 lux, the room illuminated by the RevLF was preferred to the one illuminated by the SPX3K by 67% of the younger subjects and 73% of the older subjects. Color and brightness were most commonly cited as reasons for preference.\nColor discrimination was characterized under 300 lux of RevLF and SPX3K illumination using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test (FM-100). For color-normal people below 25 years of age, and for those above 60 years of age who had cataract surgery, the red-green partial error score was statistically better under RevLF illumination. A significant difference was not found in the blue-yellow partial error score or in the total error score.\nWhen brightness perception is considered in isolation, the spectral advantages of the RevLF cannot be offset by the disadvantage of lower luminous efficacy. That is, these data suggest that at equal brightness a room illuminated with RevLF will consume more energy than an otherwise identical room illuminated with SPX3K. When brightness and color discrimination are considered together, as with visual clarity, it is unknown whether RevLF or SPX3K illumination would be more energy efficient.

These enhanced spectra had different gamut shapes, indicating abilities to saturate different colors. The experiments were focusing on retail application, restaurant, and skin tone rendition.\nKey Findings: Sources providing enhanced chroma were generally preferred. For familiar objects, such as skin tone rendition and food, sources with smaller hue shift were preferred over saturation enhancement, when the overall color shifts were similar. When characterizing color rendition, both hue shift and chroma shift are important.\n\nAll the studies were carefully conducted to test specific hypotheses.

The self-assembly is led by the interplay between a cascade of complex extracellular and intercellular activities that activate by cell mechanotransduction. In the process of cell mechanotransduction, actomyosin motors generate contractile forces in cytoskeletons. For an isolated adherent cell, the contractile force is transmitted to ECM through integrin-mediated focal adhesions, generating the extracellular traction force. For cells in multicellular monolayers, the contractile force is transmitted through both cell-ECM adhesion points and cell-cell adherens junctions, generating the extracellular traction on ECM on the one hand and the long-range intercellular tension within the multicellular sheet on the other. These cellular forces, including intracellular contraction, extracellular traction and intercellular tension, are crucial to the integrity and tensional homeostasis of epithelia. When dysregulated, pathological processes such as tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis can be triggered.  \nIn this dissertation, we start with the development of force microscopy techniques that have been used in all later studies for cellular force measurement. With the implementation of these experimental measures, we find that the extracellular traction force and the intercellular tension are dependent on the matrix stiffness as well as the size of an epithelial monolayer. These findings infer the crosstalk between intercellular and extracellular activities in the course of cells sensing mechanical cues in their surroundings, suggesting that the cellular microenvironment may pose controlling factors such as matrix stiffness and geometrical constraints for the tensional homeostasis of epithelial monolayers by steering cellular forces. \nThe force-driven tensional homeostasis is important to the barrier function of epithelial cells. Wound healing, a process of elimination of holes in the epithelia, is a scenario in which forces drive epithelia to reestablish functional barriers and restore tissue integrity. The collective cellular motion, caused by either cell crawling or the purse-string-like pulling of a contractile multicellular actin cable, is widely taken as the major mechanism that accounts for the closing of gaps with different sizes, shapes and distributions of ECM proteins. Here we unveil a novel mechanism by which epithelial cells invade and heal small non-adhesive regions, distinctly different from the previously concluded mechanism. Our findings suggest that the stiffness of the actin ring determines whether a newly proliferating cell can generate intracellular contraction to spread at the wound edge, thereby invading the wound area by consecutive actin ring forming, stiffness sensing and attachment of new cells to the wound front. The failure in generating contractile forces results in the piling up of new cells at the wound edge. This force-driven epithelial morphogenesis provides new mechanistic insights on wound healing.\nThe tensional homeostasis of epithelia, however, also poses challenges in the context of drug delivery. In past three decades, targeted delivery of nanoparticle (NP)-based diagnostic and therapeutic agents to malignant tissues has exclusively relied on conjugation of NPs with ligands that specifically bind to over-expressed receptors on diseased cells, yet theoretical studies have predicted the role of cell surface mechanics on the delivery of nanoparticles. In the context of mechanotransduction, it is known that cellular forces, correlated with cell surface mechanics, can be steered by biophysical cues in cellular microenvironment. By tailoring cellular forces through either modulating the matrix stiffness or cell malignancy levels, we hereby demonstrate that cellular uptake can also be biased by altered stress states at both single cell level and multicellular level, enabling mechanotargeting. Our in vitro delivery study exemplifies how mechanics can be harnessed in the future of drug delivery to improve targeting efficiency.

Variations of single molecule FRET (smFRET) are good methods to study the structure and dynamics of nucleosome, while there are still some technical barriers to overcome. \nI have developed two smFRET methods to study two problems in nucleosome biophysics. One method I developed was to study fast and unsynchronized nucleosomal DNA termini opening motion and how it is affected by salt conditions, DNA sequence, and histone H3 variation. My results indicate that nucleosome termini repeatedly open and close at 0.3~1 ms-1. The kinetics depends on salt and DNA-histone interactions but not much on DNA sequence, suggesting that this dynamics is universal, imposing the ultimate kinetic limit to gene access that can be modulated by histone variation or modification.\nThe other method was to study transient interactions between nucleosomes and how they are affected by two histone acetylation marks and one SUMOylation mark. I found that internucleosomal interactions are inhibited by H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac), H4K12 acetylation (H4K12ac), and H4K12 sumoylation (suH4). However, my single molecule observation suggests that the extents of inhibition in the long- and short-range internucleosomal interactions are different in each case. suH4 and H4K16ac inhibit long-range internucleosomal interactions more than the H4K12ac case. H4K16ac and H4K12ac inhibit short-range internucleosomal interactions more than the suH4 case. These observations led us to a conclusion that H4K16 acetylation inhibits nucleosome array folding by weakening both long- and short-range internucleosomal interactions, making this acetylation the most efficient way to inhibit nucleosome array folding, while H4K12ac and suH4 weaken mainly short-range and long-range interactions, respectively, making them less efficient in array folding inhibition than H4K16ac.\nMy research demonstrates that single molecule methods can provide efficient means to study fast and unsynchronized dynamics of complex systems that are difficult to probe with conventional structural biology tools.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10531], "author_name_tesi": "Wei, Sijie ", "last_name_ssi": "Wei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sijie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tae Hee Lee", "Philip C.

Mechanisms that regulate normal growth and cell proliferation are often perturbed in cancers. Mutational events found in cancers can either promote growth and cell proliferation or impede cell death. Our laboratory has discovered a novel tumor suppressor in Drosophila that we named mats (Mob as a tumor suppressor) which is capable of regulating both cell proliferation and cell death in a coordinated manner. Loss of Mats function results in increased cell proliferation, impaired apoptosis, and tumor formation characterized by elevated levels of the cell cycle regulator cyclin E and apoptosis inhibitor DIAP1. A human homolog of mats can rescue the lethality associated with loss of Mats function in Drosophila. Importantly, loss-of-function mutation in Mats1 have been identified in a human skin cancer and a mouse breast tumor, suggesting that mammalian mats genes may indeed act as tumor suppressors. The work described here focus on elucidating mechanisms by which Mats protein function as tumor suppressor.

Oncogenic mutations of RTKs can also serve as powerful experimental models for understanding the mechanisms of receptor regulation. In this current study, we demonstrate that, in contrast with human Ron (hRon), murine Ron (mRon) displays strong receptor activity and downstream signaling capacity, despite the high degree of sequence conservation between these two orthologous receptors. The main goal of this work is to study the activity and signaling specificity of the receptor by mapping the evolutionary divergence of these two homologous proteins that is responsible for their functional differences. \n                Alternative splicing of signaling proteins can contribute to the complexity of signaling networks. Splicing of the mouse Ron transcript results in the constitutive deletion of an exon used by all other known Ron orthologs, which encodes part of the juxtamembrane (JM) region of the receptor. This partial deletion in the juxtamembrane domain of mouse Ron results in enhanced receptor autophosphorylation and ligand-independent activation of the Ras-p42/44 MAP kinase pathway. In contrast to the ligand-dependent recruitment of a Grb2-Sos complex that requires the autophosphorylation of C-terminal tyrosines, ligand-independent MAP activation is c-Src-dependent and independent of Grb2 and the docking site tyrosines. Furthermore, we show that the mouse Ron juxtamembrane domain controls the association of c-Src with the receptor in a SH2 dependent manner. These data provide direct evidence that the divergence of exon usage among different species can generate a protein with novel activity and subsequently add to the complexity of cellular signaling regulation.\n               Progressive deletions of the mRon C-terminal tail reveal that the constitutive activation of the Erk-Fos pathway is independent of the entire carboxyl tail of the receptor, requiring only the integrity of tyrosine kinase domain. Among the 12 tyrosines in the intracellular region of Ron, we identified three tyrosines (Tyr1175, Tyr1265, Tyr1294) within the kinase domain that play critical but overlapping roles in controlling constitutive Erk activation by mRon. mRon harboring tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at these three sites loses the capability to constitutively activate the Erk-Fos pathway. However, this mutant retains the ability to activate this pathway in response to ligand stimulation. Thus, the ligand dependent and constitutive activity of the mRon receptor can be uncoupled through the alteration of selective sets of tyrosines. Finally, the restoration of one of these three tyrosines results in the recruitment of c-Src by the receptor, highlighting the possibility that those tyrosines might serve as potential c-Src SH2 domain binding site in the absence of ligand. \n             The chimeric studies indicate that, in addition to the JM domain, differences in the kinase domain of hRon and mRon also contribute to the differential activation of the Erk pathway by these receptors, although it only plays a secondary role. We show that the kinase domain of the mRon is more active than that of hRon, as measured by the receptor phosphorylation. However, this strong kinase activity does not regulate recruitment of c-Src by the receptor, nor is it translated into downstream mitogenic response if the active kinase domain is fused with the JM domain of hRon. In an attempt to identify the region in the kinase domain responsible for this difference in activity, we constructed chimeric proteins within the kinase domain. We mapped the critical region to the last 50 amino acids of the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain, in which the two receptors differ only at 8 amino acid residues. Further studies will examine whether the difference in kinase activity can be attributed to a single amino acid substitution. \n            Taken together, this study demonstrates that two regions of evolutionary divergence of human and mouse Ron contribute to the constitutive activity and signaling specificity of the mRon receptor by different mechanisms. The alternation in the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain elevates the basal receptor phosphorylation while without affecting Src binding. Changes in the the mRon JM domain regulate both the activity and specificity of the receptor, leading to the recruitment of Src by tyrosine residues in the kinase domain. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6689], "author_name_tesi": "Wei, Xin ", "last_name_ssi": "Wei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Avery August", "Robert Paulson", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Jia Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Chair", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member", "Jia Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Erk", "signaling", "receptor tyrosine kinase", "Ron", "Src", "Juxtamembrane domain"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Improving models for control of seizures and spreading depression", "id": "17680", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8517", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Epileptic seizures and spreading depression are both pathological conditions characterized by abnormal, excessive discharge of population neuronal activities, accompanied by massive perturbation of ion homeostasis. My research goal is to understand the underlying mechanisms of these pathological dynamics in the brain, with the purpose of developing a novel model-based control approach to suppress pathological conditions. \n\nTo better understand the underlying mechanism of seizures and spreading depression, we first need to build computational models.  I investigated how oxygen is involved with seizure generation, as well as how it interacts with ion dynamics such as potassium and sodium, with a computational model including dynamics of potassium, sodium and oxygen concentrations. The model was validated by real experimental data.  I then extended this model to include the dynamics of chloride and volume for spreading depression - essential to characterize the fluxes and concentration changes. At the same time, I also found that there is a dynamical unification between seizures and SD. I have shown that these models can be used in model-based control frameworks to track experimentally inaccessible variables and parameters from recorded experimental data. This not only helps us understand the underlying mechanism of pathological conditions, but also provides a better foundation for model-based control of seizures and spreading depression. Lastly, I investigated the parameters of electrical stimulation in the hippocampus on freely moving rats.  In preliminary control work in whole animals, I found that there were frequencies of controllers that were associated with cognitive side effects, and that these could be avoided by constraining such controllers to avoid such frequency ranges. Therefore, therapeutic stimulation will always be a balance between optimizing pathological dynamics control and the minimization of cognitive side effects.\n\nThis thesis not only sheds new light on the interrelation between seizures, spreading depression, ion dynamics, and energy metabolism, but also provides a promising future for preventing and suppressing neurological diseases. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8410], "author_name_tesi": "Wei, Yina ", "last_name_ssi": "Wei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Schiff", "Steven Schiff", "Bruce Gluckman", "Corina Stefania Drapaca", "Kevin Douglas Alloway", "Patrick James Drew"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Schiff, Dissertation Advisor", "Steven Schiff, Committee Chair", "Bruce Gluckman, Committee Member", "Corina Stefania Drapaca, Committee Member", "Kevin Douglas Alloway, Committee Member", "Patrick James Drew, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["seizures", "spreading depression", "data assimilation", "hippocampus", "ion concentrations", "oxygen dynamics", "electrical stimulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Student use of Web 2.0 tools to support argumentation in a high school science classroom", "id": "23594", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10563", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This ethnographic study is an investigation into how two classes of chemistry students (n=35) from a low-income high school with a one-to-one laptop initiative used Web 2.0 tools to support participation in the science practice of argumentation (i.e., sensemaking, articulating understandings, and persuading an audience) during a unit on alternative energy.

In addition, the fabrication of polyphosphazene / poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) blends were examined for their physical properties as hard tissue engineering scaffolds.  Chapter 1 outlines the basic fundamentals of polymer chemistry, along with phosphazene chemistry and its application to biomedical materials.\nChapter 2 discusses the synthesis of the dipeptides alanyl-glycine ethyl ester, valinyl-glycine ethyl ester, and phenylalanyl-glycine ethyl esters.  These dipeptides were synthesized using mixed anhydride solution-phase peptide reactions.  The free N-terminus was used as a reactive site for nucleophilic replacement of the chlorine atoms in poly(dichlorophosphazene).  The C-terminus was protected with an ethyl ester to prevent side reactions and crosslinking.  The alanyl-glycine ethyl ester replaced all the chlorine atoms in poly(dichlorophosphazene).  However, replacement of all the chlorine atoms in poly(dichlorophosphazene) by valinyl-glycine ethyl ester or phenylalanyl-glycine ethyl ester polyphosphazenes was prevented by the insolubility of the partially substituted intermediates.  To circumvent this problem, co-substitution was carried out using the valinyl- or phenylalanyl esters with glycine ethyl ester or alanine ethyl ester in a 1:1 ratio.  Co-substituted polyphosphazenes with alanyl glycine ethyl ester and glycine ethyl ester or alanine ethyl ester were also synthesized with a side group ratio of 1:1.  The polymer structures and physical properties were studied using multinuclear NMR, DSC, and GPC techniques.  Heterophase hydrolysis experiments in aqueous media at different pH values were carried out to estimate the hydrolytic sensitivity of these polymers.  All the polymers were less sensitive to hydrolysis under neutral or basic (pH, 10.0) conditions than at pH 4.0, where rapid hydrolysis occurred.\nChapter 3 outlines the preparation of phosphazene tissue engineering scaffolds with bioactive side groups using the biological buffer choline chloride.  Mixed-substituent phosphazene cyclic trimers (as model systems) and polymers with choline chloride and glycine ethyl ester, alanine ethyl ester, valine ethyl ester, or phenyl alanine ethyl ester were synthesized.  Two different synthetic protocols were examined.  A sodium hydride mediated route resulted in polyphosphazenes with a low choline content, while a cesium carbonate mediated process produced polyphosphazenes with higher choline content.  The phosphazene structures and physical properties were studied using multinuclear NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and GPC techniques.  The resultant polymers were then blended with PLGA (50:50) or PLGA (85:15) and characterized by DSC analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  Polymer products obtained via the sodium hydride route produced miscible blends with both ratios of PLGA, while the cesium carbonate route yielded products with reduced blend miscibility.  Heterophase hydrolysis experiments in aqueous media revealed that the polymer blends hydrolyzed to near-neutral pH values (~5.8 to 6.8). The effect of different molecular structures on cellular adhesion showed osteoblast proliferation with an elevated osteoblast phenotype expression compared to PLGA over a 21-day culture period.\nChapter 4 describes the preparation of phosphazenes that possess reversible cross-linking groups to control mechanical stability and hydrolysis using cysteine and methionine amino acid side groups.  Small molecule models and linear polymeric phosphazenes that contain methionine ethyl ester and cysteine ethyl disulfide ethyl ester side groups were synthesized.  Protection of the free thiol groups was carried out to circumvent unwanted cross-linking of the phosphazenes through the cysteine ethyl ester N- and S-termini. Cyclic trimeric cysteine ethyl disulfide ethyl ester model compounds were deprotected by S-S bond cleavage using &#946;-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol (DTT), and zinc in aqueous hydrochloric acid.  For the high polymeric derivatives, the extent of S-S bond cleavage varied depending on the deprotection method used.  With the exception of the Zn / HCl method, the resultant deprotected polymers were soluble in common organic solvents and underwent minimal chain cleavage during the reaction sequence.  The protected or deprotected high polymers are candidates for reversible cross-linking in drug delivery systems and for cross-link stabilization of tissue engineering scaffolds.\nChapter 5 evaluates the first reported synthesis of a completely hydrolysable polyphosphazene-containing block co-polymer.  The synthesis of poly(lactic acid)-co-poly[(bis-alanine ethyl ester phosphazene)], poly(lactic acid)-co-poly[(bis-valine ethyl ester phosphazene)], and poly(lactic acid)-co-poly[(bis-phenylalanine ethyl ester phosphazene)] has been accomplished.  These block co-polymers were used as blend compatibalizers to form composites of PLAGA (50:50) or PLAGA (85:15) with poly[(bis-alanine ethyl ester phosphazene)], poly[(bis-valine ethyl ester phosphazene)], or poly[(bis-phenylalanine ethyl ester phosphazene)].  The effect of the block copolymers on the composites formed from previously immiscible blends was studied.  The resultant composites were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate systems miscibility.  The rates of hydrolysis and pH of the hydrolysis media were also investigated.\nChapter 6 discusses a unique polymer erosion process for biodegradable biomaterials through which the polymer changes from a solid coherent film to an assemblage of microspheres with interconnected porous structures. The polymer system was developed on the highly versatile platform of self-neutralizing polyphosphazene-polyester blends. Co-substituting a polyphosphazene backbone with both glycylglycine dipeptide and with side groups that can retard the polymer degradation, such as hydrophobic 4-phenylphenoxy, generated a unique polymer with strong hydrogen bonding ability and a slow degradation rate. During the blend hydrolysis in aqueous media, the relatively fast degradation rate of the polyester favored 3D void space formation characterized by macropores (10-100 \u00b5m) between polyphosphazene spheres as well as micro and nanopores on the sphere surface. The blend degradation was further investigated in vivo using a rat subcutaneous implantation model. A 12-week degradation resulted in a 3D porous structure with 82-87% porosity and with 100% interconnectivity. This in situ-formed 3D interconnected porous structure enabled cell infiltration and collagen tissue in-growth. Thus, the dynamic pore formation process accompanying the matrix erosion provides a new strategy in regenerative medicine for developing solid matrices that allows tissue integration as the matrix degrades.\nChapter 7 describes a series of closely related polyphosphazenes with propoxy, pentoxy, hexoxy, octoxy,  isostearyloxy, and 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy (MEE)  side groups, together with co-substituent species with both the alkoxy and MEE side chains.  These were studied for their morphology and miscibility with oligoisobutylene (OIB).  All the pure polymers except one had a single glass transition temperature.  The exception was the species with both isostearyloxy and MEE side groups, which underwent two low temperature second order transitions, even though 31P NMR spectra indicated the absence of a block-type structure.  For the single-substituent macromolecules, the solubility at 80 &#730;C in OIB increased as the length of the unbranched alkoxy side groups rose from propoxy to octoxy (from 1 to 11 wt/wt%).   However, the polymer with two isostearyloxy side chains per repeat unit had a low solubility in OIB (3 wt/wt%) and the species with the two MEE side groups on every repeat unit was totally insoluble.  When both alkoxy and MEE side groups were present, the solubility in OIB was also low (0-3%), except for the species with both isostearyloxy and MEE side groups, which was soluble in OIB at a level of 21 wt/wt% at 80 &#730;C, and showed Tg evidence of polymer/oligomer miscibility even at -80 &#730;C.  Explanations are suggested for the unusual behavior of this polymer.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [247], "author_name_tesi": "Weikel, Arlin Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Weikel", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Arlin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Professor Harry R Allcock", "Harry R Allcock", "Karl Todd Mueller", "Alan James Benesi", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Professor Harry R Allcock, Dissertation Advisor", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Chair", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Member", "Alan James Benesi, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polyphosphazenes", "amino acids", "polymer blends", "block copolymers"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Factors that Influence the Involvement of Youth In Pennsylvania 4-H Extension District 16 Livestock Programs\n\n", "id": "22560", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10213", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "4-H is one of Pennsylvania\u2019s oldest and largest youth development organizations, having originated in Mercer County Pennsylvania in 1912 (4-hhistorypreservation.com). In the United states, 4-H has a reach of over 6.5 million young people between the ages of 5 and 21 years old (4-h.org). \n\tOne of the major overlying themes of many 4-H programs is enriching the lives of youth through agriculture, particularly animal agriculture. With animal production and animal agricultural practices at the center of much scientific and social debate, a new generation of animal agriculture leaders will be needed to secure our national and world food supplies (Oxfam.org). \n\tThe purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence youth to become involved in Pennsylvania 4-H District 16 Livestock programs. Using data collected from 4-H members in Adams, Franklin, and York Counties of Pennsylvania (who are involved in livestock; beef sheep and swine programs), this study examined 1.)  the demographic profile of the 4-H members in this district, 2.) the factors that influence youth participation in 4-H livestock programs,  3.) learning and leadership experiences and 4.) factors limiting participation in 4-H livestock programs.  \n\tData was collected using an electronic survey tool. This tool was sent to 150 unique email addresses of youth participating in Pennsylvania 4-H livestock programs in District 16. Ninety-five responses were collected, for a return rate of 63.3%. \n\tDescriptive statistics such as frequencies, percentages, means and standard deviation were used to analyze the data. The demographic data presented showed that 100% of survey respondents identified themselves as white/Caucasian and 87.8% of indicated that they lived either on a farm or in a rural nonfarm location. This shows that 4-H livestock programs, and the valuable learning and leadership experiences associated with them, are not reaching a diverse audience. \n\tParents were shown to be the greatest influencing factor of youth involvement within the 4-H livestock program and only 3.5 % of youth indicating that their parents were a limitation to their involvement. The study also showed that youth wanted to be involved in the program because they wanted to work with animal\u2019s hands on, and that they thought the program looked like fun. The financial cost of purchasing, and raising a project animal was shown to be the most limiting factor.\n\t Youth are getting valuable leadership and learning experiences in 4-H livestock programs with 48.2% of respondents indicating that they periodically complete challenging tasks. Even more youth (61.4%) held or currently hold a club officer position. \n\tRecommendations for further study include increasing the population frame and evaluating the factor of \u201ctime\u201d to assess if 4-H members have the time to engage in more or varied livestock project experiences. With two-thirds of the study participants indicating that their parents were involved in 4-H, further study on parents professions and living situations (e.g.., if they work in livestock production, if they live rurally) could provide additional insight as to how the 4-H livestock tradition passes from generation to generation. \n\tProgrammatic recommendations include the development of a 4-H project for in school or out of school enrichment similar to the \u201cMeet the Plants\u201d 4-H project. A \u201cMeet the Animals\u201d 4-H project could be used in schools and in urban settings to give youth the opportunity to learn about and appreciate animal agriculture. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9899], "author_name_tesi": "Weikert, Ben Spangler", "last_name_ssi": "Weikert", "middle_name_ssi": "Spangler", "first_name_ssi": "Ben", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tracy Scheidt Hoover", "Rama B Radhakrishna", "Ann M Swinker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tracy Scheidt Hoover, Thesis Advisor", "Rama B Radhakrishna, Thesis Advisor", "Ann M Swinker, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["4-H", "youth development", "extension", "livestock"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Authenticity and Lesbian Health Educators\n", "id": "12233", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5114", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract                                                  \n\tThis qualitative study used narrative inquiry to explore how lesbian health educators navigate authenticity in a heteronormative higher education setting.

The mentoring relationship gives support and guidance to novices by helping them grow professionally, helping mentors become more reflective educators, and reducing feelings of isolation. Mentoring\u2019s overall effectiveness is determined by the quality of the relationship. Mentoring programs can fail because of a lack of interpersonal mentor/mentee relationships. A greater emphasis on the mentoring relationship would be beneficial to more effective mentoring overall. \nThe purpose of this multiple case study was to examine the relationships between music teacher mentors and mentees within the context of Connecticut\u2019s state-wide novice teacher induction program, Teacher Education and Mentoring Program (TEAM), a two-year induction program for beginning teachers that includes mentoring and professional development.

Second year teachers were selected to focus on the established relationships, rather than the experience of creating relationships. Data were gathered from five journal entries, three individual interviews, and one joint interview with the mentor/mentee pair. Data collection and analysis were designed to gather rich data about each case (the mentor/mentee pair) and the individual participants (the unit of analysis). \nData were analyzed and presented first by detailing the mentoring relationship of each case, and second through cross-case analysis. Emergent themes were: roles and responsibilities in the relationship, trust, communication, judgment, reciprocity, personal aspects, and the challenges of time and proximity. Findings revealed that mentors and mentees believed they had specific roles and responsibilities in the relationship. Mentors established trust and communication early in the relationship and provided support without judgment. This helped the mentees feel comfortable approaching the mentors with questions and challenges. Both relationships were collaborative and reciprocal. The mentoring relationship helped combat feelings of isolation for all participants. Although each relationship was successful, time and proximity were challenges in both relationships. \nRoles and responsibilities must be communicated early in the relationship to foster success. Mentors must be dedicated to the professional growth of the mentee, and properly prepared to take on their role.

Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) of Plasmodium falciparum are a key component in the recognition of the malaria parasite by the innate immune system. Macrophages respond to GPIs mainly via a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and MyD88 dependent pathway, activating signaling pathways that include the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and NF-&#954;B pathways. These signaling pathways are critical for the production of cytokines that enable the immune system to respond effectively and appropriately to control the pathogen growth. The goal of the work described in this thesis was to determine the role of MAPKs and transcription factors in proinflammatory cytokine production. Two cytokines, Interleukin (IL)-12 and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-&#945;, are of particular interest because they are involved in malaria pathogenesis and in shaping the intensity and effectiveness of the immune responses. \nIn macrophages, the GPI- induced expression of IL-12 is controlled by an array of transcription factors. I found that I&#954;B-zeta, a component in the NF-&#954;B pathway, is a critical transcription factor involved in the efficient production of IL-12 in response to GPIs and other TLR ligands. Priming of cells by IFN-&#947; is required for optimal production of IL-12, and it appears that this mechanism does not directly overlap with the role that I&#954;B-zeta plays in IL-12 production. Additionally, although IL-12 expression can be enhanced by suppression of certain MAPK signaling, no increase in I&#954;B-zeta was detected using MAPK inhibitors. Thus, the MAPKs do not play a role in IL-12 production via suppression of I&#954;B-zeta, although downstream cooperative mechanisms between these components are possible. \nIt is well-established that TNF-&#945; can be regulated by MAPKs at multiple levels, including transcription, mRNA stability, translation, and protein processing. The contribution of MAPK activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), a signaling molecule which plays an important role in controlling TNF-&#945; mRNA stability, was established using bone marrow derived macrophages from Mk2-/- mice. These studies were performed with TLR ligands using pharmacological inhibitors to analyze the MAPKs responsible for activating MK2. In addition to the known role for p38 in activation of MK2, I observed a role for the ERK1/2 MAPK in its regulation. Time-course studies provided new insights into temporal modulation of MK2 activation by different MAPK pathways. The effects of MK2 on TNF-&#945; mRNA stability are believed to be related to a target of MK2, tristetraprolin (TTP) that binds the TNF-&#945; mRNA. I confirmed that the Mk2-/- mice were impaired in their activation of TTP. In addition, I discovered a new role for the Tpl2/ERK1/2 MAPK pathway in the regulation of the protein TTP. Collectively, these results provide detailed mechanistic insights into how the innate immune system responses to the recognition of malaria parasite GPIs. The data have important implications for the development of novel vaccines and therapeutics.

Health messages are often based on rational appeals that point to risk and encourage precautionary actions to protect individuals from pregnancy, STIs, and HIV but neglect the affective responses to such messages. The current study was designed to develop messages that address the cognitive and affective involved in sexual decision-making by integrating affect into Prospect Theory. According to the framing postulate of Prospect Theory, individuals will respond differently to factually equivalent information based on how it is framed (Rothman & Salovey, 1997). Different audience characteristics (e.g., sex, health orientation) and individual predisposition variables such as self- and response efficacy also influence individuals\u2019 responses to messages. Therefore, it was posited that segments of the audience would respond to gain- or loss-framed guilt appeals slightly differently. To examine the processes associated with peoples\u2019 responses to sexual health messages participants completed measures of health orientation, intensity of relational commitment, anger, embarrassment, guilt, perceived behavioral control, self- and response efficacy, reinforcement of attitudes, actual and procedural knowledge and behavioral intentions. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the five message conditions; they were instructed to read a message and then completed a questionnaire. Results revealed differences between \u2018users\u2019 and \u2018nonusers.\u2019 More specifically, \u2018users\u2019 reported greater intentions to use protection for oral sex, were less concerned with what their partners\u2019 thought of them, were less angry, but experienced more guilt than \u2018nonusers.\u2019 Individuals in committed relationships were examined and the results for both the gain- and loss-framed conditions were similar. That is, for both types of frames guilt and anger were significant predictors of intentions to use. The more guile individuals experienced the more likely they were to use protection for oral sex in the future and the inverse relationship was found with anger. Surprisingly, a similar pattern emerged for individuals in non-committed relationships. These results are discussed in terms of the importance of using theory to guide message construction and the significance of guilt appeals. Limitations of the study and implications for future research are also discussed. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2823], "author_name_tesi": "Weiner, Judith Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Weiner", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Judith", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roxanne Louise Parrott", "Walid A Afifi", "Jon F Nussbaum", "Michael L Hecht", "Eva Sharon Lefkowitz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roxanne Louise Parrott, Committee Chair", "Walid A Afifi, Committee Member", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member", "Michael L Hecht, Committee Member", "Eva Sharon Lefkowitz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["message framing", "emotions", "message design", "sexual health", "guilt appeals", "Prospect Theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "BROADCASTING, THE FCC, AND PROGRAMMING REGULATION: A NEW DIRECTION IN INDECENCY ENFORCEMENT", "id": "14975djw26", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14975", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The U.S. Supreme Court, in June 2012, left broadcasters in a \u201cholding pattern\u201d by dodging the longstanding question of whether the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s broadcast indecency policy can survive constitutional scrutiny today given the vastly changed media landscape.  The high court\u2019s narrow ruling in FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc. exonerated broadcasters for the specific on-air improprieties that brought the case to its attention, but did little to resolve the larger and more salient issue of whether such content regulations have become archaic.  As a result, the Commission continues to police the broadcast airwaves, recently sanctioning a Roanoke, Virginia television station $325,000 for alleged broadcast indecency.    \n\tThis dissertation yields an in-depth analysis and synthesis of the legal obstacles the FCC will encounter in attempting to establish any revamped policy governing broadcast indecency.

As educational ideology, building systems, and technology have changed, so have the schools\u02bc curriculum and courses. Today, there is increasing pressure from practitioners, educators, and organizations such as the American Institute of Architects (AIA), the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB), the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA), and the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NCARB) to include more professional coursework into architecture curricula. The concern about recent graduates of architecture schools not being professionally prepared has been documented through several publications and data. To address this issue, schools are experimenting with new courses and curricular modifications. This research will examine some of these innovative approaches that bolster professional education coursework.\n\nTraditionally, a stand-alone professional practice course has been used to meet accreditation requirements grouped in the Leadership and Practice category for student performance criteria as defined by the NAAB. This course has been a part of U.S. architectural pedagogy for decades. Its purpose is to familiarize students with the pragmatics of working in an architecture office as well as different aspects of the profession that are not learned in traditional architectural coursework and studios. These include the Intern Development Process (IDP), codes, contract documents, client/user relations, and the process to become a licensed architect. This lecture course is commonly placed at the end of a five-year undergraduate curriculum and is normally between three and six credits. This research shows that a disproportionate amount of the accreditation criteria is being met by this stand-alone course.\n\nWith pressure to increase topics relating to professional preparedness in the curriculum, it is becoming necessary for schools to add courses, or modify the existing professional practice course in response to the accreditation criteria. The research begins with an overview of forty- seven accredited U.S. undergraduate programs of architecture and how they respond to professional preparedness requirements. Then an analysis of eighteen reports for (and from) accreditation reviews will describe how schools demonstrate compliance with the accreditation criteria. Finally, a more detailed look into two different types of innovative approaches will follow. Virginia Tech uses a modified professional practice course, while Penn State uses an additional course in conjunction with the traditional professional practice course. This research compares and contrasts how the two approaches address the NAAB accreditation requirements for Leadership and Practice in comparison to a traditional professional practice course. The results show that both approaches provide architecture students a greater understanding and applicability of the topics in professional preparedness.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8245], "author_name_tesi": "Weinreb, Ross Elliot", "last_name_ssi": "Weinreb", "middle_name_ssi": "Elliot", "first_name_ssi": "Ross", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott W Wing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott W Wing, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Architectural pedagogy", "Professional Practice course", "Accreditation"]}]
