However, as \nsingle chip systems become a reality, ingenious solutions are needed for many arising architectural issues.One such issue is the design of an on-chip interconnect to facilitate communications among different IP blocks. The integration of multiple cores on a single die has signaled the beginning of a communication-centric design philosophy rather than a computationally centered one.  Further, the introduction of nano-scale technology has emphasized the importance of a communication-conscious design where global wiring delays do not scale down as fast as gate delays in newer technologies. Therefore, on-chip interconnections are expected to be a major hurdle in the design of embedded SoC \narchitectures and high-performance multicore architectures alike. While there is a large body of literature on traditional multiprocessor \narchitectures, the design and analysis of an on-chip communication infrastructure is inherently more complex because of its resource constraints, \nfloor planning, and technology scaling artifacts. Consequently, to resolve the growing concerns of on-chip communication behavior, new architectural and technological solutions are being vigorously investigated. Among the architectural trends, use of on-chip packet-based communication networks, known as Networks-on-Chip (NoC), have been gaining wide acceptance due to their scalability. These NoCs have been deployed in current commercialized products, including a recently announced 80-core TERAFLOP processor. While NoC research has made \nsignificant progress, there is still the lack of a generic design methodology which encompasses issues in performance, scalability, power, and reliability in a cohesive fashion.\n\nThis research consists of five parts. First, the design and analysis of NoC micro-architectures has been explored, where a comprehensive platform for evaluating the performance and energy consumption behavior has been developed. This framework allows for investigating the scalability issues of \nthese NoC architectures as well as provides a means by which different system configurations, wiring layouts, switching mechanisms, routing algorithms and micro-architectural designs could be evaluated.  \nThe rapidly increasing use of SoC architectures has accentuated the need for efficient on-chip communication infrastructures. Thus, asa the second part of this work, we proposed one type of solution, in which a low-latency on-chip router architecture supporting adaptive path-sensitive mechanisms, was shown to be able to\nminimize average packet latency by intelligent path selection and reduced switching activities.\nThird, we have developed an analytical model.\nAnother fundamental aspect of NoC design is the ability to precisely and efficiently provide analysis of an NoC's performance, fault-tolerance, and energy behavior. We developed a queuing-theory-based analytical model for\nNoC architectures which performed latency and power analysis at the granularity of individual hardware sub-modules, resulting in an increase of\nthe models accuracy. The model developed here quantified the overall power consumption by capturing the utilization of different component and their corresponding energy consumptions. By integrating performance, power, and reliability models, the analytical model was further able to evaluate multi-objective tradeoffs.\nFourth, as a comprehensive design paradigm, we proposed a novel, fine grained modular router architecture utilizing a Row-Column Decoupled (RoCo) design. \nWe explored the SoC/NoC design space for reliable and predicatively high-performing architectures, and developed suitable fault-tolerant techniques to handle permanent hard faults. This architecture comprised of a powerful amalgam of novel techniques, all of which work in unison to produce a very efficient and fault-tolerant interconnection system. The development of concepts such as early ejection, guided flit queuing, the mirroring effect, and hardware\nrecycling provided huge benefits to the router's operation and help create a very efficient and resilient system. In the last chapter, we explored the design of a 3D, crossbar-style, NoC for\nupcoming 3D VLSI technology as emerging chip multiprocessor systems. This exploration provided insight into the tradeoffs between circuit complexity and performance using real commercial \nand scientific benchmarks in the simulation testbed. \nThis research helps to further understand the role of NoC design as an integral part of the future SoC/multicore architectures by investigating and developing new micro-architectural solutions.\nThis thesis is useful for making experimental and theoretical advances in understanding \nthe interplay between performance, energy, and reliability in deep-submicron designs, providing\ndevelopment of comprehensive design analysis models/tools.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3164, 3165], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Jongman ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jongman", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das", "Padma Raghavan", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "William Kenneth Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das, Committee Chair", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Routing Mechanism", "Computer Architecture", "Network-on-Chip", "System-on-Chip"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "SYNTHETIC MATERIALS FOR THE UPTAKE OF PERCHLORATE\n\n", "id": "9636", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3183", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Synthetic matrials such as layered double hydroxides (LDHs), organoclays and organosilica (MCM-41) were synthesized, characterized and evaluated for their effectiveness in removing perchlorate anions from solutions. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3171], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Joo Young  ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Joo Young ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Pollution Control", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sridhar Komarneni", "Sridhar Komarneni", "Fred Scott Cannon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sridhar Komarneni, Thesis Advisor", "Sridhar Komarneni, Thesis Advisor", "Fred Scott Cannon, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["UPTAKE OF PERCHLORATE"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "A CAPACITY ESTIMATION METHOD FOR TWO-LANE, TWO-WAY HIGHWAYS USING SIMULATION MODELING", "id": "7160", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3180", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-01-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The 2000 HCM (Highway Capacity Manual) suggests the capacity of two-lane, two-way highways to be 3,400 pcph for both directions and 1,700 pcph for one direction. In fact, higher traffic volumes have been observed in previous studies. Also, a single capacity value cannot reflect the variety of traffic, geometric, and driver conditions that may exist on two-lane, two-way highways. In addition, observation of capacity is difficult, so a new simulation model is developed in this study. Capacity of two-lane, two-way highways is estimated using a microscopic simulation model, which is developed with MATLAB 6.5. Due to the absence of capacity data, the newly developed simulator, TWOSIM (Two-lane, two-way highway SIMulator) is compared to existing analytical tools such as TWOPAS and 2000 HCM method for verification of its performance. Using TWOSIM, the capacity (i.e., 100 percent no-passing zone, all passenger cars and commuters, level tangent section, 12\u2019 lane width, 6\u2019 shoulder width) for one direction is estimated to be 2,100 pcph at 60 and 70 mph average free flow speeds, 2,000 pcph at 50 mph average free flow speed, and 1,850 pcph at 40 mph average free flow speed. These estimated capacities are higher than the 2000 HCM\u2019s estimated capacity for one direction. The presence of passing zones was not found to increase capacity. Additional capacity values are estimated to account for the presence of a driveway, a horizontal curve, a grade, and various percentages of trucks in the traffic stream.

Both the finite wing\neffect and actuator saturation for trailing-edge flaps\nare also included in an aeroelastic analysis.\n\nFor a composite articulated rotor, a new active blade loads control method is\ndeveloped and tested numerically. The concept involves\nstraightening the blade by introducing dual\ntrailing edge flaps. The objective\nfunction, which includes vibratory hub loads, bending moment harmonics and\nactive flap control inputs, is minimized by an integrated optimal\ncontrol/optimization process.\n A numerical simulation is performed for the steady-state forward flight of\nan advance ratio of 0.35. It is demonstrated that through straightening the\nrotor blade, which mimics the behavior of a rigid blade, both the bending\nmoments and vibratory hub loads can be significantly reduced.\n\nAn active vibration control method is\ndeveloped and analyzed for a hingeless rotor.\n The concept involves\ndeflecting each individual trailing-edge flap using a compact resonant\nactuation system. Each resonant\nactuation system could yield high authority, while operating at a single\nfrequency. Parametric studies are conducted to explore the finite wing effect of\ntrailing-edge flaps and actuator saturation.\nA numerical simulation has been\nperformed for the steady-state forward flight ($mu=0.15 sim 0.35$). It is\ndemonstrated that multiple trailing-edge flap configuration with the resonant\nactuation system can reduce the required trailing-edge flap hinge moments.\n\nA novel resonant actuation concept is developed to efficiently\nrealize the\nhelicopter vibration and blade loads control. The resonant actuation\nsystem (RAS) is achieved through both mechanical and electrical\ntailoring. With mechanical tuning, the resonant frequencies of the\nactuation system (includes the piezoelectric actuator and the related\nmechanical and electrical elements for actuation) can be adjusted to\nthe required actuation frequencies. This obviously will increase the\nauthority of the actuation system. To further enhance controllability\nand robustness, the actuation resonant peak can be significantly\nbroadened and flattened with electrical tailoring through the aid of\nan electric network of inductance, resistance, and negative\ncapacitance.\n\n\nA piezoelectric resonant actuation system model is\nderived for active flap rotors.\nThe optimal values of the electrical components are explicitly\ndetermined. An equivalent electric\ncircuit model emulating the physical actuation system is derived and\nexperimentally tested to investigate the initial feasibility of the\npiezoelectric resonant actuation system. It is\ndemonstrated that the proposed resonant actuation system can indeed achieve\nboth high active authority and robustness. In addition to this,\nthe RAS is compared to an equivalent\nmechanical system to provide better physical understandings.

This research is focused on the effects of metacognitive monitoring and situation awareness feedback on human performance and a new approach to evaluate trainees\u2019 self-regulated learning process in dynamic control tasks by using fuzzy indexes including the Self-Regulated Fuzzy (SRF) index and the Self-Regulated Learning Meta (SRLM) index. Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) is one of the most popular concepts in metacognition research. It provides a broad picture of learning competencies that influence the metacognitive process, such as self-reflection and control of learning. Prior research on SRL has shown that successful learning is often based on specific metacognitive activities which have to be frequently monitored during learning. SRL models have been studied by many researchers because accurate monitoring of learning is one of the critical elements in metacognition. According to their research, self-regulated learners are more recognizable for their academic strengths and weaknesses than non-self-regulated learners.  However, the nature of the human learning process is so ambiguous and imprecise that it is hard to understand the internal cognitive process using SRL. Moreover, an important limitation in prior SRL studies is that most experimental tasks were designed within static environments. Rarely have researchers investigated the SRL process during dynamic decision making tasks.  \nThe main objective of this research is to explore new training techniques to improve not only the trainees\u2019 information-based situation awareness related to their declarative knowledge but also their experience-based situation awareness in terms of their procedural knowledge.  By investigating the significance of metacognition and developing the metacognitive training framework within the dynamic tasks environment, it is possible to recognize the impact of metacognitive feedback in training simulations and propose using a self-regulated fuzzy index to understand the relations between information-based situation awareness and experience-based situation awareness.\nTo conduct the experiment, we developed a Human-in-the-Loop Anti-Air Warfare Coordinator simulation, which emulates a computer-based dynamic control task to identify navigational cognitive behavior. A simulation-based approach is used to identify navigational metacognitive behavior derived from situation awareness properties such as knowledge, comprehension, and prediction. The results show that metacognitive monitoring feedback is an integral part of self-regulated learning processes in dynamic decision-making tasks. In this study, I also suggest the new metacognitive training framework in complex dynamic system and human adaptive training (HAT) strategy using a self-regulated learning meta-index.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8764], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Jung Hyup", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "Hyup", "first_name_ssi": "Jung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ling Rothrock", "Ling Rothrock", "Andris Freivalds", "David Arthur Nembhard", "Dr Michael Mc Neese", "Dr Anand Tharanathan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ling Rothrock, Dissertation Advisor", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Chair", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "David Arthur Nembhard, Committee Member", "Dr Michael Mc Neese, Committee Member", "Dr Anand Tharanathan, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metacognition", "human-in-the-loop simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "BRIDGING METHOD FOR THE JB2006 AND NRLMSISE-00 THERMOSPHERIC DENSITY MODELS IN THE ALTITUDE RANGE OF 140 KM THROUGH 200 KM\n\n", "id": "8462", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3076", "abstract_tesi": "Density data in the altitude range between 140 km and 200 km are sparse.

However, the\nrequired knowledge of such a reconfigurable platform is growing as\nthe complexities to use these platforms continue to increase. This\nwork simplifies the use of reconfigurable platforms for targeted\nsignal processing applications. The first contribution is the design\nof TANOR, a tool for accelerating applications utilizing numerical\nalgorithms with large-size data sets. TANOR is targeted at solving a\nrange of N-body interaction problems spanning from astrophysics to\nmolecular dynamics. The TANOR design flow starts with a MATLAB\ndescription of a particular interaction function and parameter\nselection from a graphical user interface. Subsequently, TANOR\nautomatically generates a configuration bitstream for a target FPGA\nalong with associated drivers and control software necessary to\nexecute the application on a host computer. Architectural\nexploration is facilitated through support for standard number\nrepresentations such as single precision floating point in addition\nto support for fully custom fixed-point and floating point\nrepresentations. Moreover, TANOR enables joint exploration of\nalgorithmic and architectural variations in realizing efficient\nhardware accelerators. TANOR's effectiveness and adaptability is\ndemonstrated by generating kernels for three different applications:\nnamely, the gravitational kernel (used in astrophysics), the\nGaussian kernel (common in image processing applications), and a\nforce calculation kernel (applied in molecular dynamics). The\nresults show that TANOR is capable of achieving identical accuracy\nwith lower resource utilization, making it competitive with existing\nmanually-designed custom accelerators.\n\nThe second contribution focuses on designing an accelerator for Fast\nFourier Transforms (FFT), which are used extensively in signal and\ndigital image processing. Since FFT is such a versatile algorithm,\nmuch effort has been devoted to enhance its computation efficiency.\nOf particular interest is the two-dimensional (2D) FFT which is more\ncomputation- and bandwidth-intensive than the one-dimensional (1D)\nFFT. Traditionally, a 2D FFT is computed using Row-Column (RC)\ndecomposition, where 1D FFTs are computed along the rows followed by\n1D FFTs along the columns. Both application specific and\nreconfigurable hardware have been used for high-performance\nimplementations of 2D FFT based applications. However, architectures\nbased on RC decomposition are not efficient for large input size\ndata due to memory bandwidth constraints. To address this problem,\nan efficient architecture to implement the 2D FFT for large size\ninputs based on a novel 2D decomposition algorithm is proposed. This\narchitecture achieves very high throughput by exploiting the\ninherent parallelism due to the 2D decomposition and by overlapping\ncommunication with computation. A custom-designed high throughput\nmemory interface block enables maximum utilization of the memory\nbandwidth. In addition, an automatic system generator is provided\nfor mapping this architecture onto a reconfigurable platform of\nXilinx Virtex4 and Virtex5 devices. For a 2Kx2K input size,\nthe proposed architecture provides a 96.7% improvement compared to\nRC decomposition based implementation under the same memory\nconstraints, and also outperforms existing 2D FFT implementations.\nThe proposed solutions can serve as the enabling blocks for\nimplementing a wide range of applications that can be solved using\nNon-Uniform FFT.

It has recently been shown that a new wastewater treatment method based on microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can be used to treat domestic or industrial organic wastewater and simultaneously produce electricity. Sewage sludge has been known to be a good inoculum for MFCs because it can be readily obtained and contains various electrochemically active microbes. \nVarious techniques to enrich electrochemically active bacteria on an electrode using anaerobic sludge as an inoculum were studied using anaerobic sludge and a two-chamber fuel cell. A ferric oxide coated electrode increased power density and coulombic efficiency to 30 mW/m2 and 80%, as compared with carbon electrode (8 mW/m2 and 40%). The methanogen inhibitor (2-bromoethanesulfonate; BES) also increased the CE to 70%. A paste of bacteria from an electrode already producing electricity for a new electrode increased the power density to 40 mW/m2. These results indicate that sewage sludge can be used as an inoculum with the proper acclimation techniques to increase the effectiveness of electricity generation using domestic or industrial wastewater.  \nAlcohols are believed to be transient liquid fuels for hydrogen fuels cell due to easy storage and transportation. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) using microorganisms as a biocatalyst have not been reported. The maximum power density and CE using ethanol in a 2-chamber MFC system were 40 mW/m2 at 0.3 mA and 42% to 61%, respectively. The result of the byproduct analysis indicated that ethanol was oxidized to CO2 via acetate. Single chamber MFCs with air cathodes using ethanol produced the maximum power density of 488 \u00a1\u00be 12 mW/m2 and approximately 10% of CE.

Their existence secures marginalized groups\u2019 involvement in society and enhances community development by building community leadership with multiple stakeholders that infuses new meanings to other organizational or community sectors beyond traditional approaches on leadership.\nThis critical ethnography analyzed how community activists in an urban Korean American Community Organization built community leadership and engaged in daily learning for social justice. Data were collection over a six-month period and included participant observation, formal and informal interviews with seventeen activists, and analysis of documents and cultural artifacts. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods of data analysis, reflection, and writing.\nCultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) was used as a theoretical framework. Learning in CHAT is understood as a socio-cultural phenomenon in which learning occurs through dynamic and continuous interaction of the subject and object, mediated within a specific socio-cultural and historical context.\nThree community leadership activities (activity systems) were identified: Coalition, Empowerment, and Collaboration. The activities were each driven by objects through historical accumulation of the organization\u2019s background and internal/external socio-cultural contexts. Diverse contradictions were found within each activity and among activities. The contradictions throughout three activities may hinder community leadership building and learning.\nThe contradictions became a driving force for learning. Consequently, the activists created a revised object among the three activities: to advance immigrant rights by enhancing community leadership focused organizational capacity building. This object as a significant learning outcome led to various intended/unintended outcomes for community leadership development and unintended outcomes for social and individual level learning, including socio-cultural and structural transformation, new actions, and individual learning. These learning outcomes result in the revision of the community leadership activity network with intended outcomes.\nBased on the findings, learning needs to be understood as a social process; researchers need more focus on social outcomes of learning. Several important features for facilitating community leadership and learning were also discussed.

The examination of children\u2019s drawing events is important to understand children\u2019s artistic development. Many scholars have studied home drawing events, but no one has explicitly studied the meaning of drawing events in the home environment. Many studies have shown the importance of the home to children\u2019s general education. This work specifically extended the general concept of the drawing event to the home environment.  \n\tIn order to study this event, a socio-cultural framework was used. For this study, an 8-year-old Korean boy named DV was selected as the person of interest. He was temporarily living in the United States with his family while his mother obtained her degree. This transient child was selected in order to better highlight differences in culture in the home environment. The child was observed in his home environment for 21 months. Over these 21 months, the researcher observed the child\u2019s creation of a sequence of dragon drawings; this observation offered insights into the boy\u2019s home drawing event. The work was coded and analyzed in relation to his relationship with family members, culture, and objects found in his home environment.\n\tStudy findings pointed to the overwhelming influence of the home drawing event on the child\u2019s artistic development. The home drawing event had no beginning or end. In fact, the home drawing event was an ongoing process that touched every aspect of his daily life. Additionally, his home drawing event fostered an environment of experimentation and merging of ideas from his Asian culture and new western home. This merging was best represented in the hybridity between western and Asian dragon styles in his drawings after western dragons were introduced into his U.S. home.

Long-term care organizations have conducted various change initiatives to improve the quality of the workplace environment and the retention of direct care workers. Even within the same general context, some kinds of organizations are better than others at adopting and implementing change. Organizational structure is known to be one of the critical factors in adopting and implementing organizational change. However, neither the structural characteristics of long-term care organizations nor the relationship of those structures to the process of change are well established. In addition, structural differences between facility-based and home-based long-term care organizations remain under-investigated.\n\nStudy Objectives. The study examined whether the long-term care service provider organizations are grouped together based on observed (manifest) structural indicators. The six indicators are centralization, formalization, extent of job-related training, vertical communication, horizontal communication, and supervisory span of control. The organizations were designated according to several mutually exclusive latent groups (classes), which were then related to organizational change processes, such as each organizational group\u2019s readiness for change, commitment to change, and actual level of implementation.\n\nHypotheses. Based on Burns and Stalker\u2019s typology of organic and mechanistic structure, we hypothesized that long-term care organizations could be classified into more than one group based on their respective structural configurations (H1). We further hypothesized that the grouping pattern would be different within each service provider\u2019s setting, such as facility-based vs. home-based settings (H2). Finally, we hypothesized that organic organizations would be more positively related to change outcomes than would mechanistic organizations (H3). \n\nMethods. As structure is not a one-dimensional construct, it is most effectively represented by combinations of several indicators. Latent Class Analysis (LCA), therefore, was used to identify unobserved (latent) classes of organizations, which have a common structure. The study used cross-sectional survey data from 100 long-term care organizations, all of which participated in the Better Jobs Better Care (BJBC) demonstration project from 2003 to 2006. The study variables were mostly from organizational-level survey data, except centralization (aggregated from individual-worker-level data) and span of control (aggregated from middle-supervisor-level data). \n\nResults. Three latent classes (groups) emerged based on the six observed structural indicators, with the reasonable statistical fit indicators. Classes were (1) organic (professional) hierarchy, (2) mechanistic hierarchy, and (3) minimalist. Facility-based settings had a higher probability of membership in the mechanistic class than in other classes, whereas home-based settings had a higher probability of membership in the minimalist and organic classes than in the mechanistic class. In regard to the relationship between organizational change processes and structure, the organic type was positively associated with readiness for change and commitment to change, while the minimalist type was negatively associated with readiness for change and commitment to change, compared to the mechanistic class. Change implementation level, though, was not significantly related to any of the three structures. \n\nConclusion and implications. The present study will allow managers, researchers, and policy makers to more comprehensively understand structures in various types of long-term care organizations. In addition, the study results provide information regarding which structures are most positive for organizational change, which, in turn, can be an important criteria for evaluating intervention programs and developing implementation strategies in long-term care settings.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3066], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Jungyoon ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jungyoon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Diane Brannon", "Susan Diane Brannon", "Rhonda Belue", "Deirdre Mccaughey", "Timothy Grant Pollock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Diane Brannon, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Diane Brannon, Committee Chair", "Rhonda Belue, Committee Member", "Deirdre Mccaughey, Committee Member", "Timothy Grant Pollock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["contingency theory", "latent class analysis", "long-term care", "organizational structure", "configurational approach"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Real-time Ventricular Fibrillation Detection for Pervasive Health Monitorinng", "id": "21050", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9709", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Real-time ECG monitoring has been an attractive method for early detection of unexpected ventricular fibrillation (VF) disease in pervasive health monitoring. Numerous algorithms and wearable devices have been developed and evaluated to meet this emerging need. Most of them were conducted based-on the ideal environment for verifying their practical usage. However, in order to realize the actual application of VF detection in pervasive health monitoring, the VF detection system is required to not only improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the various factors, but also integrate the hardware and software and energy saving. In this dissertation, we explore a new approach to detect VF attacks using VF algorithms processed on an embedded microcontroller, and analyze various factors affecting the detection effectiveness and efficiency. \nWe first examine research issues of VF detection in pervasive health monitoring. We propose a methodology for performing real-time VF detection using an embedded microcontroller to ensure timeliness and save battery power. We develop an integrated environment as a testbed for explorations of this study. As a benchmark, we adapt five light-weighted algorithms and a filtering process from open literature to test the VF detection capability of these algorithms. Evaluations of this research confirm that with some adaptation the conventional filtering process and detection algorithms can be efficiently deployed in a microcontroller with good performance results while saving battery power.  Among the five algorithms we considered, the time delay (TD) method has the best overall performance, a relatively short calculation time and reasonably low power consumption.\nEarly research has been predominately focused on developing effective algorithms for VF detection and most of the evaluations are conducted offline with pre-filtered data sets. The performance of these algorithms is highly dependent on several factors such as data filtering methods, data scaling, data extraction window size, detection algorithms and system parameters; therefore, understanding their impact on performance in real-time setting is important. We conduct experiments comparing the performance of five detection algorithms using the popular Creighton University (CU) database and measure their performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictivity, accuracy and computational time. We have also examined the performance against an aggregated measure called receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. This study shows that (1) detection algorithm, data filtering and window size all have significant impact on VF detection, (2) it is important to select the proper threshold value that affects the trade-off of the performance metrics, and (3) among the five algorithms that we evaluated, Time Delay (TD) outperformed other algorithms, even with different window sizes and different filtering methods and its performance was not much impacted by these factors.\nThird, we develop an energy consumption model and verify its performance for the integrated VF detection of body area network (BAN). The conventional wireless sensing nodes of the BAN capture the raw electrocardiograph (ECG) signal and transmit the sampled data through wireless communication. This method not only increases wireless data traffic significantly, but also consumes a lot of energy. Since the wireless communication process consumes much more energy than processing in the embedded microcontroller, the processing-based method, which minimizes wireless communication and integrates the light-weight algorithm, is one of the best solutions for the remote VF detection in the BAN. We develop an integrated environment for evaluating the performance of VF detection algorithms and energy consumption simultaneously. As a benchmark, five light-weighted VF detection algorithms and the filtering process are programmed on an embedded microcontroller for the detection of VF abnormality. The total ratio of energy save is 93.68% per 508 seconds data between the real-time full data transmission and the proposed VF detection methodology using time delay (TD) algorithm.\nFourth, we propose a new algorithm, called an extended real-time time-delay (ERTD), for real-time VF detection. We conduct experiments comparing the performance of TD and ERTD using the popular Creighton University (CU) database and measure their performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictivity, accuracy, algorithm complexity and energy consumption. We have also examined the performance against an aggregated measure called receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under curve (AUC). This study shows that (1) ERTD algorithm improves 2.18% of AUC comparing with TD, (2) The energy consumption of ERTD algorithm is improved up 10.56% than using TD in 508 seconds of energy measuring time, and (3) the algorithm complexity of ERTD is much reduced than TD. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9463], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Jungyoon ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jungyoon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Hsien Chu", "Chao Hsien Chu", "Dongwon Lee", "Sencun Zhu", "Kyusun Choi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Hsien Chu, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Hsien Chu, Committee Chair", "Dongwon Lee, Committee Member", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Kyusun Choi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Energy Consumption", "Ventricular Fibrillation", "Real-time Detection", "Wearable Health Monitoring System", "Factor Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Exploring The Leisure Behaviors Of Older Korean Immigrants Associated with Leisure Benefits, Facilitators to Leisure, Leisure Constraints, and Acculturation", "id": "16393", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8074", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study was aimed at exploring the leisure behavior of older Korean immigrants by focusing on leisure patterns, leisure facilitators, and leisure benefits and challenges associated with acculturation and immigration.

Specifically, understanding electron transfer in inorganic systems has become of significant interest since energy and health emerged as the most important focus to humankind in the 21st century. Inorganic materials and complexes function as an essential part in alternative energy conversion systems, molecular electronics, cell bodies, and medicinal treatments, and in many cases they are used as redox centers \u2014 places where electron potential energy can be stored and then extracted. In order to best-control their performance for specific applications, it is crucial to know fundamentals of how to modulate the electronic properties of inorganic materials and further have control over the electron transfer in different conditions. In this dissertation, a ligand-assisted approach is introduced to tune the electronic properties of different inorganic materials, and various types of electron transfer are investigated in such materials spectroscopically and electrochemically.\n     I begin by demonstrating that the electronic properties of a series of ruthenium polypyridyl complexes with a hydroxypyridine ligand can be modulated by change in the electron density of the hydroxypyridine ligand. Protonation/deprotonation and ethylation of this ligand were implemented, and I found that electronic perturbation of the ligand influenced the electronic structure of the metal center as well as the bipyridine ligands via UV-visible spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements. The deprotonation enriched the electron density of the metal center and induced de-shielding of the protons in the bipyridine ligands, and the ethylation only increased the reduction potential for the hydroxypyridine ligand. Furthermore, the intramolecular electron transfer between the bipyridine ligands could be studied with the ethylated complex. There was no absorption band detected for the intramolecular electron transfer, indicating that the complex possesses poor electronic coupling between the ligands through the metal center. This study provided an easy strategy for controlling the electronic properties of a transition metal complex by coordinating a hydroxypyridine ligand and applying a different substituent to the ligand.\n     Following this, I studied examining systems with redox active ligands. Coordination of organic radicals to metal centers and study of a related intermolecular electron transfer were performed by synthesizing a dinuclear zinc complex with tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) radicals, bridged with a TCNQ sigma-dimer. The individual molecules were easily stacked in crystals, forming pi-stacking of the TCNQ ligands. Unlike existing research, incorporation of the TCNQ sigma-dimer introduced a novel stacking pattern with different spacing between the TCNQ ligands. The intermolecular electron transfer was measured via diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and the magnetic coupling between the adjacent TCNQ ligands was studied by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The crystals showed a high-energy intermolecular charge transfer band, resulting in poor electronic conductivity. Also, I found antiferromagnetic coupling through the pi-stacks. Use of the TCNQ sigma-dimer demonstrated an example of how one could differentiate the stacking pattern in such pi-stacked systems and modify a degree of the intermolecular interaction electronically and magnetically.\n     The ligand-assisted approach for modification of the electronic structure could be expanded from the molecular systems to nano-sized inorganic materials. I studied the effect of ligands on the surface electronic structure of semiconductor nanocrystals by using colloidal zinc oxide nanocrystals. In this case, the electronically excited species was the zinc oxide nanocrystal, and two different types of carboxylic acid ligands (aliphatic and aromatic) were adsorbed on the surface of the nanocrystals. Changes to the electronic properties were probed by examining change to the bandgap energy using UV-visible spectroscopy. The absorption spectra showed that the bandgap energy of the nanocrystal with the aromatic ligand became lower than that with the aliphatic ligand. It appears that pi orbitals of the aromatic ligand could have better coupling with the valence band of the nanocrystals, leading to decrease in the bandgap. Further studies such as precise size measurements will follow to confirm this tentative conclusion.\n     Continuing the theme of using the effect of ligands to control electrons, ligand effect to the electronic properties of a solvatochromic molecule was demonstrated by investigating confined environment in which coumarin 153 was encapsulated in a metal-organic framework. Different solvent molecules were intercalated into the pore with coumarin 153, and the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra were acquired. After confined in the pore, coumarin 153 lost the original solvent-dependent photophysical properties in the absorption and emission process. However, the Stokes shift of coumarin 153 was observed to be solvent-dependent and increased in energy upon confinement in the pore. Based on these divergent results, I hypothesize that the framework dominantly affected the energetics of coumarin 153. Specifically, lattice flexibility of the framework, mainly from ligand rotation, might dissipate the excited state energy of the molecule. This confined system with a solvatochromic molecule can be a good platform to understand complex molecular interactions in restricted space and how to perturb the electronic properties of confined molecules through indirect contact.\n     These studies suggest that the electronic properties of inorganic materials can be controlled by modifying the electronic structure of coordinated ligands and inducing electronic interactions between the inorganic substrate and the ligand. I believe that the ligand-assisted approach is useful for tuning the electronic properties of inorganic materials in that ligands can be easily combined with inorganic materials in the solution phase and simultaneously influence the energetics to a large degree. In addition, the fact that there are a large number of ligands to be explored provides a potential toolbox for adjusting the properties of inorganic materials.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11082], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Juyeong ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Juyeong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin James Lear", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin James Lear, Dissertation Advisor", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ruthenium complex", "hydroxypyridine", "TCNQ", "pi-stacking", "zinc oxide", "coumarin 153", "metal-organic framework", "electronic property"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The effectiveness of school type on students' academic achievement: Focusing on private high school of South Korea", "id": "16210", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8133", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     This study estimates the private school effect on academic achievement in the Korean high school system.

Different from the rectangular support of functional linear models, the triangular support of the historical functional linear models and the point-wise support of varying coefficient models, the current model has a sliding window support into the past. This idea leads to models that bridge the gap between the varying coefficient models and the functional linear (historic) models for densely measured functional data and longitudinal data. By utilizing one dimensional basis expansions and one dimensional smoothing procedures, the proposed estimation algorithm is shown to have better performance and to be faster than the estimation procedures proposed for historical functional linear models.\nWe also consider the recent history functional linear models, relating a longitudinal response to a longitudinal predictor. We propose an estimation procedure for recent history functional linear models that is geared towards sparse longitudinal data, where the observation times across subjects are irregular and total number of measurements per subject is small. The proposed estimation procedure builds upon recent developments in literature for estimation of functional linear models with sparse data and utilizes connections between the recent history functional linear models and the varying coefficient models. We establish uniform consistency of the proposed estimators, propose prediction of the response trajectories and derive their asymptotic distribution leading to asymptotic point-wise confidence bands.

Second, I develop theoretical arguments and present empirical results that a firm\u2019s strategic alliance with a competitor\u2019s alliance partner is more favorably accepted by investors than the firm\u2019s alliance which does not involve a competitor.

Under some environments, simulation results\nshow an interesting outcome, landlords give rental discount to tenants who had late\nrent payments.

These results are predicted by the\nsimulations of the theoretical model.\nChapter 2: The Value of name in the housing market: Evidence from a South\nKorea address change policy\nThis paper delves into the existence of the name premium in the housing market. In\nSouth Korea, the method of address designation has been changed from area-based\nto street-based as of January 1st, 2014. Before the change, people recognized the\nname of the administrative region and apartment name in the address, but afterward\nthese pieces of information have been less clear and not identified as part of\nthe mailing address. This provides a good opportunity for a natural experiment to explore the importance of name for property values. Using a difference-in-difference\nmodel, I explore the effect of name premium on apartment prices in Gangnam\narea, South Korea. This region has both very prestigious and less prestigious\nneighborhoods, but the prestige becomes less apparent when this addressing policy\nchange occurred. I test the hypothesis that the marginal willingness to pay for\nprestigious locations declines once the prestige is not signaled through the postal\naddress. This would be evidence of conspicuous consumption, since the physical\nstructure of the property has not changed.\nChapter 3: Analysis of the Effect of Land Value Taxation on Land Value\nDiscovering the economic effect of land value taxation is the crucial evidence\nneeded to support or oppose land value taxation. So far, analyses of land value\ntaxation have been based on indirect measures (value of building, construction\nactivities) of these impacts. Contrary to previous papers, I employ the direct\nvalue of the land - land sales transaction data - in order to investigate the relationship\nbetween land value and its taxation.

This study investigated the effect of incorporating active learning strategies such as small-group learning with authentic tasks, scaffolding, and individual reports, which were employed to enhance students\u2019 learning and critical thinking in a large undergraduate, general science education class. \n   Two active learning modules on natural disaster content were implemented over the semester. Pre and post-tests were developed and implemented to examine effects of active learning on student learning of geoscience concepts and reasoning skills, and two sets of individual reports were analyzed to investigate levels of critical thinking exhibited in student reports over the semester. Data were collected from 155 students enrolled in the class. \n   Results indicate that the active learning strategies had a positive significant effect on undergraduate students\u2019 learning of geoscience concepts, from pretest to posttest, as well as students\u2019 critical thinking displayed in written reports, which suggests that the use of active learning strategies in a large class were useful to enhance student learning.\n   With regards to students\u2019 critical thinking, the findings of this study revealed students\u2019 average critical thinking levels fell in the category of \u201cdeveloping\u201d for all subcategories (e.g., identifying problems while considering social context, developing a perspective, justifying own decisions, presenting evidence/data, and integrating issues, etc.).

Thus, the finding of this study from the quantitative and qualitative analysis confirmed that the active learning strategies were useful in enhancing students\u2019 critical thinking as well as engaging their critical thinking process: (i) The result from students\u2019 scores on Individual reports revealed a statistically significant increase, and (ii) the results from students\u2019 perception survey and interview identified specific areas of the critical thinking process students perceived as being supportive (e.g., approaching the problem from various perspectives, applying scientific concepts/ ideas to real-world problems, and so on.).  \n   From the qualitative results regarding students\u2019 perception, in general, the use of active learning strategies reportedly had a positive effect on students\u2019 engagement in the learning experience.

This investigation applies KS analysis methods to describe the influence of narrative and expository lesson texts on bilingual readers\u2019 KS. Monolingual native language (L1) reading studies have established that text type, or genre, strongly influences reading comprehension, and narrative texts are easier to recall and understand than expository texts, indicating that the comprehensibility of the content may differ depending on the genre in which it is presented. Thus, it is important to understand reading comprehension differences that are triggered by different text genres. However, the effects of text genres on reading comprehension have rarely been the focus of target language (L2) reading research, where the few L2 studies have reached different conclusions about their relative difficulty. In addition, I consider the interaction of prior knowledge and text genres in L2 reading contexts. The inconclusive and few reported findings in an L2 reading context may largely be due to methodological difficulty because L2 reading is an extraordinarily complex process dependent upon reader-related and text-related factors that are far more varied than those implicated in L1 reading. \n\tFor this methodological problem, this investigation proposes a \u201cKS analysis model\u201d to better understand the interactions between pre-reading KS and text genre and between text genre and post-reading KS. An additional aim of this study is to assess how language proficiency modulates the interactions. For that, university mixed proficiency Korean English language learners (n = 616) were randomly assigned to one of 8 conditions that all involved a pre-reading task in L1 or L2 (as a sorting task), reading a text, then from memory a post-reading task in L1 or L2 (as a summary writing), and finally a comprehension posttest (e.g., sort Korean or English, read English expository or narrative text, write Korean or English, posttest). \nAll of the participants\u2019 sorting and essay artifacts were converted into Pathfinder Networks (PFnets) that were visually and statistically compared with each lesson text\u2019s PFnet they read. For the PFnet analysis, this investigation employed two distinctly different \u2018graph theoretic\u2019 metrics, \u201cSimilarity of PFnet\u201d and \u201cCentrality of PFnet\u201d, in order to analyze the PFnets statistically and to visually describe the interactions between text genre and pre- and post-reading KS by proficiency level. The results from the similarity and centrality of PFnets showed that the low proficiency participants\u2019 comprehension of the same text content was greater in the L1 task language and in the narrative text, while the high proficiency participants\u2019 comprehension did not differ as functions of task language and text genre. With respect to prior knowledge interaction, both low and high proficiency participants maintained their pre-reading KS more for the expository text than the narrative text. These findings from the current study can have practical implications for their L2 reading instruction. Narrative texts would be more beneficial to L2 readers who do have lower L2 proficiency because of its superior comprehensibility, while expository texts would be more beneficial to L2 readers who have enough prior knowledge of to-be-learned content because of its tendency to integrate content with prior knowledge. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14876], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Kyung ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "first_name_ssi": "Kyung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Learning, Design, and Technology ", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roy B.

One of important domains that characterize the parent-adult offspring relationships is the support and assistance that is exchanged between them.  This dissertation comprises three studies that provide complementary perspectives on intergenerational support exchanges within a family system.  The first two studies examine the role of discrepancies of perspective on exchanges among family members, using data from The Family Exchanges Study.  The third study explores patterns of intergenerational support that married adults exchange with parents and parents-in-law in a Korean sample, adding a cultural perspective.  \n\nUsing 929 parent-adult child dyads from three-generation families, Study 1 examined how discrepancies in reports of support exchanged within dyads of parents and offspring vary both within and between families, and what characteristics explain within- and between-family differences in dyadic discrepancies.  The results showed substantial between-family differences as well as within-family differences in dyadic discrepancies.  Although discrepancies in support exchanges were mainly associated with dyad-specific characteristics within families, they also appear to be influenced by the family\u2019s overall emotional environment.  Families with better relationships among family members tended to be more congruent in their perspectives about support given to offspring.\n\nStudy 2 extends the investigation of discrepancies by including an important but overlooked issue - inheritance.  Utilizing data from 327 aging parents and their middle-aged children, this study examined factors associated with expectations of inheritance and correspondence in expectations over inheritance within dyads.  The findings showed that children were less likely to expect inheritances than parents expected to give.  Although bequest decisions are circumscribed by parent\u2019s financial resources, they appear to be a continuation of established patterns of exchanges.  This study also found that parents and children form their intention or expectation about inheritance based on different factors (e.g., child\u2019s income, support given to parent, and parent\u2019s gender), leaving open the possibility of misunderstandings between the generations.  \n\nStudy 3 investigated patterns of support exchanges between Korean adult children (N = 937) and their parents and parents-in-law, gender differences in these patterns, and implications of exchange patterns for children\u2019s marital quality.  Most studies of intergenerational exchanges have focused only on parents, but little attention has been given to help that may be directed toward in-laws.  Korea is an interesting setting for examining support to both sets of parents because while it has traditionally been a patrilineal culture, rapid social changes have affected family norms and structure.  Using latent class analysis, this study identified three balanced patterns and two imbalanced patterns of exchanges between parents and parents-in-law.  These patterns reflected both the patrilineal tradition and contemporary balanced patterns.  Significant associations of exchange patterns with adult children\u2019s marital quality indicate the importance for couples of balanced exchanges with parents that are not driven by obligatory norms.\n\nIn sum, this research extends our knowledge of how intergenerational exchanges occur in various family contexts.  Together, these studies demonstrated the importance of considering family perspectives to understand the process of intergenerational exchanges and the implication for individual and family well-being.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7464], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Kyungmin ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kyungmin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit", "Steven Howard Zarit", "Michael J Rovine", "David Eggebeen", "Valarie Elizabeth King", "J Douglas Coatsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit, Dissertation Advisor", "Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Chair", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member", "David Eggebeen, Committee Member", "Valarie Elizabeth King, Committee Member", "J Douglas Coatsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["intergenerational relationships", "support exchanges", "family contexts", "discrepancy"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF SURFACE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS ON CARBON MATERIALS WITH X-RAY ABSORPTION NEAR EDGE STRUCTURE (XANES) SPECTROSCOPY\n", "id": "11240", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3594", "abstract_tesi": "Carbon materials have many applications due to their bulk or surface properties, and for the latter, surface functional groups play a decisive role. Many characterization techniques have been used to identify and quantify surface functional groups, but none is completely satisfactory so far especially when it comes to quantification. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy has several advantages over the commonly used techniques, e.g., element specific, high sensitivity, characteristic spectra for different functional groups, and straightforward quantitative analysis. For oxygen functional groups on carbon materials, oxygen K-edge (543.1 eV) XANES is preferred over carbon K-edge (284.2 eV) since it minimizes the strong interference from the carbon substrate. Oxygen K-edge XANES was attempted over 13 years ago, but it was only partially successful with qualitative analysis due to spectrum distortion from charging effect because of poor sample conductivity. In this work, we collect oxygen K-edge spectra in both fluorescence yield (FY) and total electron yield (TEY) modes. Although relatively noisier, spectra collected in FY mode do not suffer from charging effect, which is very important for quantitative analysis by linear combination fitting. It is shown that an oxygen K-edge spectrum of oxygen containing functional group mainly consists of a pre-edge peak and a whiteline (the first intense post-edge peak). The XANES spectra are unique in the position and/or the intensity of the pre-edge peak and the whiteline. Thus, identification of different functional groups is possible by fingerprinting. By measuring known functional groups in reference compounds, it is determined that oxygen functional groups on carbon materials can be grouped into three categories. Each category consists of a few functional groups, which have very similar XANES spectra, while significant difference exists between categories. Carboxyl-type groups include carboxyl, ester, and anhydride groups, and the features are a strong pre-edge peak at about 531 eV and a broad whiteline at 539 eV. Carbonyl-type groups include carbonyl and aldehyde groups, and the features are a strong pre-edge peak at below 530 eV and a broad whiteline at 539 eV. Hydroxyl-type groups include hydroxyl, phenol, and ether groups, and the features are no or very weak pre-edge peak at about 531 eV and a broad whiteline at 536-538 eV. Four activated carbons that underwent different treatments are analyzed by XANES.

Three catalysts were synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation method: 2% and 10%Ni catalysts supported on 20%CeO2-modified Al2O3 (denoted as \u201c2Ni/CeAl\u201d and \u201c10Ni/CeAl\u201d, respectively), and 2%Rh catalyst supported on the same support (denoted as \u201c2Rh/CeAl\u201d). The 10Ni/CeAl catalyst is the focus of the study, and the 2Ni/CeAl and 2Rh/CeAl catalysts were used as control samples. It is found that catalyst deactivates much faster in hexane reforming than in benzene reforming on 10Ni/CeAl with the presence of sulfur poison. Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are used together to understand the catalyst deactivation mechanisms and the effects of hydrocarbon structure on catalyst deactivation. \nSulfur K-edge XANES measured and estimated the sulfur species formed on the catalyst after steam reforming reaction. The sulfur species formed on the catalyst are the same for benzene and hexane reforming, i.e., Ni sulfide and sulfate, which do not correlate with catalyst deactivation once carbon starts to deposit on the catalyst. Formation of metal sulfide is faster in hexane reforming than in benzene reforming. It is likely that that benzene has higher reactivity with Ni, which leads to delayed sulfur poisoning in benzene reforming.\nTPO measured the amounts of carbon deposits on metal and support due to their different reactivity toward oxidation. Carbon deposition on the catalyst increases with time in both benzene and hexane reforming. More carbon is formed in hexane reforming than in benzene reforming. Carbon deposition locations are quite different as well. In benzene reforming, more carbon is deposited on the metal while in hexane reforming it is on the contrary. Carbon K-edge XANES measured the structure of carbon deposits on the used catalysts and it is found that the carbon deposits have no significant structural difference in benzene and hexane reforming. However, TEM analysis combined with EDX elemental mapping revealed that there is significant structural difference between carbon formed on the Ni and carbon on the support. Results from both reactions support a carbon deposition mechanism, i.e., carbon is formed on the metal first, and then partially dehydrogenated hydrocarbons formed on metal migrate over to the support to form coke on the support.\nIn summary, the difference in catalyst deactivation of steam reforming over Ni catalyst with the presence of sulfur poison for benzene and hexane reforming is well explained by the metal reactivity with different structured hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons with higher reactivity (such as benzene) protects the catalyst by delaying the formation of Ni sulfide through more competitive absorption on metal, leading to more available Ni sites for steam reforming and gasification. Higher gasification activity allows less carbon deposits on the metal and also less migration of partially dehydrogenated hydrocarbons to the support, which helps maintain steam activation on the support and stable catalyst activity for steam reforming reaction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8224], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Kyungsoo ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kyungsoo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yongsheng Chen", "Yongsheng Chen", "Caroline Elaine Clifford", "Semih Eser", "Chunshan Song", "Turgay Ertekin", "Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yongsheng Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Yongsheng Chen, Committee Chair", "Caroline Elaine Clifford, Committee Member", "Semih Eser, Committee Member", "Chunshan Song, Committee Member", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["steam reforming", "catalyst", "deactivation", "hydrocarbon", "hexane", "benzene", "nickel", "XANES"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THE IMPACT OF CONFRONTING ONLINE SEXISM ON THIRD-PARTY BELIEFS AND BEHAVIOR", "id": "13849lqk5191", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13849", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The internet is rife with harassing language, where women are targeted with severe forms of misogyny and sexism.

This dissertation focuses on determining whether heightened expectations following a surprise-delight event decrease the effectiveness of surprise strategies in ensuring customer loyalty in the long term and on exploring whether this possible negative effect, can be mitigated by using explanations as part of a surprise-strategy design. It was expected that the presence of explanations would help maintain realistic expectations and prevent customers from considering surprises as a normal part of the service process. \nThe empirical investigation of the hypotheses was conducted in two different service contexts: utilitarian and hedonic. Overall, the results support both the role of surprise in enhancing customer delight and the role of explanations in preventing an escalation of expectations in regard to future service. Therefore, this study can be used to help service firms effectively delight their customers over the long term without becoming engaged in a process whereby every shopping experience must include some kind of surprise experience.

As experienced in the H5N1 avian influenza epidemic in 2007 and the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, infectious diseases have emerged as a significant threat to global health. Furthermore, the rise in the prevalence of chronic conditions across all socioeconomic classes has made these conditions the leading causes of death and disability. These and other similar challenges have led to a growing interest in leveraging healthcare data better to facilitate disease prevention and control and better health care. In this dissertation, three statistical quality control (SQC) based methods are proposed to deal with some of the distinguishing characteristics in healthcare data.\n\tThe first method integrates SQC with forecasting methods to support syndromic surveillance in health monitoring. Health data are likely to be non-stationary, non-normal, or autocorrelated, which calls for caution in the application of traditional SQC approaches. Furthermore, in order to address the need to track movements of the disease progression/dispersion as well as obtain a timely and sensitive signal for disease change, the method proposes pretreatment steps using forecasting based methodologies (regression and time-series models) that strengthen in modeling baseline patterns of disease. The pretreatment steps are applied to health data in such a way that results in independently and normally distributed observations so that SQC procedures can be appropriately applied. The proposed health monitoring framework provides a customized procedure for dealing with various statistical characteristics of health data which lead to use satisfy general assumptions of SQC. As an example of influenza syndromic surveillance, we monitor the weekly influenza-like-illness (ILI) incidence data and weekly over-the-counter and prescribed medication sales related to the ILI symptoms. Statistical analysis of two sources of data shows that they are non-stationary processes with a high level of autocorrelation which is a barrier to the direct use of traditional SQC. The application of our monitoring framework to the multiple streams of ILI and drug sales results in earlier warning than the official announcement of outbreak.\n\tThe second method combines two multivariate SQC approaches \u2013 the multivariate self-starting exponentially weighted likelihood ratio (MSS-EWLR) chart and the multivariate change-point (MCP) chart \u2013 for the complexity found in health monitoring applications where there is interest in two or more quality characteristics that may be correlated and where in-control process data is limited. As an example of its application in monitoring chronic disease, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure are monitored for assessing hypertension and its related complications. Our approach allows the monitoring of both mean and variability of healthcare data in a single chart. The combination of the two SQC approaches provides better performance enabling the detection of subtle changes that can be masked by unsuspected change in the correlation among quality characteristics by monitoring both mean and variability. Also, the combined approach has the added benefit of working without a priori parameter information of a baseline.\n\tThe third method combines time-series analysis and regression to transform cross-sectional data into repeated measurement data describing individual patient profiles that can be monitored with SQC tools. The majority of accessible national surveys are based on cross-sectional data that depict a snapshot of health conditions in the population. Although national surveys are performed periodically with same individuals, identifiers are not provided to protect participant privacy and confidentiality. This profile data estimation (PDE) method will allow the performance of proposed health monitoring methods to be demonstrated with real clinical data that is publicly available. This may ease the burden of validating new methodologies. Moreover, it may result in a better, more rapid understanding of the relationship among multiple data characteristics that explain disease progression and dispersion over a complex disease process within and between patients. \n\tThe methods developed here link quality engineering research in the field of industrial engineering with health monitoring systems research in the field of healthcare. Enhanced healthcare data monitoring will contribute to the goal of ensuring that care teams and relevant organizations receive accurate, timely, and up-to-date information about given health situations so that they can determine the appropriate intervention to undertake. In this sense, the work is a part of the broader partnership between healthcare and its associated clinical discoveries, and the engineering systems that help translate the discoveries into action.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7721], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Min-Jung ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min-Jung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard", "Harriet Black Nembhard", "Dr Paul Griffin", "Ling Rothrock", "Rhonda Belue", "Li Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard, Dissertation Advisor", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Committee Chair", "Dr Paul Griffin, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Rhonda Belue, Committee Member", "Li Wang, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heatlh Monitoring", "Statistical Quality Methods"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "ROLE OF HEMODYNAMIC FORCES IN SMOOTH MUSCLE CELL CONTRACTION AND TRANSVASCULAR FILTRATION IN VIVO", "id": "6446", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4565", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The vascular wall is continuously exposed to two hemodynamic forces imparted by blood flow: pressure and shear stress. Significant changes in hemodynamic forces can occur in many physiological and pathophysiological circumstances. Changes in vascular pressure and blood flow-induced shear stress can affect vascular endothelium and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) mechanically. When vascular pressure is increased, an increase in transvascular filtration is driven by a classical Starling mechanism. This increased transvascular filtration is expected to induce increases in shear stresses through the inter-endothelial cleft surfaces and SMCs.\n         A main hypothesis of the current study is that transvascular filtration-induced shear stress might play important roles in endothelial barrier function and SMC contractions. To address this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of pressure-induced transvascular fluid flux on SMC contraction in vivo. We also investigated the effects of pressure and shear on endothelial barrier functions for water transport.  \n         In the current study performed in vivo and in excised arterioles, interstitial flow-induced shear stress through the vascular wall driven by transvascular filtration was hypothesized to be a mechanical factor that can play a role in the myogenic response in addition to the role of vascular stretch and wall tension. To address this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between filtration rate (Jv) and the myogenic response by modifying plasma osmotic pressure to attenuate Jv during a step increase in hydrostatic pressure. The myogenic response was attenuated significantly when an osmotic solution of albumin, or albumin plus Ficoll, was infused into the bloodstream to decrease fluid filtration.  Moreover, the same inhibition of myogenic tone was found in isolated, cannulated rat soleus muscle arterioles when filtration was osmotically attenuated by intravascular dextran.  Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that shear stress on arteriolar smooth muscle, induced by transvascular fluid filtration, is a contributing factor that helps control myogenic tone.\n         To understand the role of hemodynamic forces in regulating microvascular permeability, we have investigated effects of acute changes in shear and pressure on endothelial barrier function for water transport. In the study performed in the microvessels of the mesentery, we have obtained evidence that hydraulic conductivity might be regulated via a NO-dependent mechanism in response to acute change in shear rate. Additionally, the effect of sustained changes in pressure on hydraulic conductivity was also investigated using micro-perfusion technique. The substantial increase in hydraulic conductivity was observed following a pressure increase in both small arterioles and venules. It is likely that pressure-induced mechanical stimulus activates a biochemical response that can lead to increase in hydraulic conductivity in response to pressure change. Furthermore, our results suggested that an adaptive sealing effect induced by a step change in pressure also partially contributes to regulate endothelial barrier function.  These findings support the idea that endothelial transport barrier responds actively to changes in hemodynamic forces in the microcirculation and regulate transport pathways for water through biological as well as mechanical mechanisms. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4532], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Min-ho ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min-ho", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Norman R Harris", "Herbert Herling Lipowsky", "Peter J Butler", "Donna Hope Korzick", "John Michael Tarbell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Norman R Harris, Committee Chair", "Herbert Herling Lipowsky, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Donna Hope Korzick, Committee Member", "John Michael Tarbell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["shear stress", "microvascular pressure", "myogenic response", "transvascular filtration", "hydraulic conductivity", "vascular smooth muscle cell", "endothelial cell"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Socialization of children\u2019s visual expressions: The socio-cultural meaning and function of Korean child\u2019s depiction of negative emotions in drawings\n", "id": "9996", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4498", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Art is an effective tool for children to express their inner mind. However, little reliable research exists as to whether children really can express their actual emotions effectively and whether the emotions included in their drawings are the very emotions they wish to describe.

This limited depiction of emotional states in school art is entirely different from what is observed in Korean children\u2019s depiction of diverse emotional states in their manhwa. It is this phenomenon that more diverse emotional themes and expressions, both positive and negative, are daringly depicted in Korean children\u2019s self-initiated drawings called manhwa (comics) that initiated the current study. To explore the essential nature of the social and cultural influence on one child\u2019s drawings about a negative emotional theme, this study investigated (1) the emotional and drawing experiences of one Korean girl, (2) her socio-cultural values and expectations about negative emotional expressions and drawings she learned through her experience; and (3) how this socio-cultural learning affected her depiction of an angry emotional experience in two types of drawings (school-type drawing and manwha-type drawing done in school). \nThis qualitative case study was conducted through classroom observations and interviews with the case participant Suji, her friends, teachers, and parents over a three-month period. In addition, I collected Suji\u2019s self-initiated manwha, her artwork made in school, drawings about her angry emotional experience in school, and other artifacts and written materials.\nThe data were analyzed in three stages. Analysis was first performed on differences in the portrayal of the same assigned theme between Suji\u2019s school-type drawing and her manwha-style drawing without the use of any contextual information, such as information about her personal life or her previous experiences in visual expressions of anger (Chapter 4). Next, I re-examined the differences in her two drawings using contextual information about Suji\u2019s process of socialization of emotional expression (Chapter 5). Lastly, I attempted to understand Suji\u2019s drawings about a negative emotional theme with information about her drawing experiences in and out of school (Chapter 6).\nThis study revealed that Suji used expressive strategies to depict her angry emotional experience in school in both types of drawings. Furthermore, Suji carefully selected each expressive strategy by considering its socio-cultural meaning and function. Her previous emotional and drawing experiences closely related to her decisions of what expressive strategies she employed. Implications of this study will assist art educators in understanding cultural influence on and the complex mechanism of children\u2019s drawings.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4468], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Minam ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Minam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine M Thompson", "Christine M Thompson", "Brent Guy Wilson", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius", "James Ewald Johnson", "Cynthia Stifter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christine M Thompson, Dissertation Advisor", "Christine M Thompson, Committee Chair", "Brent Guy Wilson, Committee Member", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius, Committee Member", "James Ewald Johnson, Committee Member", "Cynthia Stifter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["socialization of emotional expression", "socio-cultural perspective", "socio-cultural meaning and function of expressive", "socialilzation of visual expression", "child art", "analysis of visual data", "ethnography"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Financial Aid for Scientists and Engineers", "id": "6395w7085", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12856", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the United States, more than 4 billion dollars of grant-based financial aid (GFA) is provided annually in the form of assistantships, fellowships, or tuition waivers to students enrolled in sciences and engineering (S&E) doctoral programs.

I ask whether it is possible to spend less money while awarding the same number of S&E doctorates. To this end, I construct a dynamic discrete choice model of S&E baccalaureates in which the baccalaureates decide whether to work and/or whether to attain graduate education each year after college graduation. My estimation is based on Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study for the years 1993-2003. I find that those who are likely to complete S&E doctoral programs under the current GFA policy are less responsive to policy changes compared to those who are likely to drop out of the programs. By exploiting the differential responsiveness of individuals I am able to come up with an alternative GFA policy that costs 25 percent less yet produces the same number of S&E doctorates. The second question I ask is how a policy that relaxes individual-side credit-constraints influences the composition of firms and individuals engaging in research and development (R&D). To this end, I construct a static general equilibrium model in which individuals of different endowment levels make decisions regarding education while facing credit-constraints, while firms of heterogeneous productivity decide over production and R&D investment. I show that tuition subsidies increase the relative supply of research services compared to production services, while lowering the cost of R&D activity and increasing the cost of production. As a result, the less-productive firms engage in R&D, and the least productive firms exit the market. On the individual side, depending on the initial conditions of the economy, the subsidies may ultimately attract only the most talented individuals, without encouraging rich and less-talented individuals to enroll in programs. Chapter 1 offers an introduction to the study, Chapters 2 and 3 are devoted to the first question, and Chapter 4 addresses the second question.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12747], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Moon Jung ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Moon Jung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Tybout ", "James R.

Natural ventilation systems can utilize outdoor air in order to improve the quality of the indoor environment as well as to reduce energy consumption. However, natural ventilation systems create acoustic problems if a building is in an urban area. For instance, if windows are opened for natural ventilation high levels of traffic noise or high wind driven air pressure through windows can interrupt people working in the building. Much research has been done to study traffic noise prediction methods in calculating the sound attenuation during propagation outdoors based on ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 9613; however, this research introduces a method combining outdoor sound propagation with indoor sound transmission based on ISO Acoustic Standards. This study to predict background noise level in a building for natural ventilation can be categorized into two specific areas: (1) traffic noise and (2) air flow noise. Traffic noise is designed by CoRTN (Calculation of Road Traffic Noise, U.K) algorithm and FHWA TNM (Federal Highway Administration Traffic Noise Model, 2007) models. The project will use numerical calculations to determine traffic noise values including the effects of sound attenuation, transmission and building fa\u00e7ade. After controlling building fa\u00e7ade design, targets of ventilation, outdoor weather conditions and traffic noise attenuation are specified for these design solutions. The air flow noise is generated by an opening in naturally ventilated building. The pressure difference by wind driven and stack effects of an opening determine air flow rate. Therefore, this research identifies airflow noise related by the pressure difference and air flow rate. The results of these simulations indicated that natural ventilation systems succeeded not only in predicting environmental traffic noise, but also in providing optimum wind driven air pressure. Finally, the results should compare numerical simulations and real measurements with natural ventilation while providing acoustic comfort for building occupants in urban areas.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4476], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Moon Keun ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Moon Keun", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jelena Srebric", "Jelena Srebric"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jelena Srebric, Thesis Advisor", "Jelena Srebric, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["urban area", "air flow noise", "traffic noise", "natural ventilation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "DIGITAL/MIXED-SIGNAL CIRCUIT DESIGNS WITH STEEP SLOPE III-V TUNNEL TRANSISTORS", "id": "13048mqk5211", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13048", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The scaling of silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) has long been the driving force in the improvement of device performance, increase of transistor density, and circuit-energy reduction per operation in modern computing systems. However, the total power consumption has also kept increasing in a scant few nanometer regimes as a number of transistors has increased in modern chips. In order to preserve the same or to even reduce power consumption, a supply voltage (VDD) reduction is essentially desired. However, a VDD scaling has been a challenge due to tradeo\ufb00s in improving the device performance and lowering the static o\ufb00-state (leakage) power dissipation in Si CMOS. In order to further enable a VDD scaling while retaining the same on-state performance at a scaled VDD , the threshold voltage (VTH) has to be reduced proportionally but this VTH scaling leads to severe increase in standby power dissipation because of the fundamental 60mV/decade subthreshold swing (SS) limitation. Hence, this limitation on a VDD scaling impedes the realization of low power and high performance computing systems. In order to mitigate the challenges in a VDD scaling while maintaining low leakage power dissipation, the heterojunction tunnel \ufb01eld-e\ufb00ect transistor (HTFET) has been emerged as a promising transistor candidate for post-CMOS because of its steep SS (i.e., sub-60mV/decade) without compromising on-current. To explore bene\ufb01ts and tradeo\ufb00s of HTFETs across a range of circuits, thereby, this dissertation has primarily focused on the co-design framework from the device to circuits in digital/mixed-signal circuit designs. A device-circuit modeling framework is critical to understand the applicability of TFETs across broad application spaces. There is substantial ongoing progress in TFET device development, so such a framework must bridge the di\ufb00erent design layers such as device SPICE modeling, circuit implementations, cell library characterization, and architecture benchmarking. In addition, building device-circuit modeling frameworks enables early capture of design insights across a far broader range of applications than an examination at any one of the layers in isolation. In this dissertation, the device-circuit interactions cover the impacts of III-V HTFETs in digital/mixed circuits, stemming from unique device electrical characteristics: a) the steep on-o\ufb00 switching behavior; b) unidirectional conduction; c) asymmetrical source/drain; and d) vertical device structure in a broad range of digital/mixed-signal applications.

We apply these molecular assemblies to create new interfaces and to exert control over single molecules. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to characterize the molecular orientations, structures, phases, and intermolecular interactions within molecular assemblies, in real space, at the sub-nanometer scale. We take advantage of the high spatial resolution of STM to obtain fundamental insight into molecular phenomena. Other surface characterization techniques, including infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry complement and support our STM measurements. \nPhoton STM is used to investigate optical phenomena of single organic molecules with \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m-scale precision. Evanescent wave coupling by total internal reflection adds chemical specificity to STM function. High quality, thin Au{111} films deposited on c-cut sapphire prisms efficiently couple light to the tunneling junction. Annealing significantly improves substrate quality of both the sapphire and Au{111} surfaces, providing more stable tunneling junctions. Lock-in detection with light modulation improves the photoresponse registry in the photon STM. One promising candidate for efficient organic solar cells, C60-tethered 2,5-dithienylpyrrole triads, was isolated within a well-ordered n dodecanethiolate monolayer to measure the photocurrent on single triad molecules, which will determine the intrinsic photovoltaic efficiency at the molecular level. Increased photoconductivity of isolated photovoltaic or photoconductive molecules demonstrates the function and potential of photon STM.     \nPhotoreactions of conjugated organic molecules may be allowed by selection rules but not observed in solution reactions because of unfavorable reaction geometries. We have used defect sites in self-assembled alkanethiolate monolayers on gold surfaces to direct geometrically unfavorable photochemical reactions between individual organic molecules. High conductivity and stochastic switching of anthracene terminated phenylethynylthiolates within alkanethiolate monolayers, as well as in-situ photochemical transformations, have been observed and distinguished with the STM.  Ultraviolet light absorbed during imaging increases the apparent heights of excited molecules in STM images, evidence that we are probing electronically excited states.  \nThe formation of 2-adamantanethiolate SAMs on Au{111} and their displacement by n dodecanethiol are investigated using STM, X ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy. Well-ordered 2 adamantanethiolate monolayers undergo rapid and significant molecular exchange upon exposure to n dodecanethiol solutions, but their structures and intermolecular interactions template the growth of n dodecanethiolate domains. Annealing 2 adamantanethiolate monolayers at 78 \u00baC decreases the density of vacancy islands, while increasing the overall order and the average domain sizes in the films. This results in slower displacement by n dodecanethiol molecules, as compared to unannealed monolayers. The secondary sulfur position on the adamantyl cage alters the lattice structure and the exchange of 2 adamantanethiolate monolayers by alkanethiols relative to 1 adamantanethiol monolayers.\nWe report the electrochemically driven phase transformation of a linear nanostructure in amide-containing alkanethiol, 3 mercapto N nonylpropionamide (1ATC9) SAMs. Hydrogen-bonding interactions between buried amide groups cause a multi-step electrochemical desorption, which involves an unusual phase change. This reaction can be exploited to produce a less dense, textured structure. Single-component 1ATC9 SAMs prepared in solution at room temperature for 24 hours consist of two phases with different apparent heights in STM images; these phases are readily manipulated by controlling solution temperature and deposition time. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions produce films with high thermal stability. The presence of two independent cathodic peaks in 1ATC9 monolayer voltammograms indicates two-step reductive desorption. A monolayer phase transition occurs after the first cathodic peak, transforming a close-packed monolayer into a striped phase that is energetically favored at low surface-thiolate density. Scanning tunneling microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal electrochemical nanostructuring, driven by partial reductive desorption and strong interchain hydrogen bonding. The resultant striped, low-coverage phase is inaccessible by other synthetic preparations, except by controlled dosing in ultrahigh vacuum. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4470], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Moonhee ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Moonhee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss", "Scott T Phillips", "Paul S Weiss", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Anne M Andrews"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott T Phillips, Committee Chair", "Paul S Weiss, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Anne M Andrews, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["scanning tunneling microscopy", "self-assembled monolayers", "SAMs", "photon scanning tunneling microscopy", "evanescent wave coupling", "anthracene", "photodimerization", "regioselective photoreaction", "adamantanethiol", "2-adamantanethiol", "2AD", "displacement", "Hydrogen bonding interaction", "amide containing alkanethiol", "3-mercapto-N-nonylpropionamide", "1ATC9"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DESIGN OF COMMUNICATION NETWORK ARCHITECTURE FOR THE SMART GRID\n", "id": "12204", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4589", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Power systems have been dramatically changing with cutting edge information technologies.  The new power system infrastructure called Smart Grid has evolved and has been studied by many institutes and companies. The Smart Grid is bound up with customer side activities such as Distributed Generators (DGs).  Changes in the power system structure, changes in requirements and the necessity to have easy access to accurate data have led to the need for communication systems. Due to these changes, communication systems with Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) in power companies expose the safety-critical power companies\u2019 network to the multitude of security problems in communication networks.  Moreover, obsolescent control systems for power systems are evolving into intelligent systems and connecting with smart devices to give intelligence to the power systems. As networks of the control system are growing, vulnerability is also increasing. The communication network of distribution areas in the power system connects closely to vulnerable environments. Many cyber attacks have been founded in the power system, and they could be more critical as the power system becomes more intelligent. \nIn this dissertation, an independent and hierarchical communication network architecture for Smart Grid is designed by information hiding and suppressing data exchange. The function of self-healing and resist attack will be easily implemented by this proposed network. First of all, communication bandwidth and topology is considered corresponding to the advent of DGs. Availability is also considered when it comes to design a communication network for power systems because power systems should provide seamless service. New network architecture of optical network using one core is also proposed for the distribution area in power systems to increase reliability. Additionally, a mitigation operation algorithm using device-level intelligence is suggested if servers are compromised by cyber-attacks.

A number of previous studies have used particle trajectory analysis to obtain insights into the effects of particle transport on the behavior of membrane systems; however, these studies have typically been based on simplified models for the interactions often neglecting the effects of electrostatic, interparticle, and Brownian forces.  The objective of this thesis was to obtain a more fundamental understanding of the behavior of membrane systems by performing detailed numerical simulations of the flow and particle trajectories as a function of the device operating conditions.\nNumerical calculations were performed using the commercial software package FLUENT.  The fluid streamlines were evaluated by solution of the Navier-Stokes equation, both in the presence and absence of counter-electroosmosis.  Particle trajectories were evaluated by numerical integration of the Langevin equations accounting for the combined effects of electrostatic repulsion, enhanced hydrodynamic drag, Brownian diffusion, and interparticle forces. \nIn the absence of Brownian forces, the particles are unable to enter the pore unless the drag force on the particle associated with the filtration velocity can overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the charged particle and the charged membrane.  Interparticle interactions can significantly alter the particle trajectories, allowing particles to overcome the energy barrier and thus reducing the critical flux for particle transmission.  Brownian forces allow particles to enter the pore even when the magnitude of the electrostatic repulsion is greater than the hydrodynamic drag, with the particle transmission increasing with increasing filtration velocity.  Counter-electroosmosis has a relatively small effect on the fluid streamlines and particle trajectories if simulations are performed at a constant filtrate flux; simulations at constant pressure show a significant difference due to the reduction in filtrate flux associated with the induced streaming potential.  Simulations were also performed to evaluate the possible effects of transmembrane pressure pulsing, although un-realistically rapid pulsing was required to have a significant effect on the critical flux.\nThese results provide important insights into the nature of particle motion in membrane systems, and they provide a framework for future analyses of particle trajectories, critical flux, and particle transmission in both microfiltration and ultrafiltration. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4552], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Myung-man ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Myung-man", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey", "Darrell Velegol", "Andrew Zydney", "Ali Borhan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Chair", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["membrane", "simulations", "protein", "particle"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE FORMALISM OF AFFORDANCE IN HUMAN-MACHINE COOPERATIVE SYSTEMS USING FINITE STATE AUTOMATA (FSA)\n", "id": "10253", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4738", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Control of human-centered systems is a challenging problem because of the critical role of humans in complex systems, and of the human\u2019s capability of executing unanticipated actions \u2013 both beneficial ones as well as detrimental ones. When modeling human-involved systems where a human operator is considered a crucial system component, it is necessary to consider model complexity that increases significantly due to a human\u2019s non-deterministic behavioral patterns. From the perspective of the temporal and physical state domains, human behaviors usually are limited by attention and resource constraints, which come from both resource accessibilities in a certain moment of time, and human/resource constraints such as size and weight.\nIn order to provide a systematic approach to represent human participation as a part of system operations, this research presents a formal automata model of human-involved systems that incorporates human capabilities (effectivities) with respect to system conditions (affordances). The formalism for affordance is realized by using finite state automata including the juxtaposition function between system affordances and human effectivities. The formalism is based on a hierarchical modeling concept which combines several basic models and defines the granularity of states in systems. The hierarchical FSA modeling can provide the analysis of system complexities and investigation of human planning activities. \nWe further investigate the role of perception in human actions and examine the representation of perceptual elements using an affordance-based modeling formalism. Necessary and sufficient conditions for mapping perception-based human actions into systems theory are analyzed to develop a predictive modeling formalism in the context of prospective control. \nA detailed human-machine cooperative shop-floor control example is provided to illustrate the implementation of a material handling system using a Human-in-the-system (HITS) controller incorporating an affordance-based FSA formalism. A formal human-machine cooperative model based on the finite state automaton (FSA) for designing system control schemes is constructed.  The proposed model can provide a framework to combine human activities into system operations while considering human effectivities and system affordances in dynamic situations. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4703], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Nam Hun ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nam Hun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Allen Wysk", "Drs Richard A Wysk And Ling Rothrock", "Ling Rothrock", "Sanjay B Joshi", "David J Hall", "Dongmin Shin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Allen Wysk, Dissertation Advisor", "Drs Richard A Wysk And Ling Rothrock, Committee Chair", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Chair", "Sanjay B Joshi, Committee Member", "David J Hall, Committee Member", "Dongmin Shin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["affordance", "finite state automata", "human-machine systems", "formalism"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "SHARING DECISIONS, TEACHING IN TEAMS, AND MULTI-AGING: INDIVIDUALLY GUIDED EDUCATION, 1965-1981", "id": "5896", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5003", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In an effort to enhance our understanding of public school reform, this study aimed: (1) to explore how Individually Guided Education (IGE) was developed and disseminated nationwide during 1965-1973; (2) to determine the extent to which Individually Guided Education was adopted, implemented, and continued by public elementary schools nationwide during 1969-1981; and (3) to identify what factors either facilitated or hindered the processes of mobilizing, implementing, and institutionalizing Individually Guided Education during 1969-1981. \n\nThis historical case study relied upon primary source materials, including, but not limited to: Quarterly/Semi-annual/Annual Progress Reports on the Wisconsin Research and Development Center, Theoretical/Technical Reports, Working Papers, manuals for IGE implementation, documents on leadership development conferences and inservice teacher training workshops, curricular materials published at the Center; evaluation reports on nationwide installation and continuation of IGE; more than 120 doctoral dissertations at 37 colleges and universities in 23 states; ERIC documents; and written interviews with IGE creators. \n\nBased on their degree of implementation, IGE schools were categorized into four groups in ascending order: opportunistic, nominal, marginal, and true IGE schools. These groups accounted for about 20%, 40%, 20%, and 20% of the total IGE schools,  respectively. In these groups of IGE schools, different factors either facilitated or hindered the processes of mobilizing, implementing, and institutionalizing IGE. Four factors played a major role in the phase of mobilization for IGE: locus of decision, need for a change, readiness, and resources. In the phase of implementation, four factors supported or constrained the processes of implementing IGE in successful and less successful IGE schools: staff development, role relationship change, shared decision-making, and district support. Three factors facilitated the successful institutionalization of IGE: external support, continued inservice for the staff, and creative modification of the IGE program.\n\nOpportunistic IGE schools were characterized by top-down decisions, the staff feeling no need for a change, the staff unprepared, and no resources. These opportunistic IGE schools were known to have adopted, but did not implement IGE at all. \n\nNominal IGE schools were known for top-down decisions, the staff feeling no need for a change, the staff unprepared, and few resources in the stage of mobilization. Without a good start in the phase of mobilization, nominal IGE schools showed the following characteristics in the implementation phase: little staff development, no change in role relationship and shared decision-making, and no district support. Failing to change the traditional organization and instructional practices, nominal IGE schools discontinued IGE after a period of unsuccessful implementation. \n\nMarginal IGE schools were characterized by top-down decision, the staff feeling no need for a change, the staff unprepared, but some resources utilized in the mobilization phase. In the phase of implementation, marginal IGE schools showed some staff development, mild change in role relationship and shared decision-making, and little/some district support. Although these marginal schools implemented IGE to a higher degree than nominal IGE schools, most of them ultimately failed to institutionalize IGE. \n\nUnlike the above schools, in true IGE schools the adoption decision was made jointly between the principal and staff, the staff sought a change, the staff was ready for change, and the school acquired sufficient resources during the mobilization phase. Further, in the stage of implementation, true IGE schools showed sufficient staff development, role relationship change, shared decision-making, and district support. In the institutionalization phase, true IGE schools had adequate external support, engaged in continued inservice, and modified IGE creatively.\n\nThis study found that only about 20% of the total IGE schools successfully replaced age-graded, self-contained classrooms. In order to explain the reasons for this low degree of IGE reform in the majority of IGE schools, and the reasons for the high degree of IGE reform in true IGE schools, this study reveals key factors that are important to consider in different phases of innovation in order to increase the possibility of institutionalizing current school reform programs. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4979], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Pyeong-gook ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pyeong-gook", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick Willard Shannon", "Robert F Nicely Jr.", "Murry R Nelson", "John Daniel Marshall", "David P Baker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Member", "Robert F Nicely Jr., Committee Member", "Murry R Nelson, Committee Chair", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Chair", "David P Baker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["elementary secondary education", "comprehensive school reform", "educational change", "organizational change", "school culture", "change strategies", "change agents", "organizational development", "teacher role", "staff development", "decision making", "team teaching", "individu"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "STRUCTURAL AND BIOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF LSD1/COREST HISTONE DEMETHYLASE COMPLEX ON THE NUCLEOSOME", "id": "13479suk249", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13479", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Chromatin, a complex of DNA and proteins, is a dynamic structure that can respond to external cues to regulate genes. Posttranslational modification of histones plays a key role in this regulation through modulation of chromatin structure and function. One such modification, methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), has been correlated with transcriptional activation and is enriched at the promoters and enhancers of active genes. Lysine residues can be mono-, di- or trimethylated, and the specific form of methylation is regulated by a synergistic effort of histone methyltransferases and demethylases. The LSD1 (lysine-specific demethylase 1) protein can alone demethylate mono- and dimethylated H3K4 in peptide substrates, but requires the corepressor protein, CoREST, to demethylate nucleosome substrates. The crystal structure of the LSD1/CoREST in complex with the H3-peptide has been solved and a plethora of information exists on how the LSD1/CoREST works on the peptide substrates. However, these studies do not provide insight into how LSD1/CoREST interacts with the nucleosome, the physiological substrate. As such, full elucidation of LSD1/CoREST\u2019s function on the nucleosome is critical to understanding its roles in development, cellular differentiation, embryonic pluripotency, and cancer. \nIn this dissertation, I provide insights into how the LSD1/CoREST complex interacts with the nucleosome via biochemical and structural approaches. My studies of LSD1/CoREST\u2019s enzymatic activity and nucleosome binding show that extranucleosomal DNA dramatically enhances the activity of LSD1/CoREST and that LSD1/CoREST requires DNA beyond the nucleosome core particle for optimal interaction. These results are consistent with the photocrosslinking experiments performed by Nilanjana Chatterjee in collaboration with Blaine Bartholomew\u2019s group, which indicate both LSD1 and CoREST subunits are in close contact with extranucleosomal DNA. I have also determined the molecular replacement solutions of LSD1/CoREST on 161 and 189 bp nucleosome crystal structures at 7.2 \u00c5 and 5.3 \u00c5 resolution respectively. These studies provide novel insights into how LSD1/CoREST productively engages the nucleosomes with extranucleosomal DNA. Both models suggest that the catalytic domain of LSD1 and the N-terminus of CoREST makes contact with extranucleosomal DNA, while the CoREST SANT2 domain recognizes the nucleosomal disk face. Current work is aimed toward determining the LSD1/CoREST/nucleosome crystal structure at a higher resolution.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13724], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Sang-Ah ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sang-Ah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Song Tan", "Andrey S.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a pro-oxidant deeply involves in many cellular metabolisms which use redox-balance. For this reason, oxidative stress has been considered as one of the biomarkers for the abnormality of body conditions. Therefore, the various measurement systems of oxidative stress have been explored, for example, a measurement of oxidized biomolecules. However, there are a few methods to detect oxidative stress directly, due to their unstable properties. The precise methodology such as a biosensor to detect ROS directly is desirable for diagnostic purposes. In this dissertation, various biosensors for the measurement of intracellular oxidative stress are developed, including the fabrication, characterization, and cellular applications.   \nIn order to develop a biosensor for the measurement of intracellular oxidative stress, there are several requirements. First, the biosensor for intracellular measurements should be on the nano-scale for effective internalization with minimized the cellular side effects. Second, the materials used in the biosensor should be biocompatible and suitable for the easy transfer of analytes. To satisfy these requirements, poly(ethylene) glycol hydrogels were used for the biosensors for measurements of oxidative stress, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>). The first biosensor for the detection of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was developed by a novel technique to encapsulate enzymes in PEG hydrogel without loss of enzymatic activity. Encapsulated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) can be used for effective conversion of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to fluorescent material for the optical detection. The HRP-loaded nanobiosensor then was characterized and applied in macrophages phagocytic system. \nFor the detection of superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>) as another potent intracellular oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase (SOD) was integrated in the previous nanobiosensor. The fabricated SOD-HRP encapsulated nanobiosensor was then characterized by several methods, including the enzymatic activities by using superoxide anions generation system. Furthermore, the surfaces of nanospheres were modified by phospholipids for the internalization in non-phagocytic cells. These method allowed to detect O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022-</sup>in smooth muscle cells and brain cancer cells. \nFinally, resultant cellular responses by oxidative stress were studied by fluorescent dye doped silica nanoparticles with bio-functional surface. One of the cellular responses mediated by oxidative stress is the migration of smooth muscle cells, involved in vascular disease and vessel remodeling. The migration of smooth muscle cells can be indicated by internalized fluorescent nanoparticles through membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase. Furthermore, the cellular responses to internalized nanoparticles were extensively studied, regarding to cytoskeletal structure. \nTherefore, this dissertation describes the fabrication, characterization, and applications of nanobiosensors for intracellular oxidative stress measurement and resultant cellular responses mediated by oxidative stress. These results in this thesis might contribute the field of nanobiosensors for the detection of intracellular analytes and analysis of cellular responses. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6064], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Se-Hwa ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Se-Hwa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael V Pishko", "Cara Lynne Schengrund", "Ahmed A Heikal", "Peter J Butler", "Peter John Hudson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael V Pishko, Committee Chair", "Cara Lynne Schengrund, Committee Member", "Ahmed A Heikal, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biosensor", "cell-based", "enzyme", "polymer", "oxidative stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE PARALLEL I/O", "id": "12561", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5831", "abstract_tesi": "Efficient execution of large-scale scientific applications requires high-performance\ncomputing systems designed to meet the I/O requirements.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the complex policy processes in the health policy area in Illinois, using two theoretical lenses: the policy network theory (PNT) and the advocacy coalition framework (ACF). The PNT helps us understand the complex networked relationships among the actors of public policy processes. The ACF helps us explore more specifically the belief systems of network actors and the roles such beliefs play in policy network formation and policy change.  Using the PNT and the ACF frameworks, in this dissertation I examined the policy network characteristics and policy changes in the case of the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in Illinois from 1997 to 2007. In my study I used AutoMap, a network analyses tool, and ORA, a dynamic network analysis tool. Using this combination of methods, I extracted meta-networks from the newspaper articles on the SCHIP process in Illinois and analyzed them to identify the policy networks and subnetworks (subgroups) and the values attached to these subgroups. \n\nI first discuss the background of the Illinois SCHIP policy process and the theoretical frameworks I applied in my study (PNT and ACF). After describing and discussing the analytical tools I used (AutoMap and ORA), I present the findings on the structural characteristics of policy networks in the Illinois SCHIP policy process. Next I present the results of a series of cluster analyses, which revealed the groups of actors who formed the advocacy policy coalitions, and compare these results with the predictions of the ACF. I found that in the SCHIP Illinois case and in the period I studied the predictions of ACF were only partially confirmed: I could identify some pro- and against- policy coalitions, but their membership or the values attached to them were not consistent between 1997 and 2007. Instead, ORA identified the clusters of networks (subnetworks) of policy actors and their beliefs. I conclude that in interpreting the findings it is better to use the relatively broader term of \u201cpolicy issue networks\u201d or \u201cpolicy issue coalitions,\u201d instead of the ACF\u2019s more specific term of \u201cadvocacy coalitions.\u201d \n\nMy dissertation makes a contribution to the policy literature by introducing innovative methods of network text analysis (AutoMap) and dynamic network analysis (ORA) to identify policy networks and subnetworks in texts. It also makes a contribution by presenting an understanding of the interplay between key policy actors and their beliefs and network characteristics. The methods applied in this dissertation may be used in future studies on policy processes and the findings may be compared with those of future studies to gain a better understanding of policy networks.

This dissertation focuses on the CuCl/HCl electrolysis phase of the cycle, which produces hydrogen gas via oxidation of CuCl(s) dissolved in highly concentrated HCl(aq), and reduces aqueous protons to hydrogen gas. Transport properties in the electrolyzer membrane were experimentally and thermodynamically investigated. In particular, the membrane characteristics, hot-pressing effects on ionic transport, the effects of membrane characteristics on the performance of the electrolyzer system and phenomenological modeling of transport properties via irreversible thermodynamics were carried out. \nExperimental research was carried out in three phases: In the first phase (1), several types of proton conducting polymer membranes were characterized and evaluated using single conductivity and permeability cell under a variety of conditions, and the effects of hot-pressing membranes were recorded. Initial testing of proton conducting membranes showed that single and double layer Nafion 117 membranes demonstrate higher proton conductivity than other types of proton conductive membranes. Hot-pressed Nafion membranes, such as the pressed double layer Nafion 117 membrane, demonstrated the highest selectivity (proton conductivity/copper permeability) after a hot pressing procedure. The main conclusions were that hot-pressed double layer Nafion 117 membrane could be a promising membrane by reduced copper cross over through the membrane and maintained high conductivity for electrolyzer test. Significantly improved stability of electrolyzer system with hot-pressed Nafion membrane was expected based on the results of membrane conductivity and permeability tests. \nIn the second phase (2), CuCl/HCl electrolyzer performance was investigated using linear sweep voltammetry, hydrogen production, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and analysis of copper ion flux through the membranes. These investigations show that two aspects -- lower copper permeability through membranes by hot-pressing, and high concentrated HCl(aq) catholyte and anolyte solutions -- can overcome a substantial electrolyzer obstacle: Cu(s) precipitation at the cathode. Higher concentrations of HCl(aq) and CuCl(aq) in the anolyte can significantly affect the electrolyzer performance, especially membrane conductivity. Through the concept of the copper ion dissolved in the solution, the copper deposition can be prevented by increasing the concentration of HCl(aq) catholyte solution. Such enhanced MEA and electrolyzer system allowed the electrolyzer performance to improve and extend the period time of electrolyzer operating. By optimization of test conditions in electrolyzer, a significantly improved current density of 0.456 A/cm2 was observed at 0.7 V, using 2 mol L-1 CuCl(aq) in 6 mol L-1 HCl(aq) anolyte solution when hydrogen production efficiency remained high, over 95 %.  \nIn the final phase, a simple phenomenological model based on irreversible thermodynamics was developed to describe the simultaneous transport of ions and electricity in the CuCl electrolyzer. Phenomenological coefficients were expressed in terms of gradients of electrical and chemical potentials, including conductivity, permeability and transport numbers determined by experiments. By implementing experiments, the phenomenological coefficients were obtained. Using developed single cell and electrolyzer cell designs, the phenomenological coefficients were estimated as a function of copper concentration.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8773], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Soohyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Soohyun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Serguei Lvov", "Derek Elsworth", "Yongsheng Chen", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Serguei Lvov, Dissertation Advisor", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Yongsheng Chen, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ionic Transport", "CuCl/HCl electrolyzer", "Hydrogen", "Membrane", "CuCl thermochemical cycle", "hot-pressing", "Phenomenological coefficient"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "ENERGY-EFFICIENT HIGH PERFORMANCE CACHE ARCHITECTURES", "id": "6183", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5967", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-07-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The demand for high-performance architectures and powerful battery-operated mobile devices has \naccentuated the need for low-power systems. \nIn many media and embedded applications, the memory system can consume more than 50%\nof the overall system energy, making this a ripe candidate for optimization.\nAlso, caches play an important role in performance by filtering a large percentage of main memory accesses that would take long latencies.\nTo address this increasingly important problem, this thesis studies energy-efficient high performance\ncache architectures\nthat can have a significant impact on the overall system energy consumption and performance.\nThis thesis makes four contributions to this end.\n\nThe first contribution focuses on partitioning the cache resources architecturally for energy and performance optimizations. Specifically, this thesis investigates splitting the cache into several smaller units, each of which is a cache by itself (called subcache). The proposed subcache architecture employs page-based placement, dynamic page re-mapping, and subcache prediction policies in order to improve the memory system energy and performance, especially for instruction accesses.\n\nAs technology scales down into deep-submicron, leakage energy is becoming a dominant source of energy consumption. Leakage energy is generally proportional to the number of transistors in a circuit and caches constitute a large portion of the die transistor count. Most techniques have targeted cell leakage energy minimization; bitline leakage is critical as well. To this end, this thesis proposes a predictive precharging scheme for minimizing bitline leakage as its second contribution.\n\nMany of the recently proposed techniques to reduce power consumption in caches introduce an additional level of non-determinism in cache access latency. \nDue to this additional latency, instructions dependent on a non-deterministic load and speculatively issued must be re-executed as they will not have the correct data in time. This penalty can potentially offset the claimed power benefits of using such low-power caches. To address this problem, this thesis proposes an early cache set resolution scheme as its third contribution.\n\nIncreasing clock frequencies and issue rates aggravate the memory latency problem, imposing higher memory bandwidth requirements. While caches can be multi-ported for providing high memory bandwidth, increase in their access latency with more ports limits their potential. This thesis proposes a novel temporal cache architecture, as the fourth contribution, for improving performance and reducing energy consumption by satisfying a large percentage of loads from a small power-efficient temporal cache early in the pipeline.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5961], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Soontae ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Soontae", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Richard Brooks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Member", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Richard Brooks, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy", "performance", "caches"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "PHYSICAL DAMAGE OF POLYMER ELECTROLYTE FUEL CELLS SUBJECT TO FREEZING", "id": "9243", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5971", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the remaining technical challenges for polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) commercialization is to achieve shutdown to a frozen state, and rapid start from frozen conditions without damage. PEFCs generate water as reaction product, so when PEFCs are subjected to sub-freezing environments without removal of residual water, they can experience irreversible damage. There exist conflicts in the literature regarding freeze-damage, and the particular damage modes are not clearly understood. This work is designed to elucidate freeze-damage modes of fuel cell materials, and to investigate temperature-gradient driven water transport phenomena as a potential to mitigate freeze-damage.\nFreeze-damage modes were identified through ex-situ and in-cell freeze/thaw (F/T) cycling experiment. Three primary damage modes were discovered: 1) interfacial delamination, 2) ice expansion damage, and 3) pore level damage. The effect of interfacial delamination, which was diagnosed as a main damage mode on fuel cell performance, was also investigated by developing a two-dimensional anisotropic current disruption model.\nExtensive ex-situ material F/T cycling testing was conducted under the worst case conditions of liquid water submersion to identify the key factors leading to physical damage. Specifically, the membrane electrode assembly, porous media, and electrolyte were found to be sources of water that can damage the catalyst layers under freeze/thaw conditions. Damage was found to occur almost exclusively under the channel, and not under the land. Conceptually, the best material to mitigate freeze damage in a PEFC was found to be a crack-free virgin catalyst layer, and a thin reinforced membrane with a stiff hydrophobically treated diffusion media.\nThe in-cell study affirmed that significant damage can occur for a single cell with no purge, indicating that water removal from the cell, especially from the catalyst layer pores, during shutdown is critical for robust PEFC operation in frozen conditions. \nA two-dimensional anisotropic model was developed to investigate the impact of local delamination on PEFC performance. Localized interfacial delamination of the membrane &#61564; catalyst layer and catalyst layer &#61564; diffusion media were found to significantly increase ohmic resistance. The in-plane resistance and in-plane-to-through-plane resistance ratio of PEFC components adjacent to the delamination were determined to be the key controlling parameters for increase in ohmic resistance.\nTemperature-gradient induced water transport phenomena were explored in PEFC materials because of a potential for non-parasitic water drainage at shutdown. Two different modes were identified: 1) thermo-osmosis, and 2) phase-change induced flow.\nDirect thermo-osmotic experiments on different polymer membrane types (non-reinforced Nafion\u00ae and two different commercial reinforced membranes) show that thermo-osmotic flow was observed in all membranes, and the water flow direction in the membrane was determined to always flow from the cold to the hot side, as anticipated for a small pore hydrophilic porous medium. The water flux was found to be proportional to temperature gradient and to increase with average membrane temperature. The dependency of the thermo-osmotic diffusivity on average temperature showed predictable Arrhenius-type behavior. True interfacial temperatures of the membrane were estimated using a two-dimensional thermal model, and empirical relations for the thermo-osmotic diffusivity for the membrane types tested were developed. These can be of use to design engineers concerned about achieving optimal water balance during steady and transient operation.\nContrary to thermo-osmotic flow in fuel cell membranes, a net flux of water was found to flow from the hot to cold side of the full membrane electrode assembly. The key to this is the existence of some gas phase in the catalyst layer or other porous media. This mode of transport is a result of phase-change induced flow. The measured water transport through the membrane electrode assembly is the net effect of mass diffusion as well as thermo-osmosis in the membrane, which moves counter to the direction of the phase-change induced flow. Arrhenius functions that are dependent on material set, temperature gradient, and average temperature across the materials were developed that describe the net flux. In addition to direct quantification, phase-change induced flow was visualized and confirmed using high resolution neutron radiography.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5965], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Soowhan ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Soowhan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew M Mench", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Stephen R Turns", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew M Mench, Committee Chair", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Stephen R Turns, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Water transport", "Freeze damage", "Polymer electrolyte fuel cell", "Thermo-osmosis", "Phase-change induced flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "FINGER INTER-DEPENDENCE: LINKING THE KINETIC AND KINEMATIC VARIABLES\n\n\n\n", "id": "9167", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5970", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The main goal of this dissertation has been to study the inter-dependence between actions of the fingers of the human hand. Earlier studies quantified finger inter-dependence in either isometric conditions using force production tasks, or in nearly isotonic conditions using finger movement tasks. We addressed a common situation when a person holds an object using a subset of the digits of the hand and moves one of the digits. Participants moved one of the fingers (task finger) of the right hand trying to follow a cyclic, ramp-like flexion-extension template at different frequencies. The other fingers (non-task fingers) were restricted from moving; their fingertip pressing forces were recorded and analyzed. The index finger motion caused the smallest force production by the non-task fingers. Larger forces were produced by the neighbors of the task finger; these forces showed strong modulation over the range of motion of the task finger. The forces were higher during the flexion phase of the movement cycle as compared to the extension phase. The index of enslaving expressed in N/rad depended on the movement speed and was higher when the task finger moved through the more flexed postures. These observations suggest an important role of central, neural mechanisms in the patterns of finger interdependence. They also suggest that methods of analysis of finger coordination based on an assumption of universal matrices of finger interdependence should consider the specific features of the studied tasks.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5964], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Sun ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sun", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark L, Latash", "Mark Latash"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark L, Latash, Thesis Advisor", "Mark Latash, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Finger Force Enslaving Kinetics Kinematics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Development of Meaning Making in Second Language Writing of Korean International Graduate Students: A Sociocultural and Cognitive Linguistic Perspective \n", "id": "15472", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7800", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current dissertation project sought to promote a total of ten Korean international graduate students' literacy development in the study abroad context by designing and implementing a meaning-driven, metaphor-focused pedagogical intervention. Specifically, it integrated the Cognitive Linguistic (CL) approach to language analysis and the Sociocultural approach to learning and development to materialize an effective pedagogical strategy for the academic literacy development of multilingual writers. To this end, building on recent development of the applied CL approach to second language pedagogy, the researcher provided participants with a metaphor-analytic mediational tool based on the principles of conceptual metaphor theory (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). \nAn activity system analysis of the participants' literacy ecologies revealed that they were facing two major challenges for literacy development. On the conceptual level, they needed to redefine the realities and challenges they had to confront with a principled and deeper understanding of literacy. On the activity level, they needed to reorganize their literacy practices with quality mediational tools. To address these issues, the participants joined a meaning-focused, metaphor-mediated L2 writing study group, which lasted for one academic semester. Meanwhile, metaphor identification, adaptation, and annotation were provided as the main mediational means for analyzing and appropriating conceptual and linguistic elements of discipline-specific discourse. In the process of locating metaphors in authentic texts and improvising them based on their needs for academic communication, the participants were able to recognize the importance of analytical reading as well as the connection of reading and writing. Additionally, the annotation activity enabled them to attend to the conceptual and structural aspects of each expression, showing the importance of L1 as a thinking tool in second language writing pedagogy. \nA grounded analysis of the study group sessions and the patterns of the participants' metaphor identification, adaptation, and annotation revealed that the CL-inspired L2 writing pedagogy has the potential to encourage the participants' cross-linguistic, cross-cultural, and interdisciplinary discussions and provide them with an effective tool for textual production. Furthermore, it mobilized their critical and reflective stances towards their own and other disciplines. The intervention has also left us with one major challenge in attempting to enhance its pedagogical effectiveness: structural components in L2 writing need to be addressed within the overarching principles of foregrounding meaning at the center of pedagogy, integrating language and culture, relating disciplinary concepts to linguistic metaphors, and fostering critical and creative minds towards academic discourse. \nThis discussion shows that the field of second language writing can benefit substantially from the recent development of the applied CL approach to language learning and teaching. It further suggests that it would be needed to reconfigure the functions of university writing centers and the curricular of ESL programs by incorporating diverse conceptual and linguistic tools including metaphor analysis and specialized corpora. This interdisciplinary enterprise and the effort to transform international students' literacy activity systems will contribute to helping them gain confidence as scholarly writers and overcome the current trend of mechanization and skillization of literacy. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7729], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Sung Woo", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "Woo", "first_name_ssi": "Sung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Lantolf", "Celeste S Kinginger", "Athelstan Canagarajah", "Xiaoye You"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Lantolf, Dissertation Advisor", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Member", "Athelstan Canagarajah, Committee Member", "Xiaoye You, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cognitive Linguistics", "Second Language Writing", "Conceptual Metaphor", "ESL", "Composition", "Sociocultural Theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "COMPETITION, PRIVATIZATION, CONVERGENCE, AND UNIVERSAL SERVICE: THE CASE STUDY OF KOREA\n", "id": "9329", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5973", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since telecommunications reforms began around world in the 1980s, many scholars have attempted to uncover its effects on the telecommunications sector. Nevertheless, research focusing largely on the impact of privatization on universal service has been relatively less frequent than other research on telecommunications reform such as the effect of competition on efficiency, investment, and universal service, and the impact of privatization on efficiency. As a result, there still remain doubts and debates about the effect of privatization on universal service. Further, the well-established ideas in the literature fail to fully explain the process of telecommunications reform and the evolution of universal service in Korea because of the atypical strategies which Korea has employed for network expansion and universal service. From these perspectives, this study attempted to bridge the gap between the findings in the previous works and the Korean case. \nAs a case study of Korea, it has a limitation in generalizing the impacts of changes in market structure on universal service because of the unique features which Korea has demonstrated in the process of telecommunications reform and the evolution of universal service. In spite of this limitation, this dissertation may contribute to providing policy-makers and scholars in telecommunications with useful policy suggestions by concretely illustrating why Korea has adopted its own agenda in telecommunication and how she has successfully implemented it in the reform process. Particularly, this study indicates that each state may have its discretion in telecommunications and be able to choose the strategies appropriate to its political, economic, and social circumstances in order to secure universal service, despite the irresistible global trend of market-oriented telecommunications reform. In other words, this dissertation shows through the case study of Korea that even though telecommunications reform such as competition and privatization is a useful and effective choice on the policy menu for developing countries which pursue the improvement in the efficiency of their telecommunications as well as the promotion of universal service, a new recipe, which looks queer to those who prefer the conventional, might be the better option for them depending on their tastes, as the Korean case demonstrates.\n \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5967], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Sung Wook ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sung Wook", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Krishna Prasad Jayakar", "Krishna Prasad Jayakar", "Richard Denny Taylor", "Amit Schejter", "Lynette Marie Yarger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Krishna Prasad Jayakar, Dissertation Advisor", "Krishna Prasad Jayakar, Committee Chair", "Richard Denny Taylor, Committee Member", "Amit Schejter, Committee Member", "Lynette Marie Yarger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Telecommunications policy", "Competition", "Privatization", "Universal service", "The case study of Korea"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Polyacrylamide-Treated Kaolin clay: A Fabric Study\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "8153", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5975", "abstract_tesi": "The field of surface-treated clays, especially polymer-treated clays, has been growing for the last a few decades, with a considerable number of studies conducted on the use of polymers as a clay-surface treatment.  In spite of many studies on the behavior of clay-polymer systems at the level of particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions, fabric development over a wide range of solids content is poorly understood.  The purpose of this study is to understand fabric development in a clay-polymer system, specifically kaolin-polyacrylamide systems over a wide range of solids content.  Methodologies include sedimentation tests (low solids content), viscosity measurements (moderate solids content), and liquid limit measurements (high solids content), and are conducted to determine variation in fabric for kaolin-polyacrylamide systems at various concentrations, molecular weight and ionic types of polyacrylamide.  Fabric development is verified using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  Fabric changes in sedimentation, viscosity, and liquid limit behavior in the presence of polyacrylamide corresponding to the change in the type of particle association are observed in SEM.  Floc/aggregate size and density tend to increase with increasing polyacrylamide concentration, showing the formation of more larger, denser flocs.  Final sediment height tends to decrease with an increase in polyacrylamide concentration, indicating denser particle associations (face-to-face) and verified with scanning electron microscopy.  Viscosity tends to increase as polyacrylamide concentration increases, implying more flocculated/aggregated fabric formation.  High molecular polyacylamides tend to induce a higher liquid limit with increasing concentration, demonstrating the formation of open flocculated structure.  It is observed that the most likely particle association in the presence of polyacrylamide is face-to-face association by polymer bridges, which in turn results in a dense fabric.  The molecular weight and concentration of polyacrylamide determines the fabric formation over a wide range of solids content.  The polymer charge type impacts on the resulting fabric formation only at polymer concentration above the critical coagulation concentration.  A relationship is found between polymer characteristics, solids contents, and micro-scale particle arrangement.  This relationship is summarized in a series of fabric maps.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5969], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Sung ho ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sung ho", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Angelica Palomino", "Angelica M Palomino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Angelica Palomino, Thesis Advisor", "Angelica M Palomino, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["SEM", "polymer", "kaolinite", "liquid limit", "sedimentation", "viscosity", "fabric study", "kaolin clay", "polyacrylamide", "microcomposite", "nanocomposite"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "An Engineered Clay Soil System Using Functional Polymers\n\n", "id": "12465", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13285", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soil modification is widely accepted to improve soil properties in the field of geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering.

In reply to a number of negative consequences of traditional multiple-choice tests, researchers proposed measurement-driven-reform with performance assessments. The main rationale for this movement is that changing assessment from multiple-choice tests to performance assessments will change instructional practices in the classroom, that encourage higher-order thinking skills, and as a result, they will improve student learning. In this study, the consequences of implementing performance assessments were investigated by conducting a meta-analysis using HLM (Hierarchical Linear Modeling). Specifically, whether or not performance assessments had a positive impact on student learning was examined. \nThe results of HLM analyses revealed that performance assessments improved student learning on average. Moreover, the variances across the studies were dramatically reduced after the removal of sampling errors, correction of unreliabilities, and controlling the 12 local variables.  For the reliability uncorrected data, the total variances was reduced by 57.3%, and for the reliability corrected data, 70.7% of the total variances was reduced. However, the results of Chi-square tests indicated that there still exist variabilities across the studies, indicating that the impacts of performance assessments on student learning cannot be generalized. In other words, the effects of performance assessments on student learning are locally valid.\nAmong the 12 local variables, the number of months after implementing performance assessments, cognitive learning outcome, average-performing students, and use of performance assessments as an instructional tool were statistically significant predicting effects of performance assessments on student learning. In addition to these four variables, American and one group pretest-posttest design without random assignment were statistically significant for the uncorrected data, and the variable of high-performing students was significant for the corrected data. \nFurthermore, this study found out the best (worst) combination of the local variables producing the largest (smallest) effect.

The applicability of the model is thus evaluated by selecting South Korea\u00a1\u00afs cooperation with U.S. dollar based international financial order through the Asian crisis in 1997. Since the model presupposes the hegemon\u00a1\u00afs necessity of winning supportive public opinion in weak states, not only hegemon\u00a1\u00afs building up intellectual leadership but also weak states\u00a1\u00af subscription to the leadership is investigated.

The ReaxFF force field parameters have been fitted to a quantum mechanical (QM) training set containing structures and energies related to bond dissociation energies, angle and dihedral distortions, and reactions between water and titanium dioxide as well as experimental crystal structures, heats of formation and bulk modulus data. Model configurations for the training set were based on DFT calculations on molecular clusters and periodic systems (both bulk crystals and surfaces). ReaxFF reproduces accurately the QM training set for structures and energetics of small clusters. ReaxFF also describes the relative energetics for rutile, brookite and anatase. The results of ReaxFF match reasonably well with those of QM for water binding energies, surface energies and H2O dissociation energy barriers. To validate this ReaxFF description, we have compared its performance against DFT/MD simulations for 1 and 3 monolayers of water interacting with a rutile (110) surface. We found agreement within 10% error between the DFT/MD and ReaxFF water dissociation levels for both coverages. \nIn addition to this, a new Ti-Cl force field parameter has been developed to describe reactions in Ti/O/H/Cl materials. The ReaxFF force field parameters are fitted against a quantum mechanical (QM) training set containing structures and energies related to bond dissociations, angle and dihedral distortions, and reactions between titanium and chlorine gases as well as heats of formation of TiClx crystals. These newly developed Ti-Cl force field parameters were combined with the recently developed Ti-O-H force field. ReaxFF accurately reproduces the QM training set for structures and energetics of small clusters and TiClx crystals. This force field was applied to etching simulations for titanium metal and titanium dioxide with chlorine and hydrogen chloride gases. In the etching simulations, titanium and titanium dioxide slab models with chlorine and hydrogen chloride gases were used in molecular dynamics simulations. The etching ratio between HCl and Cl2 are compared to experimental results and satisfactory results are obtained, indicating that this ReaxFF extension provides a useful tool for studying the atomistic-scale details of the etching process. \nIn addition, simulations of TiO2 (both rutile and anatase) nanoparticles with water, methanol and formic acid were conducted by combining C parameter with the Ti/O/H parameters to investigate the characteristic behavior of reactivity to these organic solvents. The force field was validated by comparing water dissociative adsorption percentage and bond length between Na and O with DFT and experimental results. In the simulations, 1 nm rutile and anatase nanoparticles with water, methanol and formic acid were used, respectively. The numbers of attached hydroxyl with time and nanoparticles distortion levels are presented. We found that the rutile nanoparticle is more reactive than the anatase nanoparticle and that formic acid distorts nanoparticles more than water and methanol. \nBy adding Ca parameters with the previously developed Ti/O/H/Cl force field, simulations of TiO2 nanocrystalline surfaces in aqueous solutions with Ca and Cl ions were conducted. Before that, the force field was validated by comparing bond length between Ca and O with experimental results. The energetic and structures of hydrated ions was investigated. The numbers of OH and Ca ions attached to the surfaces with respect to time were tracked. Also, the mechanism of ion adsorption caused by proton-induced charge transfer and Ca ions diffusion behavior was analyzed. In addition to these, the ion adsorption characteristic behaviors of 5 different specific faces for anatase and rutile were evaluated. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8417], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Sung-yup ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sung-yup", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin", "James David Kubicki", "Richard A Yetter", "Donghai Wang", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin, Dissertation Advisor", "James David Kubicki, Committee Chair", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ReaxFF", "Reactive force field", "titanium dioxide", "nanoparticle"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A New Class Of Bayesian Segmentation Methods For Deriving Heterogeneous Key Drivers Of Service Quality Evaluations\n", "id": "20046", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9598", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation proposes a series of unconstrained and constrained Bayesian finite mixture regression models tailored to examine heterogeneous response patterns in service quality evaluations by simultaneously identifying the underlying market segments of consumers (heterogeneity) and the differential significant drivers in their evaluation judgments (variable selection), while enforcing various managerial and theoretical implementation restrictions (constraints) into the model.

The primary objective of this research is to derive managerial implications in different objectives through appropriate decisions regarding multi-skilled worker allocation. Since a skilled workforce has become an increasingly expensive resource for organizations, determining minimum staffing levels to meet production requirements is critical to competitiveness. This dissertation investigates the effects of several exogenous and controllable factors on minimum staffing levels in parallel dual resource constrained (DRC) systems. The study examines factors of worker selection policies, task heterogeneity, individual cross-training levels, time schedule granularity, and production requirements. The research explores two cases of parallel systems in which a system consists of an equal number of workers and tasks and another with more tasks than workers. \nIn addition, the dissertation presents an association rule mining based framework for workforce scheduling to assist managers with robust real-time assignment decisions. The study explores a parallel production system that meets specified production requirements over a fixed time horizon with the minimum workforce resources based on the number of worker-periods assigned. Three managerial policies are considered including, setting a maximum allowable individual cross-training level, balancing workload among workers, and an unconstrained policy. The research proposes the use of several schedule attributes to quantify key aspects of optimized schedules that may in turn, aid in determining robust assignment rules, and the development of better cross-training policies. Current results indicate that the proposed approach is effective at identifying important rules, many of which add to our knowledge of useful workforce scheduling strategies.  \nBesides, the dissertation examines analytically how heterogeneity in each of the four parameters of the Exponential L/F model affects system productivity. The dissertation also introduces several linearization techniques to reformulate non-convex mixed integer nonlinear (MINLP) workforce assignment models to mixed integer (MIP) models. Through the linearization processes, the resulting model becomes entirely linear, so we can utilize commercially available MIP solvers which is capable of solving problems an order of magnitude larger than typical MINLP solvers can tackle. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6065], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Sungsu  ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sungsu ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Arthur Nembhard", "David Arthur Nembhard", "Paul Griffin", "Ling Rothrock", "Spiro E Stefanou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Arthur Nembhard, Dissertation Advisor", "David Arthur Nembhard, Committee Chair", "Paul Griffin, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Workforce Scheduling", "Cross Training", "Workforce Flexibility", "Learning and Forgetting", "Productivity", "Staffing Level", "Rule Mining", "Robust Optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "OPTICAL, ELECTRICAL AND ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF FERROELECTRIC DOMAIN WALLS IN LiNbO3 AND LiTaO3\n", "id": "6140", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5966", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ferroelectric LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 crystals have developed, over the last 50 years\nas key materials for integrated and nonlinear optics due to their large electro-optic\nand nonlinear optical coe\u000ecients and a broad transparency range from 0.4 \u00b5m - 4.5\u00b5m wavelengths.

Ferroelectric domain microengineering has led to electro-optic\nscanners, dynamic focusing lenses, total internal reflection switches, and quasi-phase\nmatched (QPM) frequency doublers. Most of these applications have so far been on\nnon-stoichiometric compositions of these crystals.\nRecent breakthroughs in crystal growth have however opened up an entirely new\nwindow of opportunity from both scientific and technological viewpoint. The growth of\nstoichiometric composition crystals has led to the discovery of many fascinating effects\narising from the presence or absence of atomic defects, such as an order of magnitude\nchanges in coercive fields, internal fields, domain backswitching and stabilization phenomenon.\nOn the nanoscale, unexpected features such as the presence of wide regions\nof optical contrast and strain have been discovered at 180\u000e domain walls.

It began to alter the way in which people conduct their everyday affairs and also the way in which businesses are conducted.  Under these circumstances, our traditional concept of accessibility can no longer be valid. In fact, through ICT people can get virtual accessibility to a rapidly growing range of activities without the more traditional spatial and temporal limitations and constraints.   Consequently, people have more flexibility to arrange their schedules, and eventually change their activity and travel patterns.   These substantial impacts of ICT motivate the need for research on the present and future impacts of telecommunication on activity and travel behavior. \n\nWith the Puget Sound Transportation Panel (PSTP) data, especially the data collected in Wave7 (1997) and Wave 9 (2000), this study attempts to examine a variety of aspects of the relationships between ICT and activity and travel behaviors within comprehensive conceptual model systems examining correlation patterns.   Several models have been developed, each of which focuses more on a specific aspect of the relationships.  \n\nFirst, technology choice models were developed to identify user groups for each ICT device. Multivariate multilevel categorical data models were used to account for a strong behavioral correlation among households and within household members as well as a high degree of people heterogeneity in technology adoption.  The model revealed that decisions of ICT ownership and usage are most likely determined by joint decisions among members of the same household and there is heterogeneity in each type of ICT ownership and use among different situations.\n\nSecond, a comparative analysis of three different model systems, including a set of single-equation regression models, seeming unrelated regression models (SUR Model), and multivariate multilevel models, was conducted to examine the effect of ICT on activity and travel duration.  Although the three different models produce very similar coefficient values, multivariate models are more advantageous over single-equation models.  The multivariate models account for the correlation of the error terms across equations, and as a result, they produce smaller standard errors of the coefficient estimates than those from single-equation models.  Between the two multivariate models, the multilevel models are superior because they consider the hierarchy of level in the data and provide more information by estimating variance-covariance matrices and correlations for each of the multiple levels, offering additional insight on behavioral heterogeneity at each level.\n\nThird, the joint models using a structural equation modeling technique are formulated for daily time allocation to various activities (subsistence, maintenance, and leisure) and travel, and mode frequency (driving alone, shared ride, transit, bike, walk, and others) as a function of cross-sectional and longitudinal information on personal and household socio-demographics and telecommunication technology ownership and usage.  In this way, the impacts of information and communication technologies on daily time allocation to various activities and travel, and on modal split are assessed. At the same time, the complex relationships among different activities and travel time use indicators and their daily frequencies are explored.  In addition, using longitudinal information on ICT, it is possible to check whether or not the changes in ICT ownership and usage have symmetric effects on time use for activity and travel behavior.  From this model, it was found that the \u00a1\u00b0technology\u00a1\u00b1 effect depends on the location and type of technology and that the majority of social, economic, and ICT changes have asymmetric effects on behavior.  \n\nFourth, dynamic analysis of time use and frequency of activity and travel between Wave 7 and Wave 9 is conducted using latent class clustering and structural equation modeling.  A fixed time budget is explicitly taken in account in these models, and existence of very strong substitutional and complementary relationships in time use among different activities and travel are examined.  In addition, as a new approach to account for state dependence (past activity and travel behavior effects) in the model, relatively homogenous daily activity and travel behavior patterns in Wave 7 are first identified through latent class cluster analysis.  Then time use for a specific activity (in-home activity, out-of-home subsistence activity, and out-of home non-subsistence activity) and traveling, and frequency of episodes by activity in Wave 9 are modeled as a function of cross-sectional and longitudinal information as well as activity and travel patterns in Wave 7.  The model results showed that out-of-home activity duration and travel time have very large substitutional effects on in-home activity duration, while out-of-home activity duration has complementary effects on travel time.  The model results also confirmed the existence of strong habit persistence in activity engagement and time use even in a relatively long period of time. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6328], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Tae-Gyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tae-Gyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Konstadinos G Goulias", "Martin T Pietrucha", "Ageliki Elefteriadou", "William L Harkness"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Konstadinos G Goulias, Committee Chair", "Martin T Pietrucha, Committee Member", "Ageliki Elefteriadou, Committee Member", "William L Harkness, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ICT", "Transportation", "Activity and Travel Behavior", "Panel Analysis", "Multilevel Modeling", "Structural Equation Modeling", "Latent Class Cluster  Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Quality Management: Technical efficiency, benchmarking, and contracts", "id": "6026", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6327", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-09-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Because production processes typically generate quantity flows and quality flows simultaneously, the management of quality flows is potentially as important as the management of quantity flows in the improvement of the performance of firms.  Specially, quality is also important in the supply chain in that the quality of products produced by suppliers is one of the most important determinants of the quality of products produced by procurers.  If this quality is perfectly observable in market, it will be priced and demanded optimally in the market.  Procurers can obtain the quality that they want and suppliers must produce quality in a technically efficient manner.  However, quality may be imperfectly observable to suppliers and procurers in the market. In this case, the quality market fails to price quality and there exist only low quality products in the market.  As a result, procurers cannot obtain the quality that they want and persistent technical inefficiency exists in the quality production of suppliers.   \t\n\n\nThe objective of this dissertation is to examine the estimation and the improvement of technical efficiency generated from the imperfect observability of quality and the management of quality produced by suppliers in supply chain.  To do so, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), benchmarking, and contracting are used as base methodologies.  \n\n\nThe first essay suggests a new estimation approach for technical efficiency based on DEA when controllable categorical factors are involved in the firm\u00a1\u00afs production process.  The new approach can estimate the efficient category level of controllable categorical factors. The second essay examines how firms can improve their technical efficiency by their own effort.  New peergrouping approach and new benchmarking approach are developed to help technically inefficient firms improve their technical efficiency based on recent advances in DEA-based benchmarking.  The third essay develops a contract model to coordinate the quality flow in supply chain and technical efficiency of suppliers under both symmetric and asymmetric information.  Using a simulation method, it is illustrated how the incentives under contract work to manage quality flows and technical efficiency.  The simulation results illustrate that incentives under contract can improve the performance of both procurers and suppliers.      \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6327], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Taeho ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Taeho", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert D Weaver", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "David Christy", "Jeffrey Stokes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert D Weaver, Committee Chair", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Member", "David Christy, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Stokes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["contracts", "benchmarking", "categorical factors", "Technical efficiency"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "An Investigation on the Importance of Design form and Function: Market Success and Consumer Preference\n\n", "id": "10044", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6357", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of product design is to obtain maximum functionality and aesthetic beauty at a minimum cost.

A conceptual research framework derived from a review of relevant literature resulted in four research questions, which were examined through a statistical analysis of survey data from 473 sample corporations included in the Human Capital Corporate Panel (HCCP) 2009 data set (a data set collected and shared for research purposes in Korea). The research variables included two independent variables\u2014employee development interventions (consisting of education funding programs, learning community program, and learning mileage program) and career development interventions (consisting of succession planning, career development planning, mentoring and coaching, and job rotation program); one mediating variable\u2014organization-level human capital (consisting of employees\u2019 job capability, productivity, motivation, and retention); and two dependent variables\u2014process competency (consisting of new product and service development, work process effectiveness, and product and service competitive advantage through cost reduction) and customer competency (consisting of prompt response to customer needs, product and service variety, new customer acquisition, loyal customer retention, and brand image). Statistical strategies included measurement testing through the factor analysis and reliability test, examination of the research questions with regard to predicting and mediating relationships between variables through the multiple regression analysis, and supplemental testing of the Sobel test and effect size comparison. Results indicated that, controlling for the mediating variable, no statistically significant relationship was established between the two independent and two dependent variables, at the significance level of .05 (\u03b2 = .04, t = .88, p > .05; \u03b2 = .08, t = 1.55, p > .05; \u03b2 = .05, t = .95, p > .05; \u03b2 = .05, t = .91, p > .05).

Although social backgrounds affect comparatively different college experiences, few if any studies exist that explore how social background relates differently within the college-going population.  Thus the study\u2019s second purpose was to explore how social background affects different higher education enrollment trajectories.  The study used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) to test the research questions.  The outcome variable was credits earned, which reflected the cumulative percentage of credits earned toward a BA degree by a respondent in a given year.  The outcome variable was rearranged by both age and high school graduation year.  This study applied growth mixture modeling (GMM) to explore the variability in the data concerning credits earned.  In this way, discrete growth trajectories (classes) were identified, and predictors of membership in those classes were gauged.  As a result of GMM analysis, the findings indicate that a quadratic 4-class model based on the high school graduation timing variable, which included traditional and non-traditional trajectories of credits earned, best explained variations in enrollment patterns in higher education in the present sample.  This study also investigated whether the credits-earned trajectories within higher education could be differentiated in terms of academic, social, cultural, or economic background factors.  The results support the contention that historically disadvantaged students are likely to follow nontraditional college enrollment patterns compared to their advantaged counterparts.  Therefore, while existing research has focused on the significant influence of academic, social, cultural, and economic background, this study provides evidence that students follow notably different credits-earned patterns once they have entered the higher education system.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11980], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Won ho ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Won ho", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Liang Zhang", "Liang Zhang", "John Jesse Cheslock", "Dorothy H Evensen", "Michael John Cleveland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Liang Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Liang Zhang, Committee Chair", "John Jesse Cheslock, Committee Member", "Dorothy H Evensen, Committee Member", "Michael John Cleveland, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Enrollment Patterns in Higher Education", "Growth Mixture Modeling", "Academic Background", "Cultural Background", "Social Background", "Economic Background"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Framework for Set-based Manufacturing Analysis and Visual Feedback", "id": "23767", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10893", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Design changes and subsequent verifications happen frequently during the development stages for a complex product.

This research introduces a framework that shortens or reduces these iterative loops by letting designers perform manufacturing feasibility checks on multiple manufacturing processes at the early design stage. If feedback information for manufacturability of a design can be delivered to designers in a timely manner, then it can significantly reduce the entire product development cycle. \nA set-based manufacturing analysis and feedback framework is proposed to provide early, fast, and informative visual feedback on manufacturability to designers for a complex product for multiple manufacturing processes. Instead of applying automatic reasoning algorithms, questions regarding part geometry are asked directly of designers. Using the obtained geometric information, the framework analyzes manufacturability in terms of part geometry with respect to a given set of process capabilities based on Design for Manufacturing (DFM) guidelines. To minimize the number of questions, a method that derives process decision blocks for manufacturing process families is proposed. A manufacturing process family is a set of processes that share the same geometric parameters among related DFM guidelines. The process decision block is then refined either heuristically using statistical data from a product domain or analytically based on geometric connections between parameters in the decision block. Using the process decision block, infeasible manufacturing processes are quickly screened out for subsequent analysis. Moreover, the proposed framework provides efficient and dynamic visual feedback for geometric advice at the feature level for each selected manufacturing process. Through dynamic visual feedback generation, designers can quickly search for design alternatives while maintaining manufacturability.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10484], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Wonmo ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wonmo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson", "Timothy William Simpson", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Sanjay B Joshi", "Christopher J Saldana", "Mary I Frecker", "Daniel Antion Finke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson, Dissertation Advisor", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Chair", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Member", "Sanjay B Joshi, Committee Member", "Christopher J Saldana, Committee Member", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Member", "Daniel Antion Finke, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["manufacturing analysis", "design for manufacturing", "visual manufacturing feedback", "set-based approach"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A study on compensation strategies and their effects on corporations in a global context", "id": "14479", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7351", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "   These days, as corporations are seeking global opportunities in this global society, how to motivate employees from different cultures, who have different values, needs, and norms, is becoming increasingly important.

The present study presents development of simplified numerical modeling methodologies, development of nominal IAB response prediction models through an extensive parametric study, and establishment of IAB response statistics using Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, new load combinations in a load and resistance factor design (LRFD) format have been developed using reliability analyses.\nFor a robust, long-term simulation and numerical probabilistic study, a simplified numerical modeling methodology has been developed based on field monitoring results of four IABs. The numerical model includes temperature variation, temperature gradient, time-dependent loads, soil-structure interaction, and plastic behavior of the backwall/abutment construction joint. The four field tested IABs were modeled to validate the methodology. The proposed numerical model provides accurate, long-term prediction of IAB behavior and response.\nIAB response prediction models have been developed using a parametric study. Current design specifications and guides do not provide clearly defined analysis methods, therefore, there is a need for easily implemented preliminary analysis methods. Based on the calibrated, nonlinear, 2D numerical modeling methodology, a parametric study of 243 cases was performed to obtain 75-year bridge response. The parametric study considered five parameters: (1) thermal expansion coefficient; (2) bridge length; (3) backfill height; (4) backfill stiffness; and (5) pile soil stiffness. The parametric study revealed that the thermal expansion coefficient, bridge length and pile soil stiffness significantly influence IAB response as measured by: (1) bridge axial force; (2) bridge bending moment at mid-span of the exterior span; (3) bridge bending moment at the abutment; (4) pile lateral force at pile head; (5) pile moment at pile head; (6) pile head/abutment displacement; and (7) abutment displacement at the centroid of a superstructure. The influence of backfill height and backfill stiffness are not significant relatively. The study results provide practical, preliminary estimates of bridge response and ranges for preliminary IAB design and analysis.\nIn order to establish IAB response statistics, Monte Carlo simulation has been performed based on the 2D numerical modeling methodology. Based on the established thermal load and resistance variable statistics, this study developed probabilistic numerical models and established IAB response statistics. Considered input variables to deal with uncertainties are resistance and load variables. IAB response statistics were established: (1) bridge axial force; (2) bridge bending moment; (3) pile lateral force; (4) pile moment; (5) pile head/abutment displacement; (6) compressive stress at the top fiber at the mid-span of the exterior span; and (7) tensile stress at the bottom fiber at the mid-span of the exterior span.

Commercial buildings account for nearly 18% of the national energy consumption of the United States, which produces approximately 12% of the annual global greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, there is a pressing need to evaluate and understand the energy performances of commercial buildings during design and operation phases in an effort to increase their energy efficiency and conservation. However, some buildings fail to perform as their designers intended, in part because users do not or cannot properly operate the buildings or behave differently than designers expect. Therefore, a relationship between the occupancy patterns and building energy consumption is important. Prior studies have shown that occupant behavior, occupancy rate and occupancy presence/absence have a direct effect on building energy consumption. These studies revealed the importance of occupancy patterns not only for actual building energy consumption, but also for the accuracy of building energy simulations to predict the building energy consumption. However, it is hard to normalize the occupancy patterns to use as an input parameter for energy simulations. \nThe main objective of this dissertation research is to improve the accuracy of the building energy simulations by accounting for occupancy patterns from data available in actual buildings. This objective resulted in a methodology based on metered electric data to derive occupancy schedules for input into building energy simulations. The development of this methodology was divided into three steps. First, this study quantified the effect of occupancy rates on the electricity consumption in office and campus buildings. Second, this study developed and validated a methodology to derive occupancy schedules from sub-metered electricity consumption for input into energy simulations. Third, this study examined the energy simulation accuracy with occupancy schedules derived from filtered hourly electricity consumption, when sub-metering is not available. \nTo develop and demonstrate the methodology, this study used three buildings in Pennsylvania, USA, including Building 101 at Navy Yard in Philadelphia, as well as Forest Resources and Borland Buildings at the Penn State campus in State College. For these buildings, the study analyzed the occupancy rates and electricity consumption data. The correlation coefficients between the total electricity consumption and number of occupants was significant for the three studied buildings (R2\uf0bb40%-70%). In the case study for Building 101, the plug-load consumption is more directly related to the occupancy rate (R2\uf0bb70%-80%) when compared to the relationship between the total electricity consumption and the occupancy rates (R2\uf0bb40%~60%). Nevertheless, typical buildings do not have detailed plug-load consumption data because of the costs associated with the instrumentation as well as the data collection and analysis. For buildings without sub-metering instrumentation, such as Forest Resources and Borland Buildings, this study found that the occupancy rates are significantly correlated to the fluctuations in the total energy consumption (R2\uf0bb70%). Therefore, for the studied commercial buildings, the electricity consumption can be used to derive occupancy patterns for input into energy simulations.\nThis study proposed a methodology to derive the occupancy schedules from the hourly electricity consumption data for input into building energy simulations. Most importantly, with these occupancy schedules, building energy simulations were successfully calibrated because when the simulation results are compared to the actual energy consumption, they satisfied the stringent accuracy requirements by the ASHARE Guideline 14 (CVRMSE < 15% for daily data). \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10338], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Yang-seon ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yang-seon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric", "Hosam Kadry Fathy", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric, Dissertation Advisor", "Hosam Kadry Fathy, Committee Chair", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["building energy", "occupancy", "plug-load", "building energy calibration", "building energy simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Measuring the value of succession planning and managemenet:a qualitative study of U.S. affiliates of foreign multinational companies\n", "id": "6930", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6769", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purposed of this study was to offer a framework for placing value on succession planning and management in a business organization and to investigate the unique features of succession planning and management in foreign-owned companies in the U.S., especially U.S. affiliates of Asian-based multinational corporations.

The effectiveness of organization\u2019s strategies and marketing often depends on how the organization responds to its competitors\u2019 strategic movements (e.g., Day & Reibstein, 1997; Reibstein & Wittink, 2005). Therefore, it is critical for an organization to take competitors into account in developing strategic plans. \nThe hospitality pricing literature has been largely focused on customer-based pricing, where room price was based on customer segmentation strategy (i.e., yield management). Hotel pricing research, however, has not paid close attention to the direct effects of competitors\u2019 pricing on hotel manager\u2019s pricing decisions. This study fills the gap in the hospitality pricing literature by diagnosing the influence of competitors on hotels\u2019 strategic pricing behavior. \nMany studies regarding the competitive interactions among firms in price and advertising have been done at the corporate (or brand) level. In spite of the increasing competition and the importance of competitor effects on strategies and performance of local hotels, empirical research regarding the issue is limited.

Specifically, hotel\u2019s room rates were more likely to be influenced by rate changes of competing hotels that were similar in market segment, had a strong market position and a credible commitment to the changes. Local hotel managers were likely to match rate decreases of their rivals that were similar in market segment and had a strong market position. In the case of the rivals\u2019 rate increases, the managers tended to follow the increases when the rate increasing rivals were similar in market segment and had a stronger market position and a credible commitment to the increases.

The managers surpassed their rivals\u2019 rate changes only when certain conditions were met. A greater similarity in market segment between focal and rival hotels, strong brand power of rivals, and higher market demand were the conditions for outdoing rivals\u2019 rate increases, while a greater similarity in market segment, strong brand power of rivals, and their own hotels\u2019 cost leadership strategy were for conditions outdoing rivals\u2019 rate decreases.\nThis study offers substantial contributions to the hospitality strategy and pricing literature and the competitive dynamics literature by examining the influences of specific characteristics of competitors on strategic pricing decisions of an organization (i.e., a local hotel). The findings of this study should assist hotel managers in developing more effective pricing strategies. This study also provided several recommendations for future studies regarding competitive pricing strategies in the lodging industry. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6914], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, YongHee ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "YongHee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John O'neill", "Anna S Mattila", "Amit Sharma", "Donald C Hambrick", "John W.

Our investigation explores the psychological significance of virtual-world avatars on real-world outcomes. In particular, it explores the role played by avatar customization on users\u2019 self-preservation behaviors. \nParticipants (N = 95) in a between-subjects experiment were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: a desired avatar condition in which users were directed to customize their avatars to reflect their ideal, desired selves; and an actual avatar condition in which users were directed to customize their avatars to be resemble their actual selves; an assigned attractive avatar condition in which the user was assigned an attractive avatar by the system; and an assigned unattractive avatar condition. The first two conditions were used to test propositions derived from the agency model of customization whereas the latter two were inspired by behavior confirmation theory. Behavior confirmation theory predicts that avatar users\u2019 behaviors would be influenced by others\u2019 expectations raised by the physical appearance of the avatar. Therefore, an attractive avatar would motivate users to undertake behaviors that would help them keep up this appearance in real life.  On the other hand, the agency model of customization would argue that it is not the attractiveness of the avatar\u2019s appearance but the sense of agency arising from the active construction of one\u2019s avatar that would motivate self-preserving behaviors. Therefore, this study attempts to reveal the key factors driving a user\u2019s self-preservation motivations by testing these two competing theories to predict the user\u2019s behavior pursuant to avatar use.\nThis study yielded a significant effect for avatar customization on motivations for self-preservation. Participants who customized their avatars indicated that they would spend a significantly higher percentage of their time maintaining good health, compared to participants who were assigned avatars. Furthermore, this effect was mediated by sense of agency. This study also found that customizing one\u2019s avatar to resemble a desired ideal self promotes visualization of his/her ideal body, which is positively related to prevention-focused sense of self-preservation. We also found that customizing one\u2019s avatar to resemble one\u2019s actual self increases perceived risk, which is negatively related to promotion-focused sense of self-preservation due to reductions in self-efficacy. Overall, the findings support the agency model of customization over behavior confirmation theory. \nThe key contribution of this study is the demonstration that psychological benefits obtained from avatar customization can be leveraged for promoting users\u2019 wellness. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed, followed by an outline of the study\u2019s limitations and directions for future research. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6769], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Youjeong ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Youjeong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["S.

Both types of plasticity are mediated by the mushroom body (MB) neurons in the brain, in which various signaling molecules play crucial roles. However, important yet unresolved molecules are the receptors that initiate aversive or reward learning cascades in the MB. \nThe dDA1 represents one of the Drosophila dopamine receptors that activate the cAMP cascade. To gain insights into the role of dDA1, we generated a polyclonal antibody against the unique sequence in dDA1 and investigated dDA1 distribution in the central nervous system (CNS) of Drosophila melanogaster. In both larval and adult CNS pronounced dDA1 immunoreactivity was present in the neuropil of the mushroom bodies, a brain structure crucial for learning and memory in insects, and four unpaired neurons in each thoracic segment. The adult CNS also exhibited intense dDA1 immunoreactivity in the central complex, a structure controlling higher-order motor function, moderate expression in several neurosecretory cells, and weak staining in two unpaired neurons in the mesothoracic neuromere. The dDA1 expression in these areas was only detected in the adult, but not in the third instars larval CNS.\nGiven the findings that dDA1 and the octopamine receptor OAMB are highly expressed in the MB and use cAMP as a cellular signaling prompt us to test the roles of these receptors in associative learning using two classical conditioning paradigms: negatively and positively reinforced olfactory conditioning. Negatively reinforced olfactory conditioning has been well-characterized and flies show robust and reliable performance; however, olfactory conditioning utilizing positive reinforcement has shown to be less effective in that flies display low learning performance with highly variable scores. Therefore, we developed a novel assay for positively reinforced (appetitive) olfactory conditioning. In this assay, flies were involuntarily exposed to appetitive unconditioned stimulus sucrose along with conditioned stimulus odor during training and their preference to the odor previously associated with sucrose was measured to assess learning and memory capacities. After one training session, wild-type Canton S flies displayed reliable performance, which was enhanced after two training cycles with 1 or 15 min inter-training intervals. Higher performance scores were also obtained by increasing sucrose concentration. Memory in Canton-S flies decayed slowly when measured at 30 min, 1 h and 3 h after training, whereas memory had declined significantly at 6 h and 12 h post-training. When the octopamine-deficient t\u00a5\u00e2h flies was challenged, they exhibited poor performance, validating the utility of this assay. As the Drosophila model offers vast genetic and transgenic resources, the new appetitive conditioning described here provides a useful tool for elucidating the molecular and cellular underpinnings of reward learning and memory. Similar to negatively reinforced conditioning, this reward conditioning represents classical olfactory conditioning. Thus, comparative analyses of learning and memory mutants in two assays may help dissect molecular and cellular components common or discrete to US information used in conditioning. \n\nWith the new appetitive conditioning along with negatively reinforced (aversive) conditioning paradigms, we tested the roles of dDA1 and OAMB in both aversive and appetitive conditioning. We first identified two mutants dumb1 and dumb2 with abnormal dDA1 expression. When trained with the same conditioned stimuli, both dumb alleles showed negligible learning in electric shock-mediated conditioning while they exhibited moderately impaired learning in sugar-mediated conditioning. These phenotypes were not due to anomalous sensory modalities of dumb mutants because their olfactory acuity, shock reactivity, and sugar preference were comparable to those of control lines. Remarkably, the dumb mutant\u00a1\u00afs impaired performance in both paradigms was fully rescued by reinstating dDA1 expression in the same subset of MB neurons, indicating the critical roles of the MB dDA1 in aversive as well as reward learning. Previous studies employing dopamine receptor antagonists implicate the involvement of D1/D5 receptors in various Pavlovian conditioning tasks in mammals; however, these have not been supported by the studies of D1- or D5-deficient animals. Our observations unambiguously clarify the critical roles of D1 dopamine receptor in aversive and appetitive learning.\n\nIn contrast to dDA1, OAMB is the receptor that mediates appetitive, but not aversive, learning in Pavlovian olfactory conditioning. When trained with the same conditioned stimuli, oamb mutants showed severely impaired learning in sugar-mediated conditioning while they exhibited normal learning in electric shock-mediated conditioning. This learning defect was not caused by abnormal sensory processing of oamb mutants because their olfactory acuity and sugar preference were not affected. The oamb mutant\u00a1\u00afs impaired performance in reward learning was fully rescued by restoring OAMB in the subset of the MB neurons that require dDA1 for normal appetitive learning, indicating the critical role of OAMB in the MB for appetitive learning. Thus, aversive and appetitive olfactory learning are likely mediated by the same subset of the MB neurons and dDA1 and OAMB together mediate reward memory formation.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6841], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Youngcho ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Youngcho", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kyung An Han", "Bernhard Luscher", "Byron C Jones", "Pamela J Mitchell", "Richard W Ordway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kyung An Han, Committee Chair", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Member", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member", "Pamela J Mitchell, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Octopamine receptor", "Dopamine receptor", "Aversive conditioning", "Reward conditioning", "Associative learning", "Drosophila", "Classical Olfactory conditioning"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Cultivating Reflective Thinking: The Effects of a Reflective Thinking Tool on Learners' Learning Performance and Metacognitive Awareness\nin the Context of On-line Learning\n\n\n\n", "id": "6764", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6725", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of the study was to explore the effects of using a reflective thinking tool designed to prompt students to think reflectively about their learning goals, motivation, understanding, learning strategies, and interaction with peers and instructors on students\u00a1\u00af learning performance and metacognitive awareness in an on-line learning context. Specially, this study investigated 1) if the use of a reflective thinking tool was effective in enhancing students\u00a1\u00af learning performance and metacognitive awareness, 2) if there was any difference in learning performance and metacognitive awareness by level of students\u00a1\u00af reflective thinking, and 3) how the students perceived the reflective thinking tool in its use for their learning.\nTwo research studies were conducted. Study 1 used a cohort research design in an agricultural business management course in a land-grant university in the northeastern United States. Thirty seven college students who received the treatment, an on-line reflective thinking tool, for two weeks in a course of the 2003 Fall semester were compared with a cohort group of 50 students who did not receive the treatment in the previous semester. Also, the learning performance and pre and post metacognitive awareness of the 37 participants in the treatment group was analyzed by level of reflective thinking.  \nStudy 2 was carried out with college students in a statistics course that provided both a classroom-based and an on-line learning environment. Students in the treatment group (N=84) used a reflective thinking tool during the two-week study, whereas students in the control group (N=73) only wrote an essay about what they learned without the help of the reflection tool. The two groups were compared in terms of their learning performance. Also, students\u00a1\u00af performance and metacognitive awareness in the treatment group were compared with respect to the level of their reflective thinking. \nThe results of study 1 and 2 showed a significant difference in problem solving performance between those who used an online reflective tool and those in the control group who did not. However, there was no significant difference between the treatment and the control group on comprehension. These findings indicate that the reflective thinking activity may be effective for problem solving, but not for comprehension. \nFrom the analysis of learning performance by level of students\u00a1\u00af reflective thinking, the results from study 1 and 2 do not support the hypothesis that students who have a higher level of reflective thinking will perform better than those who have a lower level of reflective thinking on their learning performance because of inconsistent results between the two studies. Both study 1 and 2 showed that students\u00a1\u00af metacognitive awareness was significantly enhanced by the activity of reflective thinking. \nFinally, the results of this study indicate that students who have a higher level of reflective thinking show a higher regulation of cognition. However, the relationship between reflective thinking and the component of knowledge about cognition was not significant. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6720], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Younghoon ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Younghoon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara L Grabowski", "Kyle Leonard Peck", "Francis M Dwyer Jr.", "Rayne Audrey Sperling"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara L Grabowski, Committee Chair", "Kyle Leonard Peck, Committee Member", "Francis M Dwyer Jr., Committee Member", "Rayne Audrey Sperling, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Learning tool", "Reflective thinking", "Metacognition"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DESIGN CHALLENGES ON ENTERPRISE-SCALE STORAGE\nSYSTEMS EMPLOYING HARD DRIVES AND NAND FLASH\nBASED SOLID-STATE DRIVES\n\n", "id": "10128", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6916", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Flash memory overcomes some key shortcomings of hard disk drives (HDDs), including faster access to non-sequential data and lower power consumption. Economic forces, driven by the desire to introduce flash into the enterprise market without changing existing software based, have resulted in the emergence of solid state drives (SSDs), flash packaged in HDD from factors and capable of working with device drivers and I/O buses designed for HDDs. Unlike the use of DRAM for caching or buffering, however, certain idiosyncrasies of SSDs make their integration into HDD-based systems non-trivial. Flash memory suffers from limits on its reliability, in an order of magnitude more expensive than the disk, and can be sometimes even slower than the HDD (due to excessive GC induced by high intensity of random writes). Given the complementary properties of HDDs and SDDs in terms of cost, performance, and lifetime, the current consensus among several storage experts is to view SSDs not as a replacement for HDD but rather as a complementary device within the storage hierarchy.\n\nIn my dissertation, I designed and evaluated such a hybrid system called HybridStore to provide (a) improved capacity planning techniques to administrators with the overall goal of operating within cost-budgets and (b) improved performance/lifetime guarantees during episodes of deviations from expected workloads through several novel mechanisms such as fragmentation busting and write regulation. As an illustrative example of HybridStore\u2019s efficacy, a combination of 1 SSD and 6 low-speed, cheaper and higher capacity HDDs is recommended the most cost-effective storage configuration in HybridStore for a predominantly random-write dominant I/O trace from an OLTP application running at a large financial institution. Also, HybridStore employing HDD with small SSD is able to reduce the average response time for Financial trace by about 71% as compared to a HDD-based system.\n\nIn addition to HybridStore project, I developed a novel design technique of the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) in the SSD. It provides improved performance, reduced garbage collection overhead, and better overloaded behavior compared to state-of- the art FTL schemes. For example, the Financial trace shows a 78% improvement in average response time (due to a 3-fold reduction in operations of the garbage collector), compared to a state-of-the-art FTL scheme. Finally, I also developed and validated flash simulation framework call FlashSim. While a number of well-regarded simulation environments exist for HDDs, the same is not yet true for SSDs. This is due to SSDs having been in the storage market for relatively less time as well as the lack of information (hardware configuration and software methods) about state-of-the-art SSDs that is publicly available. FlashSim aimed at filling this void in performance evaluation of emerging storage systems that employ SSDs.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6913], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Youngjae ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Youngjae", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Anand Sivasubramaniam And Dr Bhuvan Urgaonkar", "Anand Sivasubramaniam", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar", "Prasenjit Mitra", "Qian Wang", "Raj Acharya"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Anand Sivasubramaniam And Dr Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Dissertation Advisor", "Anand Sivasubramaniam, Committee Chair", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Committee Chair", "Prasenjit Mitra, Committee Member", "Qian Wang, Committee Member", "Raj Acharya, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Storage Systems", "Flash Memory"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PERSONAL AND CULTURAL INTRICACY IN ART HISTORY CLASSROOMS\n", "id": "11184", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4502", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The field of art history in the United States, as well as the teaching of the subject in American universities, rapidly developed during and after World War II, with immigrating scholars from Europe as the catalyst for the discipline.

Growing concerns about future generations in Korea have also intertwined with this marriage-labor immigration phenomenon, which includes social problems associated with low birth rates of native-born Koreans (Suzuki, 2003) and pressures to cultivate a citizenry that can compete successfully in today\u2019s global marketplace (Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development, 2006).

This dissertation focuses on characterizing the biogeochemical processes that solubilize and sequester copper (Cu) in environments impacted by AMD. \nCopper isotope measurements are a novel approach to characterizing Cu mobility. A review of published Cu isotope data (Chapter 2) show that, on average, Cu(I)-sulfides and secondary Cu(I)/(II) minerals are depleted in 65Cu (based on 65Cu/63Cu) relative to AMD-impacted streamwater, seawater, and large rivers. Based on published experiments, including those described in this dissertation, aqueous Cu(II) is enriched in 65Cu relative to aqueous and solid Cu(I) phases (Chapter 2). Enrichment of aqueous Cu in 65Cu relative to Cu-bearing minerals is best explained by a redox isotope effect, whereby isotopically heavy Cu(I) in sulfide minerals preferentially oxidizes to Cu(II), which is then released to solution. Experiments also show that Cu isotope fractionation (up to 4\u2030) due to a redox isotope effect can be overprinted by additional isotope effects that are related to mineralogy, kinetics, ligand complexation, and biological processes, which, in combination, may account for the large variation of Cu isotope composition (&#916;65Cu = 12\u2030) in environmental samples.\nChalcopyrite is the most abundant Cu-bearing mineral on earth, and most commonly occurs in hydrothermal sulfide deposits. Under oxic conditions, dissolution of chalcopyrite releases dissolved Cu and Fe and acidifies surrounding solutions. Understanding how this and other sulfide minerals dissolve is important for abating anthropogenic release of metals in association with mining activies. In Chapter 3, chalcopyrite dissolution kinetics are synthesized and analyzed in order to derive empirical chalcopyrite dissolution rate laws. Using multiple linear regression analysis, we determine a rate law for nonoxidative chalcopyrite dissolution and for oxidation of chalcopyrite by Fe(III). \nChapter 4 is a survey of Cu isotope compositions in primary chalcopyrite and enargite and leached Cu in an AMD-impacted area in southwestern Colorado, USA. To aid our interpretation of Cu isotope fractionation measured among field samples, we also conducted chalcopyrite and enargite leach experiments in the absence and presence of the Proteobacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. When bacteria are present, leached Cu is isotopically lighter than chalcopyrite (&#8710;aq- mino = -0.57 \u00b1 0.14\u2030, where mino refers to the starting mineral), and isotopically identical to enargite (&#8710;aq- mino = 0.14 \u00b1 0.14\u2030). The biotic fractionation differences between chalcopyrite and enargite are likely due to differing mineralogy. Even though microorganisms are present at the field site, Cu isotope fractionation in the field resembles that in abiotic chalcopyrite leach experiments. In abiotic experiments, leached Cu was isotopically enriched in 65Cu relative to chalcopyrite (&#8710;aq- mino = 1.37 \u00b1 0.14\u2030) and enargite (&#8710;aq- mino = 0.98 \u00b1 0.14\u2030). Mass balance calculations support the likelihood that partitioning of isotopically heavy dissolved Cu into microbial-associated phases is less significant in the open field system compared to the closed laboratory experiments. Copper isotope measurements in abiotic experiments allow us to infer that heavy Cu is preferentially oxidized at the interface between the isotopically homogeneous mineral and a surface oxidized layer. The isotopically heavy oxidized Cu is then solubilized. The result is leached Cu that is isotopically heavier than the starting material during abiotic leaching. During biotic leaching, additional processes likely affect the Cu isotope composition of leached Cu. \nBased on the hypothesis that interaction of isotopically heavy dissolved Cu with A. ferrooxidans cells caused part of the biotic fractionation measured in sulfide leach experiments (Chapter 4), we characterized Cu association with cells and related precipitates using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence microscopy (&#956;-XRF), and micro-x-ray diffraction (&#956;-XRD). The results, described in Chapter 5, show that within cells, polyphosphate granules have the highest Cu concentration. The &#956;-XRF observations show that whole cells of A. ferrooxidans grown in 1 mM Cu may contain 0.11 \u00b1 0.01 to 6.19 \u00b1 0.28 fg Cu/cell. Outside of cells, Cu may co-precipitate with jarosite minerals (identified with &#956;-XRD) that form as a result of cell growth. Incorporation of isotopically heavy Cu into jarosite is consistent with equilibrium isotope fractionation theory and the observed bioleach fractionation measured (Chapter 4). Further work is warranted to determine whether isotopic, chemical, and structural characteristics of jarosite function as a biosignature of microbial Fe-oxidation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [669], "author_name_tesi": "Kimball, Bryn Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Kimball", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Bryn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley", "Susan Louise Brantley", "Jennifer Macalady", "Matthew Scott Fantle", "Brian Dempsey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Chair", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Chair", "Matthew Scott Fantle, Committee Member", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microscopy", "isotopes", "iron-oxidizing microorganisms", "acid mine drainage", "copper", "spectroscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Developing a model of theory-to-practice-to-theory in student affairs: An extended case analysis of theories of student learning and development\n", "id": "15353", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7552", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent literature suggests a problematic connection between theory and practice in higher education scholarship generally and the study of student learning and development specifically (e.g. Bensimon, 2007; Kezar, 2000; Love, 2012). Much of this disconnect stems from a lack of differentiation between various types of theory used in student affairs practice\u2014critical among them: formal, informal, and implicit theories. \n\nFormal theory is produced by scholars and, to the maximum extent possible, conforms to standard social science assumptions about knowledge production, generalizability, and predictiveness (Parker, 1977). Since formal theory will not always apply perfectly to practice, student affairs practitioners may choose not to adapt it for their own uses as they create a theory-in-use\u2014essentially a set of values, beliefs, and assumption that guide their practice (Argyris & Schon, 1974). \n\nThough there is some disagreement in the literature as to whether the use of formal theory is necessary (Evans & Guido, 2012; Love, 2012), most hold that the goal of higher education research is to influence practice through the production of relevant theory (Bensimon, 2007; Kezar, 2000). As a result, it is possible to distinguish between two different types of theory-in-use: implicit theory and informal theory. Implicit theories are a body of loosely considered values, beliefs, and assumptions that are not connected in any systematic way to relevant formal theories (Bensimon, 2007). In contrast, informal theories are based on formal theory but also include the understanding of context and relevant professional experience of student affairs practitioners (Parker, 1977). \n\nWhile determining the precise role of each of these types of theory is critical to theory-to-practice conversions (Reason & Kimball, forthcoming), no empirical work has yet examined the role that each plays in student affairs practitioners\u2019 conceptualizations of student learning and development. As such, this dissertation uses the extended case method (Burawoy, 1991; 1998; 2009) to examine the thinking of six academic advisors and three residence life professionals at a large public research university to address three linked research questions:\n1) How do practitioners understand student experience? \n2) What is the role of theory in that understanding? \n3) What is the connection between theory and practice? \nMajor findings reveal that the way that student affairs professionals think about learning and development are the unique products of the contexts in which they work. Effectively, these practitioners employ \u201cguiding concepts\u201d synthesized from formal theories as well as their own experiences in order to construct a flexible theory-in-use capable of useful application in a wide variety of situations within the environment in which they work. \n\nAdditional findings suggest that learning and development, despite recent attempts to synthesize them (Reason & Renn, 2008), remain independent-yet-related concepts in the minds of the students affairs professionals who participated in this study. Important findings related to student affairs work also include an acknowledgement of the critical roles of technostructure\u2014the systems, processes, and tools that enable a professional role to be constructed in a particular way\u2014and the larger social context play in practice. Finally, in order both to honor and benefit from the knowledge of student affairs professionals, this dissertation closes by proposing a model of theory-to-practice-to-theory based on the extended case method and designed to allow for a tighter coupling between formal and informal theory.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7487], "author_name_tesi": "Kimball, Ezekiel Wayne", "last_name_ssi": "Kimball", "middle_name_ssi": "Wayne", "first_name_ssi": "Ezekiel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kimberly Griffin", "Robert Reason", "Robert M Hendrickson", "Gerald K Letendre", "Alan M Sica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kimberly Griffin, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Reason, Special Member", "Robert M Hendrickson, Committee Member", "Gerald K Letendre, Committee Member", "Alan M Sica, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["student affairs practice", "student development", "student learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "BUILDING AN EMPIRE, DEFINING A NATION: \nTHE RHETORIC OF U.S. EXPANSION AT THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\n\n", "id": "12223", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6362", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States looked fundamentally different than it had just ten years before.

While the muscles crossing the knee joint have been widely accepted as having a role to play in knee pathology, muscles of the hip joint have also been associated with knee pathologies such as patellofemoral syndrome.  However, research is inconclusive as to whether these hip muscles lack strength, neuromuscular control, or both in subjects with patellofemoral syndrome.  Additional research is needed regarding the characteristics and properties of hip musculature in order to comprehensively understand this relationship.  This dissertation consisted of three studies designed to analyze the isometric moment-angle relationships of the hip abductors and hip extensors in healthy subjects as well as those with patellofemoral syndrome.  The moment-angle relationships were then analyzed in multiple facets: the peak joint moment at pre-determined positions throughout an arc of motion, the gradient of the aforementioned peak moments across the arc of motion, and the joint moment fluctuations at each hip position.\n\tIn the first study, measurements of peak isometric joint moments at various positions in hip abduction (-15\u00b0, 0\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 30\u00b0) and hip extension (-45\u00b0, -30\u00b0, -15\u00b0, 0\u00b0) were gathered and then analyzed to determine the moment angle relationship in normal healthy subjects.  The position of the knee was either in flexion or extension throughout the hip joint moment assessments.  Results showed a descending moment-angle curve for both hip abduction and hip extension.  These results demonstrate that joint strength decreases throughout hip abduction and hip extension.  These findings have implications for clinicians for prescribing exercises for this musculature.\nThe second study analyzed the peak hip joint moments of hip abduction and hip extension in individuals with current complaints of patellofemoral syndrome, and compared them with age and size matched control subjects.  The results demonstrated that individuals with patellofemoral syndrome had a decreased joint moment of hip extension with the knee flexed, but not with the knee extended.  This suggests a deficit of strength of the uniarticular gluteus maximus, or increased strength of the biarticular hamstring musculature, in subjects with patellofemoral syndrome.  Contrary to previous literature, there were no statistically significant differences in hip abductor strength between the two groups.\nThe third study examined joint moment fluctuations of subjects with patellofemoral syndrome and healthy controls, during maximal isometric moments produced during hip abduction and hip extension.  The fluctuations in joint moment data were quantified using statistical techniques (signal coefficient of variation) in addition to methods from statistical physics (e.g., signal complexity and signal fractal properties).  Results showed increased coefficient of variation, indicating greater signal noise and therefore poorer muscle control, of the hip extension moment with the knee flexed for the group of subjects with patellofemoral syndrome.  This suggests the weakness of the uniarticular musculature in subjects with patellofemoral syndrome is, at least in part, due to different neuromuscular control.  No differences were found in signal complexity between subjects with patellofemoral syndrome and healthy controls.\nThese studies demonstrated that subjects with patellofemoral syndrome were found to be deficient in strength and neuromuscular control for hip extension joint moment, especially when the knee was flexed. Therefore, the hip extensor musculature should be strengthened when rehabilitating individuals with patellofemoral syndrome.  The hip extensor muscle group should also be trained to facilitate neuromuscular control, such as controlled eccentric exercise and static isometric holds, at various joint angles of hip extension.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10105], "author_name_tesi": "Kindel, Curtis ", "last_name_ssi": "Kindel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Curtis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Henry Challis", "Jinger Gottschall", "Sayers John Miller Iii", "Andris Freivalds"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Henry Challis, Dissertation Advisor", "Jinger Gottschall, Committee Chair", "Sayers John Miller Iii, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Biomechanics", "hip", "patellofemoral-syndrome", "moment-angle relationship", "joint moment fluctuations"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Coming of Age in Rural America: The Educational and Occupational Outcomes of Rural Young Adults", "id": "10133", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2254", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many of the issues related to poverty in rural communities are unique to those communities, and do not mirror the issues associated with poverty in suburban and urban areas.

This inquiry into the underlying values for teaching through specific \u201cpraxis\u201d writings and curricula preparation can engage pre-service teachers in the examination of their teaching philosophy, their negotiation of cultural positioning, and their roles as cultural pedagogues. This dissertation examined the need to create pedagogical spaces to combine the use of technology, literary practices, and theoretical frameworks of cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957) to solve the dilemmas of cultural pedagogues. Thus, this study explored the cognitive awareness of teaching as a cultural activity with emancipatory consequences.  \n     This study that questions how and why the conceptualization of teaching multicultural education, including a review of the perspectives of scholars in the field of education, can indicate how literary practices are related to indicators of cognitive dissonance. Learning and teaching controversial subject content and a cultural context within multicultural education promotes \u201cresistance\u201d which needs to be examined further for the existence of the invisible undercurrents of cognitive, historical, and cultural dissonance(s). This perceived resistance and the \u2018officialized\u2019 conceptualization of theories of resistance have been indoctrinated into teacher preparation and practice through the ideology of the deficit model of education, resulting in the disempowerment of educators. Henry Giroux (2001) talks about \u201ctheories of resistance education,\u201d in which dissonance can be framed as \u201coppositional resistance.\u201d This \u2018official\u2019 view of education creates a suboptimal view of teaching framed with pedagogies of hopelessness, impossibility, and marginalization.  \n\tThe purpose of this research project was to explore a praxis teaching/research inquiry done with pre-service teachers at Penn State University. The teachers reflected on their own unique cultural stories and the history of their education when writing their individual statements of their teaching philosophy. The application of their lesson planning and their development as English pedagogues was enhanced through their participation in the National African American Read-In Day (AARI). Their experiences of teaching an MCE lesson and the reflections on their AARI teaching experiences became part of a methods course for pre-service teachers at Penn State during the Spring 2008 semester. The research project was a supplemental teaching project, with the goal of the students learning more about African American literature and teaching multicultural education. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how a culturally appropriate planned teaching module, when combined with a web-based e-curriculum, could serve as a planned cultural activity designed to emancipatory consequences in teacher preparation and practice. The project involved pre-service teachers enrolled in a Language and Literacy methods course LLED 411 titled Teaching Language Arts in Secondary Schools, which analyzed how classroom literacy events connect theory, practice, and identity. Using the AARI day, their lessons involved engaging multicultural texts through the use of curriculum development as an inquiry into these socially constructed practices. They connected theory and practice, concluding with their teacher reflections about how \u201cteaching as cultural workers\u201d engages critical reflection on the \u2018official\u2019 representations of teachers\u2019 racial and cultural identities, relationships, and values in traditional teacher education practices.  \n     In the Spring 2008 semester, a class of 13 pre-service teachers (2 males and 11 females) participated in this praxis project. They developed and taught lessons on African American literature for the local high school\u2019s AARI activities. This group of all White pre-service teachers taught these lessons to a predominately White high school population. In the next section I describe how to utilize theories of multicultural education and \u2018cultural pedagogy\u2019 to prompt pre-service teachers\u2019 analyses of how \u2018official\u2019 educational texts (e.g., standardized curricula and \u201ctraditional\u201d pedagogical styles) reflect the dominant racial and cultural identities of teachers. However, in this cultural exercise, the pre-service teachers were teaching African American literature, some context of which are deemed as \u201cunofficial\u201d educational texts (e.g., non-standardized curricula and \u201ccultural\u201d pedagogical styles) to a majority classroom and then reflecting upon their experiences as English educators and cultural pedagogues.  \n     This dissertation argues how student teachers\u2019 rethinking of traditional practices and their uses of critical pedagogy theory (Giroux, 1998) and emancipatory education (Freire, 1993) helped to transform their knowledge of literacies, identities, relationships, and values. Because the pedagogical goal of the project was to have the teachers engage in an inquiry into their cultural identity as the basis for connecting theory and practice, the knowledge of their own \u201ccultural\u201d and \u201csocietal\u201d identities were integral to this AARI cultural activity. Thus, what is important to note is that the 13 teachers and myself, the researcher, can be represented in several ways: 1) two males and nine females, 2) two students who did not attend the AARI activity with their groups, but still participated in the online activities and research activities, and 3) being instructed by an one African American graduate teaching assistant and researcher (myself). These aspects of identity were significant to this study and to their work as future educators who were almost exclusively White, middle class, female students seeking secondary English teacher certification in a large Midwestern public university.   \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1534], "author_name_tesi": "King, Donna Ruth", "last_name_ssi": "King", "middle_name_ssi": "Ruth", "first_name_ssi": "Donna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamie Myers", "Keith B Wilson", "Ladislaus M Semali", "David Mc Bride", "Dr Ron Jackson Ii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamie Myers, Committee Chair", "Keith B Wilson, Committee Member", "Ladislaus M Semali, Committee Member", "David Mc Bride, Committee Member", "Dr Ron Jackson Ii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cultural pedagogy", "cultural workers", "liberation", "multicultural education", "liberatory praxis", "historical dissonance"]}]
