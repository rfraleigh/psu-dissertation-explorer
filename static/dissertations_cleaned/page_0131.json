Ubiquitination controls a wide range of\ncellular events. Ubiquitin is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved in eukaryotes.\nUbiquitin can be appended as a monomer and also as an isopeptide-linked polymer via\nlysine 48 (K48) or lysine 63 (K63). Monoubiquitination is involved in biological\nprocesses such as endocytosis, DNA repair, and viral budding, while polyubiquitination\nmediates processes such as proteosomal degradation and signal transduction mechanisms,\nas K48 and K63-linked chains, respectively. Ubiquitination is reversible because of the\nexistence of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs); cysteine proteases that digest ubiquitin\nchains. One such DUB is the recently identified tumor suppressor, cylindromatosis\n(CYLD).\nCYLD was originally identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in patients\nwith benign head and neck tumors known as cylindromas. Cylindromas originate from\nhair follicles, usually in the head and neck region. Mutations associated with disease\noften occur in the C-terminal region, which usually encompass the DUB domain. CYLD\nis an important molecule in several signal transduction pathways, with the most\nprominent being the NF-kB activation pathway. As a DUB enzyme, CYLD\u2019s\ninvolvement in these signaling pathways has implications in cell survival, inflammation,\nlymphocyte activation, thymocyte development, as well as cell cycle progression.\nUbiquitination plays an important role in signal transduction pathways that are vital for\nefficient progression of spermatogenesis as well as mast cell development and function.\nIn this thesis, we explore the role of CYLD as a DUB enzyme in apoptosis-mediated germ cell development and male infertility, as well as the role of CYLD in mast cell\ndevelopment and activation via the FceRI. The major findings are summarized in the\nfollowing:\n\n1. Tumor suppressor CYLD is required for FceRI signaling in mast cells. Mast\ncells have an important role in the body\u2019s defense against bacteria and parasitic\ninfections, as well as mediating allergic responses. Mast cells develop under the influence\nof various cytokines with the most important being interleukin-3 (IL-3). Chapter II of this\nthesis, focuses on the role of CYLD in the negative regulation of IL-3-mediated mast cell\nsurvival and proliferation and the positive regulation of FceRI-mediated BMMC\ndegranulation and cytokine production. Activation of mast cells via the crosslinking of\nIgE on the FceRI culminates in the release of preformed inflammatory mediators such as\nserotonin and histamine, from granules, as well as the de novo synthesis and release of\ncytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -a and IL-6. The engagement of the\nFceRI elicits mast cell function through the activation of kinases, including proximal Src\nand Syk kinases and down stream MAP-kinases, as well as transcription factors such as\nNF-kB. Our findings suggest a critical role for CYLD in FceRI signaling. Although\nCYLD is dispensable for the development of bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs)\nin vitro, the CYLD knockout (CYLD-/-) mast cells are largely defective in FceRImediated\ncytokine induction and degranulation. These functional defects of CYLD-/-\nmast cells are associated with severe attenuation in the activation of receptor proximal\ntyrosine kinases and the transcription factor NF-kB. Thus, CYLD positively regulates\nmast cell function in a manner that is dependent on NF-kB.\n\n2. Regulation of early wave of germ cell apoptosis and spermatogenesis by\ndeubiquitinating enzyme CYLD. Chapter III focuses on the role of CYLD in the\nregulation of apoptotic mechanisms that are critical for spermatogenesis and male\nfertility. Spermatogenesis originates with the proliferation of the primordial male stem\ncell, spermatogonia, and its differentiation into spermatocytes. Spermatocytes undergo\nmeiosis to become haploid round and elongating spermatids which subsequently mature\ninto spermatozoa. Apoptotic cell death is an important mechanism that is believed to be\nimportant in the initial stages of germ cell development in order to establish a proper\nbalance between germ cells and supporting Sertoli cells required for spermatogenesis\nprogression. We demonstrate in this section that genetic deficiency of CYLD attenuates\nthe early germ cell apoptosis and causes impaired spermatogenesis in mice leading to\ninfertility. This loss of CYLD results in increased NF-kB activation with concomitant\naberrant expression of NF-kB dependent, anti-apoptotic target genes. We further\ndemonstrate that this phenomenon is dependent on the ability of CYLD to directly bind\nand deubiquitinate RIP1, an important positive regulator of the NF-kB pathway. These\nfindings establish CYLD as a pivotal DUB that regulates germ cell apoptosis and\nspermatogenesis and suggests an essential role for CYLD in controlling the RIP1/NF-kB\nsignaling axis in testis.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [319], "author_name_tesi": "Wright, Ato Obrumah", "last_name_ssi": "Wright", "middle_name_ssi": "Obrumah", "first_name_ssi": "Ato", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shao Cong Sun", "Todd Schell", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Neil David Christensen", "Diane M Thiboutot"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shao Cong Sun, Committee Chair", "Todd Schell, Committee Chair", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Diane M Thiboutot, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["deubiquitination", "K63", "DUB", "K48", "Mast cells", "FceRI", "BMMC", "degranulation", "cytokines", "type I allergy", "allergy", "IgE", "tyrosine kinases", "anaphylaxis", "spermatogenesis", "bcl-2", "male infertility", "germ cells", "TNF-alpha", "TRAF", "LOH", "loss of heterozygosity", "ubiquitination", "apoptosis", "cylindromatosis", "NF-kB", "CYLD", "RIP", "Receptor interacting protein", "caspase", "IKK"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Examining Concrete Properties Containing Recycled Glass Cullet as a 100% Fine Aggregate Replacement", "id": "14794", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7548", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over 600,000 tons of glass per year cannot be recycled into new glass.

This thesis investigates the use of glass cullet as a 100% fine aggregate replacement in Portland cement concrete (glasscrete) systems. \n\nWashed glass sand was produced in order to achieve a fineness modulus similar to natural sand for use in concrete. After mixture proportioning, the fresh and hardened properties of glasscrete were evaluated and compared to natural sand concrete on a basis of similar compressive strength or similar water-to-cementitious material ratio (w/cm). The objective was to create empirical data that would provide material engineers and suppliers design specifications on the proper methods of proportioning glasscrete mixtures. In order to mitigate the deleterious alkali-silica reaction resulting from the use of silica glass as a fine aggregate, a class F fly ash was used to replace 20% of cement by weight. \n\nFresh property testing showed that glasscrete has better workability than natural sand concrete. Hardened property testing showed that glasscrete needs a lower w/cm to reach similar design strengths. At similar strengths, glasscrete has an earlier initial and final set time, lower coefficient of thermal expansion, greater abrasion resistance, greater resistance to ion penetration, and lower water sorptivity. At similar w/cm, glasscrete has a lower linear coefficient of thermal expansion, greater resistance to chloride ion penetration than natural sand concrete, and a lower water sorptivity than natural sand concrete. However, glascrete is less abrasion resistant at the same w/cm.\n\nThis study concludes that glasscretes have adequate workability and can sustain loads necessary for field applications.

One method employed to reduce the amount of energy input needed for such reactions is to use the photothermal effect in nanoparticles (NPs) to heat the reactant molecules locally without heating the whole reaction mixture. Determining the amount of thermal energy produced by NPs is of concern in order to maximize the efficiency of such methods, but most approaches to date only indirectly report on this heat by monitoring the progress of the target reaction. \nI used photoacoustic (PA) analysis to measure the heat produced by NPs, specifically dodecanethiol-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and oleylamine-functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs). PA analytical techniques use microphones or vibration-sensitive piezoelectric detectors to acoustically measure the pressure front caused by the propagation of thermal energy away from an analyte. For such measurements, thermal energy is generated by the non-radiative (thermal) relaxation pathways in the analyte of interest.\nUsing a frequency-doubled pulsed Nd:YAG laser to irradiate the NPs, a piezoelectric detector mounted to a 1 cm pathlength cuvette, and a 1 GHz digital oscilloscope for signal processing, a simple, custom-built, and adaptable photoacoustic cell and measurement technique was developed to measure the acoustic pressure signal produced by nanoparticles. The dependence of the photoacoustic signal strength upon laser energy and nanoparticle concentration has been tested, revealing a linear dependence upon each within limits of optical density and laser energy. Preliminary efforts have been made to calculate the heat flux and temperature changes that produced the photoacoustic signal.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9277], "author_name_tesi": "Wrubel, Joshua Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Wrubel", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin James Lear", "David Lawrence Allara", "John B Asbury"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin James Lear, Thesis Advisor", "David Lawrence Allara, Thesis Advisor", "John B Asbury, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["chemistry", "analytical", "photoacoustic", "nanoparticles", "gold", "iron oxide", "laser", "TEM"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Supporting place sensemaking with multidimensional information representation on mobile devices", "id": "15322", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7539", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Knowing the living environments is an intrinsic part of human development for building self-confidence and meeting social requirements. Proliferation of mobile devices has greatly changed our interaction with the physical environments. The problem for existing mobile navigation tools is that it only emphasizes the spatial factor by offering step-by-step route directions, not helps us better understand the place. Such approach is inadequate in situations like moving to a new city where people need to build comprehensive awareness, rather than a one-shot solution to the problem. In this research, I propose a view to see navigation as a sensemaking process. I coined the term \u201cplace sensemaking\u201d to refer to the process of maintaining awareness and building comprehensive knowledge of the environment. Specifically, this work represents my effort in representing information that could transform our understanding of a physical space into a vivid place by taking advantage of mobile technology and online resources.\nTo interrogate this topic, this work practiced a holistic set of research methods: \nFirst, I applied works in sensemaking from information science in the context of physical navigation and proposed a place sensemaking framework. Based on the existing literature and my empirical work on spatial information representation, I have developed a theoretical framework that identifies the core components in making sense of a place, such as a person\u2019s ongoing spatial task, internal spatial mental model, and external environmental information, and emphasizes the role of interactive information visualization and exploration in mediating the relationships among the above components. \nSecond, based on this framework and empirical users\u2019 requirement analysis, I proposed design goals to support place sensemaking by providing not only spatial information, but also the social and temporal aspects of the place. \nThird, targeting the design goals, I designed and implemented a mobile application on the Android platform to facilitate place sensemaking by integrating multiple online resources, such as Facebook, Foursquare, Panoramio, and Wikipedia. \nFinally, results from a field evaluation with 18 participants in several weeks showed the benefits of our approach in support of comprehensive space exploration and elevation from space, a concept that focuses more on the objective and geographical properties of a physical environment, to place, a notion that embodies the physical features, individual spatial sense, and social aspects of the environment.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7476], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Anna ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Xiaolong Zhang", "Xiaolong Zhang", "John Millar Carroll", "John Yen", "Aleksandra B Slavkovic"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Xiaolong Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Xiaolong Zhang, Committee Chair", "John Millar Carroll, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Member", "Aleksandra B Slavkovic, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Human Computer Interaction", "Mobile application design", "Sense-making", "Location-based service"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CONTRASTING DIFFUSION PATTERNS FOR \nPC AND MOBILE VIDEOS: A USER-CENTRIC VIEW OF THE INFLUENCING FACTORS\n\n", "id": "10969", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "878", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As both computer and mobile phone reach nearly ubiquity in the U.S. market, the slow uptake of mobile video, in contrast to the thriving usage of PC-based video, warrants a deeper understanding of user-oriented factors contributing to the two diffusion paths. \n\nUnlike the majority of existing diffusion research practices, the dissertation examines the differences between mobile and PC video diffusion patterns through the lenses of user-oriented influences in the user-technology relationship. Built upon the established adoption user group classification, the research is informed by the Uses and Gratification theory, the Social Technical theory, and the Technical Affordance perspective. These synergistic theoretical arguments share the recognition of the role of user in the dynamic, usually socially intertwined user-technology interactions. The key research questions that the dissertation sets out to answer include: Does the importance of quality of viewing experience in adoption decision for PC video and mobile video differ significantly across the adoption groups? Do the adoption groups have different expected technology affordances or discover technology affordances different from expectation after experiencing the technology by mode of video? \n\nResults suggest PC video has significant advantages over mobile video in terms of a broad range of affordances \u2013 convenience, space and user-creativity related affordances. Particularly, higher level of affordance is expected and experienced toward PC video among Early Adopters/Early Majority, usually equivalent to the critical mass for any technology, signaling the need for a stronger push for relevant affordance for mobile video. \n\nThe research reports a strong, positive correlation between expectation and actual experience of technology affordance for both mobile and PC videos, which implies a phenomenon of \u201cexpect it, and you\u2019ll find it.\u201d There is also some evidence to show that this correlation is even stronger among later adoption groups, underscoring the paramount practice of building positive expectations for mobile video among the mass market in order to achieve critical mass for adoption. \n\nThe dissertation reveals how users acquire or identify affordances as related to mobile and PC videos in the adoption process. Trial and error is found to be the most frequently leveraged channel to discover affordance. Despite a few subtle differences across market and adoption groups, social exchanges and information seeking are also highly utilized channels for both video technologies. The user\u2019s reliance on the above channels together with the significant presence of false affordance, unexpected affordance and unusual affordance clearly illustrate the relational nature of technology affordance involving the user and the technological artifact. This understanding is needed for mobile video marketers to best align technology development, promotion and support efforts to catalyze the market acceptance of the technology. \n\nFurther delving into the formation of false and unexpected affordances, the research indicates some evidence that the cue-heuristic-affordance connection can be used to reduce dissonance in user experience, and hence facilitate user adoption. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [871], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Baixue  ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Baixue ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Karl Davis", "Dennis Karl Davis", "Richard Denny Taylor", "S.

Fundamental limitations of FSOC arise from the environment through which light propagates. This thesis addresses transmitted light signal dispersion (spatial and angular dispersion) and attenuation in FSOC operating in the scattering medium. Light signals transmitted through the scattering medium will interact with particles along the propagation path. Attenuation of light signals propagating through the medium is a combined effect of dispersion (spatial and angular) and absorption by particles. This thesis shows that the physical properties of the scattering medium play important roles in determining signal attenuation and dispersion of received light signals. A model based on ray tracing is developed to investigate light propagating through the medium. A computer simulation model of ray tracing is presented, as well. \nThis thesis investigates the correlation between spatial and angular dispersion of received light signals, which has significant effects on receiver design. Moreover, this thesis points out that scattering loss (loss caused by aerosol scattering) strongly depends on the receiver aperture size, field-of-view (FOV) and the position of the receiver relative to the optical axis of the transmitter. \nTwo categories of the scattering media are considered: clouds and battlefield particles. Cumulus cloud and fog oil (battlefield particles) are selected as the representatives of scattering media for the computer simulations. Since the scattering effects of cumulus cloud and fog oil particles are substantially different, different approaches of receiver designs are proposed.  A fog oil type of medium requires a sensitive receiver with a small FOV so that it can find the line-of-sight (LOS) photons and work with them, since only the LOS photons are meaningful to the FSOC system. For cumulus cloud, if a small value of optical thickness is concerned, a receiver with a small FOV is needed to find the LOS photons and work with them. However, a large value of optical thickness requires multiple receivers with a large FOV to capture the scattered energy and maintain the link availability. \nThis thesis develops a method of measuring the particle density of smoke. The particle density of smoke (man-make particles such as fog oil particles) is a key factor in the computer simulations. Different particle density may lead to different simulation results, which require rescaling of the simulation results. An experiment is then carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the method.   \nThe results in this thesis describe only specific scenarios for given types of scattering media and the physical size of the receiver.

Even though the router nodes may be well-protected, possible damage can still occur due to either natural (e.g., earthquake) or man-made (e.g., weapon of mass destruction (WMD) attack) disasters.  A high-survivability network will be able to provide continuous service between end-point nodes even in the presence of such disasters. When a path is not available, a network routing protocol reacts by finding an alternate path to overcome temporary failures. However, a reactive routing protocol can cause a significant delay to time critical communication applications (e.g., Voice over IP, live video-conference, stock market trading applications, or patient monitoring applications). Another possible solution to alleviate the consequence of node failures is to redundantly replicate data packets and proactively route the replicated packets through different disjointed routing paths. Though the solution improves the availability of the network, it adds significant amount of transfer overhead.\nIn this thesis, we are interested in dealing with situations in which a large number of network nodes/links located in a localized region may experience failure. A rare WMD attack or high intensity hurricane/earthquake can cause such damage. When a WMD event or natural disaster occurs, the shielding of the critical network components would minimize the damage, and hardware redundancy would reduce the physical network infrastructure recovery time. However, the shielding and redundant hardware components remain vulnerable to WMD attacks or natural disasters as well, and they might be destroyed at the same time as the primary components. This thesis proposes the concept of smart redundancy which uses the Redundant Array of Inexpensive Links (RAIL) technique to achieve the high routing survivability of the network. Our technique first fragments a data block into n stripes: p1, p2, \u2026, pn. Then using Reed-Solomon Coding, the m additional check sum stripes are added, p1, p2, \u2026, pn, pn+1, \u2026, pn+m. The resulting n+m stripes are treated as n+m separate packets, which we will henceforth refer to as striped packets. Finally, these n+m striped packets are routed over n+m different routing paths, such that these routing paths are node- and link- disjoint. The Reed-Solomon coding is based on the theory Finite Field and offers the desirable property that the original packet can be completely reconstructed from any n out of n+m striped packet. Thus, by this method, up to m path failures are tolerated in the network. If the n+m multiple paths are completely non-overlapping and a path is assumed to have a failure probability of Pf, then the failure probability of m paths is Pfm \u00ab Pf.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [750], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Bo Chen ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bo Chen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George Kesidis", "George Kesidis", "Shashi Phoha", "Kyusun Choi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George Kesidis, Thesis Advisor", "George Kesidis, Thesis Advisor", "Shashi Phoha, Thesis Advisor", "Kyusun Choi, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["routing survivability", "large-scale failure", "RAIL", "smart redundancy", "multipath routing protocol"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Bi-Objective Integrated Supply Chain Network Design Under Supply and Demand Uncertainties", "id": "np193916n", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13043", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A supply chain has a network structure and its design involves production-distribution\ndecisions on the location of production, distribution facilities, capacities and\ntransportation quantities.

In adult mice, stress erythropoiesis utilizes a specialized population of stress erythroid progenitors that are resident in the spleen. In response to acute anemia, these progenitors rapidly expand and differentiate. Our lab previously identified a BMP4- dependent stress erythropoiesis pathway. The initiating event in the activation of this pathway is the up-regulation of BMP4 expression in the spleen.

I uncovered that hypoxia transcription factor HIFs (Hypoxia Inducible Factors) binds two cis regulatory sites in the BMP4 gene, which induces BMP4 expression in the spleen during the recovery from phenylhydrazine- induced acute anemia (published in PLoS ONE). Following activation, essentially all of the BMP4- dependent stress erythroid progenitors are mobilized and differentiate. Previous work from the lab showed that Hedgehog signaling is required for the maintenance and replenishment of stress progenitors in the spleen. The work described in Chapter 3 dissects the role of Hedgehog signaling during stress erythropoiesis, and shows that Hedgehog signaling is essential for stress erythropoiesis. Firstly by using short- term radioprotection as a stress model, I showed that Hedgehog signaling is required for stress erythropoiesis by regulating differentiation and expansion of stress progenitors Sca1+Kit+CD34+/ Sca1+Kit+CD34- cells, and stress erythroid progenitors Sca1+Kit+CD71+ cells. In addition, Hedgehog signaling is required for the induction of BMP4 expression during the recovery. The data suggest that Hedgehog signaling is necessary to initiate the BMP4- dependent stress erythropoiesis pathway and may play a role in specifying the stress erythroid fate. Secondly by using the in vivo culture system\nthat recapitulates in vivo stress erythropoiesis (described in Chapter 4), I analyzed why Hedgehog signaling is still required following the specification of stress erythroid fate. It maintains self-renewal, expansion of BMP4- responsive cells, and the ability of Sca1+Kit+CD34- cells to generate erythrocytes. This study also identified stress erythroid progenitor populations, \u201cCD34+CD133+Sca1+Kit+ CD71+Ter119- cells\u201d and \u201cCD34-CD133-Sca1+Kit+ CD71+Ter119- cells\u201d. In addition to hypoxia and Hedgehog signaling, role of another factor, GDF15, in stress erythropoiesis was also explored. In the first part of Chapter 4, my studies on role of GDF15 in stress erythropoiesis are summarized, which demonstrate that GDF15 is an essential factor for stress erythropoiesis. Moreover, I applied my findings from studying these signals and stress erythropoiesis as well as the knowledge from our lab\u2019s publications to establishing an in vitro culture system that expands stress erythroid progenitors. The work in the second part of Chapter 4 demonstrates \u201cproof of principle\u201d experiments where stress erythroid progenitors provide erythroid- specific rescue in a murine model of &#946;0 thalassemia which is similar to the most severe form of human Cooley\u2019s anemia. This in vitro culture system successfully generates functional stress erythroid progenitors that alleviate lethal anemia and allow a normalization of erythropoiesis including iron utilization in murine &#946;0 thalassemia. The fact that these thalassemia recipients are alive for more than 10 months (up to date) suggests that erythroid stem cells exist in these stress erythroid progenitors (Sca1+Kit+CD71+Ter119- cells). Taken together, this study explored the interactions among signals, microenvironment and progenitor cells in stress erythropoiesis. The working model of stress erythropoiesis established in our lab was further proved by the in vitro generation of functional stress erythroid stem cells. The in vitro culture system established in this study provides therapeutic insight and a tool for studying stress erythropoiesis.   \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1679], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Dai-Chen ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dai-Chen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Paulson", "Robert Paulson", "Douglas Cavener", "David Scott Gilmour", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Ross Cameron Hardison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Paulson, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hedgehog", "BMP4", "hypoxia", "hematopoiesis", "erythropoiesis", "GDF15", "anemia", "stem cell"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Supermarket as a Site of Spectacul-art Pedagogy\n", "id": "11366", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1675", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In 1967, French cultural theorist and situationist Guy Debord published his work, The Society of the Spectacle, in which he asserted that spectacle is not a collection of images; rather, it is a social relationship between people that is mediated by images (Debord, 1994, p.12). Debord\u2019s prophetic assertion has been realized in today\u2019s society due to the improvement of technology and the instantaneity of Internet-based activities. No matter what the form of visual culture, we project our desires on it, withdraw fragments of desire from it, and even map our understandings of people and things through our readings of it. It is in our gazing, reading, interpreting, and even our bodily encounters such as touching, smelling, and tasting the texts of visual culture that the social relations of class, gender, race, and ethnicity are embodied.\n\nThe role of Wegmans Food Markets as embodied spectacle was almost equally important to me as that of the graduate school during my six years of graduate student life at State College, Pennsylvania. To paraphrase Austrian coffeehouse poet, Peter Altenberg\u2019s words, if I am not at home or on campus, I am at Wegmans or on my way to it. The supermarket, a seemingly ordinary place, is in fact a site where the complicated and subtle operations of the consumerism spectacle lurk. To borrow Debord\u2019s concepts of the spectacle, I deem that the contemporary spectacle of Wegmans sophisticatedly manipulates visual culture and corporeal experiences to embody a worldview which mediates our relationships with others. Knowledge within this worldview endorses the authenticity of facts and realities re-presented in the spectacle. Situated in the nexus of visual culture and contemporary feminist studies, this research thus aims to comb the twisted roots and intricate gnarls of visual culture and to examine through a feminist methodological lens how knowledge and experience are structured in this supermarket spectacle.\n\nThe fl\u00e2neuse, inspired by Walter Benjamin\u2019s fl\u00e2neur, is the feminist methodological device of this research. Her perspective, which is a critical and gendered standpoint of a cultural female Other, is applied here in order to examine this specific everyday place. In addition, the fl\u00e2neuse\u2019s corporeal experiences are brought into my field research which investigates the dynamic interactions between spectacul-art (pleasant/tasteful visual culture and spectacular/lived performances) and spectator-consumers. In so doing, this research aims to answer the following questions: How does the supermarket spectacle as embodied in Wegmans make spectators consumers? How are consumers tamed by the supermarket spectacle and urged to take actions? What kind of knowledge and experiences are constructed in the supermarket spectacle through visual culture? How does the supermarket spectacle deepen learning in accordance with its ideology through exhibition strategies?\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1661], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Dai-Rong ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dai-Rong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius", "Charles Richard Garoian", "Joan Landes", "Christine M Thompson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius, Dissertation Advisor", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius, Committee Chair", "Charles Richard Garoian, Committee Member", "Joan Landes, Committee Member", "Christine M Thompson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["spectacul-art pedagogy", "spectacle", "embodiment", "fl\u00e2neuse", "spectacle pedagogy", "society of extras"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Expression Analysis Of Three Cellulose Synthase Genes In Poplar Trees", "id": "16206", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8200", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cellulose is a major component of plant cell walls, which are very important in plant growth and development.

More specifically, this dissertation examines two novel biophotonic techniques: 1) a frequency multiplexed confocal microscope with the potential to provide rational therapy of congestive heart failure (CHF), and 2) the \u00a1\u00b0optical comb\u00a1\u00b1 with the potential to improve results of retina reattachment surgery and accelerate post surgical recovery. Next, I will discuss the background, design and initial experimental results of each study individually.\n\nPart I: The Frequency Multiplexed Confocal Microscope\nCHF is one of the largest threats to human health currently. Nearly 5 million Americans are living with heart failure, and 550,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Observations on humans as well as experimental animal models indicate that heart cell (myocyte) contractile abnormalities partly account for pump dysfunction observed in the heart disease state which leads to CHF. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which contraction in a single myocyte is regulated is important in our quest for effective therapy for CHF. Recently high-resolution imaging suggests that the ion transporters involved in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling are grouped together to defined regions (t-tubules and triads) of the cardiac cell membrane. Despite the important question of whether these small domains do indeed exist in the cardiac myocytes, there is no straight-forward approach published to-date to quantify and to track simultaneous changes of calcium ion and sodium ion concentration in a living cardiac myocyte during an action potential.\n\nFluorescence confocal microscopy is a powerful tool for life science because of its capability to optically section a thick specimen and obtain the 3-D image of that sample. However, a conventional confocal microscope requires pixel-by-pixel scanning, and as a result, has poor temporal resolution (i.e. slow imaging speed), which makes it difficult to monitor the fast dynamics in cells. To overcome the limitations of existing confocal microscope technology, this dissertation proposes a non-scanning, real-time, high resolution technique (a multi-point frequency multiplexed confocal microscope) to measure 3-D intracellular calcium ion concentration in a living cardiac myocyte. This method can be also applied to measure the intracellular sodium ion concentration, or other ions in which high quantum-yield fluorescent probes are available. The novelty of the proposed research lies in the introduction of carrier frequency multiplexing techniques which can differentiate fluorescence emitted at different spatial locations in cardiac myocyte by their modulated frequency. It therefore opens the possibility to visualize the transient dynamics of intracellular dynamics at multiple locations in cells simultaneously, which will shine a new light on our understanding of CHF.\n\nThe procedure for frequency multiplexing proposed is described below. Multiple incident laser beams are focused onto different locations in an isolated rat cardiac myocyte with each beam modulated at a different carrier frequency. The fluorescence emission at each location therefore bears the same modulated frequency as the stimulation laser beam. Each fluorescence signal is sent to the photo multiplier tube (PMT) after being spatially filtered by a single mode fiber (functioning as a pinhole). Since each signal has a different carrier frequency, only one signal detector is required to collect multiple signal streams which eliminates the errors introduced by difference of multiple detectors. After taking the Fourier Transform of the collected data, multiple peaks can be found in the frequency domain. Each peak refers to a corresponding location in the sample. The temporal information of the fluorescence signal variation at each location can be obtained by demodulating the low frequency information from the carrier frequency, followed by an inverse Fourier transform.\n\nPart II: The \u00a1\u00b0Optical Comb\u00a1\u00b1\nRetinal detachment refers to separation of the inner layers of the retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium. It can cause degeneration of the retina and may lead to permanent vision loss if not promptly treated and hence is considered an ocular emergency. Currently, the only treatment available for retinal detachment is surgical reattachment.\n\nRecent research findings provide a new explanation for the mechanism of visual loss due to detachment. Diffusion caused by the detached retina is but one of the factors of visual impairment, another factor could be the misalignment of the photoreceptors. During post surgery recovery, the photoreceptors and pigment epithelium regenerate and regain original contour; thus the vision may continue to improve over many months. To accelerate the recovery, ways to enhance photoreceptor realignment are required. In the second part of my dissertation, a novel technique called \u00a1\u00b0optical comb\u00a1\u00b1 is proposed to tackle the problem.\n\nThe idea of an \u00a1\u00b0optical comb\u00a1\u00b1 is developed from the general working principle of the well known \u00a1\u00b0optical tweezers\u00a1\u00b1 in the optical literature, which can pull micro-objects through the trapping force produced by a focused laser beam. If we can manage to incident the focused laser beam onto the misaligned photoreceptors and further scan it back and forth, trapping forces that produced may be able to \u00a1\u00b0comb\u00a1\u00b1 the photoreceptors to be aligned, and thereby help with post surgery recovery. A series of experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the plausibility of this idea. First, several micro glass rods with size similar to human\u00a1\u00afs photoreceptors (6 microns in diameter and 30 microns in length) were used. We observed that when the laser beam is focused close to one end of the micro rod originally laid on a glass coverslip, the rod is pulled to stand upright successfully, and we can manipulate the direction it faces by controlling its relative position to the laser beam. We are now experimenting with this combing technique with detached bovine retina samples to further verify its feasibility over live animal cells.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1981], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Fei ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shizhuo Yin", "Karl Martin Reichard", "Timothy Joseph Kane", "Zhiwen Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shizhuo Yin, Committee Chair", "Karl Martin Reichard, Committee Member", "Timothy Joseph Kane, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["calcium ion", "confocal microscope", "optical trapping", "cardiac", "retina"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Mining Heterogeneous Data for Semantic Understanding of Mobility Data", "id": "15274fxw133", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15274", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the prevalence of positioning technology, an increasing amount of human mobility data becomes available nowadays, including geotagged social media data, location records collected by mobile phone applications, and GPS traces collected by navigation services. \nThere have been tremendous interests in mining different mobility patterns for understanding human activities and behaviors. \nWhile the mobility data are valuable, they are often numeric or categorical in nature,  (e.g., a GPS point with timestamp and geo-coordinates). \nAs a result, the subsequent mined patterns from the data often have limited semantics. \nAt the same time,  a massive volume of spatial contexts (e.g., venue databases and geotagged tweets) provides us with rich semantics about urban dynamics. \nBy combining the mobility data with surrounding contexts, we are able to understand the semantics of human mobility.\nSemantics enriched mobility data can benefit various applications such as automatic human activity space inference and target advertisements.\n\nThis dissertation describes several recent attempts in fusing external context data for understanding the human mobility data. \nI will motivate the problem by presenting one key limitation of conventional mobility pattern mining approaches.\nA fundamental step in understanding the semantics is the mobility record annotation problem, that is, to associate a raw mobility record with the relevant surrounding context. \nMore specifically, I have proposed to use words from social media as a source of dynamic event information. \nI have also proposed a framework to model dependencies among annotations for individual and collective movements.\nAs the context data could have duplicates, I have proposed a label propagation method for addressing the annotation problem under noisy contexts.\nFinally, I will present recent collaboration results on applying the proposed framework to a practical social science study.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16659], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Fei ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "first_name_ssi": "Fei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhenhui Li", "Zhenhui Li", "Clyde Lee Giles", "Xiang Zhang", "Wang-Chien Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhenhui Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Zhenhui Li, Committee Chair", "Clyde Lee Giles, Committee Member", "Xiang Zhang, Committee Member", "Wang-Chien Lee, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["semantic annotation", "mobility data", "data mining"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Universal Service Provision in Western China", "id": "6591", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2002", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Universal telecommunications services provision is an important factor in reducing regional disparities in China and ensuring sustainable economic development, social equity, and national stability. This study, by drawing on the universal service concept and institutionalism policy research, analyzes the disparity in telecommunications services access between the western and the eastern regions of China. Based on the analysis, the study attempts to provide a framework to motivate and assist further explorations of universal service provision in China and in other regions with similar features. \n\nThe objective of this study is three-fold: (1) to demonstrate the widening disparity in telecommunications services access between the eastern coastal and the western inland regions of China; (2) to examine the historical, geographic, and policy reasons for the disparity; and (3) to offer solutions, policy recommendations, and a conceptual framework for universal service provision in western China and in regions with similar features. To accomplish the objective, this dissertation conducted a case study of telecommunications development in China. The findings suggest that despite the rapid development of overall telecommunications capability in China, a widening gap in telecommunications services access exists between the western and the eastern regions of the country. The study also suggests that the gap is a reflection of not only geographical and historical reasons, but more importantly, strategic considerations and national polices. In recent years, a more fundamental problem confronting universal service provision in China has been the incompatibility between the need to provide services to disadvantaged regions, and the requirement arising from China\u00a1\u00afs entry into the World Trade Organization to transform to a full-fledged market-based economy characterized by competitive neutrality. The contradiction between a planned economy in a socialist system and commercial viability in a competitive quasi-capitalist free market economy is both the background and the cause of the difficulty and disagreement in universal service provision in western China. \n\nBased upon its analysis, this study attempts to propose solutions and policy recommendations. The study suggests that emphases should be given to establishing a universal service mechanism, ensuring interconnection, promoting alternative technologies, segmenting the market, and improving the policy-making process and regulatory conduct. This study also suggests that the current approach to universal service provision continues to be bound by the limitations of a past regulatory era. When new elements emerge and change the industry\u00a1\u00afs underlying facts, the dominant and classical model becomes increasingly inadequate. Thus this study presents a new universal service model that emphasizes heterogeneity and flexibility, and is likely to be more suited to the new telecommunications environment in China and in other regions with similar features.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1985], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Feng ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Feng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Denny Taylor", "Jorge Schement", "Dennis Karl Davis", "Chris Benner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Denny Taylor, Committee Chair", "Jorge Schement, Committee Member", "Dennis Karl Davis, Committee Member", "Chris Benner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Universal service", "telecommunications", "western China", "rural area"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "NUMERICAL MODEL FOR ISOBARIC STEAM HEATING OF INITIALLY SATURATED PACKED BEDS\n", "id": "9905", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2417", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Pressurized-steam segmented-flow aseptic processing (PSAP) is a novel technology being developed to process particulate foods, e.g. mushrooms, soybeans, beans, peas, apple slices, corn, etc. For the commercial application of this system, it is essential to model the heat and mass transfer, steam distribution and penetration in the heating of those foods. Models will be helpful in adjusting the segmented-flow aseptic processing system in order to process different particulate foods in this system. Such capability can bring great benefits to the food and agricultural industry of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and beyond. \nFor modeling purposes, each segmented unit in PSAP was simplified to be a packed bed. Glass beads with 2, 3, and 5 mm diameter were used to simulate the particulate foods. In preliminary experiments, a capillary fringe (CF) was observed, which was a region with 100% water saturation existing at the bottom of packed beds after vertical drainage. CF prevented steam from penetrating the whole bed and slowed down the heating, which is a negative effect. \nFour major heat transfer mechanisms were important in this research: conduction, convection, condensation, and steam penetration. Although many researchers have modeled these processes, there was no applicable, integrated model available for predicting the temperature changes in the packed beds with the same scenario as in PSAP. The overall objective of this research was to develop a numerical model to simulate the heat and mass transfer in packed beds during isobaric steam heating so that the maximum bed depth can be determined, with which the temperature distribution from top to bottom of packed bed is still uniform. \nFirstly, the characteristics of packed beds were studied. Although different sizes of glass beads have different particle densities and bulk densities, the porosity turned out to be the same, 0.46, for each size of glass beads. The sphericities were 0.989, 0.991, and 0.992 for 2, 3, and 5 mm glass beads, respectively, suggesting ideal spheres of the glass beads. The measurement of static holdup showed that at 1 cm above upper boundary of capillary fringe in packed beds, static holdup decreased rapidly from 0.46 to 0.024, while above that elevation it remained almost constant at 0.24. Under low water flux, the water flow velocity (parent velocity) in packed bed had positive polynomial relationship with dynamic holdup. Under high water flux, the relationship between dynamic holdup and water flow velocity was assumed to be linear, based on the literature. The capillary fringe thickness were 2.4, 1.4, 0.6 cm for 2, 3, and 5 mm glass beads, respectively, under atmospheric pressure. Less thickness of capillary fringe was expected for packed beds at high temperature due to the decreased surface tension of water. \nA PSAP simulator was designed and built, and steam heating experiments were performed to investigate the temperature histories in packed beds with different bed depths and particle diameters. By modifying the experimental setup, temperature and weight changes in packed beds in steam heating were simultaneously measured. The general trend of temperature change of packed bed in steam heating was that the elevations from top to bottom were heated in order, and the bottom portion, CF, was heated much slower than other elevations. Further studies showed that with the decrease of particle diameter and increase of bed height, it took longer time for CF to reach a target accomplished temperature fraction (ATF). \nThe overall scheme for developing the numerical model was to divide the unsaturated flow zone (UFZ) and CF into N and M finite layers, in which the energy and mass balances were developed. Finite difference method was used to develop this numerical model, which was programmed and solved in an Excel spreadsheet. Model validation showed that after calibration of two parameters the one-dimensional numerical model performed well in predicting temperature and mass change, local porosity and liquid holdup and lethality, etc, in each layer. \nA comparison of heating time versus bed depth showed that the predicted and observed data had the same trend and were close to each other, which doubly confirmed that the model works well.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2401], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Haijun ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Haijun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Walker", "Paul Walker", "Virendra Puri", "Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Savas Yavuzkurt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Walker, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Walker, Committee Chair", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member", "Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Numerical Modeling", "Heat and Mass Transfer", "Saturated Steam", "Segmented-Flow Aseptic Processing", "Packed Beds"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THE TRANSMISSION OF MEMORIES:  REPRINTS, HISTORICAL STUDIES, AND COMMEMORATION  IN THE JESUIT SHANGHAI MISSION, 1842-1949", "id": "14170hiw5061", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14170", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the history of the Jesuit order\u2019s mission to China beginning in the nineteenth century and their use of historical memory as a way to engage with China\u2019s Christian communities and with Chinese society more generally. In particular, the focus is the relationship between the order\u2019s original mission, which was established in the sixteenth century and then outlawed in China after the early eighteenth century, and the mission as refounded in 1842. In order to connect themselves to Chinese history and society, the newly arrived nineteenth-century Jesuits emphasized the continuity between the two missions in three principal ways: (1) by reprinting books written by their predecessors in the first Jesuit mission to China; (2) by formulating historical narratives about the original mission to establish continuity in terms of outlook and purpose between the two groups of Jesuits across the century-long gap dividing them; and (3) by holding public commemorations to celebrate certain figures related to the original mission. The nineteenth-century Jesuits carefully constructed a new vision of the original mission, which they used both to establish themselves and to distinguish themselves from other Protestant missionary groups and likewise from rival Catholic missionary groups.\nThese three ways in which the new Jesuits reimagined the history of the original mission are considered and the original mission is shown to be a mixed blessing for the new Jesuits. That is, the new mission succeeded in partaking of some reflected glory from the original mission. Yet, by reviving the original mission, the new mission found itself entangled in old controversies.

Many of the results stem from measurements of individual wires.\n      Four original works are presented in the thesis: (1) The growth of diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) Zn1-xMnxS (0&#8804;x<0.6) nanowires using a three-zone furnace and two solid sources is reported (Chapter 2.4). The vibrational properties of the DMS nanowires with different Zn/Mn ratios were studied by correlating their Raman scattering spectra with the composition and structure measured by x-Ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) and selected area electron diffraction (SAD). We find that the transverse optical (TO) phonon band disappears at the lowest Mn concentrations, while the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon band position was found insensitive to x. Three additional Raman bands were observed between the ZnS q=0 TO and LO phonons when Mn atoms were present in the nanowires (Chapter 5); (2) Polarized Raman scattering on individual crystalline GaP nanowires with diameters 40<d<600 nm are systematically investigated. At small diameters, d<70 nm, the nanowires are found to act like a nearly perfect dipole antenna and the bulk Raman selection rules are masked leading to a polarized scattering intensity function I(&#952;) ~ cos4&#952; where &#952; is the angle between nanowire axis and the incident laser polarization. For larger diameter (70<d<600 nm) nanowires, a model based on the interplay between photon confinement and bulk Raman scattering are proposed to explain the experimental data. This work realizes a fundamental understanding of Raman scattering in semiconductor nanowires and furthermore, the antenna effects are essential to the analysis of all electro-optic effects in small diameter filaments (Chapter 7); (3) Results of polarized Rayleigh back-scattering studies are reported the first time for individual ~10 &#956;m long crystalline GaP nanowires using 514.5 nm excitation. The Rayleigh back-scattering intensity polar pattern I(&#952;) was measured at room temperature, where &#952; is the angle between the incident electric field and the nanowire axis. The collected radiation was polarized parallel to the incident electric field. For small nanowire diameter (d~70 nm), we observed ~cos4&#952; polar patterns. With increasing nanowire diameter above 100 nm, the polar scattering patterns rotate by 90\u00b0 with respect to those seen in small diameter nanowires and then they rotate back again to cos4&#952; patterns and finally broaden to a circle. Our experimental data are compared to the Rayleigh back-scattering efficiency calculated via the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). Our DDA calculations show that the polar patterns are sensitive to both the diameter and the nanowire length. Although the calculated polar patterns qualitatively support our data, improvement in the modeling is still needed (Chapter 8); (4) Giant nonlinear Raman scattering of both Stokes and anti-Stokes TO and LO phonons from several GaP nanowire segments with length L<1.2 &#956;m formed by cutting a long 210 nm diameter GaP nanowire is reported for the first time. The nonlinear Raman effect has been demonstrated to be stronger when the lengths of nanowire segments become shorter. We also observed that there exist threshold pump laser powers which separate the linear and superlinear region of the Raman spectra. The threshold laser powers which are indentified ~0.7-1.5 mW are two orders of magnitude smaller than reported threshold laser power for the typical Raman crystals, such as LiIO3 and Ba(NO3)2, one order smaller than the fabricated silicon waveguide and is comparable with that from SWNTs suspended between two SiO2 pillars. The threshold laser powers for short GaP nanowires are found to decrease linearly with decreasing length of nanowire segments. We contribute this giant nonlinear Raman effect to stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in cavities (Chapter 9). Indeed many of the novel optical properties discussed in this thesis stem from cavity enhanced electric fields inside the nanowire and cavity enhanced emission of the scattered field.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3096], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Jian ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter C Eklund", "Peter C Eklund", "Nitin Samarth", "Peter E Schiffer", "Lasse Jenson", "Richard Wallace Robinett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter C Eklund, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter C Eklund, Committee Chair", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Peter E Schiffer, Committee Member", "Lasse Jenson, Committee Member", "Richard Wallace Robinett, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Antenna effect", "Raman Scattering", "Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor Nanowires", "Semiconductor Nanowires", "Rayleigh Scattering", "Stimulated Raman Scattering"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A study of UV, optical and X-ray properties of quasars", "id": "12218", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3233", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The rest-frame UV, optical, and X-ray are important wavebands to study quasar activities because they trace ionization phases and dynamical properties of the physical structures surrounding the central engine, including the accretion disk, the broad line region, and the outflow.\n\n  This thesis investigates the correlations of spectral components (continua, emission lines and absorption lines) and the physical conditions implied by these components using well-defined samples of spectra from the archives of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the\nInternational Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), the Swift Space Telescope, and the Keck Telescope.

Our knowledge of AGNs has been greatly advanced during the past decades thanks to the unprecedentedly powerful X-ray missions (e.g., Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift) and modern large area surveys in the optical/UV band (e.g., the Sloan Digital Sky Survey; SDSS). Studies on the relation between multiwavelength properties of AGNs can reveal the physics of AGN accretion process. In this dissertation, I mainly study the relation between the AGN X-ray properties and their optical/UV spectral properties on emission lines, absorption lines and continuum. I also investigate the X-ray properties of AGNs with extreme radio properties in the early Universe. (1) We studied the X-ray properties of a class of radio-quiet SDSS quasars with weak broad emission lines (weak-line quasars; WLQs). Although the WLQ population shows diverse X-ray properties, they have an excess of X-ray weak sources. Besides having weak emission lines, the X-ray weak WLQs generally show other unusual UV emission-line properties similar to those of the remarkable X-ray weak quasar PHL 1811 (e.g., highly blueshifted C IV lines, weak semi-forbidden lines, and strong UV Fe emission). They are classified as \u201cPHL 1811 analogs\u201d. The X-ray weak WLQs also show a harder X-ray spectrum, while the WLQ with normal X-ray brightness have similar X-ray spectral properties to those of typical quasars. We proposed an AGN geometry which can potentially unify the X-ray weak and X-ray normal WLQ populations via orientation effect. The infrared-to-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of X-ray weak and X-ray normal WLQs have consistent SEDs with those for typical quasars, which disfavors the BL Lac-like scenario for the nature of these quasars (Chapters 2 and 3). (2) We have led the best X-ray study to date on quasars with intermediate-width absorption lines (mini-BALs). We found the X-ray brightness of mini-BAL quasars are more close to those of typical quasars than to BAL quasars (which are generally X-ray weak), showing they do not have substantial X-ray absorption. Strong correlations were found between the X-ray brightness and UV absorption parameters, e.g., the absorption strength and maximum outflow velocity. We further proposed new UV absorption parameters which better correlate with the X-ray properties than existing parameters do (Chapter 4). (3) We studied the relation between the optical/UV luminosity and X-ray luminosity (quantified by the \u000balpha_ox parameter) for the most-luminous quasars over a wide range of redshifts. Our correlation analyses provide better constraints on the alpha_\u000box-UV luminosity correlation. We have also verified that the alpha_\u000box parameter does not significantly evolve with redshift. We provide the individual and composite mid-infrared-to-UV SEDs for the most-luminous quasars. (Chapter 5). (4) We presented the X-ray and multiwavelength properties of the highly radio-loud quasars (HRLQs) at z > 4. Our HRLQs show a significant enhancement of X-ray emission over those HRLQs at lower redshift with similar optical/UV and radio luminosities, suggesting that the jet-linked X-ray emission mechanism in the early universe may differ from that in the more evolved universe. The optical/UV emission-line strength of RLQs are correlated with radio loudness, but not with relative X-ray brightness. Our HRLQs generally follow the anti-correlation between radio loudness and X-ray power-law photon index. We also studied the broad-band SEDs of HRLQs. Some HRLQs have an excess of mid-infrared emission which may originate from the jet synchrotron emission. None of our z > 4 HRLQs is detected by the Fermi LAT two-year survey (Chapter 6).", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8085], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Jianfeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jianfeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["W Nielsen Brandt", "Donald P Schneider", "Derek Brindley Fox", "Yuexing Cindy Li", "Irina Mocioiu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["W Nielsen Brandt, Dissertation Advisor", "Donald P Schneider, Committee Member", "Derek Brindley Fox, Committee Member", "Yuexing Cindy Li, Committee Member", "Irina Mocioiu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["X-rays", "Galaxies", "Quasars", "Emission Lines", "Absorption Lines", "Jets"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Investigating the roles of beta Heavy-spectrin in epidermal growth factor receptor signaling activity in Drosophila melanogaster\n\n\n\n", "id": "11687", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3293", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The spectrin-based membrane skeleton (SBMS) is a flexible and multifunctional scaffold involved in a wide spectrum of cellular processes including the generation of specialized membrane domains, determination of cell polarity, protein sorting, vesicle transport, endocytosis, protein recycling, morphogenesis, and nuclear positioning. \nEGFR signaling pathway regulates a variety of important cellular activities, ranging from cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, survival, motility, adhesion and tissue development.  It is also increasingly important as a therapeutic target for multiple cancers. The effect of spectrin, the key component of the SBMS, on EGFR signaling remains largely uncharacterized. Drosophila melanogaster is utilized in this thesis as an ideal model for investigating the relationship between beta heavy-spectrin (betaH) and EGFR signaling activity due to the low redundancy in beta-spectrin and EGF receptor isoforms, as well as the linearity of EGFR signaling pathway. \nThe hypothesis of this thesis lies in that loss of betaH enhances EGFR signaling activity. This hypothesis originates from a genetic experiment in which betaH mutant alleles suppressed rhomboidve (rhove) phenotype. Flies homozygous for rhove have incomplete wing veins due to insufficient EGFR activity. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed increased diphosphorylated Erk (dpErk) levels when the amount of betaH was reduced by RNAi. \nWe then sought to probe the mechanism by which betaH regulates EGFR signaling activity from two perspectives: EGFR ligand activiation and receptor endocytosis. The EGFR ligand mSpitz-GFP accumulated in a perinuclear lobe-like compartment and changed distribution dramatically upon betaH knockdown. However, such distribution change did not seem to correlate with increased ligand activation. Therefore, we instead focus on the endocytic regulation of EGFR and we propose that betaH is associated with EGF receptor endocytosis for the following reasons. betaH was seen associated with EGFR in internal vesicular and tubular structures that were positive for endocytic marker, Eps15. In addition, betaH was concentrated in lots of large cytoplasmic vesicles in Shibire mutant SG exposed at 30oC where clathrin-mediated endocytosis is significantly blocked. Finally, in Annexin B9RNAi SG, betaH was driven into similar internal networks along with Eps15. Based on my current data and other published works, we have proposed a model depicting the mechanism of betaH-associated endocytosis. We suggest that betaH is recruited to the endocytic machinery by Eps15, and both of them would travel with the internalized vesicles. The interaction between betaH-Annexin B9 provides additional means and specificity for vesicle trafficking to MVB. According to this model, efficient endocytic trafficking of EGFR will be compromised upon loss of betaH, which will result in active receptors accumulation at either plasma membrane or earlier endosomal compartments where they continue to signal. This leads to increased EGFR signaling activity. \nThe second half this thesis aims to unraveling the identity of the mSpi-positive lobes. The mSpi lobes are positive for multiple endocytic markers, including Eps15, Hrs and Ubi. Similar detection of such lobes in wild type salivary gland (SG) prompts us to speculate that the lobe is a naturally occurring endocytic compartment potentially involved in endosomal sorting and signaling. We have also uncovered the roles of betaH and Annexin B9 in the formation of such compartment.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3280], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Juan ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Juan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Graham Hugh Thomas", "Graham Hugh Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Graham Hugh Thomas, Thesis Advisor", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Trafficking", "Spectrin", "EGFR", "Endocytosis"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Soot Abatement Using Oxygenated Additives", "id": "6413", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2954", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A study of fundamental issues of soot abatement by using oxygenated additives is conducted systematically by both experiment and modeling studies. The overall technical objective is to develop fundamental understanding of the complex interactions of oxygenated additive with the processes that lead to particulate matter emissions. \nExperiments were performed on a premixed ethylene/air flame. Ethanol and dimethyl ether were chosen as oxygenated fuel additives. The experiments were conducted at two equivalence ratios,  &#61542; = 2.34 and &#61542; = 2.64, and two levels of ethanol or DME, 5% and 10% oxygen in mass of the fuel, were added to the fuel at each equivalence ratio. The experimental results show that Ethanol has evident effect on soot suppression. With the addition of ethanol, the concentration profiles of small PAH, large PAH and soot all show obvious reductions. The magnitude of reduction seems to increase following the sequence of small PAH, large PAH, and soot. Also, the more the oxygen content in the fuel, the more the reduction observed. By comparing the reduction ratios at two equivalence ratios, ethanol seemed to be more effective at &#61542; = 2.34 than at &#61542; = 2.64. DME addition also shows soot suppression effect. At \u00a7\u00b6 = 2.34, DME shows an obvious advantage over ethanol on PAH and soot reduction. However, at \u00a7\u00b6 = 2.64, there seems to be no detectable difference between the effective of ethanol and DME on PAH and soot suppression.\nIn order to reveal the chemical processes leading to the effect of ethanol and DME on PAH and soot reduction, a chemical model, Howard-DME-Ethanol (HDE) mechanism, was used to provide possible clues. A crucial clue to understand the effect of DME and ethanol on PAH and soot reduction is how much carbon in the ethanol and DME participates in the aromatic species formation reactions. The reaction flux analysis shows that the effect of DME and ethanol on the reduction of PAH and soot results from the removal of carbon from the pathway to aromatic species formation. DME was more effective than ethanol in reducing soot precursors, because more carbon in DME (68.7%) was removed from the participation of aromatic formation than that in ethanol (45.5%). This difference should be attributed to the molecular structure difference between ethanol and DME.\nTo check the role of temperature in the effectiveness of DME and ethanol addition in reducing PAH, modeling calculations were carried out using temperature profiles identical to the baseline fuel. The results show that temperature is unlikely to be a significant factor in reducing PAH production. \nAnother part of present study is to reveal the detailed soot reduction mechanism of NO2 through modeling investigation. To be consistent with formal ethanol and DME studies, in present modeling study, 5 wt% oxygen in the fuel by NO2 addition was chosen. The equivalence ratios were also set to be \u00a6\u00b5 =2.34 and 2.64.  \nIn order to reveal the chemical processes leading to the effect of NO2 on PAH and soot reduction, a chemical model, Howard-NO2 (HN) mechanism, was used to provide possible clues. HN mechanism comprises 256 species and 1043 reactions. The model combines Howard PAH model and NO2 mechanism.\nDetailed mechanism analysis shows that the addition of NO2 increases the level of OH radicals in the flame, through reactions of NO2+H&#61683;NO+OH, HO2+NO&#61683;NO2+OH. Then the increased OH decreases the level of H2 by reactions H2+OH&#61683;H2O+H. The lower level of H2 increases the reaction rate of H2CCCH+H&#61683;C3H2+H2, and results a lower level of H2CCCH. Since all C6H6 comes from H2CCCH through reaction 2H2CCCH&#61683;C6H6, low level H2CCCH leads to a reduction of C6H6. As a key element during the PAH growth, low level of C6H6 leads to suppression of all PAH formation and growth.\nThe effect of temperature on PAH reduction are also investigated. Under high temperature environment, the production of C8H6, is reduced due to the increase of C6H5 consumption by two competing reactions: C6H5&#61683;C6H5(L) and C6H5&#61683;HCCHCCH+C2H2. More C6H5 is consumed by these two reactions under higher temperature environment, resulting a reduction of C8H6 production through reaction C6H5+C2H2&#61683;C8H6+H. Because C8H6 is the key radical for PAH growth, reduction of C8H6 directly results a reduction of C10H8, A3, pyrene, and thus soot. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2947], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Juntao ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Juntao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Litzinger", "Robert John Santoro", "Harold Harris Schobert", "Richard A Yetter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Litzinger, Committee Chair", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["soot", "oxygenated additive"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Assortment planning for a large retailer with shelf-space constraint ", "id": "14669", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7361", "abstract_tesi": "Assortment planning has become an important issue for most retailers due to the growing variety of the products.

A way to better understand crash occurrence and identify potential countermeasures to improve traffic safety is to learn and use crash surrogates, referred to as surrogate events, events in which drivers need to take an evasive maneuver to recover to normative driving. This dissertation proposes a multi-stage procedure to identify well-defined surrogate events, and an event-based approach to connect crashes and surrogate events. The Virginia Tech 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study dataset on the NHTSA website is used to demonstrate the event-based approach. The first phase of this dissertation discusses the essence of surrogate events, identifies the desirable criteria for a surrogate event from a diverse literature, and demonstrates the use of an event-based approach for assessing safety by using naturalistic driving data to analyze surrogate events. An analytical procedure to identify surrogate events satisfying the desirable criteria from raw naturalistic driving data is proposed in phase two of this dissertation. Phase three of this dissertation tests the sensitivity of different sets of surrogate events identified. Overall, this framework as a whole is promising, since it not only connects surrogate events and crashes well and has sufficient flexibility to accommodate as much information as possible, but also provides a path for a feedback loop, which ensures robustness of the analysis results.

A blockchain can supplement or take the place of centralized fourth party logistics providers and reduce the layers of middlemen in the supply chain by connecting suppliers, retailers, and \\acrfullpl{3pl} directly. The blockchain also provides a distributed ledger that all participants would have a copy of and can contribute to without repudiation.\n\nThe decentralization inherent in the blockchain can allow smaller, independent contractors to be more competitive, increase efficiency by reducing the layers of middlemen, and reduce the costs of technology adoption for access to information. Smaller suppliers can be aggregated and matched to retailers through volume orders without a middleman. Logistics providers could be crowdsourced individual contractors that could be called upon anytime for small or rush deliveries, much like how rides can already be hailed on sharing economies such as Uber and Lyft.\n\nIn terms of traceability, the cost of sharing data between all participants could be significantly reduced, food safety issues can be mitigated as soon as they are detected, blame would be less likely to fall on the wrong party, and counterfeit products would be impeded by their lack of provenance on the blockchain.

Vitamin A (VA) is an essential nutrient that is required by the lung tissue in the postnatal period to help complete lung septation and maturation. Therefore, it is important to keep sufficient lung vitamin A in an early time of life. Previous studies have shown that retinol combined with its metabolite, retinoic acid (RA), is able to increase lung RE contents synergistically. A metabolic study has shown that RA redirects more of the VA given as a supplement into the neonatal lung. And this synergistic effect of combination of VA and RA (VARA) is only specific for the lung tissue. However, the mechanism of the synergy is unknown.\nTo better understand vitamin A metabolism in the lungs, we investigated how RA and its synthetic, metabolism-resistant analog, Am580, affect the distribution and metabolism of newly absorbed retinol in the neonatal rat. We also studied the transcript level of some genes involved in vitamin A metabolism when neonatal rats were treated with RA or Am580. Our results had shown that treatment of RA and Am580 not only increased neonatal lung RE significantly but also drive more oral-taken retinol to the lung. At the gene level, both RA and Am580 can significantly up-regulate the expression of some retinoids metabolism genes, like lecithin: retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), a member of cytochromes P450 (CYP26B1) and stimulated by retinoic acid gene 6 (STRA6) in neonatal rat lung. Compared to a transient up-regulation with RA, Am580 shows prolonged effect in increasing the expression of LRAT and CYP26. In addition, a 6-h and a 12-h study showed that although both LRAT and CYP26B1 expression response to treatment of RA greatly, LRAT reaches to its peak level much earlier than CYP26. In conclusion, the administration of acidic retinoids redirects the flow of supplemented VA in the neonate body. Some important retinoids metabolism genes like LRAT, CYP26 and STRA6 may contribute to the redirection of VA flow and play a key role in VA metabolism in neonatal lung.\nFrom these data, a model is proposed that treatment of RA greatly up-regulates expression of LRAT in the neonatal rat lung (at about 6 hours). Although CYP26B1 expression is highly induced by RA too, the change is not as big as LRAT. The change in gene pattern results in more retinol uptake into lung tissue and more RE formation. Meanwhile, the increased expression of STRA6, which codes a membrane receptor for retinol binding protein (RBP), also contributes to VA uptake into the lung. Thus the synergistic effect of VARA in RE formation can be explained.\nEach year, more than 300,000 premature infants are born in the United States. This population is born with inadequate body stores of vitamin A and is prone to respiratory diseases. Considering the beneficial effects of VA in promoting lung development and maturation, it is desirable to develop an efficient and safe way to increase neonatal lung RE content in premature infants. Our study in VA metabolism in neonatal lung provides promising therapeutic option in clinical medicine. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3845], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Lili ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lili", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross", "A Catharine Ross"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross, Thesis Advisor", "A Catharine Ross, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["retinoic acid", "metabolism", "vitamin A", "neonatal lung", "LRAT", "CYP26B1"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "VITAMIN A METABOLISM IN THE NEONATAL LUNG:\nSTUDIES IN A RAT MODEL\n\n", "id": "12540", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13260", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vitamin A (VA) is an essential nutrient for differentiation and maturation of the lungs. Direct evidence has been presented that keratinizing squamous metaplasia of the bronchopulmonary tree can be caused by VA deprivation in the lungs of VA deficient animals and this morphologic change can be reversed by refeeding the animals with VA. Other biochemical and molecular genetic evidence revealed that specific retinoids-binding proteins and nuclear retinoic acid receptors are contained in the lungs and retinoids can affect lung cells differentiation by influencing lung gene expression. In rats, significant storage of VA in the lungs starts in late gestation just before the onset of alveologenesis and surfactant synthesis, and then quickly is depleted during late pregnancy and postnatal life as the lungs are still developing, suggesting a high and acute demand of VA for postnatal lung development. However, the VA status in the lung of human and other mammals is known to be low at birth and postnatal lungs are very sensitive to dietary VA deprivation. VA deficiency associated with premature infants or infants with very-low-body-weight (VLBW) can interrupt normal development and compromise the respiratory function of the lung, thereby putting this population at high risk to develop various respiratory diseases. Therefore, it is important to improve lung VA status at the early time of the postnatal life.\nAlthough supplementation with VA to neonates is an effective way to prevent VA deficiency, it shows limited effectiveness in improving lung VA status. Previously we have shown that retinol combined with retinoic acid (RA), a biologically active metabolite of VA (VARA), is able to increase lung retinyl ester (RE) formation synergistically and RA redirects more of the VA given as a supplement into the neonatal lung. Our work investigating the molecular mechanism of VARA synergy revealed that RA is able to affect lung VA metabolism by upregulating several important retinoid homeostatic genes: LRAT, lecithin:retinol acyltransferase, an enzyme converting retinol to its storage form; CYP26, a cytochrome P450, an enzyme metabolizing RA to inactive polar metabolites; and STRA6, stimulated by retinoic acid gene 6, a transmembrane receptor for the retinol-RBP complex that mediate cellular retinol uptake. However, these findings are based on a single dose study, and the activity of RA on gene induction appears to be transient. \nIn the present study, we tested the effects of repeated supplementation with VARA in increasing lung RE contents. We also examined whether inflammation state and reduced RA concentration could affect the capability of RA in promoting RE formation.  At the same time, we speculated the spatial expression pattern of LRAT, CYP26B1 and STRA6 to further understand VA metabolism in the lungs of the neonates. We carried out several studies to 1) investigate how multiple treatments of RA during the period of lung septation affect RE accumulation and the expression pattern of lung retinoid homeostatic genes, or genes required for normal lung function; 2) compare a  reduced amount of RA in the VARA dose to test the potential of RA in elevating lung RE; 3) examine how lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation state affects VA homeostasis in neonatal lung; 4) determine the localization of retinoid homeostasis proteins in the lung. The results of our studies have shown that repeated treatments of VARA dramatically increase neonatal lung RE store in a cumulative and synergistic way. Diluted RA in VARA still promotes higher RE formation in neonatal lung more than VA alone after a single dose, but not after multiple doses. LPS-induced inflammation doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t significantly impact lung RE formation promoted by RA. The localization study suggested the expression of LRAT in lipofibroblasts, STRA6 in endothelial cells, and CYP26B1 in bronchiolar epithelium. \nOverall, these studies have shown the great ability of RA in promoting lung RE formation, even when given in much diluted concentration. Compared with a single dose, multiple treatments of VARA produced a cumulative effect on RE storage. The synergistic effect of VARA was not significantly affected by inflammation. These results together with our findings of the localization of retinoid homeostatic proteins provide a better understanding of retinoid uptake, accumulation and metabolism in the neonatal lung. Our findings also suggest a promising therapeutic approach in clinical use for a rapid restoration of lung VA in preterm or VLBW infants to promote normal lung maturation and prevent these infants from developing respiratory diseases.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12807], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Lili ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lili", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A.

Taking a mental imagery approach, the current dissertation examines how to effectively incorporate multisensory information in various types of online hospitality ads.  Its three major objectives are: 1) to explore additional psychological mechanisms behind consumer responses to multisensory information in online hospitality ads; 2) to contribute to our understanding of how multisensory information interplay with higher-order cognitive constructs such as consumers\u2019 previous preferences to influence consumption behaviors; and 3) to provide insights into how to use multisensory information to present vice vs. virtue food in the context of targeted online hospitality advertising.\nSpecifically, this dissertation examines the assimilation effect of multisensory imagery in the context of targeted advertising.  Targeted online advertising can be defined as any form of online advertising that is based on information the advertiser has about the advertising recipient, such as demographics, current or past browsing or purchase behavior (Schumann, von Wangenheim, & Groene, 2014).  With the results from one pilot test and two main experiments, this research demonstrated that the effectiveness of targeted advertising can be both fostered and impeded by prompting consumers to engage in multisensory imagery, depending on the timing to introduce multisensory imagery.  It was found that the positive effects of multisensory imagery will be significant only when it is introduced after the product pair information.  Such a timing based effect of multisensory imagery was significant only among participants who chronically adopt experiential style of processing.  \nAll together, this dissertation demonstrated that effectively incorporating multisensory sensory information in targeted hospitality ads can enhance consumers\u2019 pre-purchase evaluations.  With specific relevance to targeted advertising, the findings of this dissertation have important theoretical contributions and managerial implications for both the hospitality literature and hospitality marketing practices.

In a more general sense, the research focused on understanding combustion, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics of chemically reacting flows in small volumes and channels as well as the fabrication and diagnostic aspects of the systems. A series of small scale combustion systems were investigated that operated with gaseous, liquid, and solid reactants. Both steady-state and transient modes of combustion were studied in confinements where the characteristic length scale of the combustion volume approached that of the reaction zone. \n\nScaling issues related to combustion kinetics as well as fluid and thermal transport were reviewed. The insufficient flow residence time compared to the characteristic chemical time was identified as the critical issue for combustion at the microscale. This challenge was addressed by increasing the flow residence time using vortex flows and decreasing chemical reaction times with oxygen enrichment. Liquid nitromethane combustion, which has a higher volumetric power density than gaseous fuels, was also studied in mesoscale vortex chambers. Pressurization and oxygen enrichment were utilized to achieve high efficiency liquid propellant combustion in miniaturized chambers. \n\nHowever, combustion with high oxygen concentration in small confinements raises safety concerns. In the present study, deflagration-to-detonation (DDT) was studied to address these concerns and DDT was indeed observed for gaseous flames ignited in capillary tubes with diameters less than 1 mm. Three propagation modes were identified as the size of the tube diameter approached the quenching limit. Propagation of nanoscale Al/MoO3 thermite reactions in channels with dimensions on the order of a hundred microns was also demonstrated. The shorter reaction time of these transient processes can potentially overcome many of the thermal management problems of microscale combustion, since the time scales of the important chemical reactions become much smaller than the thermal diffusion time scales. \n\nMicro counterflow diffusion flame burners were fabricated using low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) tape technology, and were successfully operated with homogeneous gas-phase combustion. Unique to these burners was the incorporation of optical quality windows into the build process. A microscopic imaging spectrometer was developed to analyze the flame structures of the micro diffusion flames stabilized in the burners.. One-dimensional spatial distributions of CH* and C2* species across the sub-millimeter scale flames were obtained using this technique, and compared with three-dimensional numerical model predictions based on detailed kinetics.\n \nThe present research revealed the achievability of many different types of combustion processes at millimeter and sub-millimeter scales. In addition to micro propulsion, the knowledge obtained and techniques developed can be applied to many other micro reacting flow applications (e.g., fuel reforming, actuation, fluid pumping, power generation, toxic incineration, etc).\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4571], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Ming-hsun ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ming-hsun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter", "Vigor Yang", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Kendra Sharp"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter, Committee Chair", "Vigor Yang, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Kendra Sharp, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microcombustion", "micropropulsion", "microfluidic", "flame propagation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "I Text therefore I Am: Message Interactivity vs. Message Exchange in Addictive Use of Instant Messaging", "id": "m613mx57c", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13001", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nInstant Messaging (IM) has evolved into a real-time, cross-platform, presence-enabled service that allows users to send text-based messages anytime and anywhere. It is very common to see users constantly glued to their mobile devices and texting, but the nature of their messages and the motivations behind such habitual behavior are not fully understood. Do their interactions represent the ideal of message interactivity, featuring threaded conversations, wherein the content of messages are contingent upon previous messages? Or, are they simply mindless chatter, featuring mechanistic exchanges of reactive, rather than fully interactive, messages? Given that addictive use of media tends to be ritualistic and habitual, this dissertation hypothesized that users who are highly dependent on IM will focus more on simple mechanistic message exchanges, as their primary motivation is the excitement derived from sending and receiving messages. In contrast, those less dependent on IM were expected to appreciate message contingency, given their goal of having meaningful and interdependent conversations.   \n\nTo test these hypotheses, the current study (N = 188) employed a 2 (Message Interactivity: Low vs. High) x 2 (Message Exchange: Low vs. High) x 2 (Levels of Addiction: Low vs. High) between-subjects experiment. Message interactivity and message exchange were manipulated, and level of addiction was a measured variable. Participants were asked to complete an IM chat session with a financial customer service representative (i.e., research confederate) by using their own mobile phones, with the conversation topic and content were held constant across conditions. Surprisingly, the findings revealed that both addicts and non-addicts preferred message contingency. While non-addicts\u2019 appreciation of message contingency leads to corresponding content elaboration, addicts\u2019 IM use is rather paradoxical\u2014they do appreciate and demand contingent message exchange, but their actual engagement is still at a relatively superficial experiential level, focused on being absorbed in the experience of texting rather than elaborating on the content exchanged in the experience. The discovery of this paradoxical pattern of IM use is important\u2014not only does it confirm the process-oriented characteristic of IM addiction, but also offers us an opportunity to redefine and reevaluate media addiction in a more qualitative way, based on the nature of user engagement with interactive tools on the interface rather than on individual differences.

Both cooperative and non-cooperative strategies are examined. The demand  side of the market is composed by two respective consumers, one who is relatively insensitive to price, and the other who is relatively sensitive. A series of specific retailer decisions are examined, including the following: offering a private label (store brand) product or not, positioning the private label in terms of quality (vertical) and feature (horizontal) differentiation relative to the manufacturer\u2019s national brand product, and setting the retail prices and offering cents-off coupons for both products.<br>\n<br>As current literature focuses on the pricing strategies taken by the incumbent manufacturer(s) and retailer(s), their couponing strategies haven\u2019t been formally modeled and clarified. In particular, how their couponing strategies are impacted by the threat of private label and the private label offering hasn\u2019t been addressed before. Besides, given the relationship between private label expansion and couponing activities found in the existing empirical literature, no formal analysis and re-examination of the relationship has been presented. Meanwhile, the issue whether the private label customers are all price-sensitive hasn\u2019t been confirmed, and therefore becomes one of the targets of this research. By considering both non-cooperative strategies and cooperative strategies, the research intends to provide a more thorough picture of the interaction between the incumbent manufacturer(s) and retailer(s).<br>\n<br>This research shows that when the manufacturer and the retailer take non-cooperative strategies, the private label\u2019s retail price is related only to its quality level, and the retailer\u2019s coupons for the private label are simply determined by the difference between consumer types: greater consumer difference in willingness to pay brings higher coupon values. Similar patterns of the private label\u2019s price and coupon value hold when the retailer cooperates with the manufacturer.<br> \n<br>However, the national brand\u2019s prices (wholesale price and retail price) and coupon values (manufacturer\u2019s coupon and retailer\u2019s national brand coupon) are conditional on a number of factors, including whether or not the manufacturer and the retailer cooperate or not. When the manufacturer and the retailer take cooperative strategies, the national brand retail price reflects only its own quality level no matter whether the private label is introduced or not, and the national brand\u2019s total coupon value determined jointly by the manufacturer and the retailer is equal to the consumer type difference.<br> \n<br>Alternatively, when the manufacturer and the retailer take non-cooperative strategies, the threat of the private label\u2019s entry always drives the national brand\u2019s wholesale price and retail price down, no matter the threat comes from either higher private label quality or larger feature differentiation. However, with the presence of the private label, the national brand\u2019s wholesale price and retail price basically decrease with the quality for the private label but increase with feature differentiation. The retailer\u2019s national brand coupon value is based on the value of the manufacturer\u2019s coupon: as the manufacturer increases (decreases) the coupon value, the retailer decreases (increases) its own national brand coupon. <br>\n<br>No matter what strategies are taken, the research points out the emergence of three scenarios depending on the positioning of the private label. First, it is possible that the private label product is not offered. Second, the private label product might be offered but targeted to and consumed only by the consumer with higher willingness to pay, rather than the price-sensitive consumer. And third, the private label product is offered to and consumed by both types of consumers. In other words, (i) the target customer of the private label product is therefore not necessarily the price-sensitive consumer, and (ii) store coupons for the private label product are offered to the price-sensitive consumer only in the third scenario but not the second.<br>\n<br>The research shows that if the retailer offers the private label, it is always positioned at the highest possible quality (vertical differentiation) no matter what strategies are taken by the retailer and the manufacturer. However, while a very different feature strategy (horizontal differentiation) is always the best under cooperative strategies, the retailer under non-cooperative strategies may choose similar features thereby imitating the national brand to a degree such that the price-insensitive consumer is the target customer of the private label product and the second scenario therefore emerges.<br> \n<br>Focusing on the relationship between the private label expansion and non-cooperative couponing strategies in Sethurman and Mittelstaedt (1992), this research shows that the private label value market share and volume market share are irrelevant to the retailer\u2019s private label coupons, which coincides with the finding in Sethurman and Mittelstaedt (1992).<br> \n<br>However, while Sethurman and Mittelstaedt (1992) find that manufacturer\u2019s coupons (store coupons for the national brand) curb (contribute to) the private label value market share and the private label volume market share, this research shows that when the private label expansion is primarily driven by the degree of feature differentiation, manufacturer\u2019s coupons (store coupons for the national brand) decrease (increase) the private label value market share only in the private label position with very high quality relative to the national brand and very large feature differentiation from the national brand. Moreover, either when the private label expansion is driven by an increase in the private label quality or an increase in its feature differentiation from the national brand, the manufacturer\u2019s coupons (store coupons for the national brand) always increase (decrease) private label volume market share. This research therefore suggests that the private label quality or the degree of feature differentiation alone can\u2019t fully explain the relationship between the private label expansion and non-cooperative national brand couponing strategies.<br> \n<br>Finally, this research empirically tests the retailer\u2019s couponing strategy and shows that an increase in horizontal feature differentiation lowers the leading retailers\u2019 coupon values of store-level leading national brand products. This result confirms the theoretical prediction. On the other hand, an increase in feature differentiation has no impact on coupon values of leading private label products. Both results are supported by a robustness check.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5029], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Ping-Chao ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ping-Chao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Jaenicke", "Edward C Jaenicke", "Spiro E Stefanou", "Alessandro Bonanno", "Ruilin Zhou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Jaenicke, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Chair", "Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Member", "Alessandro Bonanno, Committee Member", "Ruilin Zhou, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["National Brand", "Coupon", "Product Positioning", "Private Label"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "COMMUNICATING EMOTIONS IN L2 CHINESE: A MIXED-METHODS MULTIPLE CASE STUDY OF AMERICAN LEARNERS OF CHINESE STUDYING ABROAD IN CHINA", "id": "14917quw106", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14917", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The dissertation explored American sojourners\u2019 Chinese language development and quality of experience when studying abroad in China. The linguistic focus\u2013communication of emotion\u2013is a key aspect of everyday interaction that has been little researched in L2 studies. With the aim to trace linguistic development along with reconstructing personal stories, the dissertation adopted a mixed-methods multiple case study design and the theoretical framework of Vygotskian sociocultural theory. By assessing 25 students\u2019 abilities to recognize and express emotions in a video retell task across the semester and across housing types, the study quantitatively tested the effect of time and accommodation. Case studies of four students of diverse backgrounds qualitatively investigated the aspects of Chinese emotion expression the students developed by participating in contextualized practices with their Chinese interlocutors, the process of their linguistic development, the quality of their experience abroad as interpreted by all parties involved, and lastly the interplay of personal histories, perception of experience, and linguistic progress. Informed by Vygotskian sociocultural theory, the case studies followed the genetic method in tracing the history of the students\u2019 Chinese emotional repertoire across the semester, thereby elucidating language developmental processes in situated oral interaction and in relation to their perception of the experience. The dissertation found that both group tendencies and individual cases supported the benefit of study abroad for emotion language development. However, the four cases presented variability and diversity regarding the aspects of emotion repertoire highlighted (e.g. fear-related emotion, body part emotion metaphors), contextualized practices involved (e.g. conversational narratives, language play), qualities of mediational means in situated interaction, and ultimately, developmental trajectories. Three aspects were identified as potential mediators of their sojourn experience, respectively the quality of interpersonal relationship with the Chinese roommates or host family, self- and other-positioning of racial and ethnic identities, and personal goals in the naturalistic context vis-\u00e0-vis classroom requirement. Overall, the dissertation argues that sojourners\u2019 linguistic learning and quality of experience is a complex interplay among personal goals, dispositions, individual histories, perceptions, participation in linguistic practices, and interpersonal dynamics among all parties concerned. The insights from the dissertation not only shed light on future research design (e.g. the merit of mixed-methods), but also bear significant implications for pedagogical practices and study abroad program design, including curriculum gaps involving language required in naturalistic context but not emphasized in classrooms (e.g. narrative, pragmatics of eating), pedagogical interventions that could facilitate students\u2019 understanding (e.g. concept-based instruction), pedagogical interventions that connect in- and out-of-class learning, and training for Chinese roommates and host families to promote intercultural awareness.

Therapeutics for RNA virus infections are often limited because of the rapid development of antiviral drug resistance. RNA viruses are known to exhibit high error rates during replication and thus exist as quasispecies. To maintain the maximum adaptability, these viruses exist on the edge of \u201cerror catastrophe\u201d, and small increases in the mutation frequency can cause a drastic decrease in viral infectivity. By taking advantage of the high mutation rate of RNA virus replication, a relatively new antiviral approach termed \u201clethal mutagenesis\u201d can be used to increase the error rate of RNA viral replication to intolerable levels, resulting in the loss of viral viability.\nChapter one of this dissertation reviews current antiviral therapeutics and lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral strategy. The clinically used antiviral drug ribavirin represents an agent that functions as a lethal mutagen against poliovirus (PV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). This drug is converted intracellularly to the 5'-triphosphate (RTP), which is a degenerate substrate of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP). Once in the genome, ribavirin promotes mutagenesis by templating the incorporation of both C and U during multiple rounds of viral replication, leading to error catastrophe and decreased infectivity of the virus.\nThe work described herein includes efforts to design and synthesize novel antiviral nucleosides and probe their mechanism of action. In chapter two, we report the synthesis and antiviral effects of bioisosteric deaza analogues of 6-methyl-9-&#946;-D-ribofuranosylpurine, a hydrophobic analogue of adenosine. Whereas the 1-deaza and 3-deaza analogues are essentially inactive in whole cell assays, a novel 7-deaza-6-methyl-9-&#946;-D-ribofuranosylpurine analogue, structurally related to the natural product tubercidin, potently inhibited replication of poliovirus (PV) in HeLa cells (IC50 = 11 nM) and dengue virus (DENV) in Vero cells (IC50 = 62 nM) as evidenced by plaque assays. Moreover, selectivity against PV over cytotoxic effects to HeLa cells was >100-fold after incubation for 7 h. We further found that the putative triphosphate metabolite of this 7-deaza analogue was effectively incorporated into RNA by PV RdRP.\nChapter three describes studies of the pyrazinecarboxamide compound T-1106 as an antiviral agent. Although this compound is active against several RNA viruses, its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Only a single patent has reported the synthesis of T-1106, and the coupling of its nucleobase with ribose leads to a mixture of &#945; and &#946; anomers. Improved Vorbr\u00fcggen coupling conditions were developed here to achieve a stereoselective synthesis of this compound. Treatment of PV infected HeLa cells with 1 mM T-1106 caused a dramatic decrease of viral titer, and the corresponding triphosphate was found to be incorporated by PV RdRP across all four natural nucleotides.\nChapter four focuses on another topic, development of new analogues of rhodamine as red fluorescent probes. As members of the xanthene class of dyes, rhodamines often exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields, pH-insensitivity, excellent photostability and photophysical properties. For these reasons, rhodamines are widely used as probes for labeling of biomolecules and construction of chemosensors. Three novel hydrophobic rhodamine analogues with good photophysical properties were designed and synthesized. The ability of biotinylated derivatives of these fluorophores to bind streptavidin fusion proteins expressed in living yeast cells was investigated.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5421], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Runzhi ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Runzhi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Blake R Peterson", "Raymond Lee Funk", "Blake R Peterson", "Philip C.

Due to these applications, electrical energy storage devices have been growing rapidly in recent years. Desired properties of the dielectrics for energy storage include high electric energy density, high charge-discharge efficiency, high electric breakdown, and high operation temperature. Compared with ceramic capacitors, polymer thin film capacitors are inexpensive, possess high dielectric strength, high energy density and low dielectric loss, and fail gracefully. The continuous miniaturization and increased functionality in modern electronics and electric power systems demand further increases in energy and power density of dielectric materials since these capacitors contribute significant (>30%) volume and weight to systems. \n\nOne major challenge in developing dielectric polymers is realizing high energy density while maintaining low dielectric loss, even when high electric fields are applied. The traditional dielectric polymers have a relatively low dielectric constant around 2-3, and the energy density is limited to below 5 J/cm3. Recently, PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) based dielectric polymers such as P(VDF-CTFE) (CTFE: chlorotrifluoroethylene) and P(VDF-HFP) (HFP: hexafluoropropylene) have been studied and demonstrated to achieve very high energy densities (>25 J/cm3). Unfortunately, it is still a challenge to reduce the ferroelectric loss in PVDF based polymers by the strongly coupled dipoles and the high electric field conduction loss. \n\nTwo approaches are introduced in this dissertation on how to develop the next generation polymer dielectrics with high energy density, low loss, high breakdown strength, and high temperature stability. The first approach is modification of high K polymer dielectrics to reduce the ferroelectric loss and conduction loss. The second approach is start from intrinsically low loss materials, then enhance the dielectric properties by increasing the dipole moment and dipole density.\n\nA polar-fluoropolymer blend consisting of a high energy density P(VDF-CTFE) and a low dielectric loss poly(ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (ECTFE) was developed. Both the blend and crosslinked blend films exhibit a dielectric constant of 7 and low loss (1%), as expected from the classical composite theory. Moreover, introducing crosslinking can lead to a marked reduction of losses in blend films at high electric fields while maintaining a high energy density. At 250 MV/m, a loss of 3% can be achieved in the crosslinked blend compared with 7% loss in pure blend, which is already much below that of pure P(VDF-CTFE) (35%). Furthermore, uniaxially stretch can improve the dielectric breakdown strength and mechanical properties.\n\nThe promise of aromatic, amorphous, and polar polymers containing high dipolar moments with very low defect levels is demonstrated for future dielectric materials with ultrahigh electric-energy density, low loss at high applied fields, and ultrahigh breakdown strengths. Specifically, an amorphous, polar, and glass-phase dielectric polymer aromatic polythiourea (ArPTU) features extremely high dielectric breakdown strength (>1.1 GV/m), low loss at high electric fields (10% at 1.1 GV/m), and a high maximum electrical energy density (>24 J/cm3). This dissertation presents a study of the structure-property relationships and electrical properties study in ArPTU, and offers a phenomenological explanation for the experimentally observed high-field loss characteristics which facilitate the excellent energy storage properties.\n\nBesides the aromatic polythiourea, meta-aromatic polyurea (meta-PU) was developed and investigated for energy storage capacitors. Modifications to the molecular structure can tune the dipolar density and dipole moment in the polyurea systems to improve the dielectric properties. The meta-PU has an enhanced dielectric constant from the higher volume dipolar density, higher energy density, and a high electrical breakdown. A high storage electrical energy density of 13 J/cm3 with energy storage efficiency of 91% can be achieved at 670 MV/m electric field. Other polyureas, polythioureas based dielectrics with tunable dielectric properties are also summarized.\n\nPolymer dielectrics possessing high dielectric constant, low loss are not only of great importance for energy storage capacitors, but also attractive as gate dielectrics in organic thin film field effect transistors (OTFTs). In this work, solution processable PVDF based polymers, with tunable dielectric constant from 7 to more than 50 as well as ferroelectricity, were used as the gate insulator in bottom gated OTFTs with a pentacene semiconductor layer. Due to the high dielectric constant of P(VDF-TrFE-CFE), a large capacitive coupling between the gate and channel can be achieved which causes a high charge concentration at the interface of the semiconductor and dielectric layers. In devices with the P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) dielectric layer, high performances and a low minimum operation gate voltage (5-10 V) were attained. Also, the ferroelectric thin film transistor with the P(VDF-TrFE) dielectric has a high remnant polarization, which is desired for memory applications.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10113], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Shan ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Noel Christopher Giebink", "Shizhuo Yin", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Noel Christopher Giebink, Committee Member", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy storage", "capacitor", "polymer", "dielectric", "energy density", "loss", "dielectric breakdown"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES AND COGNITIVE STYLES AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO PROPOSED SOCIAL LEARNERS\u2019 LEARNING STYLES THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SOCIAL LEARNERS LEARNING STYLES SURVEY\n", "id": "11108", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6049", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to determine if psychological types as described by Jung, Myers and Briggs, and cognitive styles, defined by Riding and Cheema, can be used to support the existence and definition of the learning styles of a group described by the researcher as social learners.

It therefore can be utilized to achieve structural vibration confinement and acoustic radiation reduction.  The control strategy of vibration confinement is to alter the right eigenvectors through active action, such that the modal components corresponding to the concerned region have relatively small amplitude.  Similarly, the control strategy for reducing acoustic radiation is to alter the right eigenvectors through active action so that the modal velocity distributions cause as small radiation as possible.  Reciprocally, the concept of left eigenvector assignment is to alter the left eigenvectors so that the effects of the exogenous disturbances on the system responses can be modified.  Therefore the left eigenvector assignment can be conceptually used to reduce the effects of external excitations, and thus achieve disturbance rejection.  The design goal is to alter the left eigenvectors through active action such that the forcing vectors are as closely orthogonal to the left eigenvectors as possible.  Because of these clear physical meanings, the proposed left-right eigenvector assignment concept can target the nature of the structural vibration-acoustics problem with more physical insight as compared to many more classical control schemes.  With such an approach, one can achieve both disturbance rejection and modal confinement (vibration control purpose) or modal radiation reduction (noise reduction purpose) concurrently for forced vibration-acoustics problems.  \nIn this research, simultaneous left-right eigenvector assignment and partial left-right eigenvector assignment approaches are synthesized for structural vibration control (discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis) and acoustic radiation reduction (Chapter 5), respectively.  With the simultaneous left-right eigenvector assignment approach, the feedback gain matrix is derived based on the generalized inverse procedure.  In such a method, all the left and right eigenvectors of the closed-loop system are determined to best-match the desired eigenvectors through a least square approximation.  On the other hand, the partial left-right eigenvector assignment method can exactly assign the selected left and right eigenvectors of the closed-loop system as the desired optimal ones.  With this algorithm, both the left and right eigenvectors can be determined accurately from the achievable subspaces through solving generalized eigenvalue problems.  \nNumerical simulations are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on a clamped-clamped beam structure example for the vibration and noise control problem.  Frequency responses of different case studies in the selected frequency range are illustrated.  It is shown that with the simultaneous left-right eigenvector assignment or the partial left-right eigenvector assignment techniques, both disturbance rejection and modal confinement or modal radiation reduction can be achieved, and thus the vibration amplitude in the concerned region or the sound pressure radiation at the receiver can be reduced significantly.  Experimental efforts are performed to implement the new active control concepts for structural vibration control (Chapter 4), where the test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.  \nFinally, in the last chapter of this thesis, the research efforts and achievements are summarized, and recommendations for possible future investigations are discussed.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6298], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Tian-Yau ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tian-Yau", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kon Well Wang", "Christopher Rahn", "Mary I Frecker", "Heath Hofmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kon Well Wang, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Member", "Heath Hofmann, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Active Control", "Structural Vibration", "Acoustic Radiation", "Piezoelectric Material", "Modal Confinement", "Eigenvector Assignment", "Disturbance Rejection", "Modal Radiation Reduction."]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "ROLES OF HISTONE MODIFICATIONS AND TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS IN TRANSCRIPTION REGULATION IN ERYTHROPOIESIS", "id": "12534", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6559", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cellular differentiation is a process in which pluripotent cells become morphologically and functionally more specialized cells, which happens in the development from monocellular zygote into a multicellular organism system with complex cells and tissues of different types, and also in cell turnover or renewal in adults.

In this thesis, we investigated the distributions of four critical histone modifications, DNase hypersensitivity, and binding sites of three important transcription factors on mouse genome in mouse G1E model which mimics normal erythroid differentiation, allowing us to study the relationship between these epigenetic features and specific gene regulation in erythropoiesis, which is a well-defined cellular differentiation process for maturation of red blood cells.\nAs described in the second chapter of this thesis, we applied ChIP-seq technique to examine the genome-wide distributions of four histone modifications in both erythroid progenitor G1E cells and differentiating erythroblast G1E-ER4+E2 cells. The modifications are H3K4me3 which is associated with promoters, H3K4me1 which marks enhancers, H3K27me3 which associates with gene repression, and H3K9me3 which is associated with heterochromatin. We employed a multivariate HMM to segment the genome into six chromatin states defined by the different distributions of the examined histone modifications. Comparison of the chromatin states between the G1E and its restored cell line G1E-ER4+E2 revealed quite limited alterations of the states in the captured erythroid differentiation process, suggesting a preceding establishment of the chromatin states prior to the GATA1-triggered differentiation, most likely at the stage of erythroid lineage commitment.\nAs a parallel project to the study of histone modifications, we utilized the same ChIP-seq approach and the same G1E system to identify the genome-wide localization of occupancy by three critical transcription factors and investigated their roles in transcription regulation in erythroid differentiation. These factors are GATA1 which is a master regulator of erythropoiesis, TAL1 which is also essential to the lineage and often co-binds DNA with GATA1, and GATA2 which is important for cell pluripotency maintenance in earlier hematopoietic stages. Our observations confirmed the replacement of GATA2 by GATA1, co-occupancy of GATA1 and TAL1, and its association with gene induction in erythropoiesis on a genome-wide scale. Our examination of the motif distribution on TAL1 binding sites suggested TAL1 localization is substantially controlled by GATA1 binding. And our investigation of distributions of H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 on GATA1 binding sites attributed them as strong determinant in GATA1 occupancy prediction. In addition, an enhancer assay of two predicted GATA1 motif containing CRMs proved one of them to be an enhancer, which is bound by GATA1 to up-regulate the transcription of a downstream microRNA locus, supporting microRNA as a mechanism mediating transcription regulation by GATA1.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6557], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Weisheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Weisheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Eric Thomas Harvill", "Yanming Wang", "James Taylor", "Francesca Chiaromonte"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison, Dissertation Advisor", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Chair", "Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Member", "Yanming Wang, Committee Member", "James Taylor, Committee Member", "Francesca Chiaromonte, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Histone modifications", "transcription factors", "erythropoiesis", "epigenetics", "chromatin states"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "On ergodicity of geodesic flows and nondense orbits of certain partially hyperbolic systems", "id": "22648", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10332", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We present two results on two different dynamical systems with certain hyperbolic behavior.

Although the targeting mechanism of synaptic GABAA receptors has been extensively studied, the exact mechanism underlying extrasynaptic GABAA-receptor targeting was not known. \nThe primary objective of this thesis was to elucidate the targeting mechanisms for distinct GABAA receptors, with special focus on the extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Previous studies suggest an important role of \u03b32 and \u03b4 subunits in synaptic versus extrasynaptic targeting of GABAARs. Here, we demonstrate differential function of \u03b12 and \u03b16 subunits in guiding the localization of GABAARs. To study the targeting of specific subtypes of GABAARs, we used a molecularly engineered GABAergic synapse model to precisely control the GABAA-R subunit composition. We found that in neuron-HEK cell heterosynapses, GABAergic events mediated by \u03b12\u03b23\u03b32 receptors were very fast (rise time ~2 ms), whereas events mediated by \u03b16\u03b23\u03b4 receptors were very slow (rise time ~20 ms). Such an order of magnitude difference in rise time could not be attributed to the minute differences in receptor kinetics. Interestingly, synaptic events mediated by \u03b16\u03b23 or \u03b16\u03b23\u03b32 receptors were significantly slower than those mediated by \u03b12\u03b23 or \u03b12\u03b23\u03b32 receptors, suggesting a differential role of \u03b1 subunit in receptor targeting. This was confirmed by differential targeting of the same \u03b4-\u03b32 chimeric subunits to synaptic or extrasynaptic sites, depending on whether it was co-assembled with the \u03b12 or \u03b16 subunit. In addition, insertion of a gephyrin-binding site into the intracellular domain of \u03b16 and \u03b4 subunits brought \u03b16\u03b23\u03b4 receptors closer to synaptic sites. Therefore, the \u03b1 subunits, together with the \u03b32 and \u03b4 subunits, play a critical role in governing synaptic versus extrasynaptic targeting of GABAARs, possibly through differential interactions with gephyrin. \nFor the second part of this thesis, I investigated the functional interaction between synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Our data showed that ectopically expressing extrasynaptic \u03b16\u03b23\u03b4-receptors in mouse pyramidal neurons significantly increased tonic currents, as expected. Surprisingly, the increase of tonic inhibition was accompanied with a substantial reduction of the fast synaptic GABAergic transmission, suggesting a possible homeostatic regulation of the total inhibition. Overexpressing the \u03b16 subunit alone induced an upregulation of the \u03b4 subunit expression level, and suppressed phasic inhibition similar to that with \u03b16\u03b23\u03b4 subunits. Blocking all GABAA receptors after overexpressing \u03b16\u03b23\u03b4 subunits did not restore the level of synaptic GABAergic transmission, suggesting that receptor activation is not required for the interplay between synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Furthermore, insertion of a gephyrin-binding-site (GBS) into the intracellular loop of \u03b16 and \u03b4 subunits recruited \u03b16GBS\u03b23\u03b4GBS-receptors to postsynaptic sites, but failed to rescue synaptic GABAergic transmission. Thus, it is not because of the positional effect of extrasynaptic localization of \u03b16\u03b23\u03b4 receptors that causes the down-regulation of synaptic GABAergic transmission. We propose a working model that both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors may compete for limited receptor slots on the plasma membrane to maintain the total GABA inhibition within a normal range.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8000], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Xia ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gong Chen", "Bernhard Luscher", "Richard W Ordway", "Timothy J Jegla", "Bruce Gluckman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gong Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Chair", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Timothy J Jegla, Committee Member", "Bruce Gluckman, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["extrasynaptic GABAA receptor", "targeting", "tonic inhibition", "gephyrin", "alpha subunit", "delta subunit", "homeostatic regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The role of barren inflorescence genes, barren inflorescence2 (bif2), barren stalk1 (ba1)and suppressor of sessile spikelet1 (sos1), in maize inflorescence development", "id": "8658", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6712", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThere are four types of axillary meristem initiated during maize inflorescence\ndevelopment. Thus, the structure of the maize inflorescence is quite different from\nArabidopsis which has two types of axillary meristems. Other grass species such as rice,\nsorghum and wheat have similar inflorescence morphology. More importantly, as the\ninflorescence produces the seed, the increase in the complexity of the grass inflorescence\nhas caused an increase in yield. Grass species are the main food source for human beings.\nTherefore, it is very important to understand the development of the grass inflorescence.\nIn addition, the development of the grass inflorescence involves hormonal regulation.\nThere are many advantages to choosing the maize inflorescence as a model system to\nstudy grass inflorescence development such as the large meristem size to perform\nhormone analysis, the multiple types of axillary meristem as well as the established\ngenetic and genomic resources. Therefore, maize is a good system to perform research on\ninflorescence development and hormonal regulation.\nIn my work described in chapter 2, I provide support that polar auxin transport\n(PAT) is required for initiation of axillary meristems in the maize inflorescence such as\nthe branch meristem (BM), spikelet pair meristem (SPM) and spikelet meristem (SM). In\naddition, RNA in situ hybridization analysis showed the interaction of two important\nbarren inflorescence genes, barren inflorescence2 (bif2) and barren stalk1 (ba1), with\nPAT. bif2 and ba1 mutants have defects in the initiation of all axillary meristems. The\nrole of bif2 appears to be similar to PINOID (PID) in Arabidopsis which regulates auxin\ntransport to initiate axillary meristems in the inflorescence. However, as ba1 homologs\nare absent in Arabidopsis genome, bif2 regulation of ba1 may shed light in understanding\nthe unique aspects of maize inflorescence development and signal transduction network.\nMy analysis of bif2;ba1 double mutants in chapter 3 showed that the interaction between\nbif2 and ba1 is complex. My work together with others has shown that regulation occurs\nat both the transcription and post transcription level. This is consistent with the model we\nproposed in the chapter 2. In addition, we revise our model to account for all of the\nevidence from genetic and molecular analysis. This will provide information to further\ntest the interaction between bif2 and ba1.\nIn chapter 4, I characterized Suppressor of sessile spikelet1 (Sos1) and its\ninteraction with ramosa1 (ra1) and ramosa2 (ra2). Since these three genes are involved\nin determining SPM determinacy, their interaction determines the mature architecture of\nthe maize inflorescence. We proposed a model based on all the molecular and genetic\nanalysis which helps to understand how these three genes interact and function in maize\nmeristem determinacy. Cloning of the Sos1 gene will be very important to understand\nhow the maize inflorescence produces paired spikelets instead of single spikelets. This is\nan important derived trait in grass inflorescence evolution. In addition, I showed in\nchapter 2 that blocking auxin transport in early development phenocopies the Sos1\nmutant phenotype. This indicates that Sos1 may be involved in the auxin signal\ntransduction pathway to regulate maize inflorescence development. The progress towards\ncloning sos1 is shown in Appendix A.\nAlthough our understanding of maize inflorescence development is ongoing, my\nresearch provides clues to understand some of the main players such as bif2, ba1, PAT,\nSos1, ra1 and ra2. In addition, my analysis primarily defines the positions of these genes\nin the network. By further analysis based on these models, we will understand more of\nthe cross talk between these genes to control maize inflorescence development.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6708], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Xianting ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xianting", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paula Mc Steen", "Hong Ma", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Kathleen Marie Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paula Mc Steen, Committee Chair", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["barren inflorescence", "maize", "inflorescence development"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "multi-stage stochastic programming on shale gas infrastructure and production planning", "id": "15508", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7310", "abstract_tesi": "The rich resource of Marcellus gas has recently boosted up the interest of people as the drilling technology advances.

Inactive NF-&#954;B is located in the cytosol complexed with the inhibitory I&#954;B proteins, and its nuclear translocation is induced through phosphorylation-mediated degrdation of I&#954;B, a molecular event that in turn is mediated by I&#954;B kinase (IKK).  NF-&#954;B activation is generally a transient process due to its tight regulation by negative feedbacks, thus timely inducing targeted genes involved in diverse biological processes.  Defect in NF-&#954;B negative regulations, due to either genetic deficiencies or pathological actions, can lead to severe diseases, such as inflammation and cancer.  Thus, deciphering the negative regulation of NF-&#954;B represents a highly significant and challenging area of NF-&#954;B research.  The primary goal of this thesis research project is to better understand the molecular mechanisms mediating the abnormal NF-&#954;B activation.  Specifically, two aspects of abnormal NF-&#954;B activation were focused on.  One was the pathological activation of NF-&#954;B by retroviral oncoprotein Tax encoded by the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I).  The other aspect was the genetic deficiency of a negative regulator, cyclindromatosis (CYLD).\n\t\tIn Chapter II, I described one novel mechanism by which Tax mediates constitutive NF-&#954;B and IKK activation.  HTLV-I Tax oncoprotein persistently activates NF-&#954;B, which is required for HTLV-I-mediated T-cell transformation.  NF-&#954;B activation by Tax has been shown through its capacity of stimulating the activity of I&#954;B kinase (IKK), but the underlying mechanism remained elusive.  We showed here that Tax functions as an intracellular stimulator of an IKK-activating kinase, Tak1.  Additionally, Tax physically interacts with Tak1 and mediates the recruitment of IKK to Tak1.  In HTLV-I-infected T cells, Tak1 is constitutively activated and complexed with both Tax and IKK.  We provided genetic evidence that Tak1 is essential for Tax-induced IKK activation.  Interestingly, ubiquitin-binding function of IKK&#947;, which is essential for cellular stimuli induced NF-&#954;B activation, is not required for Tax-specific NF-&#954;B signaling.  These findings demonstrate a pathological mechanism of IKK activation by Tax and provide an example for how IKK is persistently activated in cancer cells.  \nThe focus of Chapter III is CYLD, a deubiquitination enzyme that regulates the ubiquitination and signaling function of key components involved in activation of NF-&#954;B.  By employing CYLD knockout mice, we discovered a novel function of CYLD in the regulation of antiviral responses.  CYLD deficiency causes constitutive activation of the atypical I&#954;B kinases, IKK&#949; and TBK1, and aberrant induction of type I interferons (IFN-Is) in virus-infected cells.  CYLD acts by preventing basal ubiquitination and signaling function of an IKK&#949;/TBK1 activator, RIG-I.  Interestingly, despite their competence in IFN production, the CYLD-deficient cells and mice are considerably more susceptible to viral infection.  We provided genetic evidence that IFN-induced signaling and antiviral gene expression are attenuated in the absence of CYLD.  These findings suggest that CYLD mediates effective and controlled antiviral responses by preventing IKK&#949;/TBK1 deregulation and modulating IFN receptor signaling.  Since IKK&#949;/TBK1 deregulation is associated with oncogenesis, these findings also have implications on the tumor suppressor function of CYLD. \nBased on that CYLD negatively regulates IKK&#949;/TBK1, Chapter IV is dedicated to investigate the crosstalk between IKK&#949;/TBK1 and CYLD by focusing on mechanism of CYLD phosphorylation.  Previously, we observed that CYLD undergoes transient phosphorylation at an IKK&#947; (NEMO)-dependent manner.  In this chapter, I described the identification of a critical serine site, Ser418 of CYLD as an inducible phosphorylation site using mass spectrometry analysis and a phospho-specific &#945;-CYLD antibody.  Mutation of serine 418 to alanine renders CYLD superactive, since expression of the CYLD S418A mutant blocks the activation of IKK and JNK by mitogens and TNF&#945;.

A series of experiments is designed to challenge the assumptions of several basic theoretical models used in supply chain management that have ignored behavioral dynamics. We use controlled experimental settings to confront decision makers (mostly college students) with decision tasks conformed to the assumptions being tested. Our human subjects are motivated by real financial incentives based on their performance in the simulated game. The dissertation includes three interrelated essays. Chapters I and II provide an empirical test of the supply chain contracting theory. This theory assumes that supply chain members behave in a way that maximizes their own expected profits. However, our experimental results in Chapter I show that retailers have decision biases and often deviate from the optimal newsvendor solutions, whereas suppliers tend to behave risk-aversely rather than risk-neutrally. In addition, the results in Chapter II suggest that channel members have preferences over both their pecuniary payoff and their relative payoff standing. In other words, they are not purely self-interested but rather fairness-concerned. In Chapter III, we investigate mechanisms to reduce the bullwhip behavior, using the well-known Beer Distribution Game. And we find that when participants have obtained system-wide training experience and are allowed to communicate with their channel partners, the variability of orders in supply chains can be greatly decreased. This dissertation contributes to bridging the gap between two traditionally divergent fields of behavioral theory and operations management by identifying behavioral factors that have significant impact on the predictions of operational models. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6872], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Yan ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elena Katok", "Gary Bolton", "V Daniel R Guide Jr.", "Arunachalam Ravindran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elena Katok, Committee Chair", "Gary Bolton, Committee Member", "V Daniel R Guide Jr., Committee Member", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Coordination and Contract", "Supply Chain Management", "Experimental Economics", "Bullwhip Effect"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Effects of practicing accurate force production tasks on multi-digit coordination: Performance, synergies, and transfer", "id": "22631", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10200", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Humans become less susceptible to environmental or intrinsic perturbations with practicing a motor task, not only because they are better at correcting the task-relevant errors, but also due to the improvement of flexible involvement of their body to channel parts of the perturbations into the changes of task-irrelevant body configuration. The four studies in this dissertation explored the effects of practice of a finger force production task with adjustable instability encouraging involvement of elements (fingers) on multi-finger coordination quantified within the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis in which variance is decomposed into two components: VUCM that had no effect on total force, and VORT that affected total force. The first study showed that practicing a redundant set of fingers (R-task) and practicing each finger separately (non-redundant, NR-task) may lead to similar changes in performance accompanied by dramatically different changes in the total variance in the space of commands to fingers. Practicing R-task led to higher variability in the system with lower variability in task performance. In the second study, the elderly population demonstrated ability comparable to the younger persons to improve task performance by combining high variability with high precision. However, the effects of practice partially transferred to a simpler task on the performance improvement with no transfer of the effects on the structure of variance. The third study explored the effects of practice of a more natural four-finger force production task, and revealed that the short practice of the four-finger task with adjustable task instability also led to a change in the structure of variance characterized by a decrease in VORT and an increase in VUCM.

However, transmitting large numbers of photos/videos in a wireless environment with bandwidth constraints is challenging, and it is hard to run computation-intensive image processing techniques on mobile devices with limited energy and computation power to identify the useful photos/videos and remove redundancy.  To address these challenges, we propose a framework to quantify the quality of crowdsourced photos/videos based on the accessible geographical and geometrical information (called metadata) including the orientation, position, and all other related parameters of the built-in camera. From metadata, we can infer where and how the photo/video is taken, and then only transmit the most useful photos/videos.\n\nThe goal of this dissertation is to design and evaluate metadata-based techniques to support resource-aware crowdsourcing in wireless networks.\nFirst, we propose a metadata-based framework called SmartPhoto which can select the most useful photos to cover the specified points of interest. Optimization problems regarding the tradeoffs between photo coverage and resource utilization are formalized and efficient algorithms with provable performance bounds are designed and evaluated.  Furthermore, SmartPhoto has been evaluated through real experiments with Android smartphones, and various techniques have been designed to improve the accuracy of the collected metadata.\nSecond, for some applications, the target of interest is an area rather than a point. Thus, we extend SmartPhoto to select the most useful photos to cover an area of interest.  Since there are infinite number of points in an area and each point can be covered differently, area coverage is hard to analyze. To address this problem, we study how to select photos with the best area coverage under resource constraints and propose an efficient algorithm with provable performance bound.\nThird, for applications such as disaster recovery and battlefield, the cellular network may be partly damaged or severely overloaded, and thus photos have to be delivered through Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs).  In DTNs, data can only be transferred when two devices are within the wireless transmission range of each other, and the storage of each device is also limited. Therefore, it is important to prioritize more valuable photos to use the limited resources. We quantify the value of the photos based on their metadata, and propose a distributed photo selection algorithm to maximize the value of the photos delivered to the server considering bandwidth and storage constraints.\nFinally, we propose VideoMec, a crowdsourcing system which organizes the metadata of all videos taken by mobile devices. VideoMec supports comprehensive queries for any application to find and fetch desired videos from the corresponding mobile devices.  For time-critical applications, it may not be possible to upload all desired videos in time due to limited wireless bandwidth and large video files. Thus, we propose efficient algorithms to select the most important videos or video segments to upload under bandwidth constraints.

Along with John Tenniel\u2019s illustrations, Alice has been an enduring enchantment for both Western and Eastern readers and has inspired authors and artists to initiate their own creativity journeys.  Looking at this classic text through the perspective of reader-response theory, I find Alice is laden with \u201cmobility\u201d that prompts people to rework and refashion it in various ways: books, movies, video games, and so on.  Mobility is what the story is all about: movement and change.  Likewise, mobility serves as a stimulus that incites readers to imagination and action.  In the context of reading, this mobility spreads through three different aspects: the author, the reader, and the text.  Each aspect needs to play along with the others, so that the story can remain alive and create meanings for more than one generation.  In order to explore how the mobility in the original Alice has inspired contemporary authors and artists to engage their readers, three types of book adaptations (picturebooks, pop-up books, and an e-book) that were published after the year 1999 have been scrutinized.  Through close reading, I have focused on what in Alice makes the movements possible and how each version of the book uses the medium traits to transmit the mobility that starts with the original.  My reading response is also provided as an example of the engagement that a text invites.  The findings suggest that Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice contains \u201cdrive\u201d to make different renderings show motions in special ways.  The picturebook versions employ the interaction of word and image to convey the inherent mobility whereas the pop-up books rebel against or adapt the traditional structures of the picturebook to create the movement that brings the story to life.  The e-book app uses the interface of the tablet computer to imitate the 3D effects of the pop-up book and bring the animation of the text to its full potential.  As the reader can detect and connect the mobility in the original to other media representations, the sphere of the reading experience can be enhanced and expanded.  Moreover, we can also recognize the boundless activities to which a story narrative can take us. \n ", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7585, 7586], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Ying-Chi ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying-Chi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh", "Daniel Dean Hade", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh", "Steven Herb", "Esther Susana Prins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade, Dissertation Advisor", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Dean Hade, Committee Chair", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh, Committee Chair", "Steven Herb, Committee Member", "Esther Susana Prins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Alice in Wonderland", "media adaptations", "mobility", "picturebook", "pop-up book", "e-book"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Fractional Quantum Hall States in Continuum and Lattice Systems", "id": "22449", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10257", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, I will present theoretical studies on several aspects of quantum Hall states in both continuum and lattice systems.\n\nIn the continuum case, one can understand the quantum Hall states starting from the Landau levels of charged particles moving in a magnetic field. If an integral number of Landau levels are completely filled with non-interacting fermions due to the Pauli principle, we can get an integer quantum Hall state. When there are strong interactions between fermions or bosons, fractional quantum Hall states can be realized. These states can not be understood using perturbation theory but requires emergent concepts for their nterpretations. In the composite fermion theory, fractional quantum Hall states of physical particles are mapped to integer quantum Hall states of emergent particles known as composite fermions. It is demonstrated that the edge excitations of the fermionic fractional quantum Hall states at filling factor 2/3 and a variety of quantum Hall states for two-component bosons can be explained using the composite fermion theory.\n\nWhen the quantum Hall problem is formulated on lattices, the topological aspects of the quantum Hall states can be revealed. A topological invariant called the Chern number may be defined for the Bloch bands of lattice systems. An integer quantum Hall state occurs in a fermionic system when the total Chern number of the occupied bands of the system is non-zero. Fractional quantum Hall states can appear for interacting particles in a nearly flat Bloch band with Chern number 1. It is shown that such states are adiabatically connected to those in continuum. Lattice models which possess bands with Chern numbers larger than 1 are constructed and exotic fractional topological phases are identified in such bands. The similarities and differences between these lattice models and conventional multi-layer quantum Hall systems are examined in detail.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9940], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Yinghai ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yinghai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain", "Jainendra Jain", "Victor Nistor", "Nathan David Gemelke", "Chaoxing Liu", "Nitin Samarth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain, Dissertation Advisor", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Chair", "Victor Nistor, Committee Member", "Nathan David Gemelke, Committee Member", "Chaoxing Liu, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["topological phases", "quantum Hall states", "composite fermions", "quantum gases", "synthetic gauge fields"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "REGULATION OF IRON-SULFUR CLUSTER BIOGENESIS IN CYANOBACTERIA\n", "id": "8592", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6877", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, I present my studies on the two regulators for iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis in cyanobacteria, SYNPCC7002_A0128 and SufR. \nSYNPCC7002_A0128 is a homologue of IscR, the transcriptional regulator for iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis in Escherichia coli.

Our previous microarray study showed that the mRNA expression of CD300B was significantly up-regulated by RA treatment. We hypothesize herein that RA, alone or with other cell activator such as phorbol ester PMA, regulates CD300B expression, both at the gene level and the protein level, in THP-1 cells.  \nOur results showed that RA and PMA synergistically increased the expression of human CD300B mRNA. RA alone increased the level of human CD300B mRNA by 20-fold, while PMA alone increased CD300B mRNA by less than 5-fold. Interestingly, if we treated the THP-1 cells with RA and PMA at the same time, the combination increased the human CD300B mRNA level to about 60-fold, comparing to the control. Secondly, the expression of endogenous CD300B protein in THP-1 cells was increased by PMA treatment, but not RA treatment. Furthermore, CD300B molecules were mainly located on the plasma membrane and in the endosomal compartment, sharing a similar distribution pattern to transferrin receptor CD71. Finally, the cell signaling of PMA which induced the expression of CD300B mRNA was through the MEK/ERK pathway.

Increasingly we see that teacher shortages have led to increasing mobility of teachers across national borders in both South-to-North and South-to-South directions.  At the same time, international exchange programs designed to support the professional status of teachers in the developed nations appear to have stagnated. While \u201cteacher quality,\u201d is currently a topic of much concern, rarely do cross-national studies consider teachers as a workforce.  I argue that prevailing theoretical paradigms used to analyze global trends in mass school (e.g. neo-institutionalism, world culture, core-periphery theories, etc.) ignore the growing body of research on the teaching workforce compiled by economists and scholars of the labor market. In this dissertation, I explore how labor-market theorists, conceptualize the issue of teachers as members of a workforce.  I discuss how the works of transnational actors (UNESCO, OECD, Teach for All) have created situations where the teachers\u2019 job has been homogenized and de-contextualized from local surroundings.  These theories suggest that nations and trans-national organizations engage in long-term efforts to raise the professional status of teaching, that teaching will continue on a trajectory to a lower-skill occupation that will be increasing see greater trans-national mobility, lower job stability and long-term erosion of the social status of teachers.\nMoreover, I track the trajectory of transnational teacher mobility overtime and find that this phenomenon did not begin recently. It has existed since the late nineteenth century, when some European Missionary teachers moved around in Africa. They were there not only for religious purposes, but were also acting as \u201cagents\u201d of colonial power. After World War II, a growing number of teachers started to teach abroad through the teacher exchange program established by mainly nation state or government-related institutions to broaden the understanding of other cultures, customs, and languages. These programs became prevalent among developed countries during the Cold War period. In the present era of increased globalization, it has become apparent that an increasing number of teachers flow across national boundaries because of organized international recruitment.\nBy analyzing significant cases and using historical, cross-national, and other forms of data, I conclude that there are three models of global teacher mobility, which can be categorized by the historical period, program goals, as well as teachers\u2019 roles. These are the \u201cColonial model,\u201d the \u201cNation-exchange model,\u201d and the \u201cMarket-driven model.\u201d In addition, the roles and functions that significant institutional actors play also shift over time. In the Colonial model, colonial governments were the only actors to plan and ship teachers to the colonial territories since education was a major channel to \u201ccivilized \u201c colonists and keep them in a state of obedience. \nIn the nation-exchange model, nation states played a critical role and were heavily involved in the operation of transnational teacher mobility. Teacher-exchange programs under this model were primarily established and implemented by nation states, local authorities, or government-sponsored organizations. Governments or government-related institutions have become the most important agencies that facilitate and promote international teacher exchange.

Typical approaches for addressing this problem are distributional semantic models, which represent a linguistic item by vector space on its distributional contexts in a corpus or knowledge base. Various distributional semantic models have been proposed, such as latent semantic analysis, explicit semantic analysis, etc., which have been successfully applied to many natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) applications.\n\nDespite a long history and a rich literature on distributional semantic modeling and its applications, several important issues have not been fully studied. First, most methods do not measure the semantics of a word in its context, but give equal importance to different occurrences of a word in different contexts. This gives the first question: how to accurately model the differences of a word in different contexts. Besides the lack of context-awareness, most methods treat all occurrences of a word as the same and build a single vector to represent the meaning of a word, which fails to capture any ambiguity, leading to the second question: how to build a sense-aware semantic profile for a word that can give accurate sense-specific prototypes in terms of both quantity and quality. In addition, most methods have the close world assumption, assuming that the corpus or knowledge base used for semantic modeling is complete and can give the best representation for a word. However, this might not always hold, especially for the out-of-knowledge base (KB) world. This motivates our third line of research on modeling out-of-KB entities, such as those entities defined only in local content, emerging novel entities or news event entities that do not exist in the knowledge base.\n\nMotivated by these observations, this dissertation seeks to address the three limitations on context-awareness, sense-awareness and close world assumption by exploring a set of research problems. Specifically, we study measuring word importance in context, sense-aware semantic analysis (SaSA), and out-of-KB entity modeling. We propose a new metric namely context-aware term informativeness and apply it to various applications including concept/keyword extraction and back-of-the-book index generation. We present SaSA, a multi-prototype vector space model for word representation based on Wikipedia, and apply it to various text semantic relatedness measurement tasks. Finally, we study the modeling of typical cases of out-of-KB entities including locally-defined entities, emerging novel entities, and news event entities. For locally-defined entities, we apply a within document search approach to find the most descriptive passages to profile a given entity and evaluate it on fictional character name entities. For novel entities, we explored various feature spaces for modeling the entities and built a high-precision novel entity detector that can be applied as a pre-filtering step to improve existing entity linking systems. For news events, we studied how to build a news event knowledge base by taking advantage of Wikipedia current events.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11779], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, Zhaohui ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhaohui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Lee Giles", "Daniel Kifer", "Wang Chien Lee", "Jia Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Lee Giles, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Kifer, Committee Chair", "Wang Chien Lee, Committee Member", "Jia Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Entity Representation", "Wikipedia", "Sense Representation", "Term Informativeness", "Locally-defined Entity", "Novel Entity Discovery"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on Financial Contracting and Real Estate\n\n", "id": "7071", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5605", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-08-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis consists of three essays.\n\nIn the first essay, we examine the option compensation problem of how to optimally set the option exercise price when options have conflicting roles in both inducing management effort and encouraging management cheating. In the risk-neutral setting with both hidden information and hidden actions, we establish that the larger the information gap between the principal and the manager is, the lower the option exercise price should be set. In a dynamic extension that involves at-the-money options only, we prove that it is optimal to grant more options even following a bad stock performance. Further, we prove that the strategy of granting short-term options dominates that of granting long-term options and then repricing, if options become out of money.\n\nIn the second essay we analyze the agency problems caused by the tax timing conflict of interest in Umbrella Real Estate Investment Trusts (UPREITs). The tax timing conflict arises if management\u00a1\u00afs tax basis is lower than that of REIT shareholders. Management may be reluctant to sell the properties because it may trigger large build-in capital gains tax for them. After having controlled for the difference in tax basis and various other factors, we find that the UPREIT share price suffers additional discount. This finding is consistent with that UPREITs suffer additional agency problems related to tax timing conflict of interest. Moreover, we also demonstrate that it can be optimal not to defer tax in real estate transactions when the income tax rate is higher than the capital gains tax rate.\n\nIn the third essay we examine how the pricing differences between the public (securitized) and private real estate markets along with other factors may influence REITs\u00a1\u00af property selling decisions. Current research supports the conclusion that REITs actively arbitrage only if real estate pricing in public market is higher than in private market. Using a large sample of REIT property holding data, we however find that REITs are also active in exploiting price differences when real estate pricing in public market is lower. Furthermore, we identify a series of important factors in REITs\u00a1\u00af property selling decisions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5595], "author_name_tesi": "Wu, ZhiYi ", "last_name_ssi": "Wu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "ZhiYi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Michael Lusht", "Abdullah Yavas", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse", "Lisa Lipowski Posey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Michael Lusht, Committee Member", "Abdullah Yavas, Committee Chair", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse, Committee Member", "Lisa Lipowski Posey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tax", "Moral Hazard", "Hidden Information", "Real Estate Investment Trust", "Stock Options", "Compensation"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "English and Chinese Language Assessment of DSM-5 Personality Disorders and Interpersonal Problems in Bilingual Speakers", "id": "15354zow5029", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15354", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A review of the literature on Chinese translations of Western self-report personality assessment measures indicates the need to empirically evaluate of the validity of assessing Western personality and clinical constructs in the Chinese language and culture.

This study examined six co-occurring tree species within three genera (3 congeneric contrasts; Carya glabra and C. tomentosa, Pinus strobus and P. virginiana, Quercus alba and Q. prinus) under naturally occurring soil moisture gradients. Within each genus, species differed significantly in distribution along gradients of soil moisture (P < 0.003), with one species preferentially occupying wetter sites and the other occupying drier sites. I hypothesized that hydraulic architecture might partially explain variation in the distribution of species. I measured a suite of hydraulic architecture parameters including maximum specific hydraulic conductivity (ks max), leaf specific hydraulic conductivity (LSC), and xylem vulnerability at three levels of percent loss of maximum hydraulic conductivity (P20, P50, and P70). The congeneric contrasts within oaks and within hickories showed no significant differences for any of the parameters. For pines, the species associated with drier sites, P. virginiana, was more resistant to cavitation, which was consistent with my hypothesis. In general, species that preferentially occurred on drier sites tended to have higher maximum specific conductivity (P = 0.0039), which was opposite the expected water-conserving strategy hypothesized for drought-adapted species. These results suggest that these measures of hydraulic architecture of stems in mature trees may play only a minor role in explaining species-level variation in distribution on the landscape. This research invites further investigation into other potential limiting factors that may be controlling tree species distribution in the hill and valley region of central Pennsylvania. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2758], "author_name_tesi": "Wubbels, Jane ", "last_name_ssi": "Wubbels", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jane", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dave Eissenstat", "David Eissenstat"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dave Eissenstat, Thesis Advisor", "David Eissenstat, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydraulic architecture", "xylem vulnerability", "conductivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION AND ANALYSIS OF DROSOPHILA PCF11\n", "id": "10768", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3109", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Transcription cycle can be divided into three stages: initiation, elongation and termination. The process of transcription termination decreases the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and ultimately disrupts the association of Pol II with DNA. Termination is essential for recycling Pol II and for preventing Pol II from interfering with downstream gene transcription. Pcf11 (protein 1 of CF I) was first identified as a functional component of yeast cleavage and polyadenylation factor I. Pcf11 is involved in transcription termination. The Pcf11 mRNA in FlyBase was annotated by piecing together several cDNA clones, but only one of the cDNA clones contained a complete open reading frame. In addition, I observed that Pcf11 RNAi decreased the level of a protein around 200 kDa, which was different from Dr. Zhang\u2019s observation. To obtain an assessment of Pcf11 that would be independent of our Pcf11 antibody, I analyzed Pcf11 mRNA. I characterized two groups of Pcf11 transcripts, which encode two forms of Pcf11. One is 63 kDa, the other is 201 kDa Pcf11. Both large and small forms of Pcf11 have identical protein sequences for the first 515 amino acid residues, but have different sequences for the rest of the C-terminus. The N-terminal regions of both proteins encode the same domain that has been shown to associate with the carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II. Thus, both forms of the protein could potentially be involved in regulating Pol II. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) suggests that the short Pcf11 transcript is expressed at a significantly higher level in embryos than in cell lines or larval tissues, and that the long Pcf11 transcript is expressed at similar levels among various tissues. RT-PCR also shows that the expression level of the two transcripts is unaffected by various stresses.\nA native gel system and an in vitro dismantling assay were used to analyze the interaction between the CID (CTD-interacting domain) of Pcf11 and CTD of Rpb1, the largest subunit of Pol II. The native gel analysis shows that the CID interacts with the elongation complex mainly via CTD, and that the CID has a weak interaction with CTD-less Pol II. In contrast to work previously done in our laboratory, I was unable to detect any activity associated with Pcf11 that dismantles the elongation complex. I did find that the CID inhibited elongation by CTD-containing but not CTD-less Pol II at high nucleotide concentrations but inhibited both forms of Pol II at low nucleotide concentrations. I propose that the interaction with the CTD might contribute to the association of Pcf11 with the Pol II but interactions with the body of the Pol II are capable of regulating Pol II transcription.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3098], "author_name_tesi": "Wung, Ju-Chieh ", "last_name_ssi": "Wung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ju-Chieh", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Scott Gilmour", "David Scott Gilmour"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Scott Gilmour, Thesis Advisor", "David Scott Gilmour, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["transcription termination", "Pcf11"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Analyzing tropical cyclone structures during secondary eyewall formation using aircraft in-situ observations", "id": "15211kew29", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15211", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the evolution of mature tropical cyclones (TCs), intensity and structural changes can\noccur due to a process called an eyewall replacement cycle (ERC).

This study was designed to provide a compositional and structural description of late-successional oak stands (here stand age-defined as 120-200 years old) in Pennsylvania that can define attribute guidelines for structural complexity enhancement silviculture capable of fostering old forest attributes in younger oak stands not just in Pennsylvania, but throughout the oak-dominated Central Appalachian region.  Specifically, the objectives of this project were 1) to validate the expectation that late-successional forests (defined in this study based on age) differ from mid-successional forests (defined in this study based on age) in terms of the abundance or quality of important structural habitat attributes and 2) to provide a thorough quantitative description of those late-successional attributes to guide structural complexity enhancement management practices.  A set of five late-successional oak stands were sampled in the summer of 2012 to characterize overstory and midcanopy composition, low woody vegetation, canopy gaps, and decadence attributes including snags, cavity trees, and coarse woody debris.  These data were compared with state inventory data of mid-successional stands (here stand age-defined as 60-100 years old) of the same forest type.  The diameter distribution in late-successional stands followed a rotated sigmoid, while that in mid-successional stands followed a negative exponential distribution.  Late-successional stands had lower live stem density (p=0.002), higher actual and relative stem densities of large stems (p=0.007 and 0.020, respectively), a larger quadratic mean diameter (p=0.034), a lower canopy profile indicating more vertical canopy stratification (categorical p-values=0.000-0.042), higher densities of large snags (p=0.042), cavity trees (p=0.004), and advanced-decay coarse woody debris (p=0.025).

Published studies shows a high compatibility between U.S. Air Force bases and combined heat and power systems, but the technical and economic issues unique to military applications are not well-characterized.  Federal, DoD and U.S. Air Force energy policies require drastic improvement in energy efficiency and environmental impact while implementing new energy sources to meet published goals.  Combined heat and power application at U.S. Air Force bases is analyzed with these considerations using three methods to further characterize the potential to utilize these systems.\nThis thesis develops and applies a methodology to evaluate the technical and economic applicability of combined heat and power systems at U.S. Air Force bases.  Results show that 38 bases within the U.S. have favorable economic conditions to use combined heat and power.  An in-depth study at five bases using monthly utility data shows combined heat and power is a feasible alternative that can provide increased energy security, reduced emissions, and an increase in source-based energy efficiency when utility pricing is favorable.  A technical application study is performed at Hill AFB using hourly data and a truncated-year analysis to further characterize site-specific applications factors for these systems.  Finally, applicable energy mandates and goals for the U.S. Air Force are reviewed to establish the climate for combined heat and power systems.

The PZT fibers provide the electromechanical actuation and sensing capabilities derived from the inherent piezoelectricity of PZT. The role of the epoxy matrix is to transfer the external loads amongst the fibers while also serving as protection to enable more flexibility in the AFC device as a whole. Interdigitated electrodes (IDE) placed on the planar surfaces of the AFC are along the direction of the fibers, hereby exploiting the d33 coefficient of PZT, which is twice that of the d31 coefficient. Despite this clever strategy, the AFC electromechanical response is lower than that of bulk PZT. Although the polymer matrix has been widely studied, the PZT fibers have not. By directly characterizing the behavior of PZT fibers, recommendations to redesign of the AFC with the goal of improving its performance can be proposed. Therefore, it is important to characterize the electrical and electromechanical behavior of these fibers ex-situ using the IDE configuration to assess the impact of fiber configuration and non-uniform electric field on the piezoelectric response. \t\n\n\tFor this reason, the broad goal of this thesis is to characterize the impact of IDE electrodes on the electrical and electromechanical behavior of PZT fibers, which is necessary for their successful implementation in devices like AFC.

Therefore, to accomplish the broad goal of this study, the following research tasks are planned: 1.) To characterize PZT fibers with parallel electrodes; the parallel electrode testing will determine baseline properties that will be compared to the IDE results and will also allow for quantification of the fiber geometry\u2019s impact on the bulk PZT properties. 2.) To characterize PZT fibers using IDE configuration; the characterization of PZT fibers ex-situ with the IDE configuration will convey the PZT fiber behavior in the AFC to assist in improving the AFC design. 3.) To experimentally determine Young\u2019s modulus, coercive field, remnant polarization, dielectric permittivity and both d33 and e33 piezoelectric coefficients of PZT fibers. \n\n\tTo the best of our knowledge, these results will be the first dielectric permittivity, d33 and e33 values determined with direct measurement of PZT fibers using both parallel electrode and IDE configurations. These results will allow for direct comparison of bulk PZT and PZT fiber properties as well as the impact of the nonuniform electric filed generated by the IDE. The PZT fiber mechanical properties and dielectric permittivity measured with parallel electrodes were found to be approximately 65% of the bulk PZT fibers. The fiber\u2019s Young\u2019s modulus was determined to be 33 GPa and the dielectric permittivity determined to be 1115. The PZT fiber IDE remnant polarization, dielectric permittivity, and e33 results were found to be within the range of 50%-75% of the results found for parallel electrode configuration. The combined reduction found in the PZT fiber properties compared to bulk PZT leads to the conclusion that implementing the fiber properties into AFC models will result in a substantially different response.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11823], "author_name_tesi": "Wyckoff, Nicholas Gregory", "last_name_ssi": "Wyckoff", "middle_name_ssi": "Gregory", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zoubeida Ounaies"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zoubeida Ounaies, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["PZT", "fiber", "parallel", "interdigitated", "electrodes", "electromechanical", "piezoelectric", "permittivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "STRESSORS, SUPPORT FOR INNOVATION, OPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE\n\nAND CONSCIENTIOUSNESS AS PREDICTORS OF DEPERSONALIZATION\n\nAND PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT AMONG\n\nCANADIAN SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS\n\n", "id": "8277", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3716", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Professional stress and burnout can be substantial issues for school psychologists. Beehr\u2019s (1994) model of stress was applied to a national sample of Canadian school psychologists in the investigation of stressors, levels of burnout, and the moderator variables of conscientiousness, openness of experience, and climate for innovation. The present study identified a four-factor solution of the School Psychology Stress Inventory (Wise, 1985) using principal axis factoring with varimax rotation, and themes emerging from the present four-factor solution are consistent with previous research. Although studies of stress have been conducted with samples of school psychologists, research has not examined the moderator of climate for innovation. Hierarchical regression determined the degree to which scores of the School Psychology Stress Inventory (Wise, 1985), NEO-Five Factor Inventory Form S (Costa & McCrae, 1992), and Climate for Innovation Measure (Scott & Bruce, 1994) added to the prediction of personal accomplishment or depersonalization as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach & Jackson, 1986). The models predicting the criterion of depersonalization explained, at maximum, 22% of the variance and the models predicting personal accomplishment predicted, at maximum, 17% of the variance. When factor scores for stress were entered into the models, an increase in variance explained in the prediction of depersonalization and personal accomplishment was evident (28.9% and 25.4%, respectively). Implications of these Canadian findings are discussed in terms of the theoretical model, the constraints of school psychologists\u2019 roles in various systems, and implications for practice. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3697], "author_name_tesi": "Wyglinski, Laura A.", "last_name_ssi": "Wyglinski", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "School Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Schaefer", "Robert Leslie Hale", "Marley Watkins", "Alicia Grandey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Schaefer, Committee Chair", "Robert Leslie Hale, Committee Member", "Marley Watkins, Committee Member", "Alicia Grandey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["burnout", "stress", "school psychologists", "factor analysis", "personality"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "College Reimagined:  A Study of Affordability & Radical Organizational Change", "id": "13305jaw1101", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13305", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the U.S., rising student debt and growing public dissatisfaction with the cost of college are pressuring colleges and universities to change. While most leaders of postsecondary institutions would like to innovate to meet this affordability challenge, such change is intrinsically difficult due to the structural inertia that mires the entire field of higher education. This predicament is especially arduous for small private institutions without large endowments or donor bases to offset their reliance on tuition. These institutions are already struggling to survive, making affordability a secondary priority at best. However, one of these small, non-wealthy institutions reinvented itself in an effort to meet these affordability and viability challenges. This dissertation examines that institution. \n\nFaith College, a small and relatively unknown Christian institution in the Midwest, remade itself rapidly over the course of a few years to offer affordable, three-year degrees to students. By redesigning its curriculum and reimagining its value proposition, the institution became both more affordable and viable in a few short years. \n\nUsing a mixed-methods case study approach, this dissertation blends grounded theory and existing conceptual frameworks to analyze the driving forces behind the institution\u2019s transformation during this period. Based on 16 interviews, hours of observation, and several hundred pages of institutional documents, this research distills three core findings from Faith\u2019s example. \n\nFirst, high levels of social capital between administrators and employees created trust between leaders and followers. Second, a compelling sense of urgency within the institution helped overcome the structural inertia that typically constrains colleges and universities. By engaging in sensegiving, leveraging the exogenous shock of the Great Recession, and building a change-minded culture through the process of attraction-selection-socialization-attrition (ASSA), senior leaders cultivated an openness to change. Finally, the institution developed a mentality of academic capitalism that provided a focused, data-driven framework for decision-making and contributed additional resources through partnerships with local businesses. \n\nThis study demonstrates how social capital can be exchanged and transferred; how organizational inertia can be overcome through a combination of leadership, sensegiving, and contextual advantages; and how academic capitalism can benefit small, non-wealthy, private institutions. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13262], "author_name_tesi": "Wymore, Joshua Aaron", "last_name_ssi": "Wymore", "middle_name_ssi": "Aaron", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Jesse Cheslock", "John Jesse Cheslock", "Liang Zhang", "David S Guthrie", "Glen Kreiner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Jesse Cheslock, Dissertation Advisor", "John Jesse Cheslock, Committee Chair", "Liang Zhang, Committee Member", "David S Guthrie, Committee Member", "Glen Kreiner, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["higher education", "affordability", "student debt", "innovation", "change", "small private", "liberal arts", "leadership", "transformation", "sensegiving", "ASSA", "academic capitalism", "crisis", "tuition dependent"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Fine Sediment Deposition and Storage in Sandy-Fluvial Systems", "id": "24904", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11146", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sandy-fluvial deposits are important hydrocarbon and water reservoirs. However, they can be difficult to predict and efficiently produce due to particle-size heterogeneities ranging from pore to basin scale. Fine sediment (silt and clay) is transported as suspended load and is either bypassed through a river as wash load or is deposited and stored in the channel bed or on the floodplain. Clay accumulations in subsurface-channel deposits can cause porosity and permeability reduction at the pore scale and act as baffles and barriers that compartmentalize flow at reservoir scales. Grain-size heterogeneity within fluvial deposits may record paleo-flow variability and/or paleo-sediment supply, but without improved understanding of the conditions under which clay can accumulate in sandy river beds, it is difficult to uniquely interpret these deposits. \nIn order to better understand the processes controlling when and where fine sediment accumulates in sandy river beds, I conducted a series of physical experiments to test if there is a relationship between supplied-clay concentration and the amount of clay preserved in a river bed under constant- and variable-discharge conditions.  In three constant-discharge experiments, clay was added in concentrations of 1,000 mg/l, 4,000 mg/l and 8,500 mg/l. An additional experiment with 1000 mg/l clay concentration was conducted with variable water discharge, where discharge was slowed to a stop every hour of run time and clay allowed to settle for one hour three times and once overnight.  After each experiment, samples were collected from the dry bed and analyzed for clay content, and clay deposits observable in the bed were mapped in order to determine the nature and distribution of clay accumulations in the bed. \nResults demonstrate that under constant-discharge conditions, clay can accumulate in the bed and that the amount of clay retained in the bed is related to the amount of clay supplied to the flume.  In experiments with a low clay concentrations, little to no clay accumulated in the bed, while under high clay concentration, as much as 5-10% of the bed is comprised of clay rich lenses and 40% of the bed is likely to have clay intercalated in pore space.  Additionally, clay accumulations that form under constant-discharge conditions have a unique character and may be differentiable from those formed under variable-discharge flows.  Clay accumulations deposited under variable discharge appear as discontinuous clay drapes, while under constant flow conditions they appear as continuous clay drapes, clay rich lenses, and intercalated clay.  In all experiments, clay retention was highest in the main aggradational phase of the runs, with markedly less clay preserved during bypass.  These results suggest the nature of clay accumulations in sandy channel deposits may be useful for reconstructing paleo-discharge conditions, and that subsurface reservoir quality may be predictable if these conditions can be constrained. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10709], "author_name_tesi": "Wysocki, Nathaniel P", "last_name_ssi": "Wysocki", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Nathaniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Ann Hajek"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Ann Hajek, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["fluvial sedimentology", "fine sediment", "sandy fluvial systems", "sedimentology", "surface processes", "fluvial"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE LABOR MIGRATION OF CHINESE NURSES TO THE UNITED STATES:\nEXPERIENCES OF CHINESE NURSES\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "9078", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3873", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-01-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Most countries in the world today, including industrialized countries like the United States (U.S.), are experiencing a shortage of registered nurses (RNs).

Low phosphorus (P) availability is a primary constraint to plant productivity in both natural forest lands and agro-ecosystems. P nutrition is very important for biological N fixation which has been promoted in many farming systems using non-edible or edible crops. Root architectural traits that enhance topsoil foraging increase P acquisition in several crops including common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). P efficient common bean is an edible crop that besides of having superior P acquisition efficiency in low P soils, also can fix atmospheric nitrogen to reduce N deficiency in soils; having better P and N nutrition P-efficient beans can grow faster and more vigorously than P-inefficient bean. Therefore, they can protect better the soil in slopping lands that are common in the major bean growing areas of Africa and Latin America. Maize/bean polyculture is an important cropping system in developing countries in which most farmers often cultivate common bean poor soils characterized by low phosphorus (P) availability. In this context we determined important to test three hypotheses in this study as follow: (1) root architectural traits that increase P acquisition in bean will also enhance nodulation and biological N fixation; (2) bean cultivars with root traits enhancing P acquisition can improve bean yields but could decrease maize yields because of altered below-and-aboveground competition; (3) topsoil exploration have greater phosphorus (P) acquisition than conventional genotypes, but long term depletion of soil P by more efficient acquisition may be counteracted by lower soil erosion from greater crop biomass and canopy cover. Bean genotypes with contrasting root architecture in the three studies conducted in USA \u2013 Pennsylvania State University (PSU) Agriculture Research Farm, Mozambique in Lichinga Research Station of the Agrarian Research Institute of Mozambique (IIAM), and in the Republic of South Africa at the Ukulima Root Biology Center. For the Symbiotic nitrogen fixation study we found that, compared with P-inefficient genotypes, P-efficient genotypes had 24.8% greater growth and 39% greater symbiotic N2 fixation under low P. They also had 41% greater nodulation and 57% greater nodule activity than P-inefficient genotypes under low P conditions. For the conservation study, the shallow-rooted genotypes had greater shoot biomass, canopy cover, and less erosion than deep-rooted genotypes. And for the maize/bean competition study was determined that under high P, the bean monoculture yielded approximately 3.8 Mg ha-1 regardless of root phenotype, but under low P the shallow-rooted and deep-rooted bean categories had yield reductions of 55.3 and 75.5%, respectively. Under low P in polyculture, the shallow-rooted bean yield was 1.04 Mg ha-1 which was 43.3% greater than the yield of the deep-rooted phenotypes. We conclude that bean genotypes with root traits permitting greater P acquisition can also fix more atmospheric nitrogen, consequently attain better shoot growth which also result in greater grain yield; more robust plants makes better canopy cover, and reduces soil P lost to water erosion in low P tropical soils. There is   need for selection of appropriate matches of root systems in low-input polycultures. Breeding efforts to generate seeds of plants with efficient root system is very important since can result in better nutrient use and higher crop productivity in poor soils, generating some income to that can be used to purchase fertilizer by poor farmers to start more profitable agriculture", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5504], "author_name_tesi": "Xerinda, Soares Almeida", "last_name_ssi": "Xerinda", "middle_name_ssi": "Almeida", "first_name_ssi": "Soares", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Peter J A Kleinman", "Ricky M Bates", "David A Mortensen", "Kathleen Marie Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch, Dissertation Advisor", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Chair", "Peter J A Kleinman, Committee Member", "Ricky M Bates, Committee Member", "David A Mortensen, Committee Member", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Root architecture", "P-efficient beans", "N-fixation", "erosion", "maize-bean polyculture.

Sprite halos are diffuse optical phenomenon observed at high altitudes in Earth's atmosphere that is produced by intense cloud-to-ground lightning discharges in the underlying thunderstorms. Often times, sprite halos may also develop into sprite streamers, highly-structured filaments with diameters up to hundreds of meters in the altitude range of $\\sim$40 km to $\\sim$90 km. Extensive video observations and modeling studies have been directed towards the topic of sprite halos and sprite streamers over the past two decades. A recent study has suggested that the pre-existing plasma irregularities in the D-region of ionosphere play a vital role in sprite streamer initiation, which, in an agreement with up-to-date experimental conclusions, might challenge former sprite streamer initiation theory that sprite streamers are initiated as a result of the sharpening and collapse of the screening ionization wave associated with sprite halos. This thesis demonstrates that what was considered as a primary sprite streamer initiation in former modeling studies would actually be a manifestation of a numerical instability. \n\nIn order to accomplish the purpose of this thesis, we construct a two-dimensional plasma fluid model, capable of numerically modeling the developmental stages of sprite halo events. The model is designed with the flexibilities of altering essential parameters and thus allowing a better comparison of model results with observations. Next, a parametric study is conducted for model validation purposes. Comparisons and analyses are made for different model cases of charge moment changes of various magnitudes, as well as lightning waveform with different parameters of impulsiveness. The charge moment change is an important quantitive parameter in the present study that is defined as the amount of charge transferred by cloud-to-ground lightning times the altitude from which it was removed. Consistency of our modeling results with previous modeling studies and video observations is demonstrated. A literature review on polarity asymmetry of sprites and relative discussions are also included.\n\nOur simulation results indicate that the numerical instabilities, identified as regions with electron densities at least 10 times higher than that of surrounding areas, show great dependencies on the spatial resolution of a numerical scheme. These instabilities always emerge at a relatively fixed location for different charge moment changes and morphologically relate to the polarity of lightning current moment. Finally, a quantitive criterion is proposed to identify and detect the appearance of such instabilities by monitoring the increase of the spatial gradient of electrons within the simulation domain. We introduce a minimum ``e-folding'' parameter, $m_0$, which measures the steepest spatial gradient between adjacent grids within the simulation domain. We conclude that when the minimum ``e-folding'' parameter drops to half of the spatial resolution, due to spatial discretizations failing to correctly resolve such a steep spatial gradient, numerical instabilities develop. In practical calculation, such instabilities become apparent when $m_0$ drops to $\\sim$0.4 times smaller than the spatial resolution. After that, the results obtained should be considered as containing incorrect numerical artifacts.\n\nIn the end, a summary of the work in this thesis as well as suggestions on possible future research topics are presented.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10739], "author_name_tesi": "Xi, Hao ", "last_name_ssi": "Xi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hao", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko", "Jianqi Qin", "Julio Urbina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko, Thesis Advisor", "Jianqi Qin, Thesis Advisor", "Julio Urbina, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sprites", "streamers", "halos", "TLEs", "Plasma", "Fluid", "Numerical Modeling", "Numerical Instability", "Electromagnetics", "Atmospheric Science"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "NANO-LEVEL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SURFACE PROPERTIES OF ENGINEERED SILICON WAFER \n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "9686", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6715", "abstract_tesi": "Surface properties of silicon are the key parameter to the success of silicon direct bonding technique in the semiconductor industry. The hydrophilicity and the roughness of silicon surfaces processed with three typical surface treatments in the direct bonding technique were systematically evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). HF-treated silicon surfaces used for hydrophobic bonding showed negligible dependence of adhesion forces on humidity. However, HF treatment resulted in a considerable increase of the roughness, suggesting that additional smoothing processes are desired. RCA 1 treated and thermal oxidized silicon surfaces, without roughness increase, exhibited substantial increases in adhesion forces when environmental humidity increased from 10% to around 60%. Further rise of humidity resulted in a drop of the adhesion force. Molecular dynamics simulations of the water layer absorbed on an oxidized silicon surface suggested that there is a densification in the water structure at the vicinity of the liquid-solid interface. Such a change in the atomic structure of the water layer, depending on its thickness, gives rise to the non-monotonic adhesion force \u2013 humidity relationship on hydrophilic silicon surfaces. Based on this, a quantitative model to describe the relationship was introduced. Since hydrophilic treated surfaces exhibit strong adhesion forces over a wide range of humidity, the direct bonding should be done at a low humidity to reduce water bubble forming at the bonding interface during annealing process. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6711], "author_name_tesi": "Xi, Xiaoning ", "last_name_ssi": "Xi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaoning", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard R Tittmann", "Bernhard R Tittmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard R Tittmann, Thesis Advisor", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["direct bonding", "wetting properties", "surface roughness", "atomic force microscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "NON-DESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION OF PLANT CELL WALL ARCHITECTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AT MICRO AND NANO LEVEL", "id": "13471xzx104", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13471", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fully hydrated primary plant cell walls in their natural state were characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging and Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM) imaging.

The ae mutant, which is deficient in SBEIIb, has a profound effect on endosperm starch structure, leading to an increased amylose content and a reduced amylopectin branching.  The study of the ae mutant suggests an important function of SBEIIb on starch structure.  Although no effect of the sbe1a mutant, which is deficient in SBEI, on starch structure has been noted previously, for starch deficient in SBEIIb, a further deficiency of SBEI increased branching (Yao et al. 2004).  A related study showed that for starch deficient in SBEIIb, a further deficiency of SBEIIa also increased branching (Yao et al. 2003).  Taken together, these studies suggest a reciprocal inhibition between SBEI and SBEIIa.  It can be reasoned from these studies that the effect of individual SBE isoform on starch structure may not be independent.  The overall goal of this continuing line of SBE research is to understand the role of each of the SBE isoform in starch biosynthesis.  The goal of this thesis is to understand the effects of deficiency of maize SBE isoform activities on endosperm starch molecular and granular structure and starch digestion, with emphasis on the effect of SBEI deficiency. \n     A preliminary test of endosperm starch digestibility for the sbe1a mutant showed that deficiency of SBEI caused a decreased susceptibility of starch granules to pancreatic \u00e1-amylase.  This was the first indication of an effect of deficiency of SBEI alone in synthesis of endosperm starch and justified further investigation of the function of SBEI isoform.  Consequently, this thesis describes the study of the structure and function of sbe1a mutant endosperm starch compared to non-mutant (wild-type, Wt) starch.  \n     Starch from Wt and sbe1a mutant endosperm was subjected to in vitro pancreatic \u00e1-amylase digestion for 16 hr by the AOAC procedure for resistant starch (RS), to determine the proportion of RS.  The digestion kinetics were analyzed using a double-exponential decay fit.  sbe1a starch had a higher RS value (13.2%) compared to Wt (1.6%).  Kinetic analysis showed that sbe1a starch had a lower proportion of a rapidly-digested component than Wt. \n     Chain length profile was examined for the non-granular starch and starch fractions from Wt and sbe1a, as well as for the RS from Wt and sbe1a.  Although chain length profiles of native starch molecules appeared very similar for Wt and sbe1a, some small differences between the two genotypes were observed in the chain length profile of their RS, as well as in the comparison of the chain length profile of their RS to native starch.  Compared to Wt, fewer amylose-like chains were digested in RS from sbe1a.  Iodine binding analysis of starch fractions showed that sbe1a samples had higher \u00ebmax than Wt samples.\n    Amylopectin fractionated from Wt and sbe1a starch was subjected to in vitro \u00e2-amylase hydrolysis over 24 hr.  Hydrolysis of sbe1a chains was less complete as compared to Wt.  The less complete hydrolysis is consistent with a higher proportion of closely associated branch points in amylopectin from sbe1a.  The amylose fraction from Wt and sbe1a starch was subjected to exhaustive \u00e2-amylolysis.  sbe1a starch had more long residual chains, suggesting that the distribution of branch points on these long amylose chains may be closer to the non-reducing ends.  Debranching of \u00e2-limit dextrin from amylose by isoamylase was less complete in sbe1a, suggesting that closely associated branch points may be more prevalent in amylose from sbe1a.  \n     Granule structure for native starches and residual granule structure for the respective RS were examined by microscopy.  Scanning and transmission electron micrographs show that the RS from sbe1a mutant retained more of the granule integrity.  A resistant peripheral layer by microscopy observed for the sbe1a RS may help understand the decreased digestibility of sbe1a starch.  Sbe1a is more strongly expressed in the later stage of endosperm development (Gao et al. 1996).  Thus, if most of the later-synthesized starch is deposited in the peripheral region of the growing granule, starch synthesized in the sbe1a mutant would be expected to be affected predominantly in the peripheral region.  A reasonable speculation is that the branching pattern might differ between the RS and the digested portion of sbe1a starch, and this difference might also account for the decreased digestibility of the peripheral region in sbe1a granule.  \n     Starch utilization and coleoptile growth of Wt and sbe1a mutant kernels were measured during kernel germination.  After Day 6 germinating sbe1a kernels exhibited a slower rate of coleoptile growth and an accordingly decreased rate of starch hydrolysis as compared to Wt kernels, suggesting compromised starch utilization in germinating sbe1a kernels.\n     Comparisons of RS values among two sets of mutant combinations both show a main effect of sbe1a and a significant difference between sbe1a and Wt.  This consistent result substantially confirms our preliminary indication of an effect of sbe1a alone.  For the first set of mutant combinations, sbe1a and sbe2a, the effects of sbe1a and sbe2a on both RS values and amylopectin branching are not independent, as a significant interaction is observed.  In contrast, for the second set of mutant combinations, sbe1a and ae, the effects of sbe1a and ae on RS values are independent, but the effects of sbe1a and ae on amylose content are not independent.  The significant statistical interaction terms suggest possible physical interactions among SBEs.  These interactions might be mediated by other starch synthetic enzymes.\n     The evidence obtained in this thesis, coupled with previous research, leads to several hypotheses about the specific functions of the three maize SBE isoforms in endosperm starch biosynthesis: 1) The SBEIIb protein is the dominant form of SBE, and is responsible for synthesizing branch points that are clustered. 2) When SBEIIb is present, SBEI is responsible for modulating the branching pattern by synthesizing branch points that are less locally clustered, and SBEIIa is responsible for modulating the branching pattern by synthesizing branch points that are more locally clustered. 3) When SBEIIb is absent, SBEI and SBEIIa may have a reciprocal inhibitory function on synthesis of branch points.\n     This thesis also for the first time reports that a lack of SBEI activity resulted in an observable effect, which was seen on both starch molecular structure and starch function.  Structural and functional analysis of endosperm starch deficient in SBEI activity strongly supports the hypothesis that SBEI is required to synthesize starch granules for normal kernel development, allowing efficient hydrolysis and utilization.  Evidence from this thesis reveals a unique and essential function of SBEI in normal plant development, consistent with the evolutionary conservation of SBEI in all higher plants.\n     The new knowledge generated in this thesis will contribute to our understanding of the function and evolution of the maize SBEs, and of their roles in the biosynthesis, hydrolysis and utilization of starch granules.  Moreover, the novel sbe1a starch might have application as a food ingredient with nutritional benefit.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2360], "author_name_tesi": "Xia, Huan ", "last_name_ssi": "Xia", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Huan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald B Thompson", "Donald B Thompson", "Mark Guiltinan", "John Neil Coupland", "Devin G Peterson", "Ming Tien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald B Thompson, Dissertation Advisor", "Donald B Thompson, Committee Chair", "Mark Guiltinan, Committee Chair", "John Neil Coupland, Committee Member", "Devin G Peterson, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["starch branching enzyme", "maize endosperm starch", "starch structure", "starch digestibility", "maize mutant", "maize kernel germination"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Roles of Nkg2d/ligand-mediated Immune activations in progression of metabolic dysfunctions and vascular complications", "id": "13899", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7445", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Atherosclerosis (also known as arteriosclerotic vascular disease or ASVD) is a chronic inflammatory disease and characterized by patchy thickening of the inner lining of arterial walls, caused by deposits of fatty materials and infiltration of immune cell components. While the etiology of the disease is not well understood, it is commonly believed that atherosclerotic risk factors, such as hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia, cause various cellular stress responses that induce tissue inflammation and immune cell activation, which in turn exacerbate the metabolic dysfunction. The interplay between the immune system and abnormal metabolic conditions sustains and propagates a vicious feedback cycle of chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction that is critical for atherosclerotic progression. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in these processes are not fully understood. \nIn this thesis study, I determined the role of NKG2D/ligand-mediated immune activation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. I found that NKG2D ligands were upregulated in sera from type 2 diabetes patients. In addition, cells from human atherosclerotic lesions, including macrophage and endothelial cells exhibited a high-level expression of the NKG2D ligands. By using atherosclerotic ApoE-/- mouse models, we found upregulation of NKG2D ligands in not only atherosclerotic lesions but also other tissueswhere atherosclerosis-associated metabolites preferentially accumulated, particularly the liver, suggesting that atherosclerosis-associated metabolites might be involved in the upregulation of NKG2D ligands. Consistent with this, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) or advanced glycation end-products (AGE), two commonmetabolites associated with dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia, induce macrophage to express NKG2D ligands during the in vitro culture. Preventing NKG2D/ligandinteractions by either genetic NKG2D-deficiency or anti-NKG2D antibody significantly suppressed atherosclerotic lesion formation, demonstrating a critical role of the NKG2D/ligand axis in the disease progression. Blocking NKG2D/ligandinteractions reduced the systemic production of multiple cytokine markers associated with immune activation. In addition, blocking NKG2D/ligand interactions alleviated the metabolic disorder associated with the liver dysfunction in Western diet-fed NKG2D-deficient ApoE-/- mice by preventing immune activation-induced liver inflammation. Moreover, NKG2D-deficient, T/B-cell-deficient ApoE-/-mice showed delayed atherosclerotic lesion formation after Western Diet feeding, suggesting an important role of NKG2D-expressing T immune cells in the early development of atherosclerosis. My preliminary studies also found that NKG2D-mediated responses were also involved in Western Diet-induced complications in other tissues, such as the kidney. \nTaken together, my studies reveal that the NKG2D/ligand interaction is a critical molecular link between atherosclerosis-related chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction and the NKG2D/ligand mediated immune activation play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Therefore, blocking NKG2D/ligand interaction might be a useful therapeutic strategy in prevention and/or treatment of metabolic diseases and associated complications such as atherosclerosis.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7392], "author_name_tesi": "Xia, Mingcan ", "last_name_ssi": "Xia", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mingcan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Na Xiong", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Yanming Wang", "Avery August", "Na Xiong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Na Xiong, Dissertation Advisor", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Yanming Wang, Committee Member", "Avery August, Special Member", "Na Xiong, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["atherosclerosis", "metabolic dysfunction", "NKG2D ligand", "NKG2D", "Immune activation", "diabetes", "cardiovascular diseases", "liver dysfunction"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Land, Church, and Power: French Catholic Mission in Guangzhou, 1840-1930", "id": "22658", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10099", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This is a study of the economic and financial history of the Paris Foreign Missions Society (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res de Paris) in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong (formerly known as Canton) from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century.

Its role is to replace \u201cworn out\u201d red blood cells that are removed by the spleen. While in response to acute anemia and tissue hypoxia, another type of erythropoiesis, stress erythropoiesis, is induced to rapidly generate new erythrocytes to compensate the loss. Previously our lab showed that stress erythropoiesis utilizes various signals and stress erythroid progenitors that are distinct from steady state erythropoiesis.  Initially, bone marrow CD34+KSL cells migrate into the spleen and interact with hedgehog ligands, which induce the expression of BMP4. Hedgehog and BMP4 together specify the stress erythroid fate. Further work showed that there are three distinct populations of stress erythroid progenitors that expand in the spleen during the recovery from bone marrow transplantation. They were identified as Population I (Kit+CD71-/medTer119lo/-), Population II (Kit+CD71highTer119med) and Population III (Kit+CD71-/medTer119high). The appearance of three populations suggested the temporal order for their development: Population I gives rise to Population II and Population II gives rise to Population III. Although the number of Population I cells increased in the pre-recovery stage, we didn\u2019t observe stress BFU-E until day 8, which indicated that these cells proliferated but couldn\u2019t differentiate in the early time. Then they acquired the ability to differentiate into stress BFU-E. Finally, BMP4, SCF and hypoxia are required for the expansion and differentiation of stress BFU-E during the late stage of the recovery from acute anemia. \nMy work mainly focuses on the following questions: 1. What is the role of GDF15 in the regulation of stress erythropoiesis? 2. How to identify the self-renewing Population I cells and differentiating Population I cells? 3. How does Epo regulate the transition from expansion to differentiation of stress erythroid progenitors? These questions will be answered in Chapters 2, 3 and 4. In Chapter 2, my work showed that GDF15-/- mice are deficient in recovery from acute anemia and fail to provide short-term radioprotection. GDF15 plays a critical role in stress erythropoiesis by inducing and maintain hypoxia dependent BMP4 expression. My work in chapter 3 further described the development of distinct stress erythroid progenitors with increasing maturity based on their expression of cell surface markers CD34, CD133, Kit and Sca1. Here we developed an in vitro culture system and identified CD34+CD133+KS population as the early stress erythroid progenitors that have self-renewal ability and CD34-CD133-KS population as the later stress erythroid progenitors that have differentiation ability. The bone marrow transplantation data also showed CD34+CD133+KS cells expanded on day6 and CD34-CD133-KS cells were increased on day 12 post-transplantation. Then I further demonstrated that similar to murine bone marrow, human bone marrow contains cells can exhibit stress erythropoiesis ability and generate BMP4 dependent stress BFU-E. \n\tFinally my work in Chapter 4 showed that hypoxia and Epo induce the transition from expansion to differentiation of stress erythroid progenitors.  The interaction between microenvironment and stress erythroid progenitors contributes a key part in regulating stress erythropoiesis. Wnt signaling produced by macrophages involves in the expansion of early stress erythroid progenitors. Epo stimulates macrophages through Stat5 signaling pathway to down regulate Wnt signaling and increase Prostaglandin E2 production to induce the differentiation of stress erythroid progenitors.  The characterization of stress erythroid progenitors and the signals that regulate their development potentially provide new therapeutics to treat anemia and improve the recovery from bone marrow transplants.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10231], "author_name_tesi": "Xiang, Jie ", "last_name_ssi": "Xiang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Paulson", "Robert Paulson", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Yanming Wang", "Naomi S Altman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Paulson, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Paulson, Committee Chair", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Yanming Wang, Committee Member", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Stress erythropoiesis", "Stem cell", "Epo", "progenitors", "Anemia"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Essays in the Economic Theory of Social Networks", "id": "14402wxx108", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14402", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, I provide three social network models addressing different aspects of the economy.\nFirst, I consider the issue of social network formation. Meeting with strangers and meeting with friends\u2019 friends are two common patterns when observing the formation of social networks and thus are widely adopted in many statistical network formation settings. I establish a network formation model trying to find the individual level incentive behind the two patterns. Each agent enters the network sequentially choosing\nbetween forming global random links or connecting with friends' friends, knowing that his payoff depends on the distance between the player with valuable information and himself. I find that the distance between players in the resulting network asymptotically follows a Weibull distribution and the link formation decision depends on how easily information can be transmitted under the network. When the transmission is relatively easy and information can be received from far away, players prefer to meet with strangers. Otherwise they prefer to connect with friends\u2019 friends. \nThe second model considers a moral hazard scenario in which a monitor must detect deviations so as to provide proper incentives to attain an efficient outcome. What if the monitor himself were to deviate after being bribed by his monitored subject? I explore a multi-agent public-good provision game in which each player prefers shirking to working in the absence of exogenous enforcement and can bribe those assigned to monitor him. I find that when players agree to cooperate in choosing an optimally designed monitoring\nnetwork, a core-periphery monitoring network results, with a small group of heavily monitored players who monitor all others. Under this network, a perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) is supported in which shirking is prevented, bribing among players ceases and total monitoring costs are minimized. Further, the efficiency of this core-periphery structure is robust under various settings, including the dynamic spread of bribing, and under different punishments and monitoring schedules.\nLastly, I consider a phenomenon of innovation adoption and diffusion. Innovations are crucial to the long run economic growth; however, not all new ideas are adopted by the majority of the society even though similar ones which appear later turn out to be commercial successes. I establish a model in which multiple potential entrants each can bring a new technology into a market with consumers connected under a social network.\nTechnology has the character of network externality and entrants must rely on the word-of-mouth communication under the social network to promote their products. I find that high quality innovations are not guaranteed to perform better than low quality ones under the scenario and timing is a crucial determinant of their commercial performances. Low quality innovation firms are likely to enter the market whenever possible but high quality ones might strategically wait for a proper time to acquire a better market share.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14754], "author_name_tesi": "Xiang, Wang ", "last_name_ssi": "Xiang", "first_name_ssi": "Wang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Vijay Krishna", "James Schuyler Jordan", "Reka Z Albert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Dissertation Advisor", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Member", "James Schuyler Jordan, Committee Member", "Reka Z Albert, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Network", "Structural Hole", "Strong Tie", "Monitoring", "Percolation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Characterization of the air void system in concrete using thermography", "id": "10774", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1283", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A rapid and robust testing procedure is significant for assessing the air void system in fresh concrete so that quality control adjustments can be made to improve freeze-thaw durability of concrete before it is hardened.

Since insiders are often familiar with the organization's data and intellectual property and have legitimate access to the organization's internal network, insider attacks could be very subtle and more difficult to detect than attacks from outsiders.\n\nWe focus on an emerging type of insider attacks, which are taken out by automated software agents (not humans) that have legitimate access to the organization's information systems. The software agents impersonate legitimate users and are commanded to conduct malicious actions. Insider attacks based on software agents can hardly be detected using host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), e.g. Snort and Samhain, due to the heterogeneity of software agents in different cases. Some of the existing research works address single-actor insider attacks, in each of which only one malicious user or software agent is involved.\n\nIn this thesis, we go beyond the single-actor scenario and investigate the insider attack detection in multi-agent colluding scenarios. The software agents take charge of different aspects of an attack, and collaborate to accomplish the attack. Since the malicious actions are dispersed to many software agents, the multi-agent insider attacks from the angle of computer actions could be extremely subtle. The unpredictability of the attack missions further hampers the detection. We make an observation that the collaboration among the software agents adds to the normal collaboration among users, and the activities of the software agents are reflected on the change of collaboration structure within the organization. Based on the observation, we propose to use adjacency matrix analysis to study the collaboration among users, and detect the insider attacks through identifying the anomalous collaboration caused by the software agents.

Adsorptive desulfurization test was carried out in a flow adsorption system. Adsorption selectivity was studied in a model fuel containing the same concentration of different compounds.The sulfur chemistry during adsorption was investigated by ANTEK Total Sulfur Analyzer, Gas Chromatography-Pulsed Flame Photometric Detector (GC-PFPD), and Sulfur K-edge X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES). N2 adsorption test was used to characterize the textural properties of the adsorbents. The surface chemical properties of the adsorbents were characterized by Ti L2,3-edge and Ce M4,5-edge XANES,Fourier Transfer Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy, Zeta potential, and boehm titration.\n\nAir has been introduced into ADS for the first time as a promoter for ultra-deep desulfurization of diesel fuel under ambient conditions. Air significantly promotes ADS by facilitating the formation of highly polar sulfoxide species from original sulfur\ncompounds. Moreover, by incorporating Ce into TiO2, ADS capacity increased 20-fold due to a significant synergistic effect between TiO2 and CeO2, which can be mainly attributed to the increased amount of reduced centers of Ti3+ and Ce3+ by doping Ce into TiO2. The reduced centers possibly resulted in active O-vacancy sites for O2 activation to form superoxide species when feeding air at room temperature, which further chemically transform organosulfurs to sulfoxides.\n\nIn the presence of air, light-irradiation has been reported in petroleum chemistry in the last century to degrade or partially oxidize hydrocarbons to form oxygenates, i.e.peroxides. Photooxidation is also widely known for pollutant cleanup in water and air.\nTaking advantage of the peroxides generation by light-irradiation of fuels, lightirradiation of fuel has been studied for the first time for ADS over TiO2-CeO2-based\nadsorbents. The light-irradiation of diesel fuel dramatically enhanced the selective removal of refractory sulfur compounds over the TiO2-CeO2/MCM-48 adsorbent,resulting in a superior adsorption capacity of 95 ml-F/g-A, which is over 30-fold higher than that for the original diesel fuel(~ 3 ml-F/g-A). Light-irradiation of fuel promoted the in-situ generation of peroxides, which further served as active oxygen species to catalytically transform sulfur species to highly polar sulfones over TiO2-CeO2/MCM-48.\n\nFuel composition, i.e. nitrogen compounds, affects ADS over TiO2-CeO2/MCM-48.Activated carbon, a promising material for the removal of nitrogen compounds, has been further studied as the guard bed material for ADS over TiO2-CeO2/MCM-48 adsorbent bed from light-irradiated diesel fuel. Using AC-1 as the guard bed further doubled ADS capacity over TiO2-CeO2/MCM-48 to 195 ml-F/g-sorb. AC guard bed further enhanced\nADS by pre-selectively adsorb nitrogen compounds, which could block TiO2-CeO2 active sites for sulfur oxidation, but not peroxides, which served as active oxygen species for sulfur transformation from light-irradiated fuel.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7989], "author_name_tesi": "Xiao, Jing ", "last_name_ssi": "Xiao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Chunshan Song", "Yongsheng Chen", "Caroline Elaine Clifford", "Michael John Janik", "Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Dissertation Advisor", "Chunshan Song, Committee Chair", "Yongsheng Chen, Committee Member", "Caroline Elaine Clifford, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Andre Louis Boehman, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adsorptive desulfurization", "TiO2-CeO2", "adsorbents", "diesel fuel"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Essays on Contests and Bargaining", "id": "14592", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7482", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Chapter 1.

Essay 1 makes first attempt to explore customers\u2019 preferences toward different faces in print advertisement context. It aims to answer three questions that are important to both researchers and practitioners: 1) Do faces affect how a viewer reacts to an advertisement in the metrics that advertisers care about? 2) If faces do have an effect, is the effect large enough to warrant a careful selection of faces when constructing print advertisements? 3) If faces do have an effect and the effect is large, what facial features are eliciting such differential reactions on these metrics, and are such reactions different across individuals? Relying on eigenface method, a holistic approach widely used in the computer science field for face recognition, we conducted two empirical studies to answer these three questions. The results show that different faces do have an effect on people\u2019s attitudes toward the advertisement, attitudes toward the brand, and purchase intentions; and the effect is non-trivial. Multiple segments were found for each key advertisement metric, and substantial heterogeneity in people\u2019s reactions to the ads was revealed among those segments. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.\n\nEssay 2 aims to explore customers\u2019 preferences toward different service innovations. In this essay, we design and validate a mechanism for service firms, called the quasi-patent (qPatent) system. The qPatent system builds upon both principles of the patenting system and unique characteristics of services using state-of-art incentive aligned conjoint analysis. It provides an environment where a firm can incent potential outside inventors to develop service innovations that the firm desires, in a way that innovations addressing the needs of the firm will be protected and rewarded financially based on their market value.

A hybrid collaborative learning activity refers to a learning activity that includes both face-to-face collaboration and distributed collaboration. The activities that this study investigates require students to document and share with the group members their decision-making rationales of the shared tasks.\nPrior studies have shown that previous rationales play a role in present activities and others\u2019 rationales affect one\u2019s decision-making. As one way of understanding the effects of rationale sharing in a hybrid collaborative learning activity, this study investigates the effects of computer-supported rationale awareness in the activity. Logically speaking, sharing rationales among the group members supports one\u2019s awareness of other group members\u2019 rationales, i.e., rationale awareness. Thus, one aspect of the effects of rationale sharing in the activity is reflected from the effects of rationale awareness. More specifically, the focus of the study is to examine the effects of rationale sharing on the awareness of group members\u2019 expertise and contribution with respect to the activity and on the development of group practice in a hybrid collaborative learning activity.\nThrough an iterative design process, a group workspace tool was designed and implemented that supports both real time and asynchronous remote collaboration and provides a document-based group space for group members to share their rationales. A naturalistic study was conducted to understand the effects of computer-supported rationale awareness mediated by the group workspace. \nThe findings of this dissertation study suggest that: being more aware of one\u2019s collaborators\u2019 rationales enhances awareness of collaborators\u2019 contributions and expertise, impacts the group\u2019s decision-making process, and facilitates the collective management of rationales. The results of the study show that the process of documenting rationales helped one in studying the course subjects. This study contributes to the study of designing meta-cognitive support in terms of providing awareness in group work or group learning setting by eliciting several design implications based on the students\u2019 experience with the group workspace.

The distortion of speech signals with additive noise has hampered the success of numerous speech signal processing applications ranging from hearing aids, to speech coding and automatic speech recognition. Up to now, most practical approaches to speech enhancement are waveform based, i.e. these approaches are (in principle filtering the distorted signal to estimate the clean signal. In this thesis, we study how speech enhancement can be improved by restricting the class of targeted signals specifically to speech signals and employing\nparametric speech production models. The idea of fusing more speech specific information into the enhancement process is not entirely new, but, so far, the performance of such methods has had only limited success.\n\nWe present a new method for the enhancement of speech. The method is designed for scenarios in which targeted speaker enrollment as well as system training within the typical noise environment are feasible. The proposed procedure is fundamentally different from most conventional and state-of-the-art speech enhancement approaches. Instead of filtering a distorted signal we are re-synthesizing a new \"clean\" signal based on its likely characteristics. These characteristics are\nestimated from the distorted signal.\n\nTo re-synthesize \"clean\" signal of high quality, a speech production model is needed. Throughout this thesis, we tried two different speech production models including autoregressive speech production model and inventory based speech production model. Successful implementations of the proposed methods are presented. Experiments show that the proposed method compares very favorably to other state-of-the-art systems in both objective and subjective speech quality assessments.

The third category allows for any combinations of the first two categories within the same part. Modeling and manufacturing of HOs has come to attention recently due to the advent of additive manufacturing (AM) technology that makes it possible to build such parts. Directed energy deposition processes have the potential for depositing multiple powdered materials in various compositions in the process of creating a single layer of material.

The key aspects of these systems are the processing algorithms that analyze image sequences and videos to extract useful information from a noisy background. Traditional image/video processing technologies typically apply the sliding window method to each frame for information processing, but even the potentially useful information occupies a very small portion of the input image. To achieve real-time performance, the processing units are duplicated massively to filter every possible window location of the high-resolution input image in parallel. Such a method not only consumes lots of power, but also limits the algorithm implementation on embedded systems due to the constrained computational resources and limited power supply. Alternatively, many of these algorithms are deployed on high performance servers/desktops with multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) rather than on power efficient portable devices.\nAs opposed to high performance machine vision platforms, human brains can process the vision tasks at much lower power consumption (approximately 20W) with limited computing resources (neurons in the brain) when exposed to a complex scene. In fact, the literature has shown that people do not perceive every object in a scene equally, but instead they prioritize. Objects with \u2018outstanding\u2019 features will be chosen from their surroundings and passed on to further processing stages such as feature extraction or recognition. This biological pre-processing has been identified as the attention stage and has been well-studied in the field of visual neuroscience in the past few decades. Several computation models have been proposed to show how attention within the brain works in a hierarchical way. With the assistance of the attention stage, only the attractive regions of the input image require further processing. This results in a much lower demand of power consumption and computing resources, which makes it possible to build an embedded machine vision system that can understand complex scenes in real time.\nIn this dissertation, a state-of-the-art bio-inspired attention algorithm called \u2018Saliency [17]\u2019 is studied. Its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) prototype has been implemented to meet the real-time processing requirement. In addition, two extensions of the original attention system are proposed and\niii\nevaluated. The first extension is a video-based attention system which integrates two more computing channels, \u2018flicker\u2019 and \u2018motion,\u2019 for final attention map computing. Experiment results show that the new extended system can achieve 60% power savings on image test cases and 50% savings on video test cases when it is used as an LCD power management. The second extension considers the task influence in the vision mechanism by interpreting task-specific features as bias weights in the attention computing. Accuracy of locating a task item from noisy backgrounds has been evaluated. On average, a 12.7% improvement in accuracy can be achieved when compared to the original system. Furthermore, a comprehensive vision system composed by Saliency [17] and HMAX [54] is proposed and implemented. Its off-chip bandwidth characteristic is analyzed for operating under certain bandwidth caps. As a result, a memory bandwidth aware feedback system is developed to dynamically partition available bandwidth among a set of accelerators at a small expense of the recognition accuracy.

Therefore, a two-phase study was employed to investigate research questions. \n\nIn Phase I, the researcher conducted a systematic review of State/Federal VR policies and procedures related to substance use disorders. To systematically evaluate policies and procedures, the researcher first developed the VR Substance Use Disorders Policy Scoring Rubric. Results of this study demonstrated that the VR Substance Use Disorders Policy Scoring Rubric had sufficient psychometric properties.

Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), the prominent virulence factor expressed by E. coli O157:H7 strains, is encoded in prophages. Its release is due to induction of the phage lytic cycle, and essential for fatal HUS development. Epidemiological studies have revealed that two subtypes of Stx2, namely Stx2a and Stx2c, are more likely to be associated with severe diseases. The quantitative measurement of Stx is important to evaluate the virulence of E. coli O157:H7. Immunoassays are the widely used method for quantifying Stx2 production by Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). The application of available immunoassay in routine usage is constrained by either high cost or requiring two sets of anti-Stx2 antibodies from different species, but most commercially available anti-Stx2 antibodies are derived from the same species. A sensitive and specific receptor-based ELISA (R-ELISA) was developed using all commercially available reagents (Chapter 3).

No cross-reactivity was observed in this assay with Stx1, and linear curves could be constructed using bacterial lysate from a high Stx2a-producing O157:H7 strain. Evaluation of Stx2 levels in a collection of E. coli O157:H7 strains showed that toxin production did not necessarily correlate with strain phylogeny using this assay.\nEnhanced Stx2a expression was reported when specific nonpathogenic E. coli strains were co-cultured with E. coli O157:H7. Therefore, it was hypothesized that this phenotype required the former to be sensitive to infection by the stx-converting phages. In this study, 33% of nonpathogenic E. coli strains were shown to be able to enhance the Stx2a production of an E. coli O157:H7 strain PA2, which belongs to the hypervirulent clade 8 cluster. Different competitive indexes for nonpathogenic E. coli strains versus PA2 were observed after co-incubation. E. coli C600 was outcompeted by PA2 in co-culture, which led to our hypothesis that stx2a-converting phages produced by PA2 caused the cell lysis of phage susceptible strain E. coli C600 and resulted in Stx2a amplification. By replacing the essential gene bamA (receptor for stx-converting phages) in E. coli C600 with a heterologous bamA, we were able to generate phage resistant strains and they did not amplify Stx2a in co-culture with PA2, supporting our hypothesis. Moreover, the extracellular loops (loop 4, 6, 7) BamA E. coli were demonstrated to be important for phage lytic infection. Unlike E. coli C600, commensal E. coli strains showed growth advantages over PA2 in co-cultures. E. coli strain 1.1954 was selected as the representative strain, and its chromosomal bamA knockout mutant did not eliminate the ability to amplify Stx2a. Additionally, the phage susceptible strain E. coli 1.1954 was not lysogenized by stx2a-converting phages after co-culturing with PA2. The data collectively indicated E. coli 1.1954 had an additional mechanism of Stx2a amplification. Additionally, the commensal E. coli strain 0.1229 was shown to secrete an unknown molecule in its supernatant which amplified Stx2a production. Therefore, we proposed three mechanisms for explaining the Stx2 amplification phenotype observed for nonpathogenic E. coli strains when co-cultured with E. coli O157:H7, which may explain the variations in the severity of diseases observed for patients infected with the same pathogen O157:H7 strain.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13391], "author_name_tesi": "Xiaoli, Lingzi ", "last_name_ssi": "Xiaoli", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lingzi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward G.

Steam reforming of Norpar13 (a liquid hydrocarbon fuel from Exxon Mobile) without and with sulfur was performed on various metal catalysts (Rh, Ru, Pt, Pd, and Ni) supported on different materials (Al2O3, CeO2, SiO2, MgO, and CeO2-Al2O3). A number of characterization techniques were applied to study the physicochemical properties of these catalysts before and after the reactions. Especially, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy was intensively used to investigate the nature of sulfur and carbon species in the used catalysts to reveal the catalyst deactivation mechanism.\nAmong the tested noble metal catalysts (Rh, Ru, Pt, and Pd), Rh catalyst is the most sulfur tolerant. Al2O3 and CeO2 are much better than SiO2 and MgO as the supports for the Rh catalyst to reform sulfur-containing hydrocarbons. The good sulfur tolerance of Rh/Al2O3 can be attributed to the acidic nature of the Al2O3 support and its small Rh crystallites (1-3 nm) as these characteristics facilitate the formation of electron-deficient Rh particles with high sulfur tolerance. The good catalytic performance of Rh/CeO2 in the presence of sulfur can be ascribed to the promotion effect of CeO2 on carbon gasification, which significantly reduced the carbon deposition on the Rh/CeO2catalyst.\nSteam reforming of Norpar13 in the absence and presence of sulfur was further carried out over CeO2-Al2O3 supported monometallic Ni and Rh and bimetallic Rh-Ni catalysts at 550 and 800 \u00b0C. Both monometallic catalysts rapidly deactivated at 550 \u00b0C, and showed poor sulfur tolerance. Although ineffective for the Ni catalyst, increasing the temperature to 800 \u00b0C dramatically improved the sulfur tolerance of the Rh catalyst. Sulfur K-edge XANES revealed that metal sulfide and organic sulfide are the dominant sulfur species on the used Ni catalyst, while sulfonate and sulfate predominate on the used Rh catalyst. The superior sulfur tolerance of the Rh/CeO2-Al2O3 catalyst at 800 \u00b0C may be associated with its capability in sulfur oxidation. It is very likely that the oxygen-shielded sulfur structure of sulfonate and sulfate can suppress the poisoning impact of sulfur on Rh through inhibiting direct rhodium-sulfur interaction. Although the Rh-Ni catalyst exhibited better sulfur tolerance than the monometallic ones at 550 \u00b0C, its catalytic performance was inferior compared with the Rh catalyst in the sulfur-containing reaction at 800 \u00b0C probably due to the severe carbon deposition on the bimetallic catalyst.\nThe last part of this work focuses on the influence of sulfur on the carbon deposition in steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbon fuels over CeO2-Al2O3 supported monometallic Ni and Rh catalysts at 800 \u00baC. Though abundant carbon deposits can accumulate on the pure CeO2-Al2O3 support due to fuel thermal cracking, the metal addition substantially mitigated the carbon deposition in the sulfur-free reaction. The presence of sulfur increased the carbon deposition on both catalysts, which has a much more significant impact for the Ni catalyst. Our results indicate that (I) the presence of sulfur can suppress carbon gasification and promote the formation of graphitic carbon on reforming catalysts, and (II) the Rh catalyst possesses stronger capability to maintain carbon gasification activity than the Ni catalyst in the presence of sulfur.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1271], "author_name_tesi": "Xie, Chao ", "last_name_ssi": "Xie", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Chunshan Song", "Yongsheng Chen", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Dissertation Advisor", "Chunshan Song, Committee Chair", "Yongsheng Chen, Committee Member", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydrogen", "reforming", "Nickel", "Rhodium", "Deactivation", "Sulfur poisoning", "Carbon deposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Transport and Surface Properties of Ion-containing Polymer Membranes \n", "id": "16211", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7761", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ion-containing polymer membranes have wide applications in desalination, electrochemical devices, and other technologies that require semipermeable membranes with specific transport selectivity properties. Therefore, a great deal of research has focused on the transport of ions and water in these materials and the correlation of these properties with polymer backbone chemical structure, the type of tethered ionic group to the polymer backbone, and polymer membrane morphology. The way that water is bound within the polymer membrane also attracts great interest because species like protons, methanol, and salt ions transport through the hydrophilic domain of the phase separated polymer membrane and thus are affected by the water dynamics. In addition to the bulk properties of these materials, surface properties are also important for practical applications and have been the focus of significant efforts in new membranes. Surface fouling presents severe problems in the applications of ionic polymer membranes, especially in water treatment. New tools to control fouling and understanding the fundamental interactions in these materials that contribute to fouling are important to improve material antifouling performance and guide future material design. It is the goal of this dissertation to investigate the water binding in ion-containing polymer membranes and make correlations to their transport properties, as well as study the use of layer-by-layer assembly as a surface antifouling modification for desalination membranes.\nThe uptake and dynamics of water in polymer membranes have been found to influence their transport properties. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the water-polymer interactions in sulfonated and aminated poly(phenylsulfone) membranes were investigated and compared. The OD stretch region in D2O-doped water absorbed in the polymer membrane gives information on the water-water hydrogen bonding dynamics and the interaction of water with the ionic functional groups.  The fingerprint region spectra representing water-polymer backbone interactions were analyzed as well. It was found that anion exchange membranes with tethered quaternary ammonium functional groups exhibited more free water content and less water-polymer interactions than cation exchange membranes with tethered sulfonate groups. Measures of membrane water flux and rejection were correlated to these observations and it was found that membranes with quaternary ammonium functional groups displayed faster water and salt transport due to their greater free water content. \nHighly selective proton conductive networks were prepared based on crosslinking of chain-end functionalized polymers with perfluorosulfonate side groups. A study was carried out regarding the water binding in these crosslinked membranes and the water binding results were tied to their superior electrochemical selectivity. It was found that for these membranes the content of bound water increased with increasing relative humidity or increasing IEC. The lack of bulk-like water explained their low methanol permeability and the presence of bound water still facilitated proton conductivity due to these polymers\u2019 high water uptake. \nPolystyrene-based homopolymers and block copolymers with quaternary ammonium or imidazolium functional groups were investigated to elucidate the influence of membrane morphology as well as ionic groups on water binding. Based on observations of the OD stretch vibration of water absorbed in the polymer membranes, it was found that homopolymers displayed more bulk-like water than copolymers due to their higher degree of functionalization. From the OD stretch peak, water interacted more strongly with the imidazolium group than with the quaternary ammonium group and imidazolium functionalized polymers exhibited higher bound water content than quaternary ammonium functionalized polymers.\nMembrane surface charge has a significant influence on membrane retention and fouling performance. As a key parameter describing the surface charge properties of membranes used in aqueous applications, zeta potential measurements on membranes of various types have been used as a standard evaluation method to assess the possible fouling of the material\u2019s surface. In electrokinetic streaming measurements, it was found that the measured streaming current unexpectedly varied with the thickness of the sample and decreased with increasing ion exchange capacity of ion-conductive sulfonated poly(phenylsulfone) membranes. It was determined that membrane bulk conductance influenced the streaming current in the microfluidic channel and produced unanticipated results given the materials\u2019 composition. Extrapolating the measured streaming current to a membrane thickness of zero has proven to be a feasible method for eliminating the error and obtaining correct surface charge information for ion conductive polymer membranes. A linear resistance model relating measured streaming current to membrane bulk conductance is proposed based on the hypothesis that ion conductive membranes reduced the observed streaming current by allowing ions to flow back through the membrane bulk. \nTo better control the surface properties and improve the antifouling performance of polymer surfaces, layer by layer (LBL) assembly of anionic and cationic PEO-based polyurethanes were used to modify surfaces. Surface charge and dynamic protein and polysaccharide adsorption behaviors were measured and correlated to the chemical composition of the assemblies. The PEO-based polyurethanes LBL helped reduce protein fouling on sulfonated and aminated poly(phenylsulfone) membrane surfaces due to the hydrophilicity of PEO.  After salt annealing, intermixing between LBL assembly layers was promoted. Salt ions were absorbed into the assembly and increased the hydration of the layers by breaking some of the electrostatic crosslinks between anionic and cationic PEO-poly(urethane)s. By comparing the surface charge as well as protein and polysaccharide adsorption behavior of the LBL assembly surfaces before and after salt annealing, it was discovered that bovine serum albumin adsorption was governed by surface charge while sodium alginate adsorption was influenced by electrostatic interaction with the surface besides surface distribution of charged groups.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7694], "author_name_tesi": "Xie, He ", "last_name_ssi": "Xie", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "He", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Paul C Painter", "James Hansell Adair", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Chair", "Paul C Painter, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Desalination", "Ionic Polymer Membranes", "Transport Properties", "Water Binding", "Zeta Potential", "Layer-by-Layer Assembly", "Antifouling"]}]
