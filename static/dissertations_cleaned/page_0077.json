This study uses reflection seismic surveys shot in proximity to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide Core to estimate rock properties (p-wave velocity, s-wave velocity, and density) of the material underlying the ice sheet. Estimation of these parameters are done by picking amplitudes from the ice-bottom reflector, and analyzing their variation with offset (AVO.) This AVO response is dependent on the rock properties of the two materials at the interface (ice and underlying sediment.) Since we know the rock properties of ice, we can hold those values constant and iterate through possible rock properties of the underlying material to find a best fit. The resulting parameters from our study suggests that the material underlying the WAIS Divide Ice Core is poorly consolidated, and water saturated, sediment. A recent paper by DeConto and Pollard (2016) models the future of WAIS, and suggests a retreat of the ice sheet that puts the WAIS Ice Divide Core in close proximity to the ocean. The saturated conditions of the subglacial sediment suggested by this study, and the lack of ice previously present between the field site and ocean, would lead to conditions which may accelerate ice flow velocity and ice mass loss.

I begin by placing the 1990s in historical context, demonstrating that recent efforts to revitalize the movement are similar to other periods of debate in the history of the movement.  It appears that certain processes, notably existing leadership\u2019s desire to remain in control of the movement, have prevented significant change in organizing.  I then explore the mechanisms unions have at their disposal to recruit new members in the 1990s, which include the National Labor Relations Board certification election and the corporate campaign.  As unions move towards an increasingly conflictual relationship with firms, they have adopted the corporate campaign to overcome the weaknesses of the certification election.  Data from the 70 unions indicates that although the NLRB is used much more frequently by unions, nearly as many workers are organized through corporate campaigns.  The reason for this is twofold: 1) corporate campaigns have a much higher success rate, and 2) the typical corporate campaign involves significantly more workers than the average NLRB election.  To examine various organizing processes, including repertoire choice and success, I first draw upon resource mobilization theory, using the unique circumstances surrounding union organizing to expand this perspective.  I find that the sources of endogenous resources, including the parent organization, and, to a lesser extent, membership, affect the type of tactic used, but not the outcomes.  Human resources devoted to organizing have a strong effect on the rate of corporate campaigns and their outcomes, but no effect on NLRB elections, except for unions that use both tactics.  Leadership indicators were also employed to analyze resources devoted to organizing, repertoire use, and outcomes.  In general, bureaucratic structures had lower rates of organizing, as did unions with large staff.

This study is one of the first to explore the function of the IGF model in a developing country region by focusing on the East Africa Internet Governance Forum (EAIGF), the first regional IGF established globally. \nThis study conducted an in-depth case study of the 2012 EAIGF as well as a comparative case study analysis of Kenya and Uganda, two member countries of the EAIGF. The case study approach was used to identify the influence of the EAIGF on policymaking in the region as well as the impacts of national institutional endowments on stakeholder participation and impact within the forum. Data were derived from document analysis and semi-structured in-depth interviews with stakeholders from civil society organizations, ICT-related ministries, telecommunications regulatory agencies, and the private sector. \nThis research identified that the forum contributes to capacity building, consensus building and identification of emerging national and regional Internet governance issues, and assists in the formation of national and regional policies. Findings also revealed that national institutional endowments affect stakeholder involvement and influence within the forum. Participants indicated that Kenya has the greatest influence in the EAIGF because of its position as a regional economic leader, its strong telecommunications sector, and its longstanding role as the regional champion of the EAIGF. Civil society stakeholders are believed to shape the function and goals of the forum, and government stakeholders are believed to have the greatest influence within forum interactions due to their ability to implement policy reforms. \nThis research found that the EAIGF model has influenced collaborative policymaking in the region. EAIGF stakeholders wish to formalize the forum and ensure that the EAIGF leads to policy implementation by aligning it with the East African Communications Organization, the telecommunications policymaking arm of the East African Community. Furthermore, stakeholders believed that the Forum has led to increased collaborations between government and civil society stakeholders in ICT-related policymaking. \nThis dissertation modifies Scharpf\u2019s (1997) actor-centered institutionalism model using international regime theory and the theory of elite competition to make it more applicable to non-binding, multi-stakeholder policy interactions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8830], "author_name_tesi": "Martin, Brandie Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Martin", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Brandie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Denny Taylor", "Krishna Prasad Jayakar", "Amit Schejter", "Carleen Frances Maitland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Denny Taylor, Dissertation Advisor", "Krishna Prasad Jayakar, Committee Member", "Amit Schejter, Committee Member", "Carleen Frances Maitland, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Actor-Centered Institutionalism", "East African Community", "Internet Governance Forum", "Policymaking"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Service-Learning Pedagogy As An Instructional Tool for Latino Student Education \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "11877", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1050", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Interested in improving academic achievements for Hispanic students, this study was initiated to conclude if service-learning pedagogy is a viable practice for improving student learning.

In analyzing the frequencies for the matched paired t-test, the results of the data were presented in three sections that included the following: (1) Lighthouse Community Charter School and East Austin Prep with a total sample size of 71 participants (2) East Austin Prep with a sample size of 50 participants  (3) Lighthouse Community Charter School with a sample size of 21 participants.

Service-learning can be integrated into classroom curricula as a teaching strategy that increases academic knowledge and critical thinking skills for students.

Even though there is considerable evidence that pronunciation plays a crucial role in effective communication (Celce-Murcia et al., 2010), pronunciation training is frequently neglected in the foreign language classroom for reasons such as lack of classroom time or lack of instructor preparedness to teach pronunciation (Derwing, 2013; Grim & Sturm, 2016; Foote et al., 2011). The present dissertation addresses this discrepancy by investigating the effectiveness of a homework-based method of pronunciation instruction for beginner learners that does not require teacher feedback or in-class time and thus allows for pronunciation training to be included in any second language (L2) curriculum. Through this method, called innovative Cued Pronunciation Readings (iCPRs; Martin, 2015, 2017, see also Tanner & Landon, 2009), students receive pronunciation training in the form of Microsoft PowerPoint units that every learner can access from a home or library computer. Thus, this type of pronunciation training can be assigned as homework and students work on it alone. This allows for an implementation of pronunciation training in the curriculum without taking up valuable in-class time or requiring special skills from the instructor. \nSince pronunciation training via iCPRs can be delivered online, the method lends itself not only to use in face-to-face but also in distance (i.e. online) learning environments. The emergence of online and hybrid courses over the past two decades has presented new challenges as well as opportunities for language instruction. In particular, the development of learners\u2019 oral proficiency in an online learning environment has been shown to be problematic (Deutschmann et al., 2009). In light of these developments, it is important to consider language instruction not only in traditional face-to-face environments but also in online learning environments. \nThe present dissertation assessed the effectiveness of the iCPR method in on-campus and online learning environments by measuring novice German learners\u2019 improvement in perception and production skills over the course of one semester. Data collection was conducted with 90 first-semester learners of German. In the face-to-face environment, each of the six sections of first semester German classes was pseudo-randomly assigned the status of treatment, comparison, or control group. Students in the treatment group received ten weeks of pronunciation training delivered through homework-based iCPR units, whereas students in the comparison group received ten weeks of ten minutes in-class pronunciation training delivered by their instructors. Finally, students in the control group followed the same standardized first-semester German lesson plans as the other two groups, but did not receive targeted pronunciation training. Since there is no in-class instruction in the online learning environment, there was no comparison group in this condition. Instead, four sections of online first-semester German classes were divided into two sections that served as a treatment group (i.e., a group that received instruction through iCPR units) and two sections that served as a control group. \nThe study employed a pretest / posttest design: participants\u2019 pronunciation was recorded in the 2nd and 14th week of the semester. The assessment included a binary-choice perception task and participants\u2019 oral productions at the word and sentence level. Following standard procedure in pronunciation training research, these speech productions were rated by native German speakers for ease of comprehensibility and strength of accent. The ratings from each group were compared in order to assess the effectiveness of the different types of pronunciation training. \nFor the face-to-face learning environment, results show that the learners in the treatment group, who received homework-based iCPR pronunciation training, significantly outperformed learners in the control group on measures of phonological perception skills, comprehensibility in productions of individual words, and accentedness in productions of individual words. Moreover, results reveal no significant difference between the learners who received homework-based pronunciation training and learners who received in-class pronunciation training. Together, these results suggest that learners benefit from iCPR pronunciation training and that homework-based pronunciation training is as effective in improving learners\u2019 German perception and production skills as in-class pronunciation training. \nFor the online learning environment, results show that the learners in the treatment group, who received iCPR pronunciation training as part of their online curriculum, significantly outperformed learners in the control group on all measures, that is, in phonological perception skills, in ease of comprehensibility in productions on the word- and paragraph-level, and in a diminished accent in productions on the word-and paragraph-level. These findings suggest that learners in an online environment benefit from iCPR pronunciation training. \nTaken together, this dissertation shows that effective pronunciation training can be provided outside the classroom via iCPRs, which saves valuable in-class time and opens up possibilities for learners to receive pronunciation instruction even in an online learning environment or if their instructor lacks the preparation to teach this topic. As such, this dissertation suggests a method of pronunciation instruction that addresses the problems that all too often lead to the neglect of pronunciation training in traditional classrooms and in online learning environments.

Subjects were instructed to press with four fingers (I index, M middle, R ring and L little) from a specified initial force to target forces following a ramp target line.  Force-force relations between master and each of three slave fingers were analyzed during the ramp phase of trials by calculating correlation coefficients within each master-slave pair and then two-factor ANOVA was performed to determine the effect of initial force and force increase on the correlation coefficients.  It was found that, as initial force increased, the value of the correlation coefficient decreased and in some cases became negative, i.e. the enslaving transformed into error compensation.  Force increase magnitude had a smaller effect on the correlation coefficients.  The observations support the hypothesis that the pattern of inter-finger interaction, enslaving or compensation, depends on the initial force level and, to a smaller degree, on the targeted magnitude of the force increase.

Typically, movements involve the interaction of multiple effectors to produce a desired output. An attractive approach to addressing this problem is studying the interaction of fingers in multi-finger tasks. One issue that arises when studying finger interaction is that single finger force production cannot be performed independently of the other fingers.  A behavior known as enslaving occurs when one tries to press with a single finger \u2013 the other fingers also produce force.  The dissertation was divided into two parts. The purpose of the first part of the dissertation was to use single- and multi-finger pressing paradigms to investigate: 1) anatomical changes induced in fingers due to changes in configuration and force production of a single finger; 2) force changes of fingers due to an involuntary perturbation of a single finger during a four-finger pressing task; and 3) force changes of fingers due to voluntary pressing of a single finger which followed a task that required establishing a total force stabilizing synergy among the four fingers.  The main findings from the first part of the dissertation were: 1) the changes in configuration and force production of a single finger resulted in no significant anatomical changes in the other fingers; 2) an involuntary perturbation of a single finger resulted in the non-perturbed fingers displaying changes in force that acted to stabilize task performance; and 3) following the establishment of a force stabilizing synergy the CNS was able to quickly abolish that synergy such that typical finger enslaving was observed during voluntary pressing with a single finger. The second part of the dissertation investigated whether it is plausible the CNS uses hypothetical control variables (called neural commands) instead of the mechanical variables (force in our case) to control and regulate movements.  The neural commands are essentially free of the enslaving effects.  Estimating neural commands is non-trivial and a methodological study was performed to determine the best procedure for computing neural commands.  It was determined that a neural network model provided the most accurate estimation of neural commands. Analytical inverse optimization (ANIO) and uncontrolled manifold analysis (UCM) were used to compare performance of neural commands to finger forces in a multi-finger pressing task.  Based on the experimental results it appears plausible that the CNS may operate in the space of neural commands.  The neural commands performed equally as well to the forces in terms of optimality and outperformed forces in terms of the structure of variance.  These findings agree with the notion that the CNS controls patterns of muscle activity, not individual muscles and the findings also support a synergistic hierarchical organization of the elemental variables.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7589], "author_name_tesi": "Martin, Joel Ryan", "last_name_ssi": "Martin", "middle_name_ssi": "Ryan", "first_name_ssi": "Joel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vladimir M Zatsiorsky", "Mark Latash", "Jinger Gottschall", "Andris Freivalds"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vladimir M Zatsiorsky, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Latash, Committee Member", "Jinger Gottschall, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Biomechanics; Motor Control; Finger Interaction"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Continuing Education and Cooperative Extension: A Comparative Assessement of Organizational Culture", "id": "6604", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4180", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe purpose of this doctoral dissertation study was to assess and compare the organizational cultures of Continuing Education and Cooperative Extension at Penn State. Two key questions served to guide this research. Are there differences between the organizational cultures of Continuing Education and Cooperative Extension? If so, what variables indicate cultural differences between Continuing Education and Cooperative Extension? \nThe reason why it was important to conduct this research study is that prior to 1997, Continuing Education and Cooperative Extension were housed within separate administrative units and had relatively little contact. In 1997, these units were brought together within the organizational structure of Penn State Outreach and Cooperative Extension and were encouraged to collaborate and cooperate.\nThe target population for this study included all of the directors of continuing education, continuing education area representatives, and county extension directors at Penn State. This population was selected because these positions are outside of the University Park campus; these positions have managerial/supervisory responsibility within their respective units; and, these positions are perceived as parallel within the organizational chart. Electronic mail addresses were obtained from the associate vice presidents for outreach who direct Continuing Education and Cooperative Extension. The total target population for this study included 135 individuals.\nThe research methodology included using the Cultural Health Indicator survey developed by Emerge International and validated by Dr. Lloyd Williams. The Cultural Health Indicator is a web-based instrument consisting of 98 forced-choice statements with five-point Likert-type rating response scales. The statements address seven dimensions of organizational culture: leadership, relationships, communication, infrastructure, involvement and decision-making, change management and finance. Three open-ended questions were also included to elicit additional comments from respondents.\nThe multiple regression model analysis showed significant differences in the perceptions for the infrastructure dimension when examined by the five demographic variables and by organization represented. Organization represented was the only significant factor in explaining differences in perceptions of infrastructure when accounting for all other demographic factors using the multiple regression model.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4155], "author_name_tesi": "Martin, Michael James", "last_name_ssi": "Martin", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William J Rothwell", "Claudia Cross Mincemoyer", "Wesley Edward Donahue", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William J Rothwell, Committee Chair", "Claudia Cross Mincemoyer, Committee Member", "Wesley Edward Donahue, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Continuing Education", "Cooperative Extension", "Organizational Culture"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Friends With Different Faces: The Impact Of Community Racial Diversity On Network Diversity And Size", "id": "27354", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11889", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the face of increasing racial diversity on a national scale, it is important that we understand the various impacts that racial diversity might have on society.

Professional development programs are often diverse in philosophy, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, however the research on high quality professional development seems to support collaboration. \n     The purpose of this study was to examine elementary teachers\u2019 perceptions of collaborative professional development teams. Capturing teachers\u2019 perspectives on collaborative practices could potentially provide insight to administrators when creating professional development opportunities for teachers. Are collaborative teams seen (1) as a mechanism for promoting teacher growth, (2) a way to improve their own practice, and (3) a way to improve the practice of their team? In addition, does the principals\u2019 control of these collaborative teams (4) have any influence on the teachers\u2019 perceived value of these teams, and (5) are the perceptions of the teachers and principals comparable in regards to collaborative professional development teams? The study included five elementary schools in a large urban district where there was a strong commitment to professional development. Two of the five schools participated in face-to- face interviews for in-depth conversations and data collection. Teachers and principals were a part of this case study.\n      Through data analysis, the participants reported that collaborative teams were a positive means for professional development as they perceived it. The professional development teams were perceived by teachers as being more successful when: 1) there were opportunities to share in vertical teams, 2) there were structures and adequate time was provided, 3) there was a safe environment, 4) there was trust in colleagues, 5) the work was connected to the goals of the school, and 6) they saw student work improving as a result of their collaborative efforts. In addition, the data revealed that the amount of control that the principal has in creating the collaborative teams does not appear to negatively impact teachers\u2019 perceptions of the positive benefits of practice. When teachers felt that their work was purposeful and focused on school goals they were more willing to work in any team configuration that they were assigned to, as this helped them to grow professionally. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11063], "author_name_tesi": "Martin, Rachel J", "last_name_ssi": "Martin", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James F Nolan Jr.", "William Hartman", "Nona Ann Prestine", "Roger C Shouse", "Bernard Joel Badiali"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James F Nolan Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "William Hartman, Committee Chair", "Nona Ann Prestine, Committee Member", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Member", "Bernard Joel Badiali, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Collaboration", "professional development", "teachers' perceptions"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Practice of Medicine in Yucatan and the Southern Gulf Coast, 1600-1830", "id": "28705", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12354", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study addresses issues of legitimate/illegitimate medical practices as they pertained to socially constructed and enforced identities in Yucatan and the southern Gulf Coast region, 1600-1830.

Yet in colonial Yucatan and the southern Gulf Coast region, medical practitioners could and did simultaneously occupy both legitimate and illegitimate categories of practice as well as move freely between those categories, depending on the circumstances. The exigencies of daily life, early modern beliefs about the nature of evil, and local politics all became factors in the determination of the legitimacy of medical practice and practitioners in a region characterized by the circulation of ideas and movement of people.

The federal Constitution and all state constitutions protect the right to practice one\u2019s religion freely, but how durable are these protections in the face of laws that prohibit what believers feel they must do because of religion?  This dissertation explores the results of the judicial process Americans pursue when their religious and legal duties come into conflict, and does so in the context of the state appellate judicial system.  It uses multivariate statistical modeling techniques to answer two related questions:  (1) what factors predict whether a free exercise claim will be upheld or rejected in the state courts, and (2) what factors predict the form of legal test on which judges base their decisions.  Legal positivist and legal realist frameworks from the sociology of law are employed to address these research questions.  Content analysis of published opinions in the state appellate court systems from mid-1997 to 2011 was conducted to generate the dataset employed to test hypotheses related to the two research questions.  The dissertation finds that claimants in state appellate free exercise cases are rarely successful; the vast majority of claims are not upheld by the courts.  The dissertation also finds that when judges use legal tests that balance the severity of burdens imposed by the government on religious exercise against the government\u2019s interest in doing so, they are more likely to uphold free exercise claims than when a rational-basis test is used.

The DER is a measure of device performance, under standard testing conditions, relating the effective UV germicidal dose delivered to an airborne population of microorganisms to the power input into the UV-producing device that permits estimation of performance under other conditions and comparison between devices.  The DER is microbiologically-based in that the performance of an in-duct UV device is directly related to its ability to inactivate standard test organisms.  For this project, Bacillus subtilis (bacterial endospore) and Aspergillus niger (fungal spore) were selected as the reference organisms.  To establish the relationship between device performance and organism inactivation, accurate UV dose-response models and model parameters were established for each organism using novel dual-collimated-beam reactor designs.   \n\nUV exposure systems typically used for microbial inactivation studies collimate UV energy from only one direction, resulting in two issues that can affect the accuracy of the results, leading to uncertainty in the observed organism response.  First, the systems do not allow for UV irradiance measurements during microorganism exposure.  An average of measurements taken before and after exposure is assumed to represent the irradiance incident on the microorganisms during an actual exposure test.  Second, the systems require the determinations of numerous correction factors which are then included in estimations relating measured pre- and post-irradiance readings to the calculated irradiance levels experienced by the microbial population.  Four correction factors are generally required for systems equipped with low-pressure mercury UV lamps.  Including these correction factors in the UV dose calculation does not account for all aspects of system design or any lamp output variations that might occur during microbial exposures (when the radiometer sensor is not in place to record them).  To address the above issues associated with single-collimation reactors, and to improve the accuracy of microbial inactivation rate constant (k-value) determinations, two new dual-collimated-beam UV reactors are developed and characterized in this project and then employed to establish UV dose-response models for two standard microorganisms.  The first reactor allowed testing of aqueous microbial suspensions, while the second reactor allowed testing of microorganisms suspended in air.\n\nThese new dual-collimated-beam reactor designs provide two distinct advantages over traditional single collimation systems.  First, they allow real-time UV dose determination, which helps capture any UV lamp variations that may occur during the exposure tests, that allows microbial exposure tests to be terminated at directly-measured, desired dose levels.  Secondly, the dual-collimated-beam design allows for simple actinometric determination of necessary correction factors relating the real-time radiometer readings of irradiance to the actual irradiance levels experienced by the microorganism population being exposed.\n\nHaving determined the inactivation kinetics models for the two reference organisms using the new dual-collimated-beam reactors, the organisms were used as biodosimeters to measure the effective UV dose provided by full scale, in-duct UV devices.  The effective UV dose is a key variable in calculating the proposed DER metric.  To demonstrate the rating concept, the effective UV doses provided by five different in-duct UV lamp devices are determined by conducting tests with the reference organisms in a large, full-scale test rig over a range of air flow rates typical of most residential and commercial ventilation systems.  The UV dose provided by each in-duct device was determined by comparing the microbial inactivation measured in the rig to the reference inactivation curves established in the dual-collimated-beam reactors for the two organisms.  These UV dose values were then used to calculate the proposed DER metrics and demonstrate their usefulness to building owners and facility managers.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9239], "author_name_tesi": "Martin, Stephen Benjamin", "last_name_ssi": "Martin", "middle_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "first_name_ssi": "Stephen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Freihaut", "William P Bahnfleth", "James Freihaut", "William P Bahnfleth", "Richard George Mistrick", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Freihaut, Dissertation Advisor", "William P Bahnfleth, Dissertation Advisor", "James Freihaut, Committee Chair", "William P Bahnfleth, Committee Chair", "Richard George Mistrick, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation", "UVGI", "In-Duct", "Biodosimeter", "Air Disinfection", "Collimated Beam", "k-value"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Actresses on the London Stage, 1670-1755: A Prosopographical Study", "id": "8349", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5693", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nWhen the London theatres re-opened after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, actresses appeared on the public English stage for the first time.

This thesis argues that in order to gain an accurate picture of the place which women occupied in the theatre, and how this new occupation functioned, actresses at different levels need to be considered. To this end I will employ the technique of prosopography (group biography) for tracking and analyzing the professional and personal experiences of a significant number of actresses in the long eighteenth-century.\nFor a prosopographical study two elements need to be in place, (1) sufficient data for a detailed survey, which can provide credible results, to be carried out, and (2) a system which enables the relevant data to be extracted from the information available. I contend that the advantage of this method, often employed by historians and social scientists, is that it allows for consideration not only of the major actresses of the period, but also the minor company members. My aim is not to create detailed biographies of individuals but to look for patterns and trends in the group as a whole and thus provide as broad a view of female acting careers in the eighteenth-century as extant records will allow.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5688], "author_name_tesi": "Martin, Susan Mary", "last_name_ssi": "Martin", "middle_name_ssi": "Mary", "first_name_ssi": "Susan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Hume", "Clement C Hawes", "Laura Lunger Knoppers", "John Thomas Harwood", "John Philip Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Hume, Committee Chair", "Clement C Hawes, Committee Chair", "Laura Lunger Knoppers, Committee Member", "John Thomas Harwood, Committee Member", "John Philip Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["eighteenth-century drama", "actresses", "theatre history"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "An Investigation of Kinases Responsible for Site-specific Phosphorylation of p70s6k1 in Skeletal Muscle Following Chronic Functional Overloading\n\n", "id": "20079", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9545", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\nThe protein kinase p70S6K1 is a known regulator of cell growth as deletion of its gene results in smaller cell size and consequently reduced organ and body sizes. Its activity is modulated through multisite phosphorylation, some of which is mediated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. The present project was designed to investigate the roles of mTORC1 and that of other signaling pathways in the phosphorylation of p70S6K1 in an animal model of induced hypertrophic growth of skeletal muscle. Within 24 h of male Sprague Dawley rats undergoing unilateral tenotomy to induce chronic functional overloading of the plantaris muscle, phosphorylation of the Thr389 and  the Thr421/Ser424 sites on p70S6K1 was significantly elevated compared to a control plantaris from the contralateral leg. \nTo further investigate regulation of phosphorylation of these sites on p70S6K1, a cell culture model system was employed for easier manipulation of signaling pathways. In HEK293E cells deprived of serum for 2.5 h to impair cell growth, treatment with insulin-like-growth factor 1 (IGF-1) for 30 min resulted in a robust stimulation of the phosphorylation of the Thr389 and the Thr421/Ser424 sites on p70S6K1. In this model system, rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1, and TORIN2, an inhibitor of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, each prevented IGF-1-induced stimulated phosphorylation of the Thr389 site on p70S6K1 but not that of the Thr421/Ser424 sites.  The JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuated the IGF-1-induced stimulated phosphorylation of the Thr421/Ser424 sites on p70S6K1 but not that of the Thr389 site, and in combination with TORIN2 it blocked the effect of IGF1 on both sites. In contrast, inhibitors of the MAP kinase signaling pathway including UO126 and SB203580 had no effect on the IGF-1-induced stimulated phosphorylation of the Thr 389 and the Thr421/Ser424 sites whereas anisomycin, an activator of the JNK pathway specifically stimulated phosphorylation of the Thr421/Ser424 sites but not the Thr389 site. \nTo assess a possible role for JNK in mediating phosphorylation of p70S6K1 on the Thr421/Ser424 sites in vivo, rats were treated with SP600125 6 h prior to tissue harvest following tenotomy.  SP600125 attenuated the tenotomy-induced elevated phosphorylation of the Thr421/Ser424 sites on p70S6K1 but had no effect on that of Thr389.  Phosphorylation of JNK was elevated following tenotomy and this was prevented by treatment with SP600125, providing additional evidence of a role for the JNK signaling pathway in mediating regulation of p70S6K1 in this experimental model of hypertrophic growth.  Taken together, the results from these two experimental model systems demonstrate that both the mTORC1 and JNK signaling pathways contribute to the stimulation of cell growth by mediating site-specific phosphorylation of p70S6K1.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9317], "author_name_tesi": "Martin, Tony Dewayne", "last_name_ssi": "Martin", "middle_name_ssi": "Dewayne", "first_name_ssi": "Tony", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Scot R Kimball", "Ralph Lauren Keil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Thesis Advisor", "Scot R Kimball, Thesis Advisor", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["MAPK signaling", "muscle hypertrophy", "tenotomy"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Resonant Scattering Phase Shifts of Ultracold Cesium and Their Energy Dependence", "id": "19362", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8528", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation describes the first measurement of an atomic Feshbach resonance\nas a function of the collision energy between two clouds of ultracold cesium atoms.\nThe resonance is observed as a large phase excursion in the s-wave collisional phase\nshift.

Furthermore, pioneering research on the topic of olfactory-visual interactions has utilized fMRI to delineate the neural networks underlying the interplay between these two sensory systems (44-55). However, many of these studies employed fMRI paradigms to better understand the influence of visual information over olfactory processing.  This dissertation aimed to utilize olfactory-visual association fMRI paradigms to better elucidate the reciprocal relationship between the olfactory and visual systems in the human brain. The overall goal was to develop a more comprehensive model of the neural networks underlying the human olfactory function.\n\tOlfaction is the most studied chemosensory system, however, the functioning of this network is still not well understood because of its complicated neuroanatomical organization (56).  This dissertation, therefore, sought to elucidate several unknown aspects of the functional connection between the olfactory and visual systems by testing several hypotheses about this innate connection.  First, Chapter 2 of this dissertation focused on investigating the role of congruence during the formation of olfactory-visual associations.  It was hypothesized that olfactory-visual associations could be rapidly formed by a neutral, non-lexical abstract visual symbols, as evidenced by significant olfactory system activation during testing conditions consisting of presenting a visual cue that was previously paired with an odor compared to an unpaired visual cue. It was also hypothesized that a lexical, semantically congruent visual cue, would produce greater olfactory-visual activation during both the acquisition and testing phases compared to a lexical, semantically incongruent visual cue or a neutral, non-lexical symbol.  The results reinforced that rapid olfactory-visual associations could be formed by neutral, non-lexical visual cues, via modulation of visual activation by visual information. This indicated that olfactory-visual associations could be formed innately, in a reflexively manner to facilitate the odor naming process.  Furthermore, lexical, semantically congruent, multisensory visual cues were found to elicit patterns of greater visual and language-related activation, mostly likely subserving an olfactory-visual-lexical integrative process that may be responsible for odor identification and naming in the human brain (57-59).\n\tChapter 3 of this dissertation tested the hypothesis that an odor-attention task, involving higher-order cognitive decision-making and attentional processes to an olfactory stimulus, will elicit significantly stronger olfactory-visual associative neural activation compared to less complex visual-attention task that requires only detection of a visual stimulus.  The findings here indicated that rapid olfactory-visual associations may be formed via modulation of the visual system by olfactory information, regardless of the task context.  This suggests a unique, intrinsic mechanism between the olfactory and visual systems that provides odors an avenue to influence visual processing of stimuli, regardless of which sensory cue is selectively attended to.  \n\tChapter 4 of this dissertation consisted of an investigation of the effect of age on neural activity in response to an olfactory-visual association paradigm in an older, cognitively normal participant cohort.  Based on previous findings, it was hypothesized that a significant age-related decline would be observed in neural activity in response to this paradigm and that male subjects would display significantly greater deficits on olfactory-visual associative activation compared to female subjects.  The results highlighted a significant effect of normal aging on the olfactory-visual functional connection and differential patterns of decline were observed in men and women, with women appearing to be more resilient to this effect.\n\tIn summary, this dissertation made significant strides in elucidating several unknown aspects of this under-researched piece of brain function.  Overall, the results support the existence of an innate olfactory-visual functional connection, in that rapid olfactory-visual associations can be formed using non-lexical, neutral symbols, but that a lexical, semantically congruent visual cue \u201cSmell\u201d appears to elicit stronger associations between olfactory and visual stimuli, leading to increased activation in visual brain regions.  Furthermore, higher order cognitive tasks also appear to influence this effect by increasing activation in visual and olfactory regions, thus likely enhancing the strength of the olfactory-visual association.  Finally, it was also observed that there is a significant, negative effect of age of the innate functional connection between the olfactory and visual systems and that women may be more resilient to this effect due to improved connectivity between olfactory structures.  Taken together, these findings not only provide evidence of an innate olfactory-visual functional connection, but also offer valuable insight into modulating factors of this connection.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14624], "author_name_tesi": "Martinez, Brittany Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Martinez", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Brittany", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qing X.

However, there are many challenges in studying this community of microorganisms, and the past 20 years of study have only begun to shed light on this vast and complex ecosystem.  With each chapter herein I have taken on some of those challenges and have made progress in overcoming them, while also contributing to the knowledge of an environment that\u2014despite its potential significance\u2014remains relatively unexplored.  In particular I have focused on the application of molecular methods to the study of the subseafloor biosphere, which is complicated by difficulties such as low biomass, extracellular and fossil DNA, potential for drilling-induced contamination, and method biases.  In chapter 2, I examined the potential sources of molecular signals suggestive of phototrophic organisms in the subseafloor via cultivation, DNA sequencing, and PCR-based inquiries.  Although I found that most likely the molecular signals of phototrophic organisms found in the deep biosphere do not represent viable cells, factors such as the uncertainty of DNA survival time and the paucity of information on many subseafloor taxonomic lineages made it difficult to furnish an explanation for these molecular signals.  Additionally, while I was unable to succeed in demonstrating phototrophy in cultivations, my results suggested that I was able to stimulate other microbial growth, and that  in most cases  the organisms that became dominant in the cultivations had been only a minor proportion of the original uncultivated sediment.  This is a good demonstration of the potential importance of even the \u201cminor\u201d components of a microbial community under changing environmental conditions.\nIn chapter 3, I took on the challenges of carrying out molecular work on very low biomass sediment samples by developing and testing a novel method of whole genome amplification that overcame some of the limitations of previous methods for subseafloor samples.   While the method solved some problems specific to low biomass samples and seemed a viable alternative to previous methods of whole genome amplification for these samples, my work reaffirmed previous studies in showing that there are still dangers in interpreting community data based on DNA that has been subjected to whole genome amplification with any method.  Further, I identified problems with comparing data from different sequencing technologies and with different data analysis and classification methods.  In chapter 4, I carried out a follow-up to the study of whole genome amplification utilizing samples from 2 previously uncharacterized subseafloor locations in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific.  While the limitations of utilizing amplified DNA were again reinforced, my results showed that at some levels community analysis on amplified DNA was relatively accurate.  Here I was able to show a robust taxonomic distinction between these 2 new sites from the pelagic abyss and metagenomes from 3 previously available coastal margin subseafloor locations, while also demonstrating the potential validity of predicting microbial community composition in a subseafloor location based on results from a nearby and very similar subseafloor location.  In the final chapter I took on the problem of drilling-induced contamination by carrying out the first study of its kind to extensively characterize the microbial community from both the sediments and the corresponding drilling fluid used during sample acquisition, on a range of sample depths including several samples taken with the more aggressive extended core barrel coring (XCB) method.  I found the drilling fluid to have a very minor influence in the molecular analysis of all samples except for one, which lends confidence to the study of deep cores while at the same time reinforcing the importance of making drilling fluid controls a standard part of every molecular study of subseafloor sediment samples.  Additionally, I characterized the previously unexplored microbial communities of the Costa Rica Margin subseafloor and discussed some potential linkages between subseafloor microbial taxa and pore-water geochemistry variables.\nConsidering the current state of knowledge in this environment due to its challenging nature, the work herein contributes greatly to our understanding of microbial biogeography and relationships with environmental conditions, as well as to the many complexities in performing and interpreting molecular analyses in the subseafloor.

The focus of this dissertation is on model specification and testing of time series that are subject to gradual or sudden structural changes in a nonstationary context. Both multivariate and univariate cases are studied. In the former setting, we propose a time varying error correction model in which the cointegrating vector, which may include an intercept, smoothly varies over time. The systemic Johansen's setup is a special case of our model. We model the cointegrating relationship as a dependent and heterogeneously distributed process. A likelihood ratio test on standard (time-invariant) cointegration is defined and its asymptotic distribution is derived. The limiting law is chi-square and it is shown to be a good approximation for finite samples. Moreover, it is shown that the test is asymptotically consistent for a particular class of models. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the test has power against a general set of time varying alternatives. In an application to the PPP hypothesis with US data, we find strong evidence for time varying parity with Canada, Japan, and several European countries.\nNext we propose a model which explains data that is subject to structural changes of unspecified nature in a univariate setting. The structural shifts are generated by a random walk component whose innovations belong to the normal domain of attraction of a symmetric stable law. To test our model against a stationary process, several nonparametric statistics are presented. A Wald test based on spurious regression is also defined. Asymptotic critical values are tabulated because the test distributions are non-standard. Among the procedures considered, we show that the Kwiatkowski et al (1992), the Breitung (2001), and the Wald test statistics have the best properties in terms of size and power. This approach is applied to a set of international economic variables for which at least one abrupt structural break appears to have occurred. Only for three out of eighteen time series we did not find evidence for sudden structural breaks.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3734], "author_name_tesi": "Martins, Luis Filipe Farias de Sousa", "last_name_ssi": "Martins", "middle_name_ssi": "Farias de Sousa", "first_name_ssi": "Luis Filipe", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herman J Bierens", "N Edward Coulson", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse", "Timothy T Simin", "Quang H Vuong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herman J Bierens, Committee Chair", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse, Committee Member", "Timothy T Simin, Committee Member", "Quang H Vuong, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["TIME SERIES", "NONSTATIONARITY", "STRUCTURAL CHANGES", "COINTEGRATION", "UNIT ROOT", "STABLE PROCESS"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "RESPONSES OF AMMONIA-OXIDIZING BACTERIA AND ARCHAEA TO SOIL MULCHING AND INTERACTIONS WITH SOIL TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE REGIMES", "id": "10947", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4026", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Urban areas are increasing worldwide, but little is known about the effects of urbanization on soil microbial communities and the biogeochemical cycles they mediate.  Urban soils surrounding residences and commercial structures are commonly landscaped by removing native vegetation and covering the soil with mulch. The most widespread mulching materials are bark and gravel, used to exclude undesired vegetation and promote landscaped plant growth. Mulching involves a high degree of soil disturbance and has strong potential for altering soil nitrogen (N) transformations. Nitrification, the microbially mediated oxidation of exchangeable ammonium to mobile nitrate, is arguably the most critical N transformation process occurring in soils because it has such a significant effect on N species mobility. Soil microorganisms responsible for nitrification are also expected to be affected by mulching. The ammonia oxidizers are an especially important group of nitrifiers because they carry out the first and rate-limiting step of nitrification. Two distinctive groups of ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes (AOP) co-exist in soils: ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB).  For this dissertation, three studies were conducted to investigate the effects of mulches on AOP abundance and diversity: 1) an observational study in which AOA diversity and AOP abundance were determined in soils from mulched and unmown experimental plots; 2) a controlled greenhouse study in which the abundance of AOP, potential nitrification and other soil variables were measured over time in mulched, grass-sown, and fallow soils at two temperatures; and 3) a microcosm study of whole soils and clay/silt fractions comparing abundances of AOB, AOA, and a rare lineage of AOA in the presence and absence of added ammonium.  Diversity of AOA was determined after generating clone libraries of genes encoding ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA), while abundance of AOP was determined using quantitative PCR.   In the first study, AOA community structure in gravel-mulched soils was significantly different from that in the unmowed \u00a1\u00b0parent\u00a1\u00b1 soil, and AOA abundance was lower under bark mulch than under all other treatments.  The abundance of AOB was similar in all treatments. In the second study, soil cover and temperature significantly affected the abundance of AOP over time.  At both temperatures (18 and 28\u00a1\u00c6C) AOA abundance was greater than AOB in all treatments. Whereas AOA abundance declined in all soils, AOB increased in mulched soils at 18\u00a2\u00aaC while remaining similar in fallow and grass-sown soils. Due to overall lower abundance of AOB relative to AOA, transcriptional activity of AOB was not detectable, compared to AOA transcript levels, which were higher at 18\u00a2\u00aaC than at 28\u00a2\u00aaC.  Further, a correlation was found between AOA abundance and potential nitrification at 18\u00a2\u00aaC.  In study 3, incubation of whole soils and silt/clay fractions resulted in the enrichment of a lineage of AOA sequences that had not been detected in previous clone libraries. Abundance of these sequences, which were more closely related to 1.1a crenarchaea than to the commonly recovered 1.1b and 1.3 sequences representative of soils, increased during incubation as pH decreased. These studies demonstrate different responses by AOA and AOB to mulching in urban environments and increase our knowledge of the environmental factors influencing their abundance and activity.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3999], "author_name_tesi": "Martir-Torres, Maina  Cristina", "last_name_ssi": "Martir-Torres", "middle_name_ssi": "Cristina", "first_name_ssi": "Maina ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Carmen E Martinez", "Curtis James Dell", "David Robert Huff", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maryann Victoria Bruns, Dissertation Advisor", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Chair", "Carmen E Martinez, Committee Member", "Curtis James Dell, Committee Member", "David Robert Huff, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ammonia oxidizing bacteria", "ammonia oxidizing archaea", "urban soil", "nitrogen cycling", "biogeochemistry", "crenarchaea", "mulching", "Thaumarchaeota"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Creation and evaluation of composite measures of physician practice quality using aggregated health insurance claims", "id": "15108", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7510", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study uses mixed-methods to study composite measures of physician practice quality.  First, using qualitative interview data, this study describes the opinions of stakeholders related to the utility and development of composite measures.

First, the study investigates whether multiple measures of physician practice quality conform to a latent factor structure that can be used to create composite measures.  Second, the study will also test the extent to which different techniques used to calculate composite measures lead to differences in physician practice ratings.  Third, the study will also test the stability of physician practice quality measurement and the extent to which composite measures may improve that stability.  \nThe findings raise fundamental questions about the potential utility of composite measures.  Particularly, based on the data available in this setting, a single unidimensional measure of physician practice quality should not be created, significantly limiting the potential uses of composite measures.  This would suggest that composite developers in other settings should use similar factor analytic approaches to determine if a single unidimensional measure might be appropriate.  However, if unidimensional measures cannot be created, the potential utility of composite measures is greatly diminished. Also, composite measures address very few of the concerns stakeholders had related to physician quality measurement, and they did very little to address a specific potential application of composite measures related to data lags.   Although composite measures likely still hold some utility related to improving decision making by consumers and health plans, more time should be focused on addressing more fundamental issues with quality reports that cannot be addressed by composite measures.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7449], "author_name_tesi": "Martsolf, Grant Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Martsolf", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Grant", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Patrick Scanlon", "Dennis Patrick Scanlon", "Pamela Farley Short", "Kyoungrae Jung", "Pui Wa Lei", "Carle, Adam"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis Patrick Scanlon, Dissertation Advisor", "Dennis Patrick Scanlon, Committee Chair", "Pamela Farley Short, Committee Member", "Kyoungrae Jung, Committee Member", "Pui Wa Lei, Committee Member", "Carle, Adam, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["composite measurement", "quality measurement", "physician practice", "quality improvement"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "SHAPE SHIFTERS: RESHAPING NATIVE AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND VICTIM SERVICES \n", "id": "9716", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1941", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Native American victims residing on reservations are not afforded adequate social services, victim assistance, and community justice.

All experiments were conducted at room temperature (~25\u00a2\u00aaC), at pH between 6.0 and 6.5, at an ionic strength of 0.01 M using KNO3, at a solid to liquid ration of 1.5 g of solids in 1000 ml of solution, and at a concentration of metal(s) of 0.15 mg l-1 in a volume basis or 100 mg kg-1 in a mass basis. Metal speciation in solution (total dissolved, labile, and free) and exchangeable and total metals in individual solid phases were determined. Dissolved organic carbon in solution (DOC) and that retained by the mineral phases were also determined. The results obtained are reported in three chapters titled: \n1.\tSolid- and Solution- Phase Organics Dictate Copper Distribution and Speciation in Multicomponent Systems Containing Ferrihydrite, Organic Matter, and Montmorillonite.\n2.\tCopper Redistribution in Multicomponent Systems Containing Ferrihydrite, Organic Matter, and Montmorillonite.\n3.\tSimultaneous Sorption of Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, and Nickel by Competing Solid- and Solution- Soil Constituents.\nCopper sorption reached steady-state after 4 months and was decreased due to increasing complexation of Cu in solution by DOC. Non-labile Cu-DOC complexes accounted for 82.8% of the total Cu remaining in solution after 8 months of equilibration. Sorption of DOC onto ferrihydrite was another factor accounting for the incomplete sorption of Cu observed in this study. The sorption of Cu was mostly specific (>90%) and followed the order: leaf compost (86 mg kg-1) > montmorillonite (62 mg kg-1) > ferrihydrite (15 mg kg-1). Furthermore Cu sorbed on ferrihydrite, leaf compost, and montmorillonite showed to be sensitive to perturbations caused by addition of other solid phases to the multicomponent system resulting in significant desorption of Cu from ferrihydrite (81%), leaf compost (86%), and montmorillonite (66%). Desorbed Cu tended to redistribute between leaf compost and montmorillonite. Copper did not redistribute to ferrihydrite due to blockage of its surface by DOC sorbed therein. The initial composition of a multicomponent system was highly influential on the distribution and redistribution of Cu. Decreased sorption was also observed for Cd (90%), Ni (82%), Cu (71%), and Cr (56%) due to, again, the formation of metal-DOC complexes with different degrees of lability (Cd > Ni > Cu > Cr) being Cd the most labile metal and Cr the least labile metal. Initial formation of non-labile soluble complexes hindered metal sorption while the progressive formation of non-labile species over time resulted in incomplete metal sorption by the solid phases. Leaf Compost effectively sorbed all four metals early in the experiments and continued sorbing Cd, Cu, Cr, and Ni over time. Montmorillonite sorbed all four metals initially but desorbed Cd and Ni over time. Ferrihydrite sorbed small quantities of metals only indirectly through the sorption of DOC-metal complexes.

These viruses cause subclinical acute infections that are controlled incompletely by an adaptive immune response and thus persist indefinitely in the host, residing primarily in the urogenital tracts and replicating at low levels. The immunocompetent host will shed virus asymptomatically; upon severe immunocompromise, however, uncontrolled viral replication in target organs leads to severe disease. There are currently no effective treatments for polyomavirus infection and no targeted therapies exist. The overall goal of this work is to investigate viral and host determinants of infection to better understand how such persistent viruses are controlled using a mouse model of polyomavirus infection. First, we explore how antigenic stimulation of CD8 T cells impacts the formation and function of a memory response. We demonstrate that low levels of stimulation through the TCR are sufficient to recruit subdominant CD8 T cells to non-lymphoid tissues that establish as tissue residence. Furthermore, lower stimulation of the TCR generates a more potent memory response to secondary infection. Next, we investigate the role of a virally-encoded miRNA. The MuPyV miRNA is complementary to early viral transcripts and thus decreases expression of viral antigens in a presumed immune evasion maneuver. Additionally, we show that the MuPyV miRNA targets multiple members of the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway, suggesting a novel viral mechanism by which cell cycle progression, and thus viral replication, may be enhanced. Third, we address an urgent clinical need and test the efficacy of a potential anti-PyV therapeutic in our mouse model; here we provide the first demonstration of an anti-PyV agent conferring protection in vivo by using an experimental model to mimic the natural course of human PyV-induced diseases. Together, these studies elucidate multiple viral and host determinants of infection that can be exploited to enhance host control of this persistent virus and ultimately decrease morbidity and mortality due to PyV-induced diseases.

The motivation for this work was to provide an alternative cost saving technology for the manufacture of complex geometries. Legacy components were machined from metal blanks incurring high machining costs and long delivery times due to complex geometry, the degree of machining accuracy needed, and surface finish requirements of the part. A fabrication process technology was developed to produce an alternative low-cost high quality composite component with tailored properties.  Beyond cost reduction, the main priorities of this process focused on quality and repeatability.\n\nTechnology development took place in two phases: a prototype proving phase and a production phase. For the proving phase, a machined master blade was used to create a prototype urethane tooling mold. Hybrid fiber preforms were constructed from carbon and glass fabrics to fill the complex mold cavity. Preform layups were empirically generated and sewn together. Preforms were then loaded into the mold and the assembly was placed within a containment vessel. Vinyl ester resin was injected into the mold and allowed to cure. The mold was then disassembled and the blade extracted. The geometry of the as-fabricated prototype blade was inspected using a coordinate measuring machine. The prototype blade exhibited a geometric \u2018inward bow\u2019 distortion. Geometry data and lessons learned from the prototype phase influenced development of the production phase.\n\nOn the foundation of a successful prototype part that proved development concepts, production tooling was designed and constructed from aluminum.  A novel finite element geometry correction method was developed and demonstrated to correct for prototype blade distortion by modifying mold cavity geometry. These geometry corrections were implemented in the aluminum tooling. Also, small preforms were added, and other improvements made. A production blade was fabricated using the aluminum production tooling, inspected, and compared to the prototype and the design of record (DOR). The production tooling yielded an improved blade with corrected geometry, optimized fiber fill, and accurate repeatability.\n \nThe overall manufacturing development was a success resulting in a robust low-cost resin transfer molding process for the repeatable production of high quality complex composite turbo-machinery components with sufficient geometric accuracy. Two main accomplishments are a fully developed production technology and a process engineering blueprint for developing complex composite resin transfer molding technologies. A third major achievement of this work was the successful application of the aforementioned finite element geometry correction method that accounted for material distortions to yield a part that met required tolerances.\n\nIncluded is a review of the resin transfer molding process covering studies on the effects of process variables, potential defects and countermeasures, modeling and analysis efforts, and similar fabrications.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5177], "author_name_tesi": "Maruszewski, Rance Joel", "last_name_ssi": "Maruszewski", "middle_name_ssi": "Joel", "first_name_ssi": "Rance", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Reginald Hamilton / Dr Kevin Koudela", "Kevin L Koudela", "Reginald Felix Hamilton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Reginald Hamilton / Dr Kevin Koudela, Thesis Advisor", "Kevin L Koudela, Thesis Advisor", "Reginald Felix Hamilton, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cost Saving Manufacturing Technology", "Metrology", "Geometric Inspection", "Geometry Correction by Finite Element Modeling FEM", "Fiber Reinforced Polymer FRP", "Resin Transfer Molding RTM", "Composite Fabrication", "Prototype", "Production", "Urethane Tooling", "Aluminum Tooling", "Woven Carbon Fabric", "Vinyl Ester Resin"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Exploring the Mechanisms of Passivity on Iron: Experimental Methods for Characterizing and Developing Models to Describe Nano-oxide Growth\n", "id": "7019", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "740", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-11-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis the oxide formed on iron is studied using many experimental techniques in order to aid in the refinement of a Point Defect Model (PDM) which is capable of predicting and quantifying damage due to the general corrosion of iron.  Many older electrochemical methods, like Mott-Schottky analysis, are incorporated with more modern techniques, such as scanning wavelength ellipsometry and XPS to probe the oxide film.  \n\nEllipsometry is used to obtain in-situ thickness measurements that are performed in unison with potentiostat and impedance experiments.  XPS analysis is used to determine the concentrations of Fe2+  and Fe3+ present in an oxide film formed on iron.  The information obtained is used to derive a PDM containing only oxygen vacancies.  In addition, a new idea is proposed concerning three distinct regions over the passive range exhibited by iron in a borate buffer solution.  Each region corresponds to a change in the electronic behavior of the film as evidenced by basic Mott-Schottky analysis.  It is proposed that these different regions represent phase changes for the film.\n\nFinally, the oxygen vacancy PDM is applied to implicitly determine if the major defects in the iron oxide film are oxide vacancies.  The PDM is also fitted to the experimental data to yield the kinetic parameters and to make predictions concerning the steady-state thickness and current.  A Warburg impedance is used in the fitting to obtain diffusivity measurements for the defects.  The kinetic parameters are generated as both a function of formation potential and temperature.  A discussion is provided as to the interpretation of the results and the viability of applying the PDM to the iron system.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [733], "author_name_tesi": "Marx, Brian M.", "last_name_ssi": "Marx", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald", "Howard W Pickering", "Long Qing Chen", "Thomas E Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald, Committee Chair", "Howard W Pickering, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Point Defect Model", "XPS", "Impedance", "Iron Oxide", "Iron", "Passive layer"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Reducing High-Risk College Drinking: Examining The Consumption Of Alcohol-Energy Drink Cocktails Among College Students", "id": "11653", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4258", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\nHigh-risk college drinking continues to be a major health concern affecting campuses nationwide (Ham & Hope, 2003; NIAAA, 2006). A recent trend among college students that has been associated with increased heavy episodic drinking and alcohol-related consequences is the consumption of alcohol-energy drink cocktails (e.g., Red Bull and vodka). Past studies have examined the consumption of alcohol-energy drink cocktails (O&#8223;Brien et al., 2008; Thombs et al., 2010; Woolsey et al., 2010); however, there is a lack of research examining the psychosocial variables that explain why students are choosing to engage in this high-risk drinking behavior. The present study examined psychosocial constructs important in the relationship between group membership (those who drink alcohol-energy drink cocktails versus those who drink alcohol only) and decision-making/drinking outcomes using the general unified theory of behavior. Data were collected on 387 first-year college students at a large university in the northeastern United States via a web-based survey at two time points (i.e., spring semester of freshmen year and fall semester of sophomore year). Whereas previous research has demonstrated the risks of consuming alcohol-energy drink cocktails, the current study explored why students might be choosing to participate in this high-risk drinking practice and whether these factors change over time.\nThere were two aims of the current dissertation: (1) To examine psychosocial constructs for those who consume alcohol-energy drink cocktails and those who consume alcohol only and the effects on decision-making processes/drinking outcomes for college students using a mediation analysis, and (2) To examine developmental changes from freshman to sophomore year affecting alcohol-energy drink cocktail use based on\niv\npsychosocial constructs, decision-making/drinking outcomes using a prospective longitudinal design.\nResults revealed that the association between alcohol-energy drink cocktail use and decision-making/drinking outcomes was mediated by expectancies, injunctive norms, self-concept, and self-efficacy regarding alcohol-energy drink cocktail use and that these relationships remained stable over time.

Utilizing fuels, such as syngas, bio-derived fuels, hydrogen and liquefied natural gas, present serious challenges in lean premixed gas turbine engines.  In particular, combustion phenomena, such as flashback and flameholding, are known to be sensitive to inlet flow conditions and fuel composition. Changes in composition can lead to an increase in the flame speed, resulting in upstream flame propagation. This has the potential to cause catastrophic damage to gas turbine hardware if the flame anchors at an undesired upstream location. \n\nThe current research effort investigated flameholding characteristics of a fuel injector nozzle used in lean premixed gas turbine engine operation. A single vane of a swirled, cross-flow fuel injector was examined. A test rig with optical access to the fuel injector nozzle vane was designed and constructed, such that combustion phenomena within the nozzle could be viewed and recorded through the use of a high-speed camera. It should be noted that the likely location for flameholding was presumed to be near the location of the fuel injection jets within the nozzle vane.  \n\nFor hot-fire testing, flow conditions in the combustor apparatus were closely matched to those experienced during the full-scale operation of a stationary gas turbine engine. The test apparatus was outfitted with both high- and low- frequency pressure and temperature transducers in order to determine inlet fuel and air flow conditions as well as monitor combustor performance. Once full operating conditions were reached for a given test, a hydrogen torch ignition system was fired in order to simulate a severe combustion event upstream of the fuel injector nozzle. This practice is commonly used in examining fuel injector nozzle performance. \n\nA series of tests were conducted at a wide range of flow conditions with a variety of fuel mixtures in order to develop a threshold for flameholding in terms of reference air velocity and fuel composition. A range of inlet air velocities, from 190 ft/s to 55 ft/s, and several fuel compositions were examined. Fuels studied included natural gas (~95% methane) and various ethane-natural gas mixtures to determine the nozzle\u2019s susceptibility to flashback and flameholding with natural gas and higher hydrocarbon blends.  \n\nFor all cases tested, there was no evidence of flameholding within the fuel injector nozzle after hydrogen torch firing. However, during tests at lower inlet velocities with ethane-natural gas mixtures, a flame did appear to anchor at a location downstream of the fuel injector nozzle as observed via high-speed pressure and temperature measurements. Because the flame held outside the field of view of the high-speed camera, the exact location of the hold is unknown. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5514], "author_name_tesi": "Marzelli, Steven Benjamin", "last_name_ssi": "Marzelli", "middle_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert John Santoro", "Robert John Santoro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert John Santoro, Thesis Advisor", "Robert John Santoro, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["gas turbine engines", "lean premixed", "flameholding"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Invisible Diasporas: Afro-modernism in Italy", "id": "18130", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "7175", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project traces the multifarious modalities in which African American artists and intellectuals have engaged with their European and African legacies by way of Italy, thus redressing the marginality of peoples of African descent within the historical and cultural narratives of Euro-American modernity. Prompted by Italy\u2019s oblique yet powerful participation in the history of European imperialism\u2014as well as in the discourses of avant-garde aesthetics, radical politics, and literary modernism\u2014this project is organized around key moments in the political and cultural history of the transatlantic. It spans from the colonial enterprises of the early twentieth century to the emergence of the Global South in the late sixties. By building on current scholarship that has increasingly expanded the range of perspectives assumed by Modernist Studies, I propose an alternative picture of afro-modernism, one in which both African American and Italian twentieth-century writers and thinkers actively recast the dichotomies between progressive and primitive cultures, colonizer and colonized, margin and center. Examining the symbolic and real import of Africa in the literary and cultural exchanges that took place between Harlem, Rome, and Addis Ababa (which Italy occupied in 1935), I propose the notion of \u201cliving history\u201d as a conceptual strategy used by African American and Italian intellectuals to account for their preoccupation with transatlantic history and historiography. In a context free from rigidly codified racial relations and institutionally sanctioned encounters, the intersection of a long view of history with the subjective engagement with historical and cultural processes, such as the Civil Rights Movement, pan-Africanism, decolonization, and the Cold War, engenders an alternative cultural narrative of the black transatlantic characterized by multiple conceptualizations of historicism.

My aim is thus twofold: to offer a new archive of Euro-American modernism that seeks to move beyond accepted notions and narratives of progress, nation-building, and cultural identity, while providing the historical knowledge to better cope with current migratory phenomena and processes of globalization as they intersect with the history of the Atlantic world. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7161], "author_name_tesi": "Marzioli, Sara ", "last_name_ssi": "Marzioli", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Eburne", "Jonathan Paul Eburne", "Sophia A Mcclennen", "Maria Rosa Truglio", "Janet Wynne Lyon", "Aldon Lynn Nielsen", "Kevin Michael Bell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Eburne, Dissertation Advisor", "Jonathan Paul Eburne, Committee Chair", "Sophia A Mcclennen, Committee Member", "Maria Rosa Truglio, Committee Member", "Janet Wynne Lyon, Committee Member", "Aldon Lynn Nielsen, Committee Member", "Kevin Michael Bell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["African American Literature", "Italian Literature", "African Diaspora", "Black Atlantic", "Transatlantic Studies", "Modernism"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR RESOURCE ENDOWED COUNTRIES TO AVERT THE RESOURCE CURSE PHENOMENON: WITH A CASE STUDY OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO", "id": "15119jnm5377", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15119", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The discovery of a new valuable mineral deposit in a country does not always lead to economic growth or development in a nation.

The degree of the phenomenon\u2019s effects varies from country to country. There are many causes and symptoms of the resource curse evident in the economics literature, but there is no clear guidance on how a country can avert its resource curse. \nThis study aims to identify the factors that hinder resource-rich countries\u2019 attempts to achieve sustainable development and economic growth. The relative importance of the factors is assessed, and a seven-point strategy is formulated to help resource-rich countries reduce the adverse effects of the resource curse. The study uses a qualitative-phenomenological methodology. Fifteen resource-rich countries, which either faced the phenomenon in the past, are still facing it, or never experienced it, were selected for the study population. Subsequently, the study focuses primarily on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), one of the wealthiest in terms of resource endowment, but also the most affected by the resource curse within the study population.

Professional athletes in the National Football League (NFL) impart extreme shearing forces to the surface during competition, producing divots. Divots are defined as portions of the turf gouged from the surrounding area by athletes\u2019 cleated footwear. Divoting is the primary mechanism of damage on NFL fields, as opposed to the abrasive wear and soil compaction common on more-frequently but less-intensively trafficked surfaces. \n\nDuring the latter stages of the NFL season, the cumulative removal of above- and below-ground vegetation through divoting can destabilize the playing surface. At this time of year the prevailing atmospheric and edaphic conditions in the northeastern United States are unconducive to turfgrass growth and effectively eliminate turf recovery. To restore stable footing the surface must be replaced with new sod. \n\nAside from ambient environmental conditions at sod farms, the quality of the sod installed at NFL stadia is a direct consequence of management decisions by sod growers prior to the sod harvest and installation. Since the surface will be used for competition immediately after installation, there is little time for athletic field managers to alter the surface characteristics through management practices. While some divoting is inevitable, surface stability will be prolonged if divot sizes and numbers are minimized. It is thus imperative that divot resistance is previously optimized through cultural practices at the sod farm prior to harvest, transport, and installation. \n\nThe objectives of this research were (1) Maximize divot resistance while maintaining tensile strength of thick-cut Kentucky bluegrass sod through manipulation of pre-harvest cultural practices, and (2) Determine the effects of mowing height, sand topdressing, and nitrogen fertilization on shoot density, thatch accumulation, and below ground biomass and their relationships to divot resistance.\n\nTwo field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of cutting height, sand topdressing, and nitrogen fertilization on the divot resistance of thick-cut sod immediately after harvest. Experiment 1 was spatially replicated at the Joseph Valentine Turfgrass Research Center (University Park, PA) and Tuckahoe Turf Farms (Hammonton, NJ). A four-way blend of Kentucky bluegrass (KBG) (Poa pratensis L.) cultivars was seeded during early fall of 2012. Treatments were initiated in spring of 2013. \n\nCutting height treatments were established as discrete \u201cexperiments\u201d maintained at 3.18 and 3.81 cm. Within each cutting height experiment a 2x6 topdressing x nitrogen factorial experiment was conducted.  The topdressing treatments were a control receiving no sand and a treatment including three sand applications to total 8.5 kg sand m-2. The six nitrogen treatments ranged from 96-244 kg total N ha-1 yr-1 and were further differentiated by the application timing. Applications supplied 49 kg N ha 1 via granular ammonium sulfate. Plots received either 2, 3, or 4 N applications from March-June and either no additional N or a final N application in September of 2013. \n\nSod was harvested and tested in November 2013 at a standard \u201cthick-cut\u201d profile thickness of 4.45 cm. Divots were produced with Pennswing, a weighted pendulum device. The size of each divot was measured with smaller divots indicating high divot resistance. Other parameters measured in the field included turfgrass color, surface shear strength, and sod strength. To determine the associations among these parameters and potentially related turfgrass morphological characteristics, core samples were collected from each plot  and evaluated for shoot density, thatch accumulation, and below-ground biomass.\n\nExperiment 2 evaluated the effects of four cutting heights (2.54, 3.18, 3.81, or 4.45 cm) on divot resistance, shear strength, and sod strength. Plots were maintained under identical fertilization and topdressing regimes. Treatment evaluation occurred in November 2013 using the same methods as Experiment 1.\n\nAll plots in Experiments 1 and 2 were treated with trinexapac-ethyl (TE), a plant-growth regulator which has been shown to increase divot resistance. The use of TE is common among NFL field managers and by sod growers producing turf for the NFL, so TE applications were included as part of the plot maintenance to better simulate a real-world scenario.\n\nCutting height did not significantly affect divot resistance in Experiment 1 or 2.  While it is possible that cutting height in fact has no influence on divot resistance, the lack of a cutting height effect in this project may be attributable to other factors in the experiments masking such an effect. The blend of cultivars was uniform across all experimental units. KBG cultivars are known to respond differently to various cutting heights. The individual cultivars therefore may have responded in opposing manners, masking the cutting height effect. In addition, the use of TE regulates plant morphology in a fashion similar to close defoliation (producing compact shoots and increased plant density). TE was regularly applied to all plots in Experiments 1 and 2, and may have helped mask any cutting height effect which would otherwise have occurred. \n\nLower cutting heights tended to produce higher shear strength at VRC (both Experiments 1` and 2), although TTF showed a weak trend in the opposite direction. Increased shear strength under closer cutting may be partially attributed to higher shoot density. Shear strength and density were positively, correlated, though the relationship was relatively weak (r=0.26). The low correlation coefficient indicates other turfgrass properties also influence shear strength. \n \nCutting height had no effect on sod strength in Experiment 1, but greater sod strength was obtained in Experiment 2 with higher cutting heights. However the benefit was minor and not realized until cutting height reached 4.45 cm, which is likely too high for sod intended for the NFL. As acceptable sod strength was obtained under all cutting heights, it is recommended that sod growers producing thick-cut sod for in-season replacements maintain the production field close to 3.18 cm. This cutting height is comparable to those used at NFL stadia and would not require the stadium manager to severely reduce the cutting height prior to play.\n\nDivot resistance was negatively impacted by high N rates. Small divots indicated higher divot resistance. At the VRC location divot lengths were 37% larger under the 4-1 N treatment than the 3-0 treatment, which was most effective. Smaller yet analogous increases in divot width and depth were also noted at each location under the 4-1 N treatment. \n\nThe 4-1 N treatment (244 kg ha-1 total N) was the treatment most similar to the actual fertilization schedule used by TTF in 2013 during production of thick-cut sod for NFL stadia. This research project suggests N rates below the current standard may be advantageous with regard to divot resistance. High shoot density and darker green color were associated with greater N rates, but on NFL surfaces these traits are of minimal importance compared to divot resistance.\n\nAnecdotal concerns that close mowing and/or topdressing would render the turf unharvestable at 4.45 cm sod thickness were not substantiated in this project. All treatment combinations produced sod strength greater than 100 kg, which in these experiments was estimated as the minimum acceptable strength for thick-cut, big-roll sod. \n\nSignificant correlations among response variables occurred, but the correlation coefficients were relatively weak. These relationships indicate divot resistance is affected by multiple properties rather than a single turfgrass characteristic. Divot length was the strongest measure of divot resistance and was negatively related to shear strength \n(r= -0.47) and sod strength (r= -0.38). Surprisingly, divot length was not significantly correlated to below-ground biomass. Thatch thickness, however was significantly related to divot length (r= -0.26). The relationship was negative, indicating plots with thicker thatch layers also had shorter divots. Such a relationship is contrary to reports from practitioners, most of whom opine divot resistance to be compromised by thatch buildup. The relationship between thatch and divot resistance is complex and may depend on factors not accounted for in this study such as depth of cleat penetration, impact angle, and the physiochemical properties of the thatch layer (e.g. water status, lignin content, state of decomposition). In the future, a research tool should be developed which more accurately simulates the divot-producing mechanisms of NFL athletes.\n\nLittle research has investigated production of thick-cut sod with regard to in-season replacement of American football fields. The goal of this project was to optimize the cultural practices used by sod growers when producing thick-cut Kentucky bluegrass sod for NFL football stadia. All treatments produced harvestable sod at 4.45 cm thickness despite prior industry concern toward the imposition of close clipping as well as applications of TE and sand topdressing. Under the conditions of this study, divot resistance was improved by reducing nitrogen inputs from the current standard. Further research is needed to understand the effects of more-refined nitrogen regimes as well as the influence of thatch on divot resistance. The results of this project will aid sod growers and turfgrass managers in producing divot-resistant natural grass playing fields.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10510], "author_name_tesi": "Mascitti, Evan Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Mascitti", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Evan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Scott Mc Nitt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Scott Mc Nitt, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Kentucky bluegrass", "sod", "divot", "nitrogen", "turfgrass", "topdressing", "cutting height", "football"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Stochastic Analysis of Disruption in Supply Chain Networks\n", "id": "12087", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "812", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Supply chain risk management is becoming an increasingly important research area. A significant source of supply chain risk that should be considered in the design and control of supply chains is disruptions and random supplies. Many real-world examples in which a single catastrophic event has significantly degraded the capabilities of several suppliers leading to considerable erosion of profits and goodwill for a company exist. It is therefore essential to consider stochastic dependence among disruptions in supply chain risk management. The dependence of disruptions may have either adverse or favorable impact on the cost and service level of the supply chain depending on the structure of the supply chain. In addition, the inventory control policies of the nodes can be changed as the dependence among the capacities of the nodes increases or decreases. This forms the central thesis of the research presented. We focus on modeling and analysis of supply chains with stochastically dependent disruptions and their impact on the design, control, and performance evaluation of supply chains.\n\nWe first consider an m-manufacturer, 1-retailer, newsvendor inventory system with stochastically dependent manufacturing capacities, caused by random disruptions that may simultaneously inflict damages to the capacities of the manufacturers.  We develop the structural/analytical properties of key performance measures and optimal inventory policies for the multi-source and assembly inventory systems. We show that stochastic dependence in disruptions can have opposite effects on system performance in the multi-source and assembly systems. While risk diversification is preferred in the multi-source system, risk concentration is preferred in the assembly system. We then introduce a new method to numerically estimate the joint distribution of the disruptions. Estimating this dependence relation is a difficult undertaking since the estimate should be based on the manufacturers' spatial layout,   possible causal relations, and field data. We propose to use a new methodology developed in recent years, vine copula, to construct the dependence relation of the disruption vector. The proposed method first receives required input from the user, including manufacturing location, historical data and other system parameters. Based on the user inputs, we create the vine and estimate the parameters of the vine copula by applying likelihood methods. To test the performance of our method we construct a comprehensive set of numerical examples and show that our method can predict the costs of the multi-source and assembly systems with the average error of 2.1% and 3.3%, respectively.\n\nFinally, we extend our dependence analysis to m-manufacturer, 1-retailer, periodic-review inventory systems. Under this dynamic setting, we assume that the disruption of a manufacturer in each period depends on its disruption in the previous period and an external shock factor, where the shock factors across suppliers are stochastically dependent. This multivariate Markov chain model allows us to capture temporal and spatial effects of disruptions. Under backlogging scenario, we show that similar to the single-period results, positive dependence of supply disruptions has adverse effects on the performance of the multi-source system, but favorable effects on the performance of the assembly system. We then apply the vine copula method to numerically estimate the joint distribution of the disruption vector under the dynamic setting.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [805], "author_name_tesi": "Masihtehrani, Behdad ", "last_name_ssi": "Masihtehrani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Behdad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Drs Soundar Kumara And Susan Xu", "Soundar Kumara", "Susan Xu", "Tao Yao", "M Jeya Chandra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Drs Soundar Kumara And Susan Xu, Dissertation Advisor", "Soundar Kumara, Committee Chair", "Susan Xu, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Optimal inventory policy", "Copula and vine-copula", "Supermodular and orthant dependence orders", "Multi-source and assembly structures", "Dependent supply disruptions", "Performance bounds", "Numerical analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "NEOLIBERAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF \u201cWHITE MASCULINITY\u201d IN CINEMATIC MEDIA - 1970-2015", "id": "13578jam964", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13578", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation looks at three U.S. film cycles from the last 40 years -- the Cowboy Trucker in the 1970s, the Brom-com from 1990s-2010, and Alaska-based reality television shows from the late 2000s and into the present cable reality television era -- to connect them to neoliberal transformations of the workplace.

Recent studies have shown that brook trout populations have declined throughout much of Pennsylvania due to increased sedimentation, increasing water temperatures, and competition with non-native species. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of using thalweg profile metrics and other habitat features to predict brook trout density and to determine what factors may be limiting brook trout density in Pennsylvania streams.\nTwenty eight study streams located within the Susquehanna River Basin in central Pennsylvania were selected using information from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commissions\u2019 (PFBC) fisheries management database. These 28 streams were divided between the Ridge and Valley and Appalachian Plateau physiographic provinces. At each stream, a reach of approximately 250m in length was surveyed to measure the thalweg profile as described by Mossop and Bradford (2006). From the thalweg profile, metrics describing length in residual pool, mean maximum residual pool depth, variation index, and mean square error were calculated. Number of pools per kilometer and gradient were also calculated for each study reach from the thalweg profile. Substrate composition, bank erosion, cover, and large woody debris were evaluated at twenty evenly-spaced transects throughout the study reach. Water quality parameters including pH, temperature, and alkalinity were recorded within the study reach. Drainage area and land use composition were determined for the watershed area upstream of the study reach using GIS. \nFish were sampled at each study reach using backpack electrofishing. Two streams were sampled using mark-recapture techniques and 26 were sampled using multiple pass removal in the same reach where the thalweg profile was measured. Brook trout density was estimated using appropriate multiple pass removal estimators or the Petersen mark-recapture estimator. Brook trout were measured (TL, mm) and a sub-sample was weighed (g). All other species were recorded as present. \nBrook trout density was highly variable among streams. I did not find a significant difference in brook trout densities between the Appalachian Plateau and Ridge and Valley physiographic province. The results indicate that the thalweg metrics were not strong predictors or potentially limiting factors of brook trout abundance. Using simple linear regression, percent residual pool (  = -1 + 0.28, r2 = 0.33, p < 0.01) and mean maximum depth (  = -2.5 + 1.13, r2 = 0.16, p < 0.05) were significantly negatively correlated with log10- brook trout density. Mean wetted width (  = -0.19 + 0.04, r2 = 0.47, p < 0.01), percent gradient ( = 0.11 + 0.04, r2 = 0.25, p < 0.01), non-brook trout species (  = -0.08 + 0.03, r2 = 0.25, p < 0.01), and drainage area (  = -0.02 + 0.01, r2 = 0.16, p < 0.05) were also significantly correlated with log10- brook trout density. Using quantile regression mean wetted width, gradient, pools per kilometer, and non brook trout species were significant limiting factors for brook trout densities. \nThe results of this study indicate that brook trout restoration and protection has its highest potential in smaller higher gradient streams. The addition of many smaller pools rather than a few large pools would provide a greater benefit for brook trout restoration. Streams should be evaluated for limiting factors before restoration is pursued. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1310], "author_name_tesi": "Mason, Doris A", "last_name_ssi": "Mason", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Doris", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Paola Ferreri", "Dr Paola Ferreri", "Tyler Wagner", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read", "John Sweka"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Paola Ferreri, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Paola Ferreri, Thesis Advisor", "Tyler Wagner, Thesis Advisor", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read, Thesis Advisor", "John Sweka, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["thalweg", "stream channel morphology", "brook trout", "stream habitat"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Visual Perspectives and Decision-Making in Geospatial Uncertainty", "id": "15351jms1186", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15351", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation addresses visual perspectives and decision-making in geospatial uncertainty and fills a gap in current research by presenting three articles in a holistic approach spanning different areas of the field. The first paper in the dissertation presents an overview of the entire field of geospatial uncertainty visualization through the creation of a typology and its visualization - the visual summary. The typology and its visualization were developed and refined based on feedback from other experts in the field, highlights smaller research domains within the entire realm and shows some of the major relationships between them. The overall usefulness of the visual summary can be shown in its ability to be used to summarize both individual papers at a glance as well as summarize the entire field. This visual summary extends current existing approaches to taxonomies by allowing users a quick visual overview of relevant topics in a research area at a glance. \nThe second paper, an introductory article for a special issue on visually-supported reasoning under uncertainty, utilizes the visual summary as shown in paper one to show both the typology and the utility of its graphic representation for quickly summarizing each article within the field as a whole and also showing their unique contributions to the different sub-domains. It also allows for direct comparison between the three articles published in the special issue and visual identification of research topics not covered from the field.\nThe final paper looks at various factors including individual differences and different map characteristics to identify their relationship in making evacuation decisions. This was conducted through an iterative process in which results from the first study informed the two subsequent studies to compose a more synergistic and comprehensive understanding of decision-making under uncertainty for an approaching hurricane. Study one showed that having more certainty in flooding correlated to higher evacuation rates with marginal significance. Participants also paid attention to the flood height category, stating they would choose to evacuate most in the highest flood height zone closest to the ocean and least in the lowest blue flood height zone found farthest from the ocean. Evacuation rates were also higher overall in a mild flood scenario over a more severe scenario. This led to exploring the maps further and finding that by using real data, the mild flood scenario a lower flood height zone was adjacent to the ocean instead of the highest flood height zone, potentially influencing the results. In study two, the maps in the mild flood scenario were redrawn to close the gap in the highest flood zone so that only this zone occurred adjacent to the ocean. The data showed that participants again evacuate more in the higher flood zones and mild flood scenarios. Study three attempted to disentangle how distance to the ocean and the flood height zones impacted decisions.

The non-viable nature of such devices is a critical drawback especially for pediatric cases due to the inability of the graft to grow in vivo with the patients. A tissue engineered heart valve (TEHV) with remodeling and growth ability, is conceptually appealing to use in the surgical repair and could serve as a permanent replacements when operating for pediatric valvular lesions. It is critical that scaffolds for functional heart valve tissue engineering, be capable of mimicking the native leaflet\u2019s structure and mechanical properties at the time of implantation. Meanwhile, the scaffolds should be able to support cellular proliferation and native-like tissue formation as the TEHV remodels toward a scaffold-free state.\nOur overall hypothesis is that an \u201cideal\u201d engineered construct, designed based on native leaflet\u2019s structure and mechanics, will complement a native heart valve leaflet in providing benchmarks for use in the design of clinically-applicable TEHV. This hypothesis was addressed through several experiments conducted in the present study. To establish a functional biomimetic TEHV, we developed scaffolds capable of matching the anisotropic stiffness of native leaflet while promoting native-like cell and collagen content and supporting the ECM generation. Scaffolds with various polymer contents (e.g., poly (glycerol sebacate) (PGS) and poly (\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL)) and structural designs (e.g., microfabricated and microfibrous scaffolds), were fabricated based on native leaflet\u2019s structure and mechanics. It was found that the tri-layered scaffold, designed with assembly of microfabricated PGS and microfibrous PGS/PCL was a functional leaflet capable of promoting tissue formation. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of cyclic stress and flexure individually on the TEHV development, we designed a simple and novel stretch-flexure bioreactor in which samples were subjected to well-defined stimulations with a controlled strain-rate.

Studies of gravitropism have traditionally focused on reorientation of horizontally placed roots to restore vertical downward growth.  In nature, however, it is much more likely that a root will be forced to reorient by growing into a rock, a hard-pan layer of soil, or some other impenetrable obstacle.  I have designed a bioassay to examine the interaction of roots with obstacles preventing downward growth and have characterized the response of both primary and lateral roots of Arabidopsis to these barriers.  These experiments have shown that both touch and gravity signals appear to be integrated in the root cap, and that the response to a barrier is dependant on the gravitropic set-point angle of the root.  As I have attempted to unravel the relative importance of touch and gravity signaling, I have examined the requirement of gravisensing for this response using both mutants with altered gravisensing abilities, and laser ablation of the gravity sensing root cap cells.  I have also modified the angle of the obstruction by presenting the roots with both concave and convex barriers.  I have demonstrated that a similar response occurs in the larger roots of cress, while a somewhat different response occurs in timothy grass, a monocot with roots similar in size to Arabidopsis.  I have developed, constructed, and flown Space Shuttle hardware to examine touch responses under microgravity conditions.  Due to technical difficulties, however, I was unable to obtain data on plant growth from this experiment.  In addition, analysis using a clinostat to randomize growth has allowed us to determine that touch down-regulates the graviresponse by reducing the curvature of gravistimulated roots.  Also, touch reduces the rate of amyloplast sedimentation in the central columella cells, cells that when removed have the strongest deleterious impact on gravitropism.  To understand signaling cross-talk between touch and gravisensing I characterized a microtubule-dependent increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ upon touch in the peripheral cells, and this Ca2+ spike moved as a \u2018wave\u2019 into the columella cells of the root cap.  Generation of an artificial Ca2+ increase will cause the roots to reverse the direction of growth along an obstacle in the manner of a root hitting a secondary object while traversing a barrier.  Immunofluorescence showed that the microtubules in these peripheral cells are oriented differently than in columella cells or in cells that are sloughed off.  In addition, touch reduced the pH alterations that occur in the root cap upon gravistimulation. I propose, therefore, that touch is sensed in the root cap via an intact, dynamic microtubule array, and this force sensing leads to the observed cytoplasmic Ca2+ transients.  This Ca2+ \u2018wave\u2019 inhibits either gravity sensing or response events, and inhibition of gravitropism allows the development of a normal obstacle induced response.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2016], "author_name_tesi": "Massa, Gioia Donna", "last_name_ssi": "Massa", "middle_name_ssi": "Donna", "first_name_ssi": "Gioia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Cyr", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Simon Gilroy", "Claude Walker Depamphilis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Cyr, Committee Member", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member", "Simon Gilroy, Committee Chair", "Claude Walker Depamphilis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gravitropism", "thigmotropism", "gravity", "touch", "plant", "root"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Drug Dealing as Livelihood Practice: Space, Social Relations, and Everyday Life in Urban Illegal Economies", "id": "28735", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12381", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Through feminist attention to the everyday, inner-workings of the drug economy, this research explores the contested spaces of the neighborhood block as both stages for the enactment of the \u2018war on drugs,\u2019 and intimate, formative spaces for black men as they rely on the drug economy and navigate aggressive policing and incarceration.

In the first part of this thesis, research is presented towards understanding the ion association states (free ions, ion pairs and ion aggregates) in ionomer systems, and the correlation of ion association states, ion conduction, polymer dynamics, and morphology. Ion conductivity in ionomers can be improved by lowering glass transition temperature, increasing polymer ion solvation ability, and adjusting ionomer structural variables such as ion content, cation type and side chain structure. These effects are studied in three ionomer systems respectively, using a combination of characterization methods. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) identifies and quantifies the ion association states. Dielectric Spectroscopy (DRS) characterizes ion conductivity and polymer and ion dynamics. X-ray scattering reveals changes in morphology.\n\nThe influence of a cation solvating plasticizer on a polyester ionomer is systematically investigated with respect to ion association states, ion and polymer dynamics and morphology. A decrease in the number ratio of ion aggregates with increased plasticizer content and a slight increase at elevated temperature are observed in FTIR. Similar results are also detected by X-ray scattering. As determined from dielectric spectroscopy, ion conductivity increases with plasticizer content, in accordance with the decrease in glass transition temperature.\n \nResearch on copolymer of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PTMO) based ionomers further develops an understanding of the trade-off between ion solvation and segmental dynamics. Upon the incorporation of PTMO, the majority of the PTMO microphase separates from the PEO-rich microphase, and ionic groups are preferentially solvated by PEO chains and reside in the PEO-rich microphase. As the ratio of PTMO increases, the fraction of aggregates increases, resulting in more highly coordinated aggregation states. Results on ion association states are in good agreement with previous results on ion conductivity, polymer dynamics and morphology.\n\nThe effects of ion content, cation type and ionic side chain structure on ion association states are systemically studied in a series of ionomers with short ethylene oxide and ionic sulfonated styrene side chains, and then correlated to the ion and polymer dynamic characterization. It is found that ionomers with modest ion content, large cation and styrene ionic side chain have the most \u201cfree ions\u201d and ion pairs, and highest ion conductivity. Ion conduction in ionomers is optimized by systematically changing their chemical structures.\n\nIn addition to knowledge of ion association states, a IR band shape also contains information on molecular dynamics. In companion investigation, the vibrational relaxation and dynamic transitions of conformationally insensitive normal modes in two different polymer systems (atactic polystyrene and deuterated poly(methyl methacrylate)) are studied. The information on vibrational relaxations is resolved by conducting precisely controlled FTIR experiments, applying specialized curve resolving data analysis, and calculating time correlation functions through numerical Fourier transformation. The vibrational relaxations of these modes can be described by a two process model: a fast process on the time scale of 0.01 ps, which is inhomogeneously broadened by a slow process on the time scale of picoseconds.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9139], "author_name_tesi": "Masser, Hanqing ", "last_name_ssi": "Masser", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hanqing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul C Painter", "James Patrick Runt", "Ralph H Colby", "Qiming Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul C Painter, Dissertation Advisor", "James Patrick Runt, Dissertation Advisor", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["infrared spectroscopy", "ionomer", "ion association states", "dielectric", "ion conduction", "lithium ion", "molecular dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Dynamics of Hydrogen Bonding Polymer Blends Exhibiting Minimized Self Associations and Liquid Crystalline Polymers Of Unique Chemistry", "id": "11357", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3328", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The dynamics and states of hydrogen bonding in miscible polymer blends which preferentially form intermolecular associations are investigated.  A homopolymer and a copolymer based on poly(p-(hexafluoro-2-hydroxyl-2-propyl)styrene) (PolyHFS) form strong intermolecular associations, while the two-CF3 groups provide steric shielding around the hydroxyl group, reducing the ability to form hydrogen bonds with other PolyHFS molecules, while maintaining the ability to form intermolecular associations with another polymer.  As well as the HFS homopolymer, a copolymer of the HFS monomer with 2,3-dimethylbutadiene (DMB) was synthesized (HFS[14]:DMB[86]).  Purified PolyHFS was blended with a variety of proton accepting polymers, including poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME), poly(2-vinyl pyridine) (P2VPy), poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc), poly(ethylene[30]-ran-vinyl acetate[70]) (EVA70), and poly(ethylene[55]-ran-vinyl acetate[45]) (EVA45).  The purified HFS[14]:DMB[86] was blended with PVME.  The selection of proton accepting polymers allows for a systematic variation of the hydrogen bonding strength: P2VPy>>PVME>vinyl acetate, as well as a systematic variation of the numbers of interacting sites: PVAc>EVA70>EVA45, and PolyHFS>HFS[14]:DMB[86].  Broadband dielectric relaxation spectroscopy was used to evaluate the relaxation behavior of the blends.  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to quantify the hydrogen bonding types and concentrations.\n\tHFS[14]:DMB[86] blends with PVME exhibit a single glass transition temperature, but two dynamic glass transitions (alpha relaxations) at certain compositions due to concentration fluctuations.  The glassy state motion of PVME in the copolymer blends is not suppressed, since a relatively small number of HFS segments are present at any composition.  In contrast, the local motion of the HFS:DMB copolymer, related to motions of the HFS segment, is completely suppressed by hydrogen bonding in all blends.\n\tGlassy state motions are suppressed in the PVME and P2VPy blends with the HFS homopolymer, and the suppression is dependent on the functional group accessibility.  Due to the reduced hydrogen bond strength between HFS and the vinyl acetate functionality, local relaxations are not suppressed in these blends.  A local relaxation for free functional groups as well as hydrogen bonded functional groups is present, and the relative magnitudes of these processes can be quantified by the predictions of the Painter-Coleman association model.  Based on these results, it is likely the glassy state behavior can be well described in any hydrogen bonding blend where the hydrogen bonding behavior can be quantified.\nThe HFS homopolymer blends all exhibit a single glass transition, and a single alpha relaxation.  The dynamic fragility is dependent upon the fraction of intermolecularly associated segments, and the compositions with the highest fragilities are the compositions with the greatest degree of intermolecular coupling.  The blends with the highest fragility can be predicted based upon quantification of the infrared and dielectric results.  A relaxation related to the breaking and reforming of hydrogen bonds is present in all HFS homopolymer blends, and its relaxation behavior is dependent on the numbers and strengths of intermolecular associations.\nFinally, the dynamics of main chain liquid crystalline polymers consisting of rigid mesogens and siloxane spacer segments are investigated.

Currently, 33% of children are overweight, and over 17% are obese. A significant contributor to this childhood obesity epidemic is the current obesogenic food environment of the United States. This environment promotes the increased intake of high-energy dense foods through the promotion of large portion sizes of food products, access and availability of energy dense foods, and influential media messages such as food marketing. Studies have shown exposure to food marketing, such as food brands and food commercials, can increase food intake in children. Furthermore, several studies have shown that food brands and food commercials impact critical regions of the brain related to control, rewards, and appetite. However, it is unclear if these brain responses correlate with eating behaviors. Therefore, the primary aim of this dissertation is to evaluate whether brain response to food branding and food commercials relate to actual food intake in a laboratory setting. Study 1 of this thesis was designed to assess the effects of food branding on the brain and food intake. We found that food-brand associated activity in inferior frontal gyrus, a region associated with cognitive control, was positively associated with children\u2019s consumption from branded test-meals. Study 2 was designed to assess whether priming with food commercial would affect food intake during a multi-item meal. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of food commercials on brain response to images of food. We found that food commercials impact regions of the brain related to reward, control, emotion, and attention, and variations in these responses could explain why some children are more vulnerable to advertising content than others. It also provided preliminary evidence that brain response to food commercial priming was related to children\u2019s laboratory food consumption. The results of these two studies suggest that food marketing techniques impact brain regions implicated in the processing of food cues and eating behavior. Furthermore, brain responses to these marketing techniques correlate to actual food intake. Therefore, reducing exposure of children to food marketing techniques, whether through public policy or parental intervention, may be essential to improve children\u2019s food behavior particularly in relation to high-energy dense foods.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16329], "author_name_tesi": "Masterson, Travis D", "last_name_ssi": "Masterson", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Travis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Loralee Keller", "Barbara Jean Rolls", "Jennifer Savage Williams", "Lisa Elizabeth Bolton", "Amanda S.

The majority of these programs are not utilizing supervision procedures found to be efficacious in past research studies (Mastroleo et al., 2008). The role of supervision on the ability to deliver a BASICS intervention with fidelity is unclear. To examine this, BASICS interventions commonly practiced in university settings (Common Practice Approach; CPA) were compared to peer delivered BASICS interventions using the supervision in published studies (Evidence-Based Application Approach, EAA ; Larimer et al., 2001). Peer counselors were randomized to either the CPA or EAA group and trained to deliver a BASICS intervention. EAA peer counselors received supervision while the CPA trained peer counselors did not. Motivational Interviewing (MI: Miller & Rollnick, 2002) skill demonstration across BASICS sessions was examined to test the effects of supervision on skill acquisition. To test intervention effects, undergraduate students were randomly selected and assigned to one of three groups (Control, EAA, CPA). Differences post-intervention on drinking norms beliefs, protective behavior engagement, and drinking outcomes (total drinks per week, weekend drinking, heavy drinking episodes, peak BAC, total negative alcohol related consequences) were compared to test the role of supervision on intervention efficacy. Both treatment groups found similar post-intervention results lending continued support for BASICS as an efficacious intervention.

The increasing prevalence of chronic disease exacerbates these problems representing a significant challenge for the healthcare system. Moreover there is a misalignment between healthcare provider\u2018s compensation and high quality care. The use of financial incentives varies according to whether providers receive their base compensation by fee-for-service, capitation or mixed payment. The purpose of this study is to develop a theoretical model to design an optimal payment system, linking base compensation and pay-for-performance to motivate provider\u2018s effort across the multiple tasks involved in successful chronic disease management. Drawing from agency theory, we propose a simple multitasking model of provider choice of patient chronic care under different base compensation schemes. Specifically, a healthcare provider (agent) treats a patient and is reimbursed by the principal (the purchaser). High quality treatment increases patient\u2018s benefits, measured as controlled blood pressure for hypertensive care for example (downstream outcome). The purchaser also observes the provider\u2018s adherence to certain clinical processes, for example the frequency of monitoring tests or the provision of smoking cessation advice (intermediate outcomes). The question is to design the optimal pay-for-performance system, given the base compensation scheme, provider\u2018s characteristics and performance measurement systems. This model is used to test the effects of alternative base payment mechanisms, provider\u2018s altruism and risk orientation, as well as the number and reliability of performance measures on the total welfare, measured as the sum of expected utility of the purchaser and the physician. Simulation analysis yields estimates of total welfare, patient\u2018s benefit, total spending, parameters of the payment system, provider\u2018s wage and percentage of provider\u2018s wage coming from pay-for-performance (i.e., size of incentives). The model further strengthens conventional arguments for mixed payment systems. Results show that the estimation of the purchaser\u2018s reward from increased quality should be made carefully to prevent overpayment. Moreover provider\u2018s altruism improves outcomes even though it may generate excessive spending on patient care. The more risk averse the provider is, the more important is the role played by pay-for-performance incentives. Therefore the incentive effects will vary substantially across providers. What is more, determining the number of performance measures and their reliability is a crucial decision for designing pay-for-performance programs. Finally, we identify perspectives for future research. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [421], "author_name_tesi": "Mata, Aurore-Laetitia ", "last_name_ssi": "Mata", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aurore-Laetitia", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Nembhard", "Harriet Black Nembhard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Nembhard, Thesis Advisor", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["chronic disease", "healthcare financing", "principal-agent"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Investigation of The Effects Of Various Parameters On A Subsonic Axial Flow Fan Performance And Tonal Noise", "id": "26571", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11601", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work was aimed at improving the efficiency and decrease the noise generated by a cooling fan used by GE transportation to cool a row of resistor networks which dissipate excess energy generated by regenerative power in an inverter application. \nThe first part of study focused on determining the effect of various parameters on the performance of the fan quantitatively by using FLUENT, a general purpose CFD code. The effects of parameters such as hub to tip ratio, chord length/thickness and solidity/number of blades was studied. Once the effect of these parameters was found a new fan was designed which increased the efficiency at the operating point from 73% to 77%. This new fan had a longer blade (increased by 0.75 inches), less number of blades (24 reduced to 18) and a larger chord length (the airfoil scaled by 1.5 time). The hub shape was also modified to reduce separation at the hub. \nAlthough a more efficient design, this new fan was found to make more noise with the peak dB levels increasing from 89dB to 110dB due to a higher rate of change of axial force on blades which is proportional to the sound pressure level.

Reducing size to insect scale enables entrance into extremely narrow spaces with inherent stealth advantages. For mass production, these vehicles must have reliable and repeatable fabrication processes that define flapping wing mechanisms with microscale features and produce large flapping amplitudes at frequencies in the range of many insects. This thesis focuses on the design and fabrication processes of flapping wing mechanisms for these types of robots.\n\nFirst, the design, fabrication, modeling, and experimental validation of the Penn State Nano Air Vehicle (PSNAV), a NAV scale piezoelectrically actuated clapping wing mechanism, is presented. A flexure hinge allows passive wing rotation for the clapping wing mechanism. Analytical models of wing flapping and rotation are derived and validated using experimental wing trajectory results. The PSNAV prototype is experimentally shown to provide approximately 54 deg. peak to peak wing rotation, 14 deg. peak to peak flapping angle, and 0.21 mN of thrust at 9.5 Hz. At 25.5 Hz, the prototype produces a maximum of 1.34 mN of thrust. The PSNAV model accurately predicts the wing resonances in the experimental prototype. Model-predicted thrust is lower than the experimentally measured values, however.\n\nTowards a compliant mechanism, the next stage of this research introduces a simple process to monolithically fabricate flying robotic insects at the pico air vehicle (PAV) scale from SUEX dry film, an epoxy based negative photoresist similar to SU-8. The developed process has fewer steps compared to other methods, does not use precious metals, and greatly reduces processing time and cost. It simultaneously defines the PAV airframe, compliant flapping mechanism, and artificial insect wing using photolithography. Using this process, we designed and fabricated the LionFly, a flapping wing prototype actuated by a PZT-5H bimorph actuator. Several LionFly prototypes were fabricated and experimentally tested. Theoretical and experimental results have excellent agreement validating the compliant mechanism kinematics and aerodynamic added mass and damping. High voltage tests show a peak to peak flapping angle of 55 deg. at 150 V amplitude with 150 V\nDC offset at 51 Hz resonance. Consistent performance from multiple prototypes demonstrate the reliable and repeatable nature of the fabrication process.\n\nLastly, this research presents detailed modeling and experimental testing of wing rotation and lift in the LionFly. A flexure hinge along the span of the wing allows the wing to rotate in addition to flapping. A linear vibrational model is developed and augmented with nonlinear aerodynamic forces using the blade element method. This model is validated using experimental testing with a laser vibrometer and accurately predicts small amplitude wing dynamics in air and vacuum. Strobe photography and high definition image processing is used to measure high amplitude wing trajectories. At higher amplitudes, the model can sufficiently predict wing trajectory amplitudes, but phase measurement and simulation have slight error. The LionFly produces 46 deg. flap and 44 deg. rotation peak to peak with relative phase of 12 deg., and maximum lift of 71 \u00b5N at 37 Hz. By reducing the inertia of the wing and tuning the rotational hinge stiffness, a redesigned device is simulated to produce lift to weight ratio of one.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7174, 7175, 7176, 7177, 7178, 7179, 7180, 7181, 7182], "author_name_tesi": "Mateti, Kiron ", "last_name_ssi": "Mateti", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kiron", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Christopher Rahn", "Zhiwen Liu", "Qiming Zhang", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Rahn, Dissertation Advisor", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MEMS", "compliant mechanisms", "piezoelectric actuators", "flapping wing air vehicles", "biologically inspired robotics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Aging in Place: Racial, Ethnic, and Nativity Variations in The Residential Attainment of America's Elderly ", "id": "16079", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8098", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "By 2020, over 55 million people living in the U.S. will be over the age of 65, and many of these people will be racial and ethnic minorities and immigrants. This rapid aging of the U.S. population poses a unique public policy challenge for the nation as a whole and for individual communities. Despite media and academic attention directed at nursing homes, privately funded residential care facilities, and Sunbelt retirement migration, the overwhelming majority of elderly prefer to age in place. The extent to which their homes and neighborhoods can compensate for the declines that inevitably come with age will go a long way toward determining just how much stress population aging will put on the infrastructure of communities in the U.S. Sociologists and demographers have long seen residential location as an indicator of a group\u2019s relative standing in society. Where someone lives can determine health, job opportunities, quality of schools, exposure to pollution, and encounters with crime and disorder. In the context of an aging society, the implications of race/nativity status for the successful housing of the elderly need to be considered. \n\tThis dissertation provides a comprehensive analysis of the residential circumstances of older adults in the U.S. by race, ethnicity, and nativity status. Specifically, I use household data from the 2005 American Housing Survey (AHS) to look at the importance of individual and contextual correlates of housing and neighborhood quality for the residential attainment of older native- and foreign-born whites, blacks, Asians, and Hispanics who are aging in place. I find that the elderly as a group live in favorable residential circumstances compared to younger age groups, but considerable variation is present. Race and nativity status exert direct effects on the residential circumstances of older adults, net of household demographics, socioeconomic status, tenure, intrametropolitan location, and metropolitan location. Foreign-born groups often live in worst residential circumstances than do their native-born counterparts. Regardless of nativity status, blacks live in the worse residential circumstances, followed by Hispanics, Asians, and then whites. My results further indicate that homeownership and suburban residence are not always adequate proxies for detailed measures of housing and neighborhood quality. Instead, I show that a more comprehensive view of housing the elderly is appropriate, one that considers the nested character of places. In sum, this research identifies the characteristics of some elderly who occupy substandard housing and neighborhoods but also suggests many more are living in high quality residential environments. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8040], "author_name_tesi": "Mateyka, Peter James", "last_name_ssi": "Mateyka", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barrett Alan Lee", "Melissa Hardy", "Stephen Matthews", "D Wayne Osgood"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barrett Alan Lee, Dissertation Advisor", "Melissa Hardy, Committee Chair", "Stephen Matthews, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aging in Place", "Race and Ethnicity", "Residential Attainment"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "TRACKING MAMMARY EPITHELIAL CELL LINEAGE AND CELL DIVISIONS IN THE NORMAL MAMMARY GLAND AND MAMMARY NEOPLASIA USING TRANSGENIC MICE\n", "id": "12179", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2765", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With as many as 1 in 8 women diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in the Western Hemisphere and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in females. Decades of study have uncovered causative exposures and mutations that transform normal mammary epithelial cells (MECs) into breast cancer cells. Nonetheless, the cellular mechanisms that define the clinical behavior of breast cancers remain incompletely defined. Lineage commitment pathways yield diverse MEC cell types within the breast, and recent findings suggest these MEC lineage hierarchies may persist within breast cancers, perhaps helping to explain the cellular heterogeneity seen in tumors. To extend these studies, models are needed that permit cell fate tracking in the discrete MEC compartments of both normal and malignant mammary tissue.\nIn this work, we describe novel transgenic mouse models that permit temporally-regulated, MEC compartment-restricted expression of a histone-fused eGFP (H2B-eGFP) reporter in both normal and malignant mammary epithelium. Transactivator transgenes expressed in either the luminal or basal layer of mammary ducts drove widespread H2B-eGFP labeling of luminal or basal MECs, respectively. We tested whether the H2B-eGFP reporter could be used to track cell divisions within labeled MEC compartments. Indeed, when H2B-eGFP transgene expression was switched off in pulse-chase experiments, washout of label depended on partitioning of labeled histones between daughter cells during MEC proliferation. Moreover, the H2B-eGFP nuclear label was readily detectable in live MECs, enabling live cell imaging of MECs propagated in culture.\nH2B-eGFP labeling was used for short-term lineage tracing of MECs during lobuloalveolar development. Hormones of pregnancy trigger the development of bi-layered\nalveolar outgrowths that are believed to arise from luminal progenitor cells. Contrasting with this model, we found that labeled cells from both the luminal and basal MEC compartments contribute to alveolar outgrowths. Furthermore, both luminal and basal MECs proliferated while contributing to alveologenesis, and did not merely migrate into alveoli or become incorporated as \u201cbystanders\u201d. These findings clarify a lineage commitment pathway operative during a key, hormonally-driven stage of mammary gland development. In separate studies, we labeled either basal or luminal MECs residing in the secretory epithelium of lactating mice to examine whether a subset of these MECs persist throughout the mammary gland remodeling program triggered by weaning. Remarkably, substantial numbers of both luminal and basal MECs survived mammary gland involution and contributed to remodeled ducts. These findings have implications for understanding how a lactation-involution cycle protects against breast cancer in rodents and humans.\nIn other studies, the H2B-eGFP labeling strategy was applied in the context of Wnt1-driven transgenic mouse models of breast cancer. Here, we sought to use pulse-chase H2B-eGFP labeling of tumor cells to identify a relatively slow-cycling sub-population of tumor cells, as relatively quiescent tumor cells have been proposed to be treatment-refractory and enriched in tumor-propagating potential. Each transactivator drove reproducible, compartment-restricted H2B-eGFP labeling of a large fraction of MECs within Wnt1-initiated mammary hyperplasia, as expected. In contrast, the fraction of tumor cells labeled in Wnt1-initiated mammary cancers showed marked tumor-to-tumor variability, suggesting that the genetic and epigenetic events that cooperate in tumorigenesis sometimes interfere with transgene-mediated labeling. Notably, both the luminal- and basal-MEC-directed transactivators were capable of driving H2B-eGFP labeling of a subset of tumor cells from\nMMTV-Wnt1 transgenic mice. This finding supports the contention that Wnt1 initiates \u201cmixed-lineage\u201d mammary tumors comprised of both luminal and basal tumor cells, suggesting that Wnt1 transforms a bi-potent MEC progenitor. Tumors that labeled efficiently were studied further by quantifying H2B-eGFP washout on a per-cell basis in pulse-chase experiments. Mammary cancers typically were comprised of tumor cell populations that were heterogeneous with respect to rates of proliferation. Together, this work sets the stage for prospective studies that will compare the biological potential of luminal- versus basal-type tumor cells (i.e., those labeled using the contrasting compartment-restricted transactivators) and rapid- versus slow-cycling tumor cells (i.e., those that have depleted versus retained H2B-eGFP label).\nBreast cancers can recur many years after eradication of all clinically-detectable disease, but the cellular mechanisms that maintain disease dormancy remain undefined. H2B-eGFP labeling was applied in the context of reversible Wnt1-driven mammary tumors to investigate the cellular mechanisms that maintain tumor dormancy in a mouse breast cancer model. Here, H2B-eGFP and Wnt1 were co-expressed such that switching off both transgenes simultaneously initiated washout of incorporated H2B-eGFP label and regression of Wnt1-dependent mammary cancers. Subclinical lesions comprised of dormant mammary cancer persisted long after tumor regression, and these lesions frequently harbored tumor cells that retained bright H2B-eGFP label, indicating they had ceased proliferating. These label-retaining cells represent a candidate quiescent tumor cell population that may serve as a critical link between primary mammary cancer and subsequent disease relapse.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2760, 2761, 2762], "author_name_tesi": "Mathers, Jessica ", "last_name_ssi": "Mathers", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Joseph Gunther", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "Sarah Bronson", "Gary Alan Clawson", "Jiyue Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Joseph Gunther, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Chair", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Gary Alan Clawson, Committee Member", "Jiyue Zhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mammary stem cell", "breast cancer", "mammary gland"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Student Perceptions of Real World Applications Incorporated into Horticulture Curricula\n", "id": "8662", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "724", "abstract_tesi": "Horticulture students are better able to demonstrate their abilities later in their employment if they are provided with the opportunity to develop real world skills and apply their knowledge during the learning process.  The best way of making a connection between the real world and education is through the appropriate use of practical experiences as part of the curriculum.  These experiences have been termed \u201cReal World\u201d applications or activities.  \u201cReal World\u201d activities are a form of experiential learning in which the student is actively engaged in the learning process by performing exercises they may encounter in their future workplace.  \nActivities have been incorporated into horticulture courses at the Pennsylvania State University, which provide students with theses opportunities.  The assignments require students to interact with actual clients and/or horticulture professionals to apply the knowledge obtained in the classroom to real problems or situations that occur in the horticulture industry every day.  This includes traveling to a job site, evaluating the situation, and designing and implementing a program of work over a designated period of time.  In today\u2019s world with ever decreasing budgets and increasing professor responsibilities, one would question, \u201cIs going beyond lectures and laboratory activities worth the extra effort?\u201d  \nThe objectives of this study were to 1) describe student perceptions toward \u201cReal World Applications\u201d in horticulture curricula, 2) determine the need based on student perception for \u201cReal World Applications\u201d in horticulture curricula, and 3) assess perception differences among horticulture students.\nOne hundred and six students from six horticulture classes at the Pennsylvania State University were surveyed to acquire their opinions toward the \u201cReal World\u201d activity incorporated into their respective course.  The survey instrument contained twelve questions that utilized a Likert scale for the participants to rate their opinions.  There were five questions to determine the demographics of the participants, and an additional question asking students to select which types of experiential learning techniques they would like to see in their horticulture classes.  \nResults indicated that 82% of students felt the activities enhanced their understanding of course information, and 90% felt the activities required them to apply their knowledge more than then they would have in a laboratory setting.  Overall, 90% of participants would like to see more \u201cReal World Applications\u201d incorporated into their horticulture courses.  There were no significant differences among gender. However, there were unexpected differences among students who had completed an internship versus those who had yet to do so.  Participants who had completed an internship rated their \u201cReal World\u201d activity experiences lower then those who had not completed an internship.  \nIt can be inferred that more inexperienced students appreciate the activities as it may be one of the first opportunities for them to draw connections to their future careers.

Data was collected annually over three years when children were in kindergarten, first grade, and second grade, providing three time-points used for this study. The bidirectional influences between the three constructs (maternal depression, negative parenting practices, and child oppositional-aggression) were tested with a three-level cross-lagged path model exploring bi-directional influences among the constructs over three time points. A cross-lagged path model and bootstrapping procedure was used, to determine whether parenting practices mediated the association between maternal depression (in kindergarten and first grade) and subsequent child oppositional-aggression (in first grade and second grade). Analyses were also conducted to test for invariance across gender. \nConsistent with prior research, maternal depression led to increases over time in negative parenting practices and child oppositional-aggression. Importantly, bidirectional effects also emerged, as negative parenting practices and child oppositional-aggression both exacerbated maternal depression over time. In addition, although some of the impact of maternal depression on child oppositional-aggression was mediated through negative parenting, maternal depression also retained a direct influence on child behavior. These findings add to the existing literature by demonstrating the complex transactions that occur in high-risk families, with child behavior and parenting experiences affecting maternal depression, as well as the reverse.

Many factors involved in tissue homeostasis have been identified and yet, their comprehensive regulatory network remains to be explored. One of such genes is Yes-associated protein (human YAP or murine Yap1), a transcriptional co-activator regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. YAP functions as an effector of a signaling pathway called the Hippo pathway, and its phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion by the components in the Hippo pathway suppress the activity of YAP. \t\nInitially found as an oncogene, activation of YAP has been reported in various types of cancer. Intriguingly, however, cancer genetics has failed to attribute mutations in the Hippo pathway genes for the frequent YAP activation in cancer, calling for its alternative explanations. In my dissertation, I demonstrate that expression of a short isoform of LATS1, an immediate upstream kinase of YAP, provides a mechanism of modulating YAP activity. This short isoform named short LATS1 (sLATS1) lacks the C-terminal kinase domain of LATS1, while retaining the protein-protein interaction domains in the N-terminus. Unlike ubiquitously expressed LATS1, the expression of sLATS1 is limited to certain tissue types including skin fibroblasts, testis and uterus. In addition, clinical data show that the expression of sLATS1 relative to full-length LATS1 slightly increases in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA). Looking into the molecular role of sLATS1, I reveal that in Human Embryonic Kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells, sLATS1 promotes YAP activity through inhibition of LATS1 activity. Interestingly, sLATS1 also plays a minor role in inhibiting YAP activity through their direct interaction.\nThe oncogenic property of YAP in cell types such as proliferative epithelial cells has been studied in depth. However, its role in slowly dividing cells is yet to be fully investigated. In the second part of my dissertation, my collaborator and I use murine pancreatic \u03b2-cell lines, an endocrine cell type which produces and secretes insulin, and address the role and regulation of Yap1 activity in this highly specialized cell type. Through a loss-of-function approach, we show Yap1 is required for maintaining the viability of \u03b2-cells. Additionally, under cytotoxic conditions, such as exposure to high free fatty acids (FFAs) or hydrogen peroxide, Yap1 is activated via actin remodeling. Activated Yap1 subsequently up-regulates the expression of connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf), leading to better survival from apoptosis. Unlike in epithelial cells, activation of Yap1 did not affect cell proliferation in \u03b2-cells, suggesting its involvement is restricted to inhibition of apoptosis in \u03b2-cells. Taken together, my dissertation inquires into the differential roles and regulations of YAP/Yap1 depending on the cell type, which exemplifies the intra- or inter-cellular microenvironment determines the function of a gene. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15868], "author_name_tesi": "Matsui, Yurika ", "last_name_ssi": "Matsui", "first_name_ssi": "Yurika", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhi-Chun Lai", "Douglas Cavener", "Melissa Rolls", "Michael Axtell", "Lorraine C Santy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhi-Chun Lai, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Chair", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member", "Michael Axtell, Committee Member", "Lorraine C Santy, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hippo pathway", "Yes-associated protein (YAP)", "cell proliferation", "apoptosis", "isoform", "pancreatic beta-cell", "large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1)"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Multimodal communicative strategies for resolving miscommunication in multilingual writing classrooms\n", "id": "26487", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11821", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigates the communicative strategies of so-called non-native speakers or English as a lingua franca (ELF) speakers in the context of ESL writing classrooms at an U.S. university by employing a sequential analysis combined with ethnographic information. Following the latest work on ELF academic discourse (e.g. Bj\u00f6rkman, 2013; Kaur, 2011b, 2011c; Mauranen, 2012; Smit, 2010), it closely examines how ELF speakers resolve or prevent miscommunication through repair conducted by using various multimodal interactional resources available in the classroom ecology (van Lier, 2000, 2004). Such ecological resources include gesture, embodied action, non-verbal vocalization (e.g., laughter and silence), classroom artifacts, and people in the classroom besides verbal speech. This study is one of the first attempts to illuminate the complex process of resolving or preventing miscommunication among ELF speakers by adopting a multimodal orientation to ELF interactional analysis and to expand the notion of ELF speakers\u2019 communicative competence.\n\nThrough a sequential analysis with ethnographic information gained from regular classroom observations and stimulated recall interviews, the following patterns of resolving or preventing miscommunication among ELF speakers in the writing classroom have emerged. The first pattern is enhanced explicitness (e.g., Mauranen, 2007). Namely, in order to create extra explicit meaning, multilingual instructors and students employ various communicative strategies, including repeating key words/phrases, explicating with examples, using discourse markers, employing gesture that visualizes and concretizes abstract components, and combining information on PowerPoint slides and worksheets with verbal speech. The second pattern is the use of laughter and humor to mitigate face-threats related to overt repairs and to engage in relational work through laughing together. Another pattern is voluntary help by those who are the third-party participants in miscommunication phenomena, especially by representing their peer\u2019s point of view. As many studies (e.g., H\u00fclmbauer, 2009; Kaur, 2011c; Meierkord, 1998) have demonstrated, ELF speakers in these academic writing classrooms generally display a tolerant attitude toward language variation and interactive cooperativeness. Nevertheless, the data demonstrates that multilingual students sometimes highlight problems through laughter and ridicule, supporting the claim that ELF speakers are not always collaborative and tolerant of perceived communicative problems (Jenks, 2012; Knapp, 2002; Seldlhofer, 2004). In other words, it became clear that the nature of ELF interactions is indeed context-dependent and cannot be characterized in definite manners (Mortensen , 2013). Lastly, the data analysis clearly reveals that these ELF speakers in the academic writing classrooms effectively coordinate multiple semiotic resources along with speech by an \u201censemble\u201d of the semiotic modes in order to achieve mutual attention to critical information and make their meaning transparent for their interlocutors, which contributes to their communicative success.  \n\nTo conclude, I argue that miscommunication can be beneficial in ELF speakers\u2019 achieving mutual understanding because it creates an interactional space wherein they can explicitly negotiate various layers of differences and collaboratively construct situated understanding. Furthermore, miscommunication can lead to building solidarity and relationships among classroom members.

Specifically, how such bullied individuals share the information about their victimized status with others and the effectiveness of this disclosure as a coping strategy were investigated through three studies.\n\nStudy 1 explored the assumption that parental misunderstanding of their children's experience of bullying marks a risk factor. The results showed that certain families are characterized by a larger child-parent discrepancy (i.e., children had experienced more bullying that their parents suspected) than others; moreover, such discrepancies were negatively associated with the children's post-bullying adjustment, providing evidence for the importance of disclosure to facilitate parental awareness of bullying. \n\nStudy 2 more directly examined the underlying dynamics related to victims' disclosure decision-making. The analysis revealed that families' communicative orientation was related to victims' efficacy for disclosure and those efficacy perceptions are, in turn, associated with the likelihood for victims to disclose. This study also replicated past findings on the effectiveness of disclosure as a coping strategy such that those who had disclosed about bullying crisis had better subjective well-being than those who remained undisclosed. \n\nFinally, Study 3 compared the data collected from Japan and the U.S., and focused on how victims evaluate various types of support strategies elicited by their disclosure and also how this appraisal of received support lead to their subsequent motivation for further disclosure as well as post-bullying adjustment. The results suggest that emotional support is appreciated highly by both Japanese and U.S. Americans, whereas other strategies are less effective or even deteriorative. Notably, Japanese victims evaluated network support particularly negatively. \n\nThese findings are discussed in the last chapter with regard to the potential contribution of the communication- and relationship-centered perceptive taken by the current research to the literature of bullying and the communication of information management.

In this area of research, threat is typically defined in terms of physical danger or harm. To date, it is not well known if threat functionally motivates initiation of aggression or if the nature of threat extends beyond stimuli signaling physical danger/harm. However, theory and limited research suggest that threats of rejection/abandonment and threats of social dominance may reflect distinct functional precipitants of aggression perpetration among trauma-exposed men. This study was designed to assess men\u2019s aggressive responses in the context of their wives\u2019 rejection/abandonment and social dominance threats in order to better understand the circumstances in which aggression is used among men varying in degree of trauma exposure. Among 64 community couples selected for elevated symptoms of PTSD in either partner, husbands\u2019 aggressive behaviors and their wives\u2019 threats of rejection/abandonment and social dominance were objectively observed during couple conflict interactions. The severity of wives\u2019 rejection/abandonment threats predicted the severity of husbands\u2019 aggression perpetration among husbands with high (\uf062 = .71, t = 3.68, p < .001), but not low (\uf062 = .03, t = .18, p = .854), levels of trauma exposure.

Thus, men with relatively high trauma exposure may respond aggressively to women\u2019s threats of rejection/abandonment and social dominance. These findings are consistent with research suggesting that traumatized men\u2019s misperceptions of threat may motivate their aggression, and indicate that aggression may also be used in the context of accurately detected threat.

Investigating variation in facial morphology can provide a more thorough understanding of these evolutionary forces and can also be used to identify genes involved in normal facial feature variation.  This study aims to elucidate preliminary genetic relationships between ancestry, facial morphology and candidate genes that may play a role in morphological variation.   Because admixed populations are well suited for studying traits that differ between two parental populations, a sample of African Americans were chosen for investigation in this study. The maximum likelihood genetic ancestry for 131 participants, ages 18-37, was obtained using 176 ancestry informative markers to determine their proportions of European and West African ancestry.  Using 3dMDface (Atlanta, GA) imaging and analysis software, 3-dimensional images of each participant were captured and landmarked at 22 standard anthropometric locations.  These coordinates were compared using a Euclidean Distance Matrix Analysis to identify morphological trait variations within the sample.  DNA from each participant was genotyped at a polymorphic site in seven different selection-nominated candidate genes known to be involved in genetic disorders with craniofacial phenotypes.  WinEDMA Form comparison between West African and European pseudo-parental groups of the same sex revealed interlandmark distances that vary significantly between the parental populations.  Similar results were obtained using an ANOVA on linear distances calculated from the landmark coordinates in the entire study sample of 131 individuals of varying admixture proportion. Regression analyses identified correlations between the absolute distance (in mm) between the landmarks and proportion of West African ancestry after adjustment for variation due to sex and height.  Many interlandmark distances showed highly significant relationships with genetic ancestry which were in some cases stronger (R2 = 0.337) than those previously identified between skin color and West African ancestry proportion (R2 = 0.211).  ANOVAs were conducted using each candidate gene in combination with each interlandmark distance using sex, height and ancestry as covariates.  Five out of seven candidate genes returned significant results, identifying trends of significance across regions of the face.  COL11A1 shows association with normal variation around the mouth.  FGFR2 appears to be associated with face length.  TRPS1 displays a slight association with variation around the eyes and brow ridge.  LMNA has a striking association with projection of the face.  BRAF shows association with variation regarding the nose, notably with nose width.  Landmarking trials conducted by independent observers returned similar results, with comparable trends.  The directionality of morphological change was investigated using \u0192\u00d2\u0192z the regression coefficient, to characterize change in interlandmark distance corresponding with change in allelic composition. Much of these results were in concordance with data presented in previous studies that described the size ratio of traits between West African and European individuals. The results of this study show there is great potential for elucidation of the genetic basis of normal facial feature variation.  The associations shown with specific facial traits and patterns of variation suggest there is strong reason to further investigate these candidate genes and other genes of interest. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3318], "author_name_tesi": "Matthes, Kerri Allison", "last_name_ssi": "Matthes", "middle_name_ssi": "Allison", "first_name_ssi": "Kerri", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Shriver"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Shriver, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["admixture mapping", "craniofacial morphology", "candidate genes"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Field Dependent Spin Dynamics in Dy2ti2o7", "id": "16096", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8091", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We have studied the field dependent magnetic properties of three crystalline directions of the spin ice material Dy2Ti2O7\u2014the [100], [110], and [111] directions.

In the well-established mechanistic paradigm for functionalization of unactivated alkyl groups first set forth for the heme-dependent oxygenases and later extended to non-heme-iron oxygenases such as prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4H) and taurine:&#945;-ketoglutarate dioxygenase (TauD), the radicaloid oxo ligand of an Fe(IV)-oxo (ferryl) complex abstracts hydrogen (H\u2022) from the aliphatic substrate (R\u2013H), and the resulting hydroxo ligand then \"rebounds\" to the substrate radical (R\u2022) as HO\u2022. In no case has the Fe\u2013OH/R\u2022 state in this two-step process ever been directly detected, leading to the presumption that the rebound step is uniformly faster than H\u2022 abstraction. A small but growing number of O2-activating non-heme-iron enzymes have been found to or proposed to employ a derivative mechanistic strategy, in which a ligand coordinated cis to the hydroxo ligand, rather than the hydroxo ligand itself, is transferred as a radical to the R\u2022 formed upon H\u2022 abstraction by the ferryl complex. The central question regarding this strategy is how the enzymes that employ it promote selective transfer of this ligand radical to the exclusion of the HO\u2022 rebound that is so facile in the hydroxylating enzymes.  \nIn this work, we addressed this question for the aliphatic halogenase SyrB2, a tailoring enzyme of nonribosomal peptide synthetase machinery discovered by the Walsh group in 2005.  Aliphatic halogenation of a protein-tethered amino acid side chain was proposed to occur via transfer of an equatorial-coordinated halogen atom (Cl\u2022) from the Cl\u2013Fe(III)\u2013OH/R\u2022 intermediate that resulted from H\u2022 abstraction by the preceding chloroferryl [Cl\u2013Fe(IV)=O/R\u2013H] intermediate. This proposal was based on the observations that i) SyrB2 and several other halogenases of this type employ the same cofactor (ferrous iron) and two of the same co-substrates [&#945;-ketoglutarate (&#945;KG) and O2] as the iron- and &#945;KG-dependent hydroxylases (TauD and P4H), and ii) the carboxylate residue that normally serves as a ligand to the iron cofactor in the hydroxylases is replaced in the sequence of SyrB2 by a non-coordinating residue, alanine, and in the coordination sphere by a chloride ion (Cl\u2013), as revealed by the X-ray crystal structure of SyrB2 solved by the Drennan group.  Confirmation of the presence of a H\u2022-abstracting haloferryl intermediate in the related halogenase, CytC3, along with previous reports that the enzymes do not also mediate hydroxylation of their substrate in competition with halogenation, raised the intriguing question of how transfer of Cl\u2022 to the exclusion of the HO\u2022 equivalent was ensured. Using SyrB2 as an ideal model system in which L-threonine appended to the phosphopantetheine cofactor of the carrier protein SyrB1 (Thr) is chlorinated natively during the biosynthesis of syringomycin E, we sought to elucidate the functional principles underlying the design of enzyme active sites that mediate such radical-group-transfer reactions and to explore their versatility for new reactions.\nSite-directed mutagenesis of the enzyme, chemical alteration and isotopic labeling of the substrate, kinetic characterization of their reactions in a single turnover, spectroscopic characterization of intermediates that accumulate, and analytical characterization of resultant products provided the tools necessary to achieve this understanding.  We showed that, as described in Appendix A, binding of the trimodular substrate  \u201ctriggers\u201d formation of a H\u2022-abstracting chloroferryl intermediate.  In addition, the efficacy of triggering, the distribution of the two chloroferryl complexes observed by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, and the observed decay rate of the intermediate (presumed to be related to the C\u2013H cleavage efficiency) are all sensitive to the identity of the amino acid side chain.  By sidechain modifications that either remove or strengthen the targeted C\u2013H bond, the intermediate is stabilized to an unprecedented extent, thereby allowing facile structural characterization by EXAFS spectroscopy. The most important observation, which initiated the study described in Appendix B, was the 10-fold enhancement in H\u2022 abstraction efficiency that resulted from replacement of the &#946;-hydroxyl group of Thr by hydrogen.  This modification yields a substrate defined as L-2-aminobutyrate appended to SyrB1 (abbreviated Aba). We proposed that removal of this functional group, which might otherwise provide an active-site anchor to position the target carbon atom to favor Cl\u2022 capture, could increase the flexibility of the side chain within the substrate-binding pocket.  Consequently, this modification increases the proximity of the H\u2022-donating methyl group to the oxo ligand. A closer approach accelerates both H\u2022 abstraction by the Cl\u2013Fe(IV)=O intermediate and HO\u2022 rebound from the resultant Cl\u2013Fe(III)\u2013OH complex to the R\u2022 in the ensuing step, as hydroxylation was shown to be competitive in this case. This interpretation, which supports the hydroxylase activity of SyrB2, was confirmed by the observations of further enhanced H\u2022 abstraction and predominant hydroxylation at the C5 position (rather than C4) of L-norvaline (Nva), which has an additional methylene unit that projects the C5\u2013H bonds into even closer proximity to the oxo ligand.  The conclusion of this study was that by proper positioning of its substrate, SyrB2 effectively trades proficiency in H\u2022 abstraction for selectivity in the radical-transfer step.  \nIn Appendix C we explored the versatility of SyrB2 for other radical-group-transfers by demonstrating that alternative non-halogen anions (Y\u2013) i) bind in the halide site of SyrB2 and ii) support O2 activation and Y\u2013Fe(IV)=O accumulation in the presence of Thr, Aba and Nva substrates (in most cases), iii) permit H\u2022 abstraction but also introduce new unproductive decay pathways that compete with this step (in all cases in which i and ii are satisfied), and iv) undergo transfer to the resultant R\u2022 (for the ligands N3\u2013 and NO2\u2013).  \nFinally in our last study, described in Chapter 2, we explained the basis for the observation by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy of two rapidly interconverting chloroferryl complexes and the smaller deuterium kinetic isotope effects in the halogenases versus the hydroxylases, of which neither was accommodated by the static substrate-positioning model proposed in Appendix B. With the non-native substrate, Nva, and either 16O2 or 18O2, product profiling provides evidence for both oxo/chloro positional-ligand-interchange in the Cl\u2013Fe(IV)=O state and slow ligand-radical transfer in the ensuing Cl\u2013Fe(III)\u2013OH/R\u2022 state in the reactions of wild-type SyrB2 and its A118E variant, in which the introduced carboxylate residue occupies the chloride coordination site and abolishes chlorination. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4220], "author_name_tesi": "Matthews, Megan Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Matthews", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["J Martin Bollinger Jr And Carsten Krebs", "Carsten Krebs", "J Martin Bollinger Jr", "Squire J Booker", "Philip C.

These generated material values served as input to intralaminar and interlaminar damage models. A three-dimensional in-plane damage material model was implemented and behavior verified. Deficiencies in current state-of-the-art interlaminar capabilities were explored using the virtual crack closure technique and the cohesive zone model. A user-defined cohesive element was implemented to discover the importance of traction-separation material constitutive behavior. A novel method for correlation of traction-separation parameters was created. This new damage modeling tool was used for evaluation of novel material systems to improve damage tolerance. Classical laminate plate theory was used in a full-factorial study of layerwise-hybrid laminates. Filament-wound laminated composite cylindrical shells were subjected to quasi-static loading to validate the finite element computational composite damage model. The new tool for modeling provides sufficient accuracy and generality for use on a wide-range of problems.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4875], "author_name_tesi": "Matthews, Peter Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Matthews", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin L Koudela", "Charles E Bakis", "Sulin Zhang", "Panagiotis Michaleris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin L Koudela, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Chair", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Member", "Panagiotis Michaleris, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["composites", "delamination", "damage"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Kinesin-2 and +TIP dependent directed growth maintains the uniformly polarized microtubule array in Drosophila dendrites", "id": "12542", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1961", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In many differentiated cells microtubules are organized into polarized noncentrosomal arrays, yet few mechanisms that control the formation or maintenance of these arrays have been identified. To study such arrays, I have utilized Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) neurons. These neurons have a polarized cytoskeleton that consists of two types of noncentrosomal arrays. Both the axonal and dendritic microtubule arrays consist of uniformly oriented microtubules, but the microtubules of the axon are oriented with plus-ends outward, while the microtubules of the dendrite are oriented with plus-ends inward. We have identified a novel mechanism that allows for the maintenance of uniform microtubule polarity in the branched dendrites of these highly polarized cells. All plus-ends in these dendrites grow towards the cell body. Thus, to maintain uniform microtubule polarity in dendrites, I hypothesized that the direction of microtubule growth must be controlled at branch points. Undirected growth through branch points would disrupt the uniform polarity, as growing microtubules could turn either towards or away from the cell body at each branch. To test this hypothesis, I have used whole, live Drosophila larvae for imaging growing microtubule plus-ends tagged with EB1-GFP in dendritic arborization (da) neurons. I have found that growing microtubules navigate dendrite branch points by turning the same direction 98% of the time. Observation of the plus-end behavior led to the hypothesis that growing plus-ends may be guided along pre-existing tracks of some sort. A UAS-EB1-RFP fly line was generated to test this hypothesis, and I found that the paths of growing plus-ends aligned with stable microtubule tracks. We named this phenomenon directed microtubule growth. \nNext, candidate proteins that may be involved in directed microtubule growth were targeted. A combination of RNAi, mutant, and dominant negative phenotypic analyses indicated that Kinesin-2 (KIF3), and the +TIPS, EB1 and APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), are required for uniform microtubule polarity specifically in dendrites. Additionally, I have investigated the extent to which dendritic geometry can compensate for disrupted directed growth. I found that in the comb dendrite of the ddaE class I da neuron uniform polarity can be more severely disrupted than in other da neurons. An analysis of the dendritic branching patterns revealed that the comb dendrite\u2019s geometry created less of an inward bias, and thus microtubule growth was more easily randomized by disrupting the directed growth machinery.\nI also have shown that the Kinesin-2 subunit Kap3 can physically interact with Apc, Apc with Apc2, and Apc with EB1. Furthermore, I have found that GFP-Apc2 is highly enriched at dendritic branch points. I hypothesized that Apc would behave in the same manner, and so created UAS-GFP-Apc and UAS-RFP-Apc transgenic fly lines to test this hypothesis. Only when co-expressed with GFP-Apc2 was RFP-Apc localized to the branch points. Thus the over-expression of GFP-Apc2 can recruit RFP-Apc to branch points. We propose that Apc2 is necessary for the recruitment of Apc to dendritic branch points. At branch points, Apc is responsible for the capture of EB1 coated microtubule plus-ends, and the linkage of Kinesin-2 to the tips of growing microtubules. Kinesin-2 then steers microtubule growth along existing microtubules at branch points. This represents new functions of Kinesin-2 and +TIPs, and it is the first time the mechanism of directed microtubule growth has been observed.\nCurrently, the Drosophila model of uniform plus-end-in microtubule polarity in dendrites conflicts with the vertebrate model of mixed (plus-end-out and plus-end-in) microtubule polarity in dendrites. It is unclear which model more accurately reflects the in vivo microtubule organization of vertebrate neurons. I have developed an experimental design that our lab will soon use to elucidate the in vivo microtubule polarity in a vertebrate. Briefly, we will use Zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae for this investigation as they are one of the few vertebrates with neurons amenable to examination by light microscopy in whole live animals. I have described the strategy we will need to employ to successfully map the neuronal microtubule polarities of these in vivo vertebrate neurons.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1944], "author_name_tesi": "Mattie, Floyd J", "last_name_ssi": "Mattie", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Floyd", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Rolls", "Melissa Rolls", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Graham Hugh Thomas", "Lorraine C Santy", "Richard W Ordway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Rolls, Dissertation Advisor", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Chair", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Member", "Lorraine C Santy, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dendrite", "polarity", "microtubule", "Kinesin-2", "+TIP", "neuron", "APC", "adenomatous polyposis coli", "EB1", "noncentrosomal"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Exploring Linkages Among Preservice Teachers' Attachment Styles and Professional Dispositions Held by Effective Educators ", "id": "21523", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9828", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\nThe purpose of this study was to explore explanatory values provided by tenets of attachment theory for understanding roles that intra-and interpersonal dimensions of preservice teachers\u2019 professional dispositions play in shaping conflict styles employed by individuals in managing student behaviors in socioculturally-diverse classrooms.

(2) How are the role requirements and responsibilities determined and what is the intent? (3) In what ways, or to what extent, can these assigned tasks and responsibilities be seen as preparation for the principalship?

The processing of milk for cheesemaking was a critical development in early agriculture. Cheesemaking allows for the preservation of milk into a non-perishable and transportable form, and makes it more digestible. After the first cattle were introduced in the United States (U.S.) in the early 1600s, along with the first dairy breeds in the 1800s, mass production of dairy products began with the movement of people from the farms to the cities at the turn of the 20th century. Total milk production steadily increased after the mid-1970s in the U.S., with the parallel increase in milk production per cow. Meanwhile, average cow numbers per farm in the U.S. have decreased with many cows are now concentrated on larger farms.\nFollowing the increase in milk production, cheese production also has increased over the last several decades, with the U.S. becoming the top producer. In 2014, Pennsylvania was the sixth producer in the country, with 304 dairies holding Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) dairy permits, of which 133 are cheese manufacturing permits. Most of the state's dairy facilities are small-scale, family-oriented businesses with less than five employees. These farms, where the cheesemaker has numerous responsibilities, might find it difficult to have the cheesemaker and other food handlers leave the farm for extended periods of time for food safety training. Given that foodborne diseases are a major health problem in the U.S. and cheese has been involved in foodborne disease outbreaks, the lack of food safety and sanitation training for this audience may pose a risk to consumers. To date, no training program has been developed to address the specific and unique needs of Pennsylvanian cheesemakers. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to improve the safety of farmstead cheese produced in Pennsylvania through a comprehensive food safety needs assessment, and based on the results, develop, deliver, and evaluate a customized educational intervention for cheesemakers in Pennsylvania.\nThe comprehensive needs assessment was accomplished using 4 tools: 1) a survey for Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) dairy inspectors; 2) a survey for Pennsylvania farmstead cheesemakers; 3) observations during cheesemaking sessions; and 4) microbiological sampling and analysis of environmental samples from Pennsylvania dairy farm\u2019s cheesemaking rooms. An overall comparison and compilation of results from each aspect identified key risk factors and gaps in basic sanitation and food safety. Interestingly, dairy processors indicated that their self-assessed knowledge, attitude, and behavior were \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cvery good\u201d in the areas of sanitation and food safety. The observations indicated that these processors may lack basic food safety practices and demonstrated gaps in their food safety knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. As such, there appears to be a need for food safety training, with an emphasis on sanitation, for this underserved audience.   \nBased on those results, a customized, counter-top food safety and sanitation training program was developed, disseminated, and evaluated for farmstead cheesemakers. Using a pre- and post-test knowledge, attitude, behavior, and skill assessment, it was determined that the training program produced significant increases in knowledge and positive changes in the handwashing skill among participants, but no significant changes in attitude and behavior were observed. An environmental microbiological assessment of cheesemaking rooms, with samplings before and after the training, revealed few significant changes in the microbial load, but some overall improvements were observed. This study demonstrated that a comprehensive needs assessment identified gaps in food safety and sanitation, leading to the development of a customized face-to-face training program, which was proven to be effective for improving the food safety and sanitation knowledge and handwashing skills of cheesemakers in Pennsylvania. Future use of this training program in other states could serve to further support and sustain the current local food movement in the U.S., while ensuring public safety and the success of individual farmers.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11688], "author_name_tesi": "Mattos Machado, Robson A", "last_name_ssi": "Mattos Machado", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Robson", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Catherine Nettles Cutter", "Catherine Nettles Cutter", "Rama B Radhakrishna", "Kerry Elizabeth Kaylegian", "Robert F Roberts", "Ernest Peter Hovingh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Catherine Nettles Cutter, Dissertation Advisor", "Catherine Nettles Cutter, Committee Chair", "Rama B Radhakrishna, Committee Member", "Kerry Elizabeth Kaylegian, Committee Member", "Robert F Roberts, Committee Member", "Ernest Peter Hovingh, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cheese", "farmstead", "training", "Extension", "food safety", "sanitation"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Geographical Techniques to Quantify the Spatial Patterns of Precipitation in U.S. Landfalling Tropical Cyclones\n\n", "id": "6575", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1012", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-02-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tropical Cyclones (TCs) are dangerous storms whose rainfall can cause fresh water flooding. Rainfall models developed as recently as 2000 are based on a climatology that accounts only for storm intensity and distance from the coastline. This study utilizes ground-based radar data and the tools of shape analysis and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to quantify spatial patterns of TC precipitation. Base reflectivity radar data are analyzed within the GIS in hourly time-steps to produce polygon shapes for thirteen U.S. landfalling TCs from the period 1997-2003. Shape measures are calculated using two approaches. First, a 400 km annulus is placed atop the storm\u2019s center and is divided into quadrants to provide the approximate spatial distribution of rainfall. Then, eleven geographical measures of shape are calculated, including an area to perimeter index, minor to major axis ratio, orientation, and six measures developed specifically to quantify the degree to which precipitation encircles the storm\u2019s center and the symmetry of this precipitation. A sensitivity analyses is performed to determine the appropriate minimum threshold for the radar reflectivity values.\n\n\nSeveral statistical analyses are performed to identify relationships among the shape parameters for each storm and to determine which of eleven environmental forcing mechanisms influenced the spatial distribution of precipitation. These factors are intensity, size, forward velocity, wind shear, dry air entrainment, angle of coastal approach, distance from the coastline, sea surface temperatures, effects of topography, diurnal and semidiurnal oscillations in the areal coverage of precipitation, and interaction with middle latitude weather systems. Results of the discriminant analyses show that TCs should be stratified according to intensity prior to further analysis, and demonstrate that topography and the angle of coastal approach affect the spatial distribution of TC precipitation. The results of the principal components analyses suggest that three independent variables should be employed in the regression equations that predict TC precipitation patterns. Multiple linear regression analyses are performed to predict five variables that describe the location, shape, and areal extent of TC precipitation. At first, separate models are developed for each storm to predict the dependent variable values three hours into the future. These analyses, along with the results of the discriminant and principal components analyses, confirm that of the eleven environmental factors investigated by this study, intensity, forward velocity, directional wind shear, and distance to the coastline are the most important physical factors that influence the shape of precipitation produced by U.S. landfalling TCs. Second, a set of regression equations is then developed for each intensity level using all of the observations collected within the study to predict the location, shape, and areal extent of precipitation.\n\n\nSeveral important findings result from this study. Hurricanes are round, symmetrical, and their shape parameters are best predicted by the amount of precipitation present within their inner to middle annular rings. Tropical Storms are more linear, have less precipitation, and their shapes are predicted by the contrast between their inner and outer annular rings. Tropical depressions vary widely in shape and total precipitation area due to the influence of mountains, proximity to the coast, and interaction with middle latitude weather systems. TCs approaching the coastline at an angle less than 90\u00b0 or that are approaching a steep rise in elevation are oriented parallel to the coastline or mountain axis, and therefore, precipitation  becomes asymmetrically distributed about the circulation center. Drier and/or cooler air mixing into the storm\u2019s center causes the eyewall to open asymmetrically, and the storm\u2019s shape approximates that of a backwards \u201cC\u201d. Storms encountering strong vertical wind shear have a more linear shape with precipitation stretched out ahead of the storm and little precipitation behind the storm\u2019s center.  Future analyses will include observations from additional landfalling TCs to will improve the accuracy of the regression models developed within this study. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1002], "author_name_tesi": "Matyas, Corene J.", "last_name_ssi": "Matyas", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Corene", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Mark Carleton", "Brenton Yarnal", "Donna Jean Peuquet", "Jenni Evans"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Mark Carleton, Committee Chair", "Brenton Yarnal, Committee Member", "Donna Jean Peuquet, Committee Member", "Jenni Evans, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rainfall", "hurricane", "geographic information systems", "tropical cyclone", "precipitation", "shape analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Ghrelin as a Metabolic Regulator During Caloric Restriction\n\n", "id": "11474", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4095", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The actions of caloric restriction (CR) on lifespan are long-known and well-described.

Mouse models of varying severities of traditional CR, CR mimetics, or potential CR mechanisms provided systems for ghrelin-CR evaluation in the first two studies of this dissertation.  In the third study, polymorphic variation in the promoter region of the ghrelin receptor gene and protein levels of ghrelin and other metabolic peptides were evaluated in a human CR condition: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.  Ghrelin was demonstrated to have nuanced effects in models or mimetics of CR.  Ghrelin did not increase consistently with increasing levels of CR or generally in CR mimetics. Ghrelin did show differential effects between sexes in mice and secondly, polymorphisms in the promoter region of its receptor gene were associated with different weight loss trajectories one year post-surgery in gastric bypass patients.  Therefore, there may be some role for ghrelin or the ghrelin signaling pathway during CR models, and particularly describing how genetic changes affect clinical outcomes in the obese surgical population warrants further attention.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4073], "author_name_tesi": "Matzko, Michelle Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Matzko", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Michelle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger J Mc Carter, Ph D", "Roger John Mccarter", "Gerald Eugene Mc Clearn", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli", "Nancy M Ostiguy", "Glenn Franklin Gerhard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger J Mc Carter, Ph D, Dissertation Advisor", "Roger John Mccarter, Committee Chair", "Gerald Eugene Mc Clearn, Committee Member", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli, Committee Member", "Nancy M Ostiguy, Committee Member", "Glenn Franklin Gerhard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ghrelin", "single nucleotide polymorphism", "gastric bypass surgery", "caloric restriction"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Creating the Silent Majority: State Censorship and the Radio Right in the 1960s", "id": "13469pem5087", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13469", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores the central role that radio broadcasting played in the rise of modern American conservatism. While it is a commonplace today to think of talk radio as a conservative medium, it was not always so. The rise of conservative radio broadcasting in the 1960s was an unintended consequence of the advent of network television in the 1950s. Radio increasingly became the preserve of independent station owners, who were desperate for cash and willing to air previously marginalized political dissidents including conservatives. For the first time in radio history, a dozen Right-wing broadcasters aired on a hundred or more stations nationwide. Their listeners formed the backbone of the New Right as conservative radio acted as a megaphone, amplifying local activism and creating a truly national grassroots movement. Indeed, conservative broadcasters were so successful in stimulating activism that the John F. Kennedy Administration, worried about its upcoming 1964 re-election campaign, targeted the offending broadcasters with selective enforcement of Internal Revenue Service and Federal Communications Commission regulations. The Kennedy Administration\u2019s muting of the radio Right remains the most successful episode of government censorship in America since the Second Red Scare, albeit one that scholars have almost entirely overlooked. This story is thus an essential prehistory of the much better known emergence of the New Christian Right in the 1970s and the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13130], "author_name_tesi": "Matzko, Paul Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Matzko", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip Jenkins", "Amy S Greenberg", "Gary Scott Cross", "Philip Jenkins", "Roger Kent Finke", "Amy S Greenberg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Philip Jenkins, Dissertation Advisor", "Amy S Greenberg, Committee Chair", "Gary Scott Cross, Committee Member", "Philip Jenkins, Committee Member", "Roger Kent Finke, Outside Member", "Amy S Greenberg, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["conservatism", "New Right", "New Christian Right", "radio", "broadcasting", "Walter Reuther", "National Council of Churches", "United Church of Christ", "John F.

As a result, virus infection may indirectly modify interactions between plants and the broader insect community through effects on host phenotype, with significant implications for the fitness of the pathogen, the host, and vector and non-vector insects. Here we use chemical analytical techniques, insect growth assays, behavioral experiments, and field observations to explore the influence of infection by a non-persistently transmitted virus, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) on interactions among Cucurbita pepo, two aphid vectors of CMV, aphid natural enemies, and non-vector herbivores. Our results show that infection of C. pepo by CMV stimulates plants to produce higher amounts of the constitutive volatile blend normally released by healthy C. pepo, but that infection also reduces plant quality for vectors, stimulating their rapid dispersal after acquisition of taste cues and virions. This behavior is the result of several biochemical changes in nutrient levels and defense hormones that are induced in C. pepo when infected by CMV, and which decrease host palatability and quality. These changes can also have significant implications for parasitoid natural enemies that use aphids as hosts for larval development, as our research demonstrates that aphids reared on CMV-infected plants are more susceptible to attack by a parasitoid wasp. While these predators benefit from virus infection, field experiments show that CMV-infected C. pepo are largely avoided by various non-vector herbivores in a natural environment, particularly a damaging specialist herbivore, Anasa tristis. Our results indicate that infection by a non-persistently transmitted virus can have significant, indirect, impacts on various trophic levels, and that selection may act on viruses to favor traits that alter host phenotypes if such changes result in increased transmission.

The objective of the first experiment was to study effects of replacing alfalfa haylage with dry chopped alfalfa hay in the ration on sorting activity and to determine effects on ruminal fermentation, milk production, or milk composition. In addition, a second objective of this study was to compare results of the PSPS and RTPS for the same TMR samples and to determine effects of separation method on particle size distribution. Ration FPS was varied by replacing alfalfa silage with dry chopped alfalfa hay. The levels of hay used were 5, 10, 20, and 40% of forage DM. The results of this study showed that sorting occurred in all rations, but there was only minimal difference in the type or degree of sorting between treatments and only during the first 4 h after feeding. Sorting activity was highest at the beginning of the d and by 24 h after feeding the diets consumed by the cows were not significantly different from the offered diets. There were no negative effects of including dry chopped alfalfa hay in rations up to 23.5% of ration DM on DM intake, milk yield, and rumen fermentation. Small decreases in milk fat and protein content were found to occur with increasing dry hay inclusion. Data from the Penn State and Ro-Tap particle separators were compared, when separating the same TMR samples, and it was determined that data obtained from these 2 methods of particle separation are not directly comparable and that method of particle separation should be considered when interpreting experimental results.\nThe second experiment\u2019s objective was to study the interactions between FPS and ruminally fermentable carbohydrates (RFC) for ration sorting, ruminal fermentation, chewing activity, and milk yield and components. This study varied FPS and RFC by feeding 2 lengths of corn silage and 2 grind sizes of corn grain. The results showed that altering RFC had greater influence on milk production parameters than FPS; increasing RFC increased milk yield and protein content and decreased milk fat content. Ruminal fermentation was not affected by either FPS or RFC. Ration sorting occurred on all diets as evidenced by the changes in starch, NDF, and particle size composition of the refusals throughout the d and also by selection indices. Diets containing long FPS were sorted to a greater degree than diets containing short FPS, but there was no interaction between FPS and RFC for ration sorting. There was an interaction between FPS and RFC for DMI; DMI decreased with increasing FPS when the diet included low RFC and did change when the diet included high RFC and DMI increased with RFC for the long diets and did not change with RFC on the short diets. Finally, it was determined that approximately 5% of fecal particles were greater than 6.7 mm and that this may be a more accurate estimate of the critical particle size for rumen escape in modern lactating dairy cows.\nThe objective of the final experiment was to induce a bout of SARA in lactating dairy cows that had ad libitum access to 2 distinct diets that varied in FPS and starch fermentability and to determine how SARA affects TMR selection in dairy cows. One diet consisted of long corn silage and dry cracked corn and the other diet consisted of short corn silage and dry fine ground corn. When offered these 2 diets simultaneously cows consumed 18.1% of their total daily intake as long FPS and low RFC diet. However, after a bout of subacute ruminal acidosis, cows increased their intake of the longer ration to 38.3% of total daily intake. The following d long ration intake moderated to 28.0% and 2 d after the acidosis bout intakes were back to normal at 18.6%. These results indicate that cows are able to alter their diet preference for higher physically effective fiber and slower starch fermentability during a bout of subacute ruminal acidosis, and that they can effectively recover from this type of SARA within 72 h when appropriate diets are available.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1351], "author_name_tesi": "Maulfair, Daryl Dale", "last_name_ssi": "Maulfair", "middle_name_ssi": "Dale", "first_name_ssi": "Daryl", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Chad Daniel Dechow", "Kevin John Harvatine", "Robert John Vansaun", "Gabriella Anne Varga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Dissertation Advisor", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Committee Chair", "Chad Daniel Dechow, Committee Member", "Kevin John Harvatine, Committee Member", "Robert John Vansaun, Committee Member", "Gabriella Anne Varga, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["feed sorting", "forage particle size", "rumen fermentation", "diet selection", "eating behavior"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE ENTANGLEMENT OF FACT AND VALUE: EXPLORING THE AFFINITIES BETWEEN WEBER\u2019S VERSTEHEN AND AMERICAN PRAGMATISM", "id": "11514", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "99", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Canonized by Max Weber\u2019s \u201cScience as a Vocation\u201d, the distinction between fact and value and the principle of Wertfreiheit (value freedom) have become foundational to sociological practice.

Recent pre-clinical (rodent) and human studies suggest that inorganic nitrate supplementation in the form nitrate salts, concentrated beetroot juice, or other nitrate-rich vegetables, may be a key mediator of this cardioprotection via the serial (L-arginine and O2-independent) reduction of ingested nitrate to nitrite and subsequently nitric oxide (NO).  While nitrate supplementation has become established as a natural means of increasing NO, its influence on in vivo endothelial function in humans remains equivocal.  The effects of nitrate supplementation on cardiovascular/mental stress reactivity, another in vivo/laboratory based prognostic indicator of cardiovascular disease risk (i.e., future risk of hypertension), are also not known.   \nPURPOSE:  The primary objective of the present investigation was to determine if acute dietary nitrate supplementation augments the dilation of the brachial artery during graded handgrip exercise, a test previously shown to be nitric oxide-mediated in healthy younger men (Wray et al J Appl Physiol H1101-H1107, 2011). A secondary objective was to determine if this supplement attenuates the rise in systemic blood pressures or favorably modifies conduit artery shear patterns during an acute mental stress challenge.  \nMETHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, thirteen young (22 \u00b1 2 yrs) healthy men consumed a concentrated beetroot juice supplement (140 mL Beet-It Sport, James White Drinks Ltd.) or placebo (nitrate-depleted Beet-It Sport) on two study visits at least five days apart. Resting blood pressure (brachial auscultation) and venous nitrate/nitrite concentrations (ENO-20) were measured before and 2.5 hours post-consumption.  Three hours post consumption, arterial pulse wave velocity was measured (Colin tonometry) followed by resting and handgrip exercise-induced changes in brachial artery diameter, blood flow, and blood velocity (Doppler Ultrasound).  A sub-set of subjects (n=7) performed a serial subtraction test (SST) during which measures of superficial femoral artery diameter, flow, and blood velocity were assessed.  \nRESULTS: Dietary nitrate supplementation raised plasma nitrate (17-fold) and nitrite (1.6-fold) concentrations, and lowered resting pulse wave velocity (Colin VP-2000) versus placebo (all p<0.05) indicating absorption, conversion, and a biological effect of this supplement. However, nitrate supplementation had no effect on brachial artery diameter, flow, or shear rates at rest (all p>0.28) or during any of the six exercise work rates (all p>0.18). The increase in brachial diameter per unit change in shear rate across exercise intensities also did not differ between visits (p=0.15). Nitrate supplementation did not affect resting or SST-induced increases in systolic BP, heart rate, or femoral hemodynamics, but it did attenuate the peak rise in diastolic BP (p=0.041 vs. placebo visit).  \nCONCLUSION: These findings suggest that acute dietary nitrate supplementation favorably modifies arterial pulse wave velocity, but does not augment endothelial nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation in healthy younger men.  The SST sub-study further suggests that acute nitrate supplementation may influence blood pressure responses to acute mental stress in healthy young men.  The mechanisms and clinical significance of functional improvements in arterial compliance in healthy adults, independent of any measureable improvements in vascular function in the arm or leg conduit arteries, remains to be established.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8973], "author_name_tesi": "Maurer, David Gregory", "last_name_ssi": "Maurer", "middle_name_ssi": "Gregory", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "Lacy Marie Alexander"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor, Thesis Advisor", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Thesis Advisor", "Lacy Marie Alexander, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nitrate", "dietary supplement", "endothelial function", "blood pressure", "mental stress", "men"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Cooperation, Coercion, and Competition: Essays on Domestic Political Institutions and Civil Conflict", "id": "18769", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9032", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation looks at several aspects of domestic political institutions in an effort to explain why some states are more prone to civil conflict than others.

The third essay addresses how the nature of parties\u2019 electoral participation affects the likelihood of civil conflict before and after an election. I use original data on political party participation and performance in legislative elections covering all African states during the post-Cold War period. The results suggest that the inclusion of increasing numbers of parties also increases the likelihood of civil war onset, as well as pre-election anti-government violence and post-election pro-government violence.

The interdisciplinary study of public memory has, in fact, occupied scholars in rhetoric for the past quarter century. By focusing on the public and social qualities of most memorial practices, contemporary rhetoricians have emphasized the contingent nature of the past, drawn attention to the judgments made to select and sustain memories, and explored the persuasive power of leveraging past events in service of present needs. But why do some memories crop up at unexpected times? What happens when memories are adopted by the very institutions that formerly disavowed and suppressed them? How can scholars in rhetoric studies help explain the opportunistic resurgence of public memories or the deliberate dismissal of traumatic pasts?

Each neuron in the brain is a unique entity defined by its local environment and the connections it makes with neighboring neurons. In turn, each of those neighboring neurons is somewhat different from each other due to variation in their connections, intracellular millieu, and local environments. While the notion of a billion unique processors operating in parallel sounds too daunting to fathom, much less describe scientifically, there are certain shared phenomena common to most (and possibly all) neurons. This thesis is concerned with just one of these phenomena: exocytotic plasticity.\nPlasticity, or the ability of a cell to change in a manner associated with more effective functioning, is part of what makes the brain a powerful learning and memory tool. While plasticity can take many forms, this thesis is just concerned with changes in the exocytosis process, or exocytotic plasticity. Exocytosis is the process by which cells secrete molecules that affect nearby cells and transmit information in the form of chemical messages. These messengers, or neurotransmitters, are packed in small spherical membrane enclosures called vesicles that fuse with the cell membrane to release neurotransmitters in packets. In general, the exocytotic process is quite uniform between various cell types, but certain treatments can cause this process to occur with slower or faster kinetics, and many neuromodulators can cause the number of exocytotic events per unit time to change in frequency.\n\nConstant potential amperometry is one method to monitor exocytosis from single cells in culture with sub millisecond time resolution. By placing a carbon fiber against the surface of an excitable cell, electroactive neuromotransmitters released by the cell (such as dopamine) can be quantitatively oxidized to produce a small current that is proportional to the amount secreted. Thus amperometry can produce a great deal of information pertinent to questions about exocytosis. It has been used to study regulated exocytosis both in vivo and in isolated cultures. It has revealed fine details about exocytosis before, during, and immediately following vesicle fusion. It can reveal net changes in release as a form of toxological assay or intracellular signal screen. In addition, the amount released from a single fusion event or quantal size can be manipulated by treatments. These manipulations have provided evidence that cells could also manipulate the exocytosis process as a form of exocytotic plasticity. \n\nOne such manipulation, a collaboration with Yoshiko Niimura, demonstrates the effects of increasing various types of phospholipids on exocytosis. When cells are incubated with phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), or sphingomyelin (SM), changes in the quantal size and/or vesicle fusion kinetics are observed. PC slowed and PE accelerated the expulsion of neurotransmitter from vesicles. Phosphatidylserine (PS) increased the number of stimulated amperometric peaks. Electron micrographs of PS-treated cells indicated a larger fraction of vesicles \u201cdocked\u201d to the plasma membrane might underlie the enhanced rate of secretion. Together these data suggest that differences in membrane composition affect exocytosis and might be involved in cell function related to plasticity.\n\nPlasma membrane tension also appears to affect exocytosis. In collaboration with Leslie Sombers, we examined how reducing tension in the plasma membrane by incubating PC12 cells in hypertonic saline caused the vesicle-to-plasma membrane fusion pore to stabilize, yielding amperometric peaks with a longer and larger foot portion. This foot amplification was more pronounced when cells were loaded with the dopamine precursor, L-(3,4)-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a treatment that caused vesicular volume and vesicular membrane tension to increase.  These data lend support to the hypothesis that differences in membrane tension between the vesicle and plasma membrane induce a more stable fusion pore conformation.\nLeslie and I also examined the effect of L-DOPA incubation using amperometry and electron microscopy. Electron microscopic measurements of L-DOPA-treated cells revealed the halo of large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) contained most of the newly loaded DA. Likewise, when exocytosis was measured following treatment in hyperosmotic solutions, most of the loaded DA that leaked through the stabilized fusion pore appeared to derive from the halo. \n\nA third, unexpected effect of combining L-DOPA incubation with hyperosmotic saline was to convert a substantial portion (15.3%) of LDCVs in PC12 cells into multicored vesicles. Electron microscopy images of cells treated with an electron-dense endocytosis tracer, cationized ferritin, suggested that the multicored vesicles are formed from the fusion of LCDVs prior to exocytosis. Amperometric measurements supported this conclusion as the distribution of quantal sizes included a bimodal distribution, possibly arising from two pools of vesicles (single and multicore LDCVs). This phenomenon provides evidence that exchange of membranes between LDCVs is possible under some conditions, and this lipid exchange might be involved in regulating vesicle size and composition.\n\nMany neuromodulators affect ion channels and regulatory proteins whose action affects the rate of exocytosis. One of these is the hormone estrogen. Estrogen has been identified in the brain at higher concentrations than even the amounts found in reproductive organs. In addition, several estrogen receptors are expressed in brain areas such as the hypothalamus (controls the reproductive system) and the hippocampus (involved in learning and memory) and it seems likely that estrogen acts as both a hormone in the body and a neuromodulator in the brain. Using PC12 and GT1-7 cell cultures to model what might happen when neurons are exposed to estrogen, it appears that estrogen (specifically 17-&#946;-estradiol) can suppress exocytosis by blocking voltage-gated calcium ion channels, inhibiting calcium release from ryanodine-receptor-regulated intracellular calcium stores, and even promote exocytosis by opening voltage-gated calcium ion channels. The timing of the exposure to estrogen and subsequent observation period seems to be important in determining whether the effect of estrogen appears as an increase or decrease exocytosis. Estrogen consistently prevents other stimuli from promoting exocytosis, but at the same time causes exocytosis during and shortly after it is applied to cells. While this dual action complicates interpretation of the results, it has been confirmed using changes in cytosolic calcium as an alternate measurement. Additional work is ongoing to explain how estrogen is modulating exocytosis and ultimately understand what purpose this dual action might serve in the brain.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4488], "author_name_tesi": "Maxson, Marc M", "last_name_ssi": "Maxson", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Marc", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing", "Kyung An Han", "Gong Chen", "Nandini Vasudevan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing, Committee Chair", "Kyung An Han, Committee Member", "Gong Chen, Committee Member", "Nandini Vasudevan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hypertonic", "osmolarity", "store-operated", "voltage-gated", "calcium", "neuromodulator", "estrogen", "secretion", "exocytosis", "neuroscience", "L-DOPA", "phosphatidylserine", "phosphatidylethanolamine", "phosphatidylcholine"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Agonistic Discourses: Exploring the Relationship Between Literary Theory and Composition in the Contemporary University", "id": "23627", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10709", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Agonistic Discourses: Exploring the Relationship Between Literary Theory and Composition in the Contemporary University contributes to an ongoing effort to historicize Rhetoric and Composition as an academic discourse.

While the parallel evolution of literary theory might initially seem unrelated to Rhetoric and Composition\u2014a reasonable assumption given their often antagonistic relationship\u2014these discourses prove to be strikingly complementary if we understand them as symptomatic of broad changes in American political and economic life.

Adolescents and parents in 145 families participated in home interviews during which adolescents provided information regarding their parents\u2019 (mother and father collectively) feeding practices. Adolescents also self-reported their height and weight, overweight concerns, depressive symptoms, and autonomy in decision making.  Parents provided information regarding family background characteristics and other information as relevant to the study. Using latent profile analysis, three classes of parental feeding practices emerged: high autonomy, high restriction, and undifferentiated. There were differences in BMI across feeding classes. Youth in the high restriction class were heavier than youth in the high autonomy and undifferentiated classes. Girls and boys in the high restriction and girls in the undifferentiated classes were at an increased risk for heightened weight concerns relative to other youth. African American parents\u2019 feeding practices are diverse and are associated with adolescent physical and psychosocial health. Targeting these behaviors in obesity and eating disorder interventions may have a positive impact on youth\u2019s outcomes. \n\nThe overarching goal of the second study was to examine whether patterns of youth out of school time use in physically active, media, and non-media sedentary activities were associated with adolescent BMI and related psychosocial outcomes. During a series of seven nightly phone-calls, youth reported their daily involvement (in minutes) in out of school activities and were then categorized based on whether or not they met current national recommendations time use. Only 25% of youth met the current recommendations for physical activity\u2014whereas media and sedentary related pursuits were dominant. Girls were less physically active than boys; whereas boys spent more time in media related activities as compared to girls. Three activity groups emerged based on the number of recommendations that youth and dominant activities that youth were engaged in: (1) low activity (met two or more national recommendations); (2) high physical activity (met one recommendation); or (3) high sedentary/media (met no recommendations). Although, on average youth who took part in the study were of elevated weight status, youth in the high sedentary/media group had a greater proportion of overweight and obesity relative to youth in the low activity and high physical activity groups. After controlling for adolescent BMI, the activity groups did not differ in overweight concerns or depressive symptoms. The results of this study indicate that it is the overall pattern of involvement in various types of activity that is linked to adolescent health. Further, the results of this study suggest that there are two pathways to non-obesity\u2014high physical activity or limited non-media sedentary activity. Future research and obesity prevention programming should consider how to promote developmental competencies in both areas among African American youth.

I analyzed primary producer biomass (chlorophyll-a), biofilm nitrogen: phosphorus (N:P) ratio, alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and nitrate reductase (NR) as measures of biofilm community nutrient status across two types of nutrient gradients (experimental and empirical). Nutrient status indicators were first studied using an in-situ enrichment experiment deployed at a low nutrient limestone spring (Big Spring, Bellefonte, PA), in order to calibrate them against known nutrient loads. Nutrient diffusing substrata leached nitrate and phosphate in a factorial design of nine PxNx treatments (zero, 0.045M, and 0.50M nitrate and phosphate). Increasing P treatment led to significantly higher biomass and suppression of APA response, indicating P limitation at the site. However, when enriched with P, biomass also increased with additional N, providing evidence for secondary nitrogen limitation. N:P ratios varied with N and P enrichment, but did not correlate to biomass. NR activity increased in the highest N treatment, demonstrating that biofilm NR responds positively when nitrate is the dominant N source. \n\nChl-a, N:P, and APA were also measured seasonally on biofilms grown on incubated natural substrates in four subwatersheds of Spring Creek, Centre County, PA. Significant spatial and temporal differences were found between subwatersheds, with temporal variation in Chl-a and APA overshadowing between site variation. Biofilm N:P ratio was strongly correlated to water column DIN:SRP, but did not reflect the same patterns of seasonal P enrichment that were observed in the inverse relationship of Chl-a and APA. Alkaline phosphatase activity appears to be a more sensitive indicator of nutrient status than water column nutrient concentrations or N:P stoichiometry alone. This increased sensitivity likely reflects the difference between nutrient concentrations in streams and actual nutrient loads. Despite primary P limitation and low water column PO4-P at the study sites, biofilms in Spring Creek exhibited a range in biomass and physiology that indicated varying levels of P were influencing the system \u2013 possibly pointing toward episodic nutrient loading events.

Participants included 36 families of infants between the ages of 3 and 24 months. Temperament was assessed using the Revised Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ-R). Parent behaviors were assessed through maternal report from the Sleep Practices Questionnaire (SPQ) and through observations from overnight video recordings.

The results provided support for the organismic specificity hypothesis in the context of infant sleep.

Initial ambient air temperature was varied between 540 and 620\u00b0C. To simulate the gas mixture composition in a modern IC engine that utilizes exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), standard air was diluted with nitrogen and carbon dioxide which resulted in oxygen concentrations ranging from 21.8 to 9.6%.\n\nThe optical CVCC was built by modifying a Cetane Ignition Delay (CID 510) instrument, manufactured by PAC, l.p. Two optical systems where integrated into the design of the apparatus. A spray visualization system utilized a high speed camera that captured images of the developing liquid fuel spray at 29,197 frames per second via direct optical access through a liquid-cooled borescope. These images were post-processed to calculate liquid penetration length and cone angle. In addition, natural light emissions from excited formaldehyde (CH2O*), OH*, CH*, and C2* were captured by a chemiluminescence detection system comprised of a UV/Vis optical probe, dichroic mirrors, band-pass filters, and photomultiplier tube modules. \n\nIt was observed for each fuel sample that liquid penetration length and cone angle were insensitive to the changes in temperature and EGR dilution rates tested. A direct relationship between liquid length and cone angle was observed across transient and quasi-steady spray behavior; the ratio between these values developed a positive linear trend across the transient state followed by a constant value in the quasi-steady state. Increased ambient air temperature shortened ignition delay values for all fuel samples. ULSD and n-heptane displayed negative temperature dependence as temperature exceeded 580\u00b0C, consistent with well-understood hydrocarbon oxidation behavior. Higher rates of EGR dilution increased chemical ignition delay in an exponential manner. ULSD was the most sensitive to the decreasing ambient oxygen concentration, while B100 and n-heptane displayed stronger EGR tolerance.

Using motifs such as curiosity cabinets and systems of taxonomy, these artists demonstrate a growing interest in the paradigms of natural history. For these practitioners natural history operates within the realm of history, memory and mythology, inspiring them to make works that examine a scientific paradigm long thought to be obsolete. \n\nThis study, which itself takes on the form of a curiosity cabinet, identifies three points of consonance among these artists. First, these artists are concerned with acknowledging, adhering to, or subverting the borders of naturalist taxonomy. They have appropriated this scientific system of classification, that applies names to organisms\u2014\u201cspecies\u201d\u2014to question and undermine the very nature of culturally-constructed categories. Ultimately, their critiques are concerned with the very categorization of knowledge itself. Second, these artists demonstrate a sustained engagement with organismal bodies, attending to plants, non-human animals and fungi and how they have been applied to our wider culture. Delving into ontology, they provide a space where viewers may come to terms with, and simultaneously envision, what it is to be a human being, in a body, in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Third, in an attempt to resolve a historical past in the present, Dion, Tomaselli, Paine, Ford and Twombly use natural history to explore and negotiate memory and mythology in the process of their retreat into eighteenth- and nineteenth-century natural history, its golden age. \n\nI take Aby Warburg\u2019s (1866-1929) Mnemosyne, or Atlas Project (1927-29), as a model for understanding historical natural history as a field of observation and recollection, which attended to memory, or according to Warburg, the past conceptualized in the present. Guided by an associative model, Warburg\u2019s project continues to challenge traditional patterns of conceptualizing objects and images and their relationship to one another, leaving us to contemplate our own evolutionary pasts and place within the order of things. The artists here rely on a similar associative model to reckon with history, memories and presentness in the process of constructing new ways of seeing. They have discovered in natural history, as Warburg himself attempted to do with his \u201cserpent\u201d and \u201cnymph,\u201d a kind of resolution of memory and \u201ctrauma.\u201d For these artists, trauma is complex and subtle, scattered across a field of colonialism, ecological destruction, and reductive nature-culture bifurcations. It exists in, among other things, the consolidation of living beings into the homogenous category of \u201clife\u201d and the relegation of the field of nature to the laboratory of science, exterior to our own processes of becoming. These artists beckon us with a Visionary Natural History: Through the space of their own serpents and nymphs\u2014historical natural history\u2014they demonstrate an awareness that acknowledges a past both violent and full of promise, rich with possibilties for constructing new ways of seeing and being.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [20], "author_name_tesi": "Mazow, Alissa Walls", "last_name_ssi": "Mazow", "middle_name_ssi": "Walls", "first_name_ssi": "Alissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah K Rich", "Sarah K Rich", "Brian A Curran", "Craig Robert Zabel", "Nancy Elizabeth Locke", "Richard Matthew Doyle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah K Rich, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarah K Rich, Committee Chair", "Brian A Curran, Committee Member", "Craig Robert Zabel, Committee Member", "Nancy Elizabeth Locke, Committee Member", "Richard Matthew Doyle, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["american art", "natural history"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Responding to growers' needs: Evaluation of management strategies for onion center rot, caused by Pantoea ananatis and Pantoea agglomerans ", "id": "13634jrd5407", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13634", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Onion growers in Pennsylvania are continually challenged by in-field and post-harvest yield losses due to bacterial pathogens. In 2013, losses due to bacterial disease reduced the number of marketable onion boxes over 40%, resulting in a total loss of $488,000. The primary bacterial pathogens in Pennsylvania include the onion center rot pathogens Pantoea ananatis and Pantoea agglomerans and are the focus of this research. Although, there are a number of cultural and in-season management practices currently used by growers to reduce the risk of center rot, unacceptable losses still frequently occur and there is a need to develop more targeted strategies that can be incorporated into an integrated pest management program. The three management strategies evaluated in this research were cultivar selection, augmented nitrogen fertigation programs and pre-plant onion transplant treatments. Currently, there are no known onion breeding programs targeting center rot, nor have there been many trials to evaluate the susceptibility of commercially available cultivars. To address this knowledge gap, thirteen onion cultivars were evaluated between 2015 and 2016 for center rot susceptibility, marketability and select horticultural characteristics. The only cultivar to have lower disease incidence and severity and comparable yields to grower standard cv. Candy was cv. Spanish Medallion. Preliminary data suggested that applying total crop nitrogen prior to onion bulbing increased total yield and reduced bacterial disease incidence. Also, it was observed that low lying areas in heavily manured fields used for onion production have had up to 83% bacterial bulb decay incidence at harvest. Based on this knowledge, we evaluated whether the timing and rate of nitrogen application could reduce center rot losses at harvest. A positive, quadratic relationship was found between foliar nitrogen levels at bulbing and center rot incidence at harvest. An interaction existed between rate and time but trends in this relationship were variable based on field trial location. Eliminating P. ananatis and P. agglomerans prior to planting through use of a transplant bactericide could reduce a potential source of inoculum and provide growers with another management tool. Hydrogen dioxide, hydrogen peroxide with mono- and di-potassium salts of phosphorus acid, copper sulfate pentahydrate and streptomycin sulfate were all effective at reducing P. ananatis and P. agglomerans as epiphytes on onion transplants and in-vitro. The results of this research would also be widely applicable to other onion production systems and has been influential in the development of a horticultural production guide to aid professionals and growers in low-input horticulture and disease management decisions in Honduras. The results of this research have increased the collective knowledge on the potential use of cultivar selection, nitrogen application rate and timing and bactericide sensitivity to manage onion center rot and will be used to provide growers higher precision disease management options.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13747], "author_name_tesi": "Mazzone, Jennie Diehl", "last_name_ssi": "Mazzone", "middle_name_ssi": "Diehl", "first_name_ssi": "Jennie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Beth K.
