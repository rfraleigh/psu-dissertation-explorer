In recent years, evidence has been mounting that the primary tumor contributes to adapting this remote organ to increase this hospitality. Interestingly, many in vitro experiments have shown that conditioned media from cancer cells produce physical changes which theoretically could facilitate invasion. These include perturbations in extracellular matrix and of cell to cell adhesions. The conditioned media in these in vitro experiments could be interpreted to be a proxy for either paracrine or endocrine effects, however, when these observations are coupled with evidence from in vivo experiments, it seems possible that primary tumors have remote effects on un-metastasized organs that can elicit changes in them which are pro-metastatic. We have performed a series of experiments designed to characterize and describe changes in osteoblasts (hFOB) which occur as a result of exposure to conditioned medium from breast cancer cells (MDA-MET). Functional experiments aimed at investigating whether these changes are pro-metastatic were included as a means of this characterization. Thus cell to cell adhesions, as well as the ability of the osteoblastic environment to attract MDA-MET cells were both assessed. Further, we investigated mechanistically the bases behind the observations from the functional experiments. \nMethods\nConfluent hFOB cells were treated with conditioned media from either MDA-MET, MDA-MB-231 HTERT-HME1 or hFOB cells 24 hrs. This treatment conditioned medium was removed, the cells washed and serum-free medium added to the hFOB cells.  hFOB-conditioned medium was collected after 18hrs. This medium was then used in in vitro migration assays measuring number of MDA-MET migratory cells by labeling the cells with DNA-binding dye Cyquant; in establishing presence of collagen by western blot; in collagenase assays and in a cytokine array where antibodies to 74 cytokines were embedded on a membrane.  The presence of Type 1 collagen receptors was shown by immunocytochemistry.  The data were analyzed using one way ANOVA and the Student\u2019s T test.\nResults\nWe found that conditioned medium from hFOB cells that had been treated with MDA-MET-conditioned medium attracted more MDA-MET cells than hFOB cells pre-exposed to its own medium only.  We hypothesized that Type 1 collagen fragments of specific length were the chemoattractants responsible for our observed effect.  This was evidenced by an increase in collagenase in the conditioned medium of hFOB cells which had been exposed to MDA-MET-conditioned medium.  The definitiveness of this evidence was aided by the inherent fidelity of the collagenase enzymes and its Type 1 collagen substrate and the distinctiveness of the product of this enzyme substrate interaction. We also showed that bacterial collagenase, which creates short collagen fragments of non-specific length removed the ability of hFOB -conditioned medium to attract MDA-MET cells. In addition, we showed that at least two known Type 1 collagen receptors UPARAP (urokinase-like plasminogen activator associated protein) and integrin receptor \u03b12\u03b21 were present on MDA-MET cells. The cytokine array performed on hFOB -conditioned medium showed differential protein expression under treatment by MDA-MET compared to HTERT-HME1 in one cytokine only (CXCL5). Therefore, MDA-MET-conditioned medium treatment caused a loss of expression of CXCL5 while HTERT-HME1-conditioned medium exposure caused an increase of CXCL5. We confirmed this result by quantitative RT-PCR on both CXCL5 and on our proposed metastasis suppressor \u2013like candidate pigment-epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). We showed that this loss of CXCL5 expression occurs both in hFOB cells and on the protein level in conditioned medium. PEDF followed the differential expression of CXCL5; that is increasing in response to HTERT-HME1-conditioned medium and decreasing in response to MDA-MET-conditioned medium. We investigated whether the knockdown of CXCL5 by siRNA in hFOB cells would decrease chemoattraction of MDA-MET cells. We also added recombinant PEDF to hFOB-conditioned medium to test whether chemoattraction could be decreased. The knockdown of CXCL5 in hFOB cells had no effect (Figure 5) while the addition of PEDF, had a trend towards a decrease in chemoattraction n=5, p<0.1 (Figure 4).\nConclusions\nWe have further defined the concept of the pre-metastatic niche. This particular niche created by secreted factors from breast cancer cells in bone may 1) include chemoattractants, generated by the effect on the extracellular matrix of exposure to secreted factors from primary tumor cells. We show evidence that collagen fragments of Type 1 collagen are a likely candidate responsible for this observation. 2) Include the loss of anti-metastatic factors such as PEDF and CXCL5 by osteoblasts 3) be further characterized by a decrease in the ability of osteoblastic cells to form cell-cell adhesions.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8024], "author_name_tesi": "Chin-quee, Karis P", "last_name_ssi": "Chin-quee", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Karis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Donahue", "Henry Joseph Donahue", "Andrea Manni", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "David Feith", "Lisa M Shantz", "Ralph Lauren Keil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Donahue, Dissertation Advisor", "Henry Joseph Donahue, Committee Chair", "Andrea Manni, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "David Feith, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["breast cancer metastasis", "pre-metastatic niche", "bone", "collagen fragments", "collagenase"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "MULTIFUNCTIONAL PARYLENE-C MICROFIBROUS THIN FILMS", "id": "13681cuc262", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13681", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Towards sustainable development, multifunctional products have many advantageous over single-function products: reduction in the number of parts, raw material, assembly time, and cost involved in a product\u2019s life cycle. My goal for this thesis was to demonstrate the multifunctionalities of Parylene-C microfibrous thin films.\n\nTo achieve this goal, I chose Parylene C, a polymer, because the fabrication of periodic mediums of Parylene C in the form of microfibrous thin films (mFTFs) was already established. A mFTF is a parallel arrangement of identical micrometer-sized fibers of shapes cylindrical, chevronic, or helical. Furthermore, Parylene C had three existing functions: in medical-device industries as corrosion-resistive coatings, in electronic industries as electrically insulating coatings, and in biomedical research for tissue-culture substrates. \n\nAs the functionalities of a material are dependent on the microstructure and physical properties, the investigation made for this thesis was two-fold: (1) Experimentally, I determined the wetting, mechanical, and dielectric properties of columnar mFTFs and examined the microstructural and molecular differences between bulk films and mFTFs. (2) Using physical properties of bulk film, I computationally determined the elastodynamic and determined the electromagnetic filtering capabilities of Parylene-C mFTFs. Several columnar mFTFs of Parylene C were fabricated by varying the monomer deposition angle. Following are the significant experimental findings:\n\n1. Molecular and microstructural characteristics: The dependence of the microfiber inclination angle on the monomer deposition angle was classified into four regimes of two different types. \nX-ray diffraction experiments indicated that the columnar mFTFs contain three crystal planes not evident in bulk Parylene-C films and that the columnar mFTFs are less crystalline than bulk films.  Infrared absorbance spectra revealed that the atomic bonding is the same in all columnar mFTFs and bulk films. The static hydrophobicity of columnar mFTFs was found to be anisotropic and can be maximized by a proper choice of monomer deposition angle. In contrast, the hydrophobicity of bulk film is isotropic.\n\n2. Mechanical properties: Dynamic storage and loss moduli of columnar mFTFs were determined in the 1 to 80 Hz frequency range for temperatures between -40 deg C and 125 deg C in one of two orthogonal directions lying wholly in the substrate plane: either (i) normal or (ii) parallel to the morphologically significant plane of the mFTF. The storage and loss moduli for normal loading did not exceed their counterparts for parallel loading. All columnar mFTFs were found to be softer than a bulk film. In both bulk and columnar forms, Parylene C was found to be rheologically not simple.\n\n3. Relative permittivity: The charge-storage and absorption properties measured for the columnar mFTFs in the 100 Hz--1 MHz frequency range over temperatures between -40 deg C and 125 deg C were lower than the bulk film.  Internal surfaces of the columnar mFTFs were found to increase the charge-storage capacity. The lower charge-storage capability of columnar mFTFs suggests their possible applications as interlayer dielectrics. The frequency dependence of the relative permittivity of the columnar mFTFs was identified in terms of the Hashin--Shrtikmann model.\n\nThe elastodynamic bandgaps of Parylene-C mFTFs as phononic crystals were computationally determined for the columnar, chevronic, and chiral mFTFs. Microfibers were arranged either on a square or a hexagonal lattice with the host medium as either water or air. Following are the significant findings:\n \n1. All bandgaps were observed to lie in the 0.01--162.9 MHz regime. The upper limit of the frequency of bandgaps was the highest for the columnar mFTFs and the lowest for the chiral mFTFs. More bandgaps were found to exist when the host medium is water than air. The presence of complete bandgaps suggests their use as bulk-acoustic-wave and surface-acoustic-wave filters.  The softness of the Parylene-C mFTFs makes them mechanically tunable, and their bandgaps can be exploited in multiband ultrasonic filters. \n \n2. An investigation was made to demonstrate Parylene-C mFTFs as circular-polarization filters.  The relative permittivity of bulk Parylene C was determined as a function of frequency between 15 THz and 149 THz.  Potential application of chiral mFTFs as reflectors of thermal energy was identified. The circular Bragg regime for chiral mFTFs of Parylene C was identified as 31.8--35.2 THz,  making them useful as circular-polarization band-rejection filters.

This will be done from the point of view of deconstructing stereotypical representations of Indian women as they appear in westocentric practices.  I will also show through comparison that the differences between east and west in terms of gender and other factors related women\u2019s oppression are not that vast, thus enabling and creating a bridge for a dialogue between the two cultures. The findings that emerge through the comparison will be of benefit to postcolonial scholars of German and feminism, who have engaged themselves with the problem of too generalized and stereotypical depictions of Indian women in Westocentric discourses and practices. Indian women often get ascribed with adjectives such as average, restrained, ignorant, dutiful, victimized, maternal, uneducated, tradition-bound, leaving out their other achievements in the areas of intellectual scholarship and feminist initiatives, on a local as well as a global scale. This kind of stereotyping, and generalization, lacking in historical and cultural variation, leads to further colonizing impulses and justifies the civilizing mission that came about with the beginning of the colonial period. It also affects the self-perception of Indian women and further affects the way laws, educational and institutional policies are shaped, locally and globally. It is therefore a necessary imperative to deconstruct stereotypical images and representations of Indian women as they appear in Westocentric discourses. The feminist endeavors of Savitribai Phule, Pandita Ramabai, Tarabai Shinde and Malatibai Bedekar provide and represent a more coherent and real picture of the images of Marathi (Indian) women in international discourses. \n          Furthermore, if we look closely at what German feminists in the Western world were writing, in the same time period, we come across remarkable similarities in the writings of these feminists. I will examine these similarities on the basis of the attitude of these feminists towards patriarchy, the nation-state, means of resistance, choice of language and formal charatcteristics of the works.  Moreover these similarities stand out in marked contrast to the \u2018differences\u2019 that have been the object of study of current and  pre-colonial and colonial scholars of  various disciplines. The precolonial and colonial German  engagement with  Indian culture showed that Indian culture ( especially women)  appeared to them as different, exotic or as the \u2018other\u2019 of German culture. My study contributes to current debates by showing the similarities or the comparable elements, which further prove that there is scope for a dialogue and feminist alliances between the two cultures. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6279], "author_name_tesi": "Chindhade, Tejashri ", "last_name_ssi": "Chindhade", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tejashri", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Dr Daniel Purdy", "Prof Dr Daniel Purdy", "Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Reiko Tachibana", "Prof Dr Kumkum Chatterjee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof Dr Daniel Purdy, Dissertation Advisor", "Prof Dr Daniel Purdy, Committee Chair", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member", "Reiko Tachibana, Committee Member", "Prof Dr Kumkum Chatterjee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Colonization", "Post-colonial", "German Literature", "Marathi Literature", "Feminism", "Comparison"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTER-BASED VIDEO STRATEGY TRAINING FOR PROBLEM REPRESENTATION AND SELF-EXPLANATION ON UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS REPRESENTING AND SOLVING ILL-STRUCTURED PROBLEMS \n", "id": "10308", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6747", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Professionals solve ill-structured problems every day.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of strategy training on an individual\u2019s ability to construct an effective problem representation, and if this would lead to better problem solutions when solving ill-structured problems.

The results of ANCOVAs showed that Problem Representation Heuristic Strategy Training was effective for helping undergraduate students perform better on one of the Problem Representation sub-skills, Setting Goals. The results of chi-square tests indicated that this type of training also resulted in more students applying the following Problem Representation sub-skills when presenting problems: Define Problems, and Recognize Multiple Perspectives with Justification. This type of training, however, did not have an effect on the problem solutions generated. The findings also showed that there was no effect of Self-explanation Learning Strategy Training on students\u2019 ability to represent problems or generate solutions.

Predicting the performance of different naturally fractured oil reservoirs undergoing cyclic steam injection under varying design parameters is a difficult task. The simulation time and effort required to evaluate such performance for a large number of scenarios is likely to be very high. \nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are mathematical tools designed to map an input domain into an output domain. They are based on observations made in the study of biological systems. Their function is similar to that of a mathematical function. In this work neural network based proxy models are developed for comparative evaluation of cyclic steam injection in various naturally fractured oil reservoirs with constant injection, soaking and production periods. Five different oils with viscosities ranging from 5800 cp to as low as 1 cp at room temperature are used as reservoir fluids in this study and a proxy model is developed for each oil.

Specifically, youth who used a minimizing strategy to report distress, regardless of level of clinical symptoms (high and low) said they did not believe they had problems coping when compared to others; and the same pattern emerged across both the high and low symptom groups with mixed reporting of distress style. This suggests that the focus should be on clinical symptoms as opposed to distress reporting style in efforts to reduce the distress of youth in foster care.

Of the many positive and negative regulatory proteins known to target TBP, TBP itself (via homodimerization) and TAFII145 (via its N-terminal domain, TAND), were shown to prevent TBP from binding to DNA in vitro.  In an effort to characterize the interplay between these two putative repression mechanisms and investigate their physiological relevance, we have analyzed mutations in the crystallographic TBP dimer interface and a deletion of the TAND domain.  The TBP mutants were observed to enhance activator-independent transcription in a manner that strongly correlated with defects in homodimerization.  In addition, TBP dimerization was discovered to protect TBP against protein degradation. Though the deletion of TAND did not cause a similar transcription phenotype, a synthetic toxic phenotype was observed when mutations in both TAND and the TBP dimerization interface were combined.  Since the two proteins overlapped in their interaction with TBP, we investigated whether they represented redundant mechanisms for gene repression in vivo.  Full genome yeast microarrays were generated and used in studies that revealed that 5% of the yeast genome was significantly derepressed when the TBP dimerization interface was mutated.  In contrast, only 2% of the genome was derepressed when TAND was deleted.  When combined, the two mutant proteins caused increased expression of ~10% of the yeast genes.  Analysis of the expression intensity levels of the up-regulated genes suggested that TBP dimerization was a more dominant repression mechanism than TAND and was important for keeping genes turned \u2018off\u2019.

Bifidobacteria are often sensitive to stresses encountered during production and storage of food and during passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the overall purpose of this research was to determine if adhesion of bifidobacteria to starch-based spherulites can improve their survival when exposed to acid or bile. \nThe first objective of this work was to develop a procedure to prepare spherulites in adequate quantities for use in adhesion and survival studies. Spherulites were prepared successfully in a Parr reactor (pressure vessel) using potato starch, high amylose maize starch (Hylon VII) and purified potato amylose. Conditions were developed to dry spherulites using vacuum filtration and solvent dehydration. Spherulites were characterized with respect to size (particle size analysis) and shape (optical microscopy). Similar morphology and size were observed for both washed and dried spherulites. \nThe second objective was to determine if a variety of bifidobacterial strains could adhere to potato amylose spherulites and high amylose maize starch granules. The strains differed in their ability to adhere to spherulites and Hylon VII with adhesion to spherulites significantly higher (p = 0.001) than Hylon VII for the majority of the strains.\nThe final objective was to investigate the protective effect of adherence of bifidobacteria to spherulites or Hylon VII on their survival when exposed to acid or bile. Adhesion to spherulites or Hylon VII did not improve the survival of bifidobacteria.

Over the last two decades, increasing attention has been drawn to the importance of autonomy to language learning.  Teachers of autonomous language learners are portrayed as helper, facilitator, resource, consultant, counselor, coordinator, and adviser.  \n   Nonetheless, there is a lack of research to investigate the reactions of language learners in response to teacher roles said to promote autonomy.  This study aimed at investigating the relationship of teacher roles and learner autonomy in a cyber pedagogical context, a context where the teacher as well as the learners were L2 users of English with diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds and experiences.  Data consisted of 362 email messages generated in a twenty-month period of the cyber English class.  \n   A computational content analysis was used to identify the teaching and counseling roles of the teacher in 90 email messages, spreading equally among the beginning, middle and end phases of the instructional period.  The results showed that the teacher\u2019s teaching roles became less active as the course progressed whereas the counseling roles remained active throughout the instructional period.  Data analysis also calls into question the universality of established categories of teacher roles, suggesting that cultural context and experience need to be taken into consideration. \n  Linked to the content analysis, a follow-up discourse analysis investigated the ensuing learner-teacher interactions to explore how the learners reacted to the teaching and counseling roles of the teacher.  The results suggested that teaching roles did not provide opportunities for promoting learner autonomy, but counseling roles created a supportive learning environment for the learners to develop autonomy in language learning.  The results of the discourse analysis also provided evidence that supported the working definition with particular emphasis on the connection between communication and autonomy in language learning.  \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1277], "author_name_tesi": "Chiu, Chi-Yen ", "last_name_ssi": "Chiu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chi-Yen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sandra J.

As the number and proportion of older adults with diabetes grows within populations, there is an increasing need to understand the difficulties faced by these adults beyond the basic measure of mortality. The purpose of this three-paper thesis was to illuminate the impact of diabetes on physical function for adults from midlife to older age.\nThe first study employed an accelerated longitudinal design and multilevel modeling growth curve models to identify physical function trajectories for nationally representative samples of middle-aged adults with and without diabetes in the U.S. and Taiwan. Results demonstrated that adults living with diabetes experienced more physical limitations and faster rates of change in aging than did those without diabetes. In addition, U.S. women, minority group adults, and those of lower education suffered more adverse impacts of diabetes than did men, Whites, and those of higher education. The second study employed structural equation modeling to examine hypothesized mechanisms underlying gender differences in physical disability for adults with type 2 diabetes. Findings indicated that gender-related biological (e.g., BMI, HbA1c, blood pressure, early complications) and behavioral (e.g., exercise) factors directly and completely mediated the gender differences in physical function; psychosocial factors (e.g., perceived control, self-efficacy, coping, and depressive symptoms), contributed indirectly to the link. The third study investigated if the physical function trajectories experienced by adults living with diabetes in the U.S. were shaped by body weight trajectories earlier in life, using a group-based trajectory modeling approach. Results identified four distinct body weight trajectories (stable normal weight,\niv\n29.0%; stable overweight, 46.5%; loss and regain obese, 17.6%; and weight cumulating morbidly obese, 6.9%) and three disability trajectories (little or low increase, 34.6%; moderate increase, 45.4%; and chronic high, 20.1%). Various relationships among these two sets of trajectories were found. Importantly, the results strongly supported recommendations for weight control in adults with diabetes in order to prevent future disability. In conclusion, the three studies in this thesis highlighted the heterogeneity of adults living with diabetes in midlife and older age and underscored the importance of taking a multidimensional approach to providing diabetes care.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1151], "author_name_tesi": "Chiu, Ching-Ju ", "last_name_ssi": "Chiu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ching-Ju", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Linda Ann Wray", "Patricia Barthalow Koch", "Linda Ann Wray", "Sheila Grace West", "Mosuk Chow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Linda Ann Wray, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Barthalow Koch, Committee Member", "Linda Ann Wray, Committee Chair", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Member", "Mosuk Chow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Diabetes", "Longitudinal Research", "Cross-national comparison", "Physicla disability"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Graph Theory-Based Integration of Product Design and Supply Chain Design \n", "id": "10925", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4574", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Supplier selection is a critical part of supply chain management. Companies not only need to decide whether to \u201cmake\u201d or \u201cbuy\u201d, but they also need to be able to differentiate among potential suppliers in order to improve supply chain performance. These decisions should be integrated into the product design phase due to the bi-directional implications of product structure and the associated supply chain. \nDespite the importance of this bi-directional interaction, prior research on this topic focuses on the production stage, and only a few studies consider the supplier selection problem during product design and most of the studies start considering supply chain at the detail design stage, which is the latest stage of product design. Accordingly, there is a need to further explore this issue. \nIn this research, a graph theory-based methodology is presented to connect and integrate product design and supply chain design decisions. It begins with product design functions that analyzes the functional requirements of a product, generates design concepts, evaluates assemblability of design concepts and modularizes them as possible product architectures in a design repository. Product architecture serves as a bridge connecting product functions, components, and suppliers. Then, the supply chain performances of these design concepts are comprehensively analyzed under different levels of modularity and supply chain scenarios. \nWith actual data from an industrial company, this study shows that incorporating supply chain considerations during product design stage significantly improves the cost and time performance. In addition, the impact of different levels of modularity on supply chain performance is validated. Hence, the supply chain performance can be improved by re-modularization of the product or re-arrangement of part of the supply chain network. The centralized and decentralized supply chain scenario analyses provide insights to enterprises within the supply chain. As a result, the optimization of supply chain and product design can be simultaneously accomplished during the conceptual design stage. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4541], "author_name_tesi": "Chiu, Ming-Chuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Chiu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ming-Chuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gul Kremer", "Gul Kremer", "Vittaldas V Prabhu", "Richard Allen Wysk", "Dr Cari Bryant Arnold"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gul Kremer, Dissertation Advisor", "Gul Kremer, Committee Chair", "Vittaldas V Prabhu, Committee Member", "Richard Allen Wysk, Committee Member", "Dr Cari Bryant Arnold, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["modualrity", "supply chain design", "product design", "bi-level orogramming"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Phase Equilibria and Diffusion in HPMCAS-Acetone-Water System", "id": "26230", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11486", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Thermodynamic properties and diffusion behavior in the hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMCAS)-acetone-water system with temperatures below its glass transition temperature were investigated using the capillary column inverse gas chromatography (CCIGC) technique.

Investigation discovered that several of Pennsylvania\u2019s roads, constructed according to standard design and construction techniques and paved with Portland cement concrete, showed unpredicted, rapid friction (skid resistance) deterioration well before the expected time frame and these roads reached dangerously low levels of frictional characteristics. The objective of the PennDOT project\u2019s study was evaluation of the effect of blending Vanport limestone and other aggregates. The study evaluated the performance of different mortar fractions and aggregate concentrations to determine the effect of using coarse aggregate in the top mortar layer on pavement friction performance, as well as the effect of the substitution of different aggregates in place of Vanport limestone. \n\nTen slabs, cast for the PennDOT research project and for wear processing, underwent testing used Model Mobile Load Simulator (MMLS 3) with incremental test cycles, ranging from 15,000 to 360,000 cycles. Measurements collected from the conduced texture profile using the Circular Track Meter (CTM) formed the basis for a database for the Hilbert Huang Transform method to analyze the texture profile data. A Dynamic Friction Tester measured the coefficient of friction parameters at various speeds.\n\nThe Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) mathematical approach, created by Huang (2005) is a unique tool for processing surface texture profiles. The HHT method allows measured texture profiles to be analyzed without an underlying set of assumptions that confine the analysis to a finite set of basic functions. Based on the database gained from CTM in PennDOT\u2019s Vanport limestone project, the Hilbert Huang Transform method analyzed the texture-friction relationship. This method calculated Intrinsic Mode Functions. The amount of decomposed components, however, was sometimes inconsistent among test data. To adequately and uniformly describe the texture profile, this study selected four Base Intrinsic Mode Functions (BIMFs). Analysis of the new database obtained from the Hilbert Huang Transform method used regression statistics methodology with the values from the Dynamic Friction Tester (DFT). Additional investigation analyzed the correlation between BIMF and DFT parameters for each cycle. The analysis for the correlation between all BIMFs and DFT peak values use a 65km/h standard, and analyses included considering a correlation for BIMFs. \n\nAs shown in the analysis results, a strong relationship exists among BIMF functions and DFT coefficient of friction values. The correlation between BIMF and DFT parameters for each cycle is more significant than previous analysis results, and the best correlation appeared at 360,000 cycles. DFT peak values at 65km/h strongly relate to 4 BIMF parameters. BIMFs and Speed Number (Sp) values displayed a significant correlation with each other, as did Sp values significantly relate to one BIMF parameter. Three BIMF parameters were significantly correlated to F 60 values. Having observed stronger correlations among data than previous studies\u2019 data results, the HHT method might be a suitable alternative to conventional techniques.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1152], "author_name_tesi": "Cho, Choongwoo ", "last_name_ssi": "Cho", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Choongwoo", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Stoffel", "Shelley Marie Stoffels", "Zoltan Ivan Rado", "Mansour Solaimanian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Stoffel, Thesis Advisor", "Shelley Marie Stoffels, Thesis Advisor", "Zoltan Ivan Rado, Thesis Advisor", "Mansour Solaimanian, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hilbert Huang Transform"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "MULTILEVEL METHODS FOR THE GENERALIZED FINITE ELEMENT METHOD DISCRETIZATIONS", "id": "8327", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1636", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is focused on multilevel methods for generalized finite element method (GFEM) discretizations.

In particular, emerging ultrasonic guided waves techniques for advanced non-destructive evaluation (NDE) and structural health monitoring (SHM) applications aim for improved detection reliability and faster inspections. While the sensitivity of linear ultrasonics widely used for many conventional techniques is limited to defect sizes in the order of millimeters, nonlinear ultrasonics can provide opportunities to develop new techniques that enable detection of incipient micro-scale damage that precedes macro-scale cracks and delaminations. Thus, nonlinear ultrasonic guided waves are rapidly developing techniques that possess significant potential for early damage detection capabilities to be incorporated into emerging NDE and SHM techniques.\nThe goal of this dissertation is to investigate several key aspects of generation and reception of nonlinear guided waves in plates based on understanding wave mechanics and nonlinear physics. This dissertation begins by discussing a multi- element PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) sensor able to detect guided waves polarized as either Rayleigh-Lamb (RL) or shear horizontal (SH) modes and determine their wavelength. A uniaxial polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) film is employed and rotated \u00b145\u00b0 to enable the coupling between in-plane shear deformation and the electric displacement in the out-of-plane direction. The multi- element configuration guarantees the wavenumber-frequency analysis for modal decomposition. Accompanying numerical and experimental studies validate the outstanding advantages such a low-profile, low-mass, conformable, inexpensive sensor ideal for SHM and other applications.\nThe development of the new PVDF sensing method spurs investigation on its capability to detect localized fatigue damage in an aluminum plate with a nonlinear SH-SH guided wave interaction that results in another RL guided wave generation. A mode triplet (SH-SH-RL modes) is selected based on the theoretical formulation for mutual interaction of guided waves in plates and the corresponding mode selection criteria. The finite element simulations explore several numerical aspects of the associated wave propagation, interaction of the selected mode triplet, and mode identification. Laboratory experiments confirm second harmonic generation in an aluminum plate using the PVDF sensor by conducting frequency-wavenumber and other analyses, which are later used to detect localized fatigue damage in an aluminum plate with a new scanning technique.\nThe utility of PVDF is further extended to both actuation and reception of self- interacting second harmonic guided waves to detect fatigue damage accumulation in an aluminum plate subject to cyclic mechanical loading. A comb type dual PVDF transmitter is designed to selectively actuate finite amplitude symmetric RL waves that in turn generate second harmonics. Self-interacting S1-S2 mode nonlinear guided wave measurements from an aluminum plate with progressive, but invisible, fatigue damage demonstrates the excellent robustness and sensitivity of PVDF transducers as well as early damage detection capabilities of nonlinear guided waves before catastrophic failures.\nFurthermore, to facilitate advancing to studies of nonlinear guided waves in anisotropic and layered media, this dissertation also discusses second harmonic generation in composite plates from theoretical and numerical standpoints. A theo- retical framework to analyze second harmonic generation in transversely isotropic plates is presented. Conditions for internal resonance are derived, followed by expanded mode pair selection strategies. Then, finite element simulations are con- ducted to confirm the predicted generation of second harmonic in a unidirectional lamina and quasi-isotropic laminate.\nFinally, the importance of skew angles on the generation of cumulative second harmonics in composite plates is emphasized by investigating the selection of internally resonant mode pairs under the influence of skewing guided waves. The skew angle occurs when wave velocities are directionally dependent and it causes deviation of the energy velocity vector from the intended wave vector. Taking into account the wave skewing effect, the skew angle matching condition is discussed for selecting mode pairs in a transversely isotropic plate and a quasi-isotropic laminate. Numerical simulations revealed that the effect of skew angle mismatch can be significant for second harmonic generation in anisotropic media.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15835], "author_name_tesi": "Cho, Hwanjeong ", "last_name_ssi": "Cho", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hwanjeong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clifford J.

The longer the legacy fleet remains in service, the more likely fatigue cracks are to initiate and grow. Structural health monitoring (SHM) provides an economical way to maintain airworthiness of aging fleets. This work focuses on methods for monitoring fatigue cracks growing from multiple fastener holes in aluminum structures using ultrasonic guided waves so as to evaluate the remaining useful life of the structure. It examines the applicability of ultrasonic guided waves for a structure in between a simple laboratory experiment specimen and a complex real component. It considers a sparse array of transducers for the sake of less expense. Accordingly, five 12.7 mm-diameter fastener holes were introduced in an equally spaced manner in planar aluminum structures. These fastener holes serve as stress raisers, when sinusoidal tensile in-plane stress is applied so as to induce fatigue cracks at the edge of the holes. Ten 6.35 mm-diameter Piezoelectric Wafer Active Sensors (PWAS) were mounted in a pattern such that the scattering waves can be well detected as the crack grows although later analysis showed that six transducers would suffice. A Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model was built and analyzed to evaluate the most effective transducer pattern. Ultrasonic guided waves\u2019 signals were collected in through-transmission mode from all pairs of transmitters and receivers in the array by a data acquisition system at a predetermined interval. In order to detect, locate, and visualize the progress of the crack, the transmission coefficient was calculated and integrated into the Reconstruction Algorithm for Probabilistic Inspection of Damage (RAPID) technique. The RAPID technique was modified as necessary to remove the complexity of scattering caused by the multiple fastener holes based on the knowledge that a fatigue crack is anticipated to initiate along the centerline of the fastener holes. Two types of structures were tested: one is a plate with open holes and the other is a bolt-jointed structure. A fatigue crack, invisible to the eye, was detected and located in the bolted joint by sending ultrasonic guided waves across the joint.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2247], "author_name_tesi": "Cho, Hwanjeong ", "last_name_ssi": "Cho", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hwanjeong", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ultrasonic Guided Waves", "Fatigue Crack", "Fastener Hole", "Structural Health Monitoring", "Bolt Joint"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "sensory evaluation of french-fries fried in trans-fat free frying oils over production cycle", "id": "23637", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10819", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Deep fat frying is one of the popular cooking method due to unique taste of fried food and its convenient cooking process.

Among those, control of water amount in the fuel cell is the major bottle neck for achieving durable operation from sub-freezing temperature.  When the fuel cell is shutdown to a frozen state without proper removal of water, the pore structure of the porous media (diffusion media (DM) and catalyst layer) can be damaged due to volume expansion of the residual water, and catalyst layer can be delaminated from the membrane due to frost heave, leading to degradation of the fuel cell.  \nTo remove water from the cell after shutdown, a gas purge has generally been applied into the cell.  However, the common method of gas purge is just applied without much fundamental consideration of water removal.  Therefore, the conventional method (i.e., purge with nitrogen gas or air into both side of cell after cell shutdown) generally takes a relatively long time to remove water from the cell sufficiently, resulting in significant parasitic loss and reduced system efficiency.  Additionally in some case the purges can be conducted without control of the drying distribution, which causes the MEA to be degraded at an accelerated rate.  Requirements for adequate gas purge are as follows; it should be performed in short time without major parasitic loss, and it should selectively remove water from the porous media and channels without causing degradation of the membrane via over drying.  \nThese purge issues can be solved in part through fundamental understanding of water removal during purge.  The purge/water removal relationship should be understood in actual system to do optimize design, and those behaviors should be interpreted with a fundamental understanding of evaporative water removal in individual fuel cell components.\nIn the first part of this study, water removal behavior was investigated in a full sized fuel cell, and compared for various purge conditions.  With concurrent utilization of neutron radiography and high frequency resistance, membrane dryness could be compared along with water removal from the cell during purge.  The results showed gas purge could be performed while maintaining membrane durability by a controlled RH and flow rate condition for anode and cathode, respectively.  \nIn the second part of this study, the characteristic water removal of each fuel cell component and coupled effect of each component on evaporative water removal were investigated in a novel test cell.  The DM is known to store a significant fraction of the total liquid water, but quantitative fundamental research examining water removal behavior from DM is not yet available in literature.  Therefore, a fundamental study was conducted to characterize the water removal behavior of the DM with newly designed test rig.  Effects of purge flow rate, DM material properties, and flow field structure on water removal rate were investigated.  From this new fundamental understanding, an advanced purge method was proposed to achieve highly efficient and durable purge with reduced energy consumption.  The proposed protocol was validated experimentally with high resolution neutron radiography.  The fundamental and applied understanding in this study can be utilized to provide guidelines for an optimized purge protocol for actual systems.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3656], "author_name_tesi": "Cho, Kyu Taek ", "last_name_ssi": "Cho", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kyu Taek", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clinton Matthew Mench", "Matthew M Mench", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Seungjin Kim", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clinton Matthew Mench, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew M Mench, Committee Chair", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member", "Seungjin Kim, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer electrolyte fuel cell", "water management", "gas purge", "evaporation", "gas diffusion media", "neutron radiography"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Essays on Networks and Hierarchies\n\n\n", "id": "8485", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4403", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The thesis consists of four chapters.\n\nChapter 1 studies a repeated prisoner's dilemma game\nin a network where each agent interacts with his neighbors and cannot observe the actions of other agents who are not directly connected to him. If there is global information processing through a public randomization and global communication, it is not difficult to construct a sequential equilibrium which supports cooperation and satisfies a refinement, called stability, which requires that cooperation resumes after any history. Here, we allow agents to locally communicate with their neighbors and show that it is possible to construct such an equilibrium without global information processing. The role of local communication is to resolve the discrepancy of agents' expectations on their neighbor's future actions.\n\nChapter 2 considers the same environment as in Chapter 1, except that agents are not allowed to communicate with their neighbors but can observe a public randomization. By introducing a public randomization, we also can construct a sequential equilibrium for sufficiently patient agents, which supports cooperation and in which cooperation eventually resumes after any history. In addition, if there is a small possibility of mistakes, the equilibrium we construct can result in a more efficient outcome than the trigger strategy equilibrium, even though they give the same payoffs in the limit.\n\nChapter 3 studies a situation where agents can make a binding agreement both on the amount of local public goods and on the structure of networks through which they share the benefits of public goods. An agent enjoys the benefit of public goods produced by others who are (directly or indirectly) connected to him. There is a cost to maintain a link as well as to produce a public good. Since agents can choose the amount of public goods, the value of a link is endogenously determined. In the analysis, we first consider two different models of sequential bargaining games through which a contract on allocations is established. In the first model, we allow agents to propose a pure allocation and show that there is no symmetric stationary perfect equilibrium for sufficiently patient agents. In the second model, agents are allowed to propose a distribution on allocations. As a result, we find a symmetric stationary perfect equilibrium in which probabilistic choices are made on an equivalent class of allocations. Next, we characterize core allocations, which consist of a minimally connected network and an effort profile in which at most one agent does not produce the maximum amount of public good.\n\nChapter 4 studies the problem of organizational design in a setting where workers differ in their abilities and each worker is required to be monitored to prevent shirking. The need for monitoring workers generates a hierarchical structure in an organization, which can be represented as a rooted tree. The value of an organization is determined by the wage cost, the total number of productive tasks carried out, and the length of chain of supervision in the organizational hierarchy. In this setting, we construct and characterize an efficient structure of hierarchy which maximizes the value of the organization.

However, the continued advancement in aeronautics technology made it possible to design small supersonic business jets whose shaped, low-amplitude sonic booms are known to be less intrusive to the human hearing.  As there is enough evidence that these low-amplitude sonic booms are likely to be acceptable to human hearing outdoors, the focus of the sonic boom research is shifting towards their indoor acceptability.\nThis dissertation presents two numerical models that simulate the external pressure loading on building structures that are exposed to low-amplitude sonic booms.  Obtaining accurate external pressure loading information through numerical simulations is an important step in the study of sonic boom transmission into the interior of a building.  A three-dimensional \ffinite-difference time-domain (FDTD) model has been developed, which simulates several NASA field measurements of low-amplitude sonic booms conducted around distinct building geometries.  The FDTD model exhibits good agreement with the measurement data, accurately calculating the acoustic field near the building structures including the effects of diffraction.  The validation of the FDTD model for single and multiple building cases indicates that it can be extended for different building shapes or configurations of multiple buildings.\nConsidering the expected degradation of the accuracy of the FDTD model above its high-frequency limit, a hybrid model combining the low-frequency FDTD model result with a high-frequency ray-tracing model result is developed, using a complementary FIR filter pair and a time-alignment algorithm for the component waveforms.  The ray-tracing model, written by Riegel [1], is a high-frequency approximation that does not take into account the effects of diffraction.  The result\nof the hybrid model, tested for a limited number of simulation cases, points out some principal challenges in numerical modeling of the sonic boom induced pressure loading on buildings.  However, both the FDTD and hybrid models exhibit potential as a tool for an accurate prediction of the exterior pressure loading on buildings.\nThe dissertation also reports an interesting phenomenon named the \"building spiking effect\", in which the pressure waveforms recorded on the building wall directly exposed to the incident boom consistently show two ampli\fed peaks with a positive overpressure. A physical explanation of the building spiking effect is given, attributed to the frequency-selective nature of di\u000braction.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7207], "author_name_tesi": "Cho, Sang Terry", "last_name_ssi": "Cho", "middle_name_ssi": "Terry", "first_name_ssi": "Sang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor Ward Sparrow", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "Philip John Morris", "John Brian Fahnline", "Lyle Norman Long"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor Ward Sparrow, Dissertation Advisor", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Chair", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "John Brian Fahnline, Committee Member", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FDTD", "finite-difference", "numerical model", "sonic boom", "low-boom", "diffraction"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "HYDROGEL STABILIZED RESPONSIVE COMPLEX EMULSIONS", "id": "15015szc5433", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15015", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Emulsions, which are mixtures of immiscible fluids, have found widespread interest and use in fields and applications ranging from medicine, food, and cosmetics to optics.

Recently, a method to reconfigure the morphology of complex droplets containing hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon oils in water was demonstrated.1 Such droplets display unique physical and chemical properties rendering them applicable in areas such as sensors and tunable optics. However, emulsions are inherently not stable for extended time periods resulting in a critical obstacle for various applications. Traditional encapsulation approaches that are useful for droplet stabilization would render these hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon droplets non-responsive, thereby negating their most advantageous properties.

This growing interest in foreign language immersion programs is based on the fundamental rationale that foreign language learning proceeds more effectively if the target language is used for authentic and meaningful communication rather than being taught as a separate school subject with no or reduced communicative value (Cummins, 1998; Genesee, 1992). While research has contributed much to the discovery of second language development in immersion school programs, few studies have investigated to understand how foreign language learners learn target languages in a short immersion camp programs, or about the kinds of activities and projects in which learners participate in immersion camp programs and their connection to language learning.\n\nThis dissertation research centers on a unique Korean language-learning environment, i.e., an immersion camp in which high school students spend four weeks of summer in a rural village-like setting in the Upper Midwest of the United States (Korean Language Village). Participants interact using only Korean with their peers, camp staff, and instructors in a learning environment that reflects an eclectic nature of pedagogical approaches. It contains elements of traditional second language instruction coupled with immersion instruction. In this study, language socialization (Ochs 1990; Schieffelin & Ochs, 1986) was adopted as the theoretical framework along with ethnography of communication (Hymes, 1962) guiding this qualitative research with the primary concern for the ethnographic description of the community to which the learners belong and the analysis of interactive practices in which the learners recurrently participate for explicit instruction in the target language during learning group sessions.\n\nThe data consists of participant-observation, field notes, and 25 hours of interactional data collected from a focal learning group (one teacher and five learners). The analysis is divided into two parts. In the first part, a detailed ethnographic description of the Korean Language Village is presented, focusing on the key elements of constructing the learner-oriented community as well as the functions of learning group sessions in the community. The second part demonstrates how learners were taught grammatical structures with a project-based approach, which is defined as a \u201csocial practice into which students are socialized through a series of individual or group activities that involve the simultaneous learning of language, content, and skills\u201d (Slater, Beckett, & Aufderhaar, 2006, p. 242). While engaging in the projects, the learners used the target grammatical structures in different contexts of talk, and the learners showed their development in syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and interactional skills.\n\nOverall, this study indicates that language learning in this context can be characterized as a communicative approach in authentic contexts where the target language is used for daily practices, and the roles of explicit instruction are to assist learners to become more competent members in the community. This study has important implications for foreign language educators regarding the importance of learner community in which learners become valuable members through interacting with others in the target language as well as the roles of explicit instructions on language in second/foreign language learning.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5923], "author_name_tesi": "Cho, So-Eun ", "last_name_ssi": "Cho", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "So-Eun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Kelly Hall", "Joan Kelly Hall", "Karen E Johnson", "Celeste S Kinginger", "Jamie Myers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Kelly Hall, Dissertation Advisor", "Joan Kelly Hall, Committee Chair", "Karen E Johnson, Committee Member", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Member", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["language socialization", "Foreign language immersion camp", "second/foreign language learning", "project-based learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "POLYPHOSPHAZENES FOR POLYMERIC MICELLES AND OPTICAL APPLICATIONS\n", "id": "9737", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6055", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The synthesis and characterization of polymeric micelles and dendrimers based on polyphosphazene materials were systematically investigated. In addition, this dissertation is concerned with the novel polymeric optical waveguide materials based on the polyphosphazene cyclomatrix structure.\nAmphiphilic triblock copolymers (PN-PPG-PN) were synthesized with two hydrophobic poly[bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene] blocks linked to a central poly(propylene glycol) block. These were synthesized via the cationic polymerization of chlorophosphoranimines and coupling of these blocks to a diamine functionalized poly(propylene glycol) followed by macromolecular substitution. The micellar characteristics of these amphiphilic triblock copolymers were examined using fluorescence techniques, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. The critical micelle concentrations (cmcs) of PN-PPG-PN polymeric micelles determined by a fluorescence technique were in the range of 9.5-12.4 mg/L. The mean diameters of the micelles of the PN-PPG-PN polymeric micelles, measured by dynamic light scattering, were between 197-364 nm. \nHydrophobic block copolymers with adamantyl-polyphosphazene and polystyrene blocks were synthesized via the controlled cationic living polymerization of a phosphoranimine at ambient temperature. &#61538;-Cyclodextrins (&#61538;-CDs) were then complexed with the adamantyl side groups in aqueous media to generate amphiphilic block copolymers. These underwent micelle formation in an aqueous environment. The micellar behavior of these complexes was monitored using fluorescence techniques, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and dynamic light scattering. The critical micelle concentration of the adamantyl polyphosphazene-polystyrene block copolymer complexes was 0.925 mg/L. TEM imaging revealed spherically shaped micelles. A mean diameter of 193 nm was measured by dynamic light scattering. It was possible to control micelle formation by changing the amount of &#61538;-CD in the aqueous medium at constant block copolymer concentration.\nThree novel polyphosphazene-functionalized diaminobutane poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers have been prepared and investigated for their properties as prospective hydrophobic drug delivery systems. The solubilization and release properties of these functionalized dendrimers have been investigated by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy by using pyrene as a probe. The introduction of amphiphilic phosphazene groups at the external surface of the dendrimers affects the solubilization and guest release properties compared to the behavior of the parent dendrimers. The release of encapsulated guest molecules is triggered by the addition of sodium chloride solution. It has been established that these novel dendrimeric compounds exhibit useful protective and targeting properties. These properties render the new molecules promising candidates for salt-responsive controlled-release systems, possibly including prospective drug delivery applications.\nNovel cyclophosphazenes containing aryl trifluorovinyl ether functional units together with the corresponding perfluorocyclobutane (PFCB) phosphazene polymers have been synthesized and characterized. These polymers have desirable properties for low optical loss waveguide applications. The monomers used in this study were prepared from sodium 4-(trifluorovinyloxy)phenoxides and cyclophosphazenes with fluorinated alkoxy or aryloxy side groups. The resulting polymers, produced by 2&#960; + 2&#960; cyclopolymerization of the aromatic trifluorovinyl ether moieties, showed good chemical stabilities and high thermal stabilities (Td up to 330 \u00b0C). Tough and transparent thin films of these polymers were readily prepared by solvent-free processes using spin-coating of the monomers. By adjusting the ratio of monomers, the refractive index of the polymers could be controlled from 1.4528 to 1.5187 at 1550 nm, with exceptionally low birefringence of &#61508;n = 0 to 0.0003 &#61617; 0.0002. A propagation optical loss lower than &#8764;0.25 dB/cm at 1550 nm was determined from the polymer films, for the TE polarization by measuring the scattered light intensity along the slab waveguide length. Such good thermal and optical properties demonstrate that these novel PFCB-based phosphazene polymers are promising candidates for optical waveguide or optical device materials.\nAmphilic triblock copolymers with varying ratios of hydrophilic poly[bis- (methoxyethoxyethoxy)phosphazene] (MEEP) and relatively hydrophobic poly- (propylene glycol) (PPG) blocks were synthesized via the controlled cationic-induced living polymerization of a phosphoranimine (Cl3P=NSiMe3) at ambient temperature. A PPG block can function as either a classical hydrophobic block or a less hydrophobic component by varying the nature of a phosphazene block. The aqueous phase behavior of MEEP-PPG-MEEP block copolymers was investigated using fluorescence techniques, TEM, and dynamic light scattering. The critical micelle concentrations (cmcs) of MEEP-PPG-MEEP block copolymers were determined to be in the range of 3.7-16.8 mg/L. The mean diameters of MEEP-PPG-MEEP polymeric micelles, measured by dynamic light scattering, were between 31 and 44 nm. The equilibrium constants of pyrene in these micelles ranged from 4.7 &#61620; 104 to 9.6 &#61620; 104. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6048], "author_name_tesi": "Cho, Song Yun ", "last_name_ssi": "Cho", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Song Yun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock", "Harry R Allcock", "John V Badding", "Karl Todd Mueller", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock, Dissertation Advisor", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Chair", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dendrimer", "polymeric micelle", "polyphosphazene", "optical material"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Mobilization of Social Support in Caregivers of Dementla Patients\n", "id": "7381", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5803", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The characteristics of mobilization in five different types of social support among caregivers of dementia patients were examined in this study. The Pearlin\u00a1\u00afs stress process model and Andersen\u00a1\u00afs Health behavior model provided the theoretical basis for selecting sociodemographic variables, objective stressors, subjective stressors, and mental health outcomes. Five different types of mobilized social support included mobilized 1) informal instrumental support with patient help, 2) informal instrumental support with household chores, 3) emotional support, 4) formal service use, and 5) institutionalization. The data from the Caregiver Stress and Coping Study (Aneshensel, 1995) were used for the present study. The caregivers were followed longitudinally for five years with one year interval in between. During the five-year interview, caregivers were categorized into continuing care sample if they continued to provide care to their relatives at the time of the interview. If caregivers placed their relatives into nursing home at the time of the interview, caregivers were categorized into placement sample. When relatives passed away, caregivers then were placed into bereavement sample. The current analyses only used Time 1 and Time 2 data. Final sample of 452 caregivers at time 2 were used for this particular study. \n\nThe study first examined whether mobilization of social support occurred in response to the stressors and if so, whether the predictors were different for each type of social support. The study then examined the mediating effect of mobilized support on the relationship between subjective stressors and caregivers\u00a1\u00af mental health. Finally, the study attempted to analyze the moderating effect of mobilized support on caregivers\u00a1\u00af mental health under high subjective stressors. Results from the analyses indicated that not all types of social support showed mobilization in response to the stressors. The results also suggested that some types of social support such as formal service use remained stable over time. Finally, the results from the analyses demonstrated that mediating and moderating effects of mobilized social support differed depending on the type of social support.  \n\nConclusions were made based on the results of these findings. First, finding that not all types of social support were impacted in response to the stressors over time suggest that each type of mobilized social support has different characteristics. Secondly, it has been assumed that caregivers who experience higher stressors use more support over time. Hence, previously, the effect of social support had been investigated cross-sectionally based on this assumption although the findings were inconsistent. However, the finding that some type of social support especially the formal service use remains low contribute to the explanation why previous research may have shown the inconsistent findings.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5799], "author_name_tesi": "Cho, Soyeon ", "last_name_ssi": "Cho", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Soyeon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit", "David Manuel Almeida", "Dr Chalandra M Bryant", "Linda Ann Wray"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Chair", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Member", "Dr Chalandra M Bryant, Committee Member", "Linda Ann Wray, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["caregivers", "social support", "mobilization", "family caregiving"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "ANTECEDENTS OF ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN PRESCHOOLERS: THE INTERPLAY OF FEARFUL TEMPERAMENT, SLEEP REGULATION, AND MATERNAL PROTECTIVENESS", "id": "16054", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8141", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although children\u2019s regulatory skills (e.g. physiological, affective, attentional regulation) have been hypothesized to explain the longitudinal relations among temperamental characteristics, parenting, and anxiety symptom development, few studies have directly tested this proposition (Bosquet & Egeland, 2006; Degnan & Fox, 2007; Thompson, 2001). The present study examined observational and questionnaire data on 124 children and their mothers to test whether fearful temperament and maternal protective parenting behaviors may predict preschool-age sleep dysregulation. Sleep regulation\u2014encompassing emotion, attention, arousal regulation\u2014was examined as an intermediate developmental outcome that may be meaningfully related to early fearful temperament and later development of anxiety symptoms. The possible conditional indirect effects of fearful temperament on symptoms of separation anxiety and worry at kindergarten entry were also examined.\nContrary to the study hypotheses, the findings indicated that high levels of maternal protective behaviors predicted significantly fewer sleep dysregulation problems for temperamentally fearful children, whereas similar levels of protective behaviors predicted greater sleep dysregulation in children who were rated as less fearful as toddlers. Furthermore, although specific indices of preschool-age sleep dysregulation uniquely predicted anxiety symptoms at kindergarten entry above and beyond the prediction made by concurrent symptoms of anxiety at age 4, significant indirect relationship between fearful temperament and anxiety symptoms at kindergarten entry was not found.

Machines struggle to quickly process and make real time decisions based on image data. A fundamental design decision that holds significant implications to the vision system\u2019s operation, efficiency, performance, and overall quality is the image representation strategy within the system. In the mammalian visual pathway, the simple cells in the V1 stage of the primary visual cortex respond strongly to oriented edges to transform image information from light intensity values to a feature based representation. A bank of Gabor filters is widely used to model the receptive field profile of the simple cells as filter responses closely resemble the receptive field response. The resulting Gabor feature space is a biologically inspired form of feature based image representation that has proven to be extremely rich and effective for a wide variety of computer vision algorithms. \nHowever, Gabor feature extraction is a computationally intensive task. Yet, most of the applications that utilize the Gabor feature space require real time performance. Poor performance resulting from large quantity of computations involved with feature extraction have hindered systems from being real time. Often, the feature set is reduced to achieve acceptable performance. \nThe massively parallel network of neurons in the brain are well suited to perform the enormous amount of independent computations required for Gabor feature extraction while instruction based serial processing principles of the general purpose computer are not. Therefore, a different platform customized for the task and massively parallel in architecture is necessary.\nField Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) have emerged as the preferred hardware platform for a wide range of computationally intensive vision tasks.

It has many applications to biology, economics, industrial engineering, and so on. Independent censoring is one of the crucial assumptions in survival analysis. However, this is impractical in many medical studies. For example, in many medical studies, disease occurrence and dependent censoring exist simultaneously, where the presence of dependent censoring leads to the difficulty in analyzing covariate effects on disease outcomes. Such a data structure has been termed `semicompeting risks data'. \nMuch research have been performed on modeling semicompeting risks data. One approach to handle the dependent censoring is to use semiparametric accelerated failure time (AFT) model. This dissertation focuses on addressing restrictions on previous methodology of the semiparametric AFT model and provide solutions. \nIn the first part of the dissertation, we propose a new weighted estimator for the AFT model under dependent censoring. One of the advantages in our approach is that these weights are optimal among all the linear combinations of the previously mentioned two estimators. To calculate these weights, a novel resampling-based scheme is employed. Attendant asymptotic statistical results for the estimator are established. In addition, simulation studies, as well as an application to real data, show the gains in efficiency for our estimator. \nGoodness of fit procedures are essential tools for assessing model adequacy in statistics. While many authors have proposed goodness of fit tests for U-statistics of order 1, little has been developed for higher order U-statistics. In the second part of the dissertation, we develop a general theory and approach to goodness of fit techniques based on U-processes for the AFT model. Many of the examples will focus on U-statistics of order 2.  We propose goodness of fit tests for U-statistics of order 2 by using theoretical results from U-process theory. For numerical summary of hypothesis testing, a generalization of resampling approach adapted from goodness of fit tests based on U-statistics of order 1 is developed. Simulation studies are used to illustrate the proposed methods. \nIn many medical studies, estimation of treatment effects is often of primary scientific interest. As mentioned before, standard methods for evaluating the treatment effect in survival analysis typically require the assumption of independent censoring. In semicompeting risks framework, estimating treatment effect for the disease occurrence is difficult due to the dependent censoring. The approach to use semiparametric AFT model to adjust the dependent censoring requires an artificial censoring technique. However, when covariates are continuous and have large variability, this can lead to excessive artificial censoring resulting in numerically unstable estimates. In the third part of the dissertation, we propose a strategy for weighted estimation of treatment effect that adjusts for covariates. Weights are based on propensity score modeling of the treatment conditional on confounder variables. This novel application of propensity scores avoids excess artificial censoring caused by continuous covariates. Simulation studies and an application to data from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) are used to illustrate the methodology.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10896], "author_name_tesi": "Cho, Youngjoo ", "last_name_ssi": "Cho", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Youngjoo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Debashis Ghosh", "Debashis Ghosh", "David Russell Hunter", "Runze Li", "Christopher Jon Zorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Debashis Ghosh, Dissertation Advisor", "Debashis Ghosh, Committee Chair", "David Russell Hunter, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Committee Member", "Christopher Jon Zorn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bivariate Data", "Failure Times", "Perturbation Method", "Resampling", "U-statistics", "Causal Inference", "Observational Study"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "COMPETITION AND PROGRAM TYPE DIVERSITY IN THE OVER-THE-AIR TELEVISION INDUSTRY, 1943-2005\n", "id": "7907", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6826", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Competition and diversity are touchstones in media policy, but the relationship between them is not clear despite a great number of studies because even studies dealing with their relationship, did not measure the intensity of competition. \nThis paper investigates the relationship between market competition and program type diversity in the over-the-air television industry.

Cation exchange equilibria of Cs+ and Sr2+ and heavy metal cations such as Co2+ and Ni2+ with K-depleted phlogopite, K-depleted biotite, and K-depleted muscovite were conducted to evaluate their selective cation exchange properties. Na+\u00a1\u00e6 Cs+ exchange equilibria revealed that all K-depleted micas have high selectivity for Cs+ ion at low equivalent fractions of Cs+ in solid. The order of cation exchange for Cs+ ion was K-depleted phlogopite > K-depleted biotite &#8776; K-depleted muscovite. For 2 Na+\u00a1\u00e6 Sr2+ equilibria, K-depleted biotite had a high selectivity for Sr2+ ion. Studies of heavy metal cation exchange with K-depleted phlogopite and K-depleted biotite revealed that both the K-depleted micas have high selectivity for Co2+ and Ni2+ ions at low concentrations of these metal cations. Both K-depleted phlogopite and K-depleted biotite were found to show higher selectivity for Ni2+ ion than Co2+ ion. The d(001)-spacing of both Co-exchanged and Ni-exchanged micas increased to ~ 14 &Aring; at higher equivalent fractions of these metal ions in solid. \nIn addition, cation exchange mechanism and rate of Cs+ exchange was investigated using two different particle size (< 2 \u00a5\u00ecm and 20-2 \u00a5\u00ecm) fractions of K-depleted phlogopite. Kinetic results revealed that the 20-2 \u00a5\u00ecm particle size fraction of the K-depleted phlogopite took up more Cs+ ions than the <2 \u00a5\u00ecm particle size fraction. Elovich model described the kinetic data of the <2 \u00a5\u00ecm particle size fraction well, while the modified first-order model or parabolic diffusion model described those of the 20-2 \u00a5\u00ecm particle size fraction well. \nTopotactic cation exchange under hydrothermal conditions (at 200 oC) was explored as another alternate method to immobilize or fix radionuclides such as Cs+ and Sr2+ in the K-depleted biotite or K-depleted muscovite by forming mica-like hydroxylated phases. The K-depleted biotite treated with alkali cations produced anhydrous hydroxylated phases by topotactic exchange. The alkaline earth cations, however, produced hydrous hydroxylated phases with both K-depleted biotite and muscovite. \nAlso, weathering of K-depleted phlogopite, K-depleted biotite, and natural biotite under acidic hydrothermal conditions (3 N AlCl3 at 200 oC) was investigated to understand weathering mechanism and predict final weathering products of the micas. Studies of weathering showed that the order of transformation rate was K-depleted phlogopite > K-depleted biotite > natural biotite. The alteration pathway of K-depleted micas is as follows: K-depleted biotite \u00a1\u00e6 hydroxy-Al interlayered vermiculite \u00a1\u00e6 kaolinite.

Gram-negative bacteria account for nearly 40% of clinical mastitis cases resulting in an estimated loss to the U.S. dairy industry of $800 million per year. The research presented here focuses on host- mediated genetic and immunological factors involved in Gram-negative bacteria induced mastitis during the early phases of disease onset. Array analysis of mammary gland gene expression in a global context in response to E. coli is currently unavailable. A mouse mastitis model was used to study the transcriptional response in the mammary gland. This study identified potential candidate genes for susceptibility to bovine mastitis. We identified bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI) as a potential candidate gene for susceptibility to Gram-negative infections. Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified within the BPI gene sequence encoding for the N-terminal region of the mature protein that exhibits bactericidal and LPS-neutralizing activity. A polymorphism located at +61 (G/A) resulted in a non-synonymous amino acid substitution from glycine to serine. No significant association was found between the identified SNP-marker allele and their haplotypes with SCS for a sample size of eighty-five Holstein dairy bulls. \nCurrent therapeutic and prophylactic measures have marginal efficacy against mastitis. The potency of human and bovine BPI-derived synthetic peptides was evaluated for its bactericidal and LPS-neutralizing activity in biological fluids from the bovine. In this study, a 24 amino acid (aa) sequence synthetic peptide of human  (hBPIpep) and bovine BPI (bBPIpep) corresponding to domains 90-99 and 148-161 of both human and bovine mature BPI protein was found to exhibit 100% LPS-neutralizing activity at  100 \u00b5g/mL concentration. Complete bactericidal activity against E. coli was demonstrated in broth, serum and whey. However, only bacterial inhibitory activity was recorded in milk at the highest concentration tested (2 mg/mL). In the presence of EDTA (16mM concentration), a chelator of divalent cations, the hBPIpep exhibited complete bactericidal activity at the lowest concentration tested (10\u00b5g/mL). The other two bovine BPI peptides corresponding to amino acid 65-99 (bBPIpep-II) and 142-169 (bBPIpep-III) did not have any bactericidal activity. However, bBPIpep-III exhibited LPS-neutralizing activity equivalent to polymixin-B (concentration &#8805; 30 \u00b5g/mL). The human and bovine BPI peptides were tested for their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against clinical isolates of major Gram-negative mastitis pathogens. The innate immune response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied to determine whether the induction pattern to different Gram-negative bacteria is conserved in bovine mammary gland immunity. We show that the cytokine pattern induced by P. aeruginosa and E. coli are conserved with respect to systemic and local innate immune responses. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1142], "author_name_tesi": "Chockalingam, Annapoorani ", "last_name_ssi": "Chockalingam", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Annapoorani", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cindy E Mc Kinney", "Douglas D Bannerman", "Guy F Barbato", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss", "Eric Thomas Harvill", "Robert Paulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cindy E Mc Kinney, Committee Chair", "Douglas D Bannerman, Committee Chair", "Guy F Barbato, Committee Member", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss, Committee Member", "Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mastitis", "Gram-negative bacteria", "Single-nucleotide-ploymorphism", "Bactericidal/permeability increasing protein", "LPS-binding", "cytokines", "innate immune response"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Meditation as Leisure in America", "id": "15267", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7101", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A substantial amount of research has demonstrated that leisure can reduce stress, help people cope with stress, improve mood, and contribute to overall health and well-being (Iwasaki, 2010; Mannell, 2007; Orsega-Smith et al., 2004).  Similarly, meditation helps individuals reduce stress and alleviate anxiety and depression (Shapiro et al., 2005), it is cost-effective (Kabat-Zinn et al., 1992; 1994) and makes people more \u201cinsightful\u201d about life (Miller, et al., 1995).  The similarities between leisure and meditation suggest that a comparative analysis of them may provide deeper insights into the ways in which both can contribute to improved quality of life.  Moreover, since those who engage in meditation do so during discretionary or otherwise unoccupied time, thinking about meditation as a kind of leisure may be fruitful.  Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the nature of the meditation experience with the additional goal of determining if/and what experiences and outcomes of meditation are similar to and different from those of leisure. \n\tI used participant observation and in-depth interviews to study how individuals experience meditation and its outcomes. I collected data in the spring of 2011 with the Open Meditation Society at Penn State University and a Zen meditation group in central Pennsylvania.  I conducted interviews with 16 individuals, including a Buddhist monk, a priest, a teacher, and meditators. Also, in order to assist with study design, I did a pilot study with seven people in February 2009 and a second pilot study using participant observation with a meditation group during the spring and fall of 2010. I participated in the rituals, social events, and other activities with group members, facilitated free meditation sessions, observed them, took notes, held informal conversations and interviews, and conducted formal interviews in order to obtain information that would enable me to address my research questions.\n\tResults indicate that meditators experience stress reduction, spiritual health, self-actualization, flow, mood enhancement (emotion management), and quality of life enhancement, during both their leisure and their meditation. Therefore, meditation and leisure appear to provide individuals with similar outcomes.  However, the meditation experience for beginning and veteran meditators differed.  Inexperienced meditators reported that meditation can be hard work because they have to consciously concentrate, but doing rituals, praying, and meditating can still be calming and relaxing. They also enjoy the quiet time alone (just for themselves) because they always feel rushed. On the other hand, experienced meditators are interested in achieving higher level of freedom and complete relaxation from worries, thoughts and other external environments. They also focus on cultivating their minds by deep observation, and actively integrating meditation methods into their lives in both work and leisure. Nevertheless, the outcomes for both experienced and inexperienced meditators were similar.  This may mirror the experiences of individuals who are taking up a new leisure activity versus those who have been involved in an activity for and extended period of time.  This study employs a new lens through which to examine positive experiences and outcomes derived from meditation that renders it similar to leisure. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7092], "author_name_tesi": "Choe, Jaeyeon ", "last_name_ssi": "Choe", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jaeyeon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Garry Chick", "Garry Chick", "Edward Paul Durrenberger", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Careen M Yarnal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Garry Chick, Dissertation Advisor", "Garry Chick, Committee Chair", "Edward Paul Durrenberger, Committee Member", "Andrew Justin Mowen, Committee Member", "Careen M Yarnal, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Meditation", "Leisure", "Stress Reduction"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "HUWE1 Interacts with PCNA to Alleviate Replication Stress", "id": "13492kzc152", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13492", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The integrity of the genome relies on the accurate and faithful duplication of genetic information from a parental cell to its progeny during each cellular division.

Dynamic roughness involves small periodic perturbations to the airfoil surface in the form of discrete bumps along the span of the airfoil that have the ability to expand and contract at a specific frequency. \n\nAs part of this work, a mechanism for measuring the aerodynamic loads on airfoils was designed and validated for the low-speed wind tunnel at the Pennsylvania State University. \n\nA reciprocating mechanism for dynamic roughness actuation involving mechanical springs was proposed. Kinematic and dynamic analyses of the mechanism meeting the frequency requirement at higher Reynolds numbers were performed. It was observed that the mechanism would not function properly at the required frequencies. A rotating cam was proposed and designed as an alternative actuator mechanism to support fundamental research.\n\nApplication of dynamic roughness at ~74% chord, which corresponds to the separation point at stall, on a NACA 23012 airfoil failed to cause flow control. Part of the reason for this ineffectiveness was attributed to the stall characteristic specific to the NACA 23012. \n\nLater, the HTR1555 airfoil was chosen as an ideal airfoil for testing of dynamic roughness flow control due to its stalling behavior. Dynamic roughness with amplitude on the order of the local boundary layer thickness was applied at 55% chord from the leading edge. Three different cam shapes were tested. Tests at RC= 1,000,000 showed that the best cam shape resulted in maximum lift increment of 3.5%, without any delay in stall angle. Dynamic roughness cams with half this amplitude provided a lower increase in maximum lift. Tests with the same cam shape and amplitude at RC= 250,000 resulted in 4.5% increase in maximum lift. \n\nReplication of the experiments on the SM701 airfoil by the original investigator on which this work was largely based revealed that the reported effect on the behavior of the tufts due to the actuation of dynamic roughness was not due to the flow control caused by the physical dynamic roughness interacting with the boundary layer. Careful observations from the tests performed on the same airfoil and actuator used by the researcher who reported the original results pointed to acoustic excitation and/or vibration as the most probable cause of the observed flow attachment.  \n\nStatic vortex generators installed at 10% and 55% chord from the leading edge increased maximum lift by 35% and 14% respectively, much higher gains compared to dynamic roughness with comparable device heights.

In this thesis, a new\nhigher-order, free-wake method for rotor aerodynamic analysis is presented. The\nmethod uses elements of distributed vorticity to model the lifting surfaces and the\nassociated wake. The use of such higher-order spanwise elements ensures higher\nresolution compared to traditional filament-based free-wake analysis and does not\nrequire explicit vortex core modeling with a user-specified core size. Since the\nmethod uses a full-span, singularity-free, relaxed wake, it can resolve the effect of\non-blade, partial-span devices.\nThe free-wake method is validated in both hover and forward flight against\nmeasured data from well-documented experiments. In hover, the blade spanwise\nlift coefficients predicted by the free-wake analysis correlate well with the measured\ndata from the classic Caradonna-Tung model rotor experiment. The figure of merit,\nwhich is a measure of rotor efficiency, predicted by the present method is compared\nto that from the experiments conducted by Knight and Hefner, and the correlations\nare found to be quite good given the level of fidelity of this method, which is based\non potential flow theory. Rotor downwash, which is one of the most important\nconsiderations in rotor aerodynamic analysis, is predicted very well by the free-wake\nmethod when compared to measured data from a full-scale rotor test performed\nby Boatwright. These correlation studies provide a lot of promise as to the ability\nof the method in predicting the challenging aerodynamics of a helicopter rotor in\nhover.\nValidation studies are also performed to assess the accuracy of the free-wake\nanalysis in predicting downwash distribution in forward flight. Comparison of\nnumerical predictions with experimental data requires the rotor to be trimmed to\nthe conditions recorded in the experiment. To ensure this, the free-wake program\nis coupled with RCAS, a comprehensive helicopter analysis code developed by the\niii\nUS Army, in order to take advantage of its robust trim algorithm, among other\ncapabilities. The coupling is achieved through what is called a \u201cloose-coupling\nmethodology\u201d, whereby data is exchanged at the end of each coupling iteration or\n\u201cconverged\u201d rotor revolution. The downwash distributions predicted by the present\nmethod are compared to measured data for a model rotor at various advanced\nratios and thrust levels taken at the U.S. Army/NASA Langley Research Center\n(LaRC) facility. The free-wake method not only captures the important phenomena\nobserved in the experiments but the results also correlate well with the measured\ndata both in terms of magnitude and distribution. However, exceptions exist at\nthe highest advance ratio, where other methods also demonstrate poor correlations.\nThe results from this free-wake analysis are also compared to predictions by other\nexisting methods such as the University of Maryland free-wake method (UMDFW)\nand the vortex transport method (VTM). The present method yields results\ncomparable to the ones obtained using VTM, both of which correlate better with\nmeasurements than does UMD-FW.\nSensitivity studies show that the blade panel density and azimuthal time-step\nsize do not have a significant influence on the solution fidelity. In addition, free-wake\nanalyses with the azimuthal time-step size of \u0001  = 3o demonstrate the robustness\nof the method even with small time-steps, which is important for certain problems\nincluding rotor acoustics.\nThe thesis concludes with a discussion on the capability of the new free-wake\nmethod in resolving on-blade, partial-span devices.

Low-alkali boroaluminosilicate glasses are of interest for electrostatic energy storage since they have exceptionally high dielectric breakdown strength. Polymer dielectric such as polyethylene is the state-of-the art material for power transmission cables. Therefore, understanding their breakdown mechanisms and predicting their strengths are important theoretically as well as practically. This research focuses on understanding electrical conduction and space charge dynamics and their effects on electrical breakdown strengths. Conduction mechanisms for AF45 glass (one kind of low-alkali BAS) below 473 K were studied using Schottky, Poole-Frenkel, space-charge-limited current, and ionic hopping conduction mechanism. This study showed that the electrical conduction in low-alkali BAS glass is governed by a combination of two or more conduction mechanisms. Cation depletion phenomena during thermal poling of low-alkali BAS is an important precursor to dielectric breakdown. Numerical models including multiple charge carriers such as Na+, nonbridging oxygen ion, H3O+/H+, Ba2+ were developed to predict depletion widths under anode and electric field distribution within the glass. These numerical models accurately predicted widths of 2.1 \u00b5m, which were very close to the experimentally determined values. Moreover, the calculated electric field from a numerical model assuming Na+, H3O+/H+, Ba2+ migration could reproduce the experimentally determined electric field distribution. Numerical breakdown models were developed assuming electronic conduction or ionic redistribution and electronic breakdown for low-alkali BAS glass. The numerical model assuming electronic conduction predicted weakly thickness dependent breakdown strengths below 20 \u03bcm although it cannot predict strongly thickness dependent breakdown strengths above 20 \u03bcm. Another combined breakdown model assuming ionic redistribution and electronic breakdown predicted two distinct regions in AF45 glass for thickness dependence of breakdown strengths. Temperature dependence of breakdown strengths for AF45 glass predicted by the model assuming ionic redistribution and electronic breakdown agreed well with experimental results. This model showed that the change in breakdown strengths with temperature depended on the initial mobile sodium ion concentration. Thermal and electronic breakdown combined model was also applied to low-density polyethylene where electrical conduction is dominated by electrons and holes. Upon high electric fields these carriers move and produce space charges which enhance local electric field near the anode. This breakdown model predicts weakly thickness dependent breakdown strengths at room temperature which is also proved by other researchers. Furthermore, the relationship between the breakdown strength and voltage ramp rate can be reproduced in this model.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9182], "author_name_tesi": "Choi, Doo Hyun", "last_name_ssi": "Choi", "middle_name_ssi": "Hyun", "first_name_ssi": "Doo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan", "Clive A Randall", "Shujun Zhang", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Seong H Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan, Dissertation Advisor", "Clive A Randall, Dissertation Advisor", "Shujun Zhang, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member", "Seong H Kim, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dielectric breakdown", "low-alkali boroaluminosilicate", "electrical conduction", "thermal poling", "depletion width"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A CASE STUDY OF AN EARLY CHILDHOOD INCLUSIVE PROGRAM: TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND COLLABORATION\n", "id": "11256", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1869", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Today the issue of how young children with and without special needs play and learn together is getting more and more attention and support from a variety of sources. Although many educators and parents realize the importance of having effective early childhood programs that serve children with all abilities and their families, less clear are data about the essential knowledge and skills of early childhood practitioners needed to be effective. In addition, academic merger of the fields of Early Childhood Education (ECE) and Special Education (SPLED) has occurred in response to issues of inclusion; but the practical side to this merger is still not fleshed out very well (Darragh, 2007). This study focuses on what we might learn about a set of teachers in an early childhood inclusive program with regard to teacher professional development and collaboration of the teachers who come from diverse academic backgrounds.\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of six teachers concerning their professional development and collaboration within an early childhood inclusive program context. This study provides an empirical basis for examining the experiences that early childhood inclusive educators need to have in order to construct a deep and complex understanding of the early childhood knowledge base and skill sets required for providing meaningful educational experiences for children with and without special needs and their families. \nTo accomplish the research purpose and to describe the research questions appropriately, this study employed qualitative methodology to chronicle the experiences of six teachers in early childhood inclusive program in Northeastern U.S. This study adds to the literature on ECE and SPLED by in-depth interviewing of teachers in both ECE and SPLED; teachers come from different academic backgrounds. A focus was on professional development, and t collaborative team work for successful inclusion. \n              The participants for this study were two experienced general education teachers, three experienced special education teachers, and the Director of the program (N=6), all in inclusive classrooms in one program site . All participants had more than 5 years of teaching experiences in early childhood inclusive settings. Four data sources provided the basis for this study: 1) focus group interview, 2) individual interview, 3) observations, and 4) documents. With a lengthy and interactive process of data collection and processing that involved describing, analyzing, and interpreting data, the researcher synthesized perceptions of teacher professional development and collaboration from the participants\u2019 perspective. \n                Research questions specified four different interests regarding teacher professional development and collaboration in early childhood inclusive program: 1) How do teachers perceive inclusion and their roles in inclusive program?, 2) How does the program practice ECE and SPLED for teaching children with and without special needs?, 3) How teachers develop their knowledge and skills to meet the needs of children in all abilities?, and 4) How teachers collaborate with other members in the program?\nThough the analysis, the participants revealed the complexity of their practice of teaching in an early childhood inclusive program; and the themes identified were: 1) inclusion, 2) operations of ECE in relation to SPLED, 3) professional development, and 4) collaboration. \nEach theme generated several sub-themes which had strong connections with one another. The issues that participants experienced as teachers in early childhood inclusive program were: 1a) the definition of inclusion was different as a function of academic backgrounds-- whether they came with general or special education degree. 1b) teachers play two different roles depending on children\u2019s abilities-- developmental roles for children with special needs and general classroom role for typically developing children. This finding has implications for teacher preparation program in ECE and SPLED. 2) ECE and SPLED practice in the program was not balanced well but inclined more to SPLED approach, 3) professional development of teachers was done in two different ways: teacher preparation program, and in-service training. In-service training can be categorized in two types: (a) attending conferences or workshops outside of the setting, and (b) sharing knowledge and skills with other teachers in the setting, and this process overlapped with the way teachers collaborate each other. 4) teachers collaborated in diverse contexts and methods: in classrooms, playgrounds, teachers\u2019 room and even the hall way formally and informally. \nCollaboration methods that the participants described were the meetings, mentor system, peer observation, emails, chatting, and face book. These are all different ways to share knowledge and skills that may not otherwise be held in common across all the teachers who are from different academic backgrounds and in-service experiences.  Note also, their differences sometimes caused conflicts between teachers but they always tried to solve as soon as possible employing various strategies made possible by being in the same program work place.\nData-based assertions are given in conclusion, and the implications of these assertions.  In addition, recommendations for future study are made. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1852], "author_name_tesi": "Choi, Eunjung ", "last_name_ssi": "Choi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Eunjung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr James Johnson", "James Ewald Johnson", "Vivian Yenika Agbaw", "David Lee", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr James Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "James Ewald Johnson, Committee Chair", "Vivian Yenika Agbaw, Committee Member", "David Lee, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["inclusion", "teacher professional development", "teacher collaboration", "early childhood education", "early special education", "pre-service training", "in-service training"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Towards a Robust Characterization of Material Damage Evolution via Linear and Nonlinear Ultrasonic Guided Wave Features", "id": "14238gwc5041", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14238", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Guided wave mode selection, which considers the application, structure, material properties and geometry, is crucial for defect dectection and characterization. This requires understanding of linear and nonlinear elastic guided wave propagation within a waveguide and the interaction with inhomogeneous features or localized discontinuities within the waveguide. Some aspects towards characterization of defects and material damage evolution via linear and nonlinear ultrasonic guided wave features are presented.\n\tNondestructive quality assurance testing methods are limited for thick carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) structures and have poor resolution for detects such as out-of-plane wavy plies. As one example of a linear guided wave method, a portion of my work involved the numerical investigation, via Frequency Domain Finite Element Method (FDFEM), on the response of a few ultrasonic guided wave modes after interaction with out of plane wavy defects in thick CFRP. The analysis identified a guided wave mode and frequency combination that exhibited greater sensitivity than lower order modes and frequency pairs to interaction with the inhomogeneous or localized discontinuity of geometry and material properties. \nWhile linear elastic guided waves are suitable for detection and characterization of inhomogeneous macroscale features, we are also interested in techniques that can provide earlier detection. Nonlinear ultrasonics has the potential to be used to characterize microstructural evolution, which can ultimately enable earlier remaining life prediction and improve condition-based maintenance of structures. The goal of the conducted work was to improve understanding of the interactions between nonlinear ultrasonic guided waves and evolving microstructure features, and to determine an experimental technique sensitive to damage states prior to when macroscale damage is visible. Experiments have been conducted to investigate the sensitivity of the 3rd harmonic, resulting from self interaction of one primary wave or two-wave mixing to localized monotonic tensile deformation and fatigue damage of aluminum plates, using magnetostrictive transducers to excite shear horizontal waves in plates and axisymmetric torsional T(0,1) mode in pipes. Theoretical investigations provide experimental guidelines and offer some insights for interpreting results from experiments using those nonlinear ultrasonic techniques. Damage of interest are the following: ratcheting induced by creep-fatigue in Inconel 617 thin wall tubing and fatigue damage in aluminum alloy and Inconel 718 plates. \nNonlinear guided wave theory was used with the Semi-Analytical Finite Element Method, to consider second and third harmonic generation within a finite width plate. With the additional geometric boundaries of a finite width, the dispersion analysis reveals wavestructure profiles dependence through the width direction and many additional modes can exist compared with planar guided wave propagation. Calculation of power flux of mode combinations that exhibited phase matching, was able to determine that additional cumulative higher harmonic modes can be generated compared with that of planar wave guides.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15030], "author_name_tesi": "Choi, Gloria W", "last_name_ssi": "Choi", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Gloria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden III", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden III", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Parisa Shokouhi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden III, Dissertation Advisor", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden III, Committee Chair", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Member", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Parisa Shokouhi, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["guided waves", "nonlinear guided waves", "frequency domain finite element", "composite", "metals", "pipes", "plates", "semianalytical finite element method", "nonlinear generation within finite width plates", "nonlinear guided wave generation", "third harmonic", "second harmonic", "higher harmonic", "mutual interaction", "self interaction", "wave mixing", "CFRP", "kink", "marcelling", "out of plane ply waviness", "fatigue", "creep-fatigue ratcheting", "microstructure", "inhomogeneous damage"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Creep-fatigue-ratcheting Behavior of Haynes 230 via Isothermal Multiaxial Experimentation", "id": "19941", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8673", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tHaynes 230 is a Ni-Cr-W-Mo-C alloy with a good combination of mechanical properties and oxidation resistance at high temperatures. It is one of the materials in consideration for the intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) tubing of the very high temperature reactor design, which is one of the next generation nuclear plants (NGNPs) and is intended to be operated around 800-1000\u00baC. At such high temperatures with this application, the structure will experience creep and low cycle fatigue damage interaction. Two corresponding material responses of interest are the ratcheting damage (cyclic strain accumulation) and cyclic hardening-softening responses with nonproportional multiaxial loading. Ratcheting is the progressive plastic deformation that occurs with certain cyclic loading until failure. Cyclic stress hardening-softening responses can reveal changes in the resistance to material deformation due to cyclic strain loading, and are generally influenced by loading history, loading amplitudes, and microstructure. Varying these loading conditions and temperature can result in different dominant damage mechanisms. After understanding the material responses and damage mechanisms, operating conditions can be established for routine maintenance to occur prior to when predicted failure or excessive deformation takes place. \n\tSeveral multiaxial fatigue isothermal experiments were conducted on Haynes 230 thin wall tubular specimens via axial-torsional loading. Influence of temperature and non-proportionality of the cyclic loading path is investigated with two types of experiments. Test temperatures carried out for both sets are the following: 23, 649, 760, 871, 927 and 982\u00b0C.  One experiment type (Group A) involves observing the ratcheting-creep-fatigue life, where the loading path is triangular symmetric shear strain cycling with a steady axial stress. The resulting axial strain exhibits ratcheting, while the shear stress response exhibits cyclic hardening/softening due to the shear strain cycling. The second experiment type (Group B) loading path incorporates the following: (1) axial strain cycles, (2) 90o out-of-phase sinusoidal axial-shear strain cycles, and (3) axial strain cycles. Both the axial stress and shear stress exhibits cyclic hardening/softening/stable trends, with the shear stress cyclic response only present during segment (2). Based on the cyclic stress responses of both experiment types and the ratcheting rate of Group A experiments, some of the tests can be grouped based on similar trends. \n\tThe greatest extent of cyclic stress hardening occurred with the test temperature at 649\u00b0C for Group A and B loading paths. Both test temperatures 649\u00b0C and 760\u00b0C exhibit low axial ratcheted strains less than 0.010 m/m for Group A. Higher test temperatures 871\u00b0C and 927\u00b0C exhibit ratcheting trends similar to primary and steady-state creep and accumulated ratcheting strains more than 0.040 m/m. Cyclic stress softening was dominant in test temperatures 871\u00b0C and 927\u00b0C in Group A and in test segments (1) and (3) with Group B experiments. On the other hand, initial cyclic stress hardening was apparent in Group A and B experiments for test temperatures 649\u00b0C and 760\u00b0C. To understand the diverse failure modes exhibited in the Group A experiments microscopy should be performed in the future.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8547], "author_name_tesi": "Choi, Gloria W", "last_name_ssi": "Choi", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Gloria", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Ivica Smid"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Thesis Advisor", "Ivica Smid, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["creep-fatigue", "ratcheting", "cyclic softening", "cyclic hardening", "elevated temperature", "Haynes 230", "nickel based superalloy"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Communication-Driven Coscheduling in Clusters\n", "id": "6776", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2090", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The availability of high bandwidth and low-latency networks,\nsupported by efficient user-level communication \nprotocols,\nhas made High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters an attractive and cost effective \nalternative to traditional multiprocessor systems.\nOn any such parallel computing platform, \noptimally scheduling processes of a parallel job onto various \nnodes of the system has always been a challenging problem. \nThe proposed scheduling techniques in clusters span from simple batch scheduling\nand native local scheduling \nto more sophisticated techniques like gang scheduling \nor communication-driven coscheduling.\n\n\nUnlike batch and gang schedulings, all prior studies on communication-driven \ncoscheduling techniques were conducted  on  non-dedicated clusters.\nThus, the overall objective of this thesis is to design a new coscheduling technique\nthat is scalable, simple and portable, \nand should provide better performance than other scheduling techniques in a dedicated cluster.\nIn this context, we have investigated three related issues in this thesis.\n\nFirst, we propose a generic framework to provide a unified interface for implementing\nany scheduling technique on a cluster.

In order to investigate adolescents\u2019 social talk about prevention program, this dissertation includes two studies that focus on 8th graders in one rural middle school (N =185). \nStudy One provides a conceptualization of social talk in relation to prevention programs and operationalizes it through adolescents\u2019 social networks. Participants were eighth-grade students receiving keeping it Real (kiR), a middle school substance-abuse prevention program. The findings showed that students engaged in both positive and negative social talk about kiR. In addition, students\u2019 social networks were associated with social talk: Students with higher friendship centrality were more likely to have higher social-talk indegree centrality, indicating that youth who most classmates considered friends were reported as speakers of positive social talk on kiR. Also, social talk was associated with important program outcomes. Youth who talked positively about kiR tended to report anti-substance personal norms. On the other hand, those who engaged in negative social talk appeared to have pro-substance personal norms. \nStudy Two explored subgroups based on adolescents\u2019 patterns of social talk and social relationships.

We provide a general strategy for constructing confidence regions in a real separable Hilbert space using hyper-ellipsoids and hyper-rectangles. We then propose specific implementations that work especially well in practice. They provide powerful hypothesis tests and useful visualization tools without relying on simulation. Next, we demonstrate the negative result that nearly all regions, including our own, have zero-coverage when working with empirical covariances. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating confidence regions by showing that the distance between an estimated region and the desired region (with proper coverage) tends to zero faster than the regions shrink to a point, and call this phenomenon ghosting. We illustrate these methods in a simulation study and an application to diffusion tensor image of  fractional anisotropy. \n\nIn Chapter 3, we use hypothesis tests developed in Chapter 2 to enhance distribution goodness-of-fit tests based on the empirical cumulative distribution function, ECDF. Other than simply using ECDF as the random function whose functional is to be used as the test statistic, we propose other transformations of a random sample on $R^n$ into a function on $L^2[0,1]$. This approach leads to a multitude of distribution goodness-of-fit tests with combinations of different functionals from Chapter 2. Many of them beat commonly used ECDF-based tests like Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS), Cram\\'er-von Mises (CVM), and Anderson-Darling (AD) in many scenarios. We especially propose a few of them since they provide sufficient power in most of the scenarios while AD test -- which is considered to be the best ECDF based test -- does fail in some.\n\nIn Chapter 4, we consider the confidence regions for the regression coefficients when the explanatory variable is a near unit-root AR process. We take test-inversion approach, i.e., inverse the hypothesis tests, to find a proper confidence region for such regression coefficients. While proper confidence intervals for the AR coefficient itself have been available through test-inversion approach, those for regression coefficients on the AR process have not. We propose methods to construct proper joint and marginal confidence regions for the regression coefficients and the AR coefficient using test-inversion approach and Tukey's halfspace depth.

Although on-line discussion has been used with these expectations for learning benefits, the actual effects are unclear. Meaningful discussion can be initiated when learners raise thoughtful questions or provide critical feedback; however, generating effective questions requires a certain level of domain knowledge and metacognitive skills of the question-askers (Dillon, 1986; Miyake & Norman, 1979; Palincsar & Brown, 1984; van der Meij, 1990; Wong, 1985). Unfortunately, novice learners who begin to explore a new area are often limited in those metacognitive skills (Land, 2000; Garner & Alexander, 1989), so they may experience difficulties in generating meaningful interactions. In cases where simple question-answer cycles are employed in a discussion, learners may not benefit from the interactions in a way that enhances effective knowledge construction.<br><br>\n\nThis study proposes a peer-challenge support framework intended to facilitate effective peer interactions in on-line discussion and thus enhance learning. This framework assumes that novice students who lack domain knowledge and metacognitive skills can be supported in generating meaningful interactions at an early stage of learning (King & Rosenshine, 1993; Palincsar & Brown, 1984). In turn, the resulting questions and feedback can enhance peers' metacognition, such as reflecting and monitoring, which can allows them to refine and restructure their understanding (Piaget, 1985; Webb & Palincsar, 1996).<br><br>\n\nThus the purpose of this study was to test this peer-challenge support framework by investigating the effects of providing externalized, on-line support for generating effective peer-challenges during on-line small group discussion, thereby enhancing learning in college students. On-line peer-challenge support included descriptions of what to do and generic and domain-specific examples of questions.<br><br>\n\nA field experimental time-series control-group design was employed as a mixed model for the research design. Thirty-nine students from an on-line introductory class on turfgrass management offered by a large northeastern land-grant university participated in the study. The participants were randomly assigned to a small group of four to six members. Then those small groups were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from five successive sessions of on-line small group discussion, ten sessions of open-ended essay exams, three sessions of multiple-choice exams, an on-line survey, and a telephone interview (of four volunteers) throughout a sixteen-week semester.<br><br>\n\nThe quantitative results revealed that on-line peer-challenge guidance helped learners to generate significantly more challenges. However, the guidance did not improve the quality of challenges, further interactions, and learning outcomes. The increased quantity of challenges alone might not be sufficient to improve meaningful interactions. Based on the survey data, possible reasons for the failure of showing the guidance effects on learning might be the following: students\u2019 limited use of the guidance, their relatively high level of prior experience, and a small sample size. <br><br>\n\nThe qualitative results based on the interview data were consistent with the peer-challenge support framework. The results verified that students tended to experience difficulties in generating challenges for their peers when they perceived a lack of knowledge. Importantly, they perceived that the use of on-line guidance helped them to improve their questions in both quantity and quality when they had difficulties in generating challenges. Furthermore, the students who received meaningful challenges from their peers tended to experience cognitive dissonance which triggered them to reflect upon their understanding, to articulate their lack of knowledge, and to seek necessary information until they built up enough knowledge to be able to generate satisfying answers. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2452], "author_name_tesi": "Choi, Ikseon ", "last_name_ssi": "Choi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ikseon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Francis M Dwyer Jr.", "Susan M Land", "Alfred J Turgeon", "Richard Alan Carlson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Francis M Dwyer Jr., Committee Member", "Susan M Land, Committee Chair", "Alfred J Turgeon, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Carlson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["turfgrass management education", "online peer learning", "online peer questioning strategies", "online discussion strategies", "online collaborative learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF TEACHERS AT A LIFELONG LEARNING INSTITUTE: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY", "id": "7613", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2450", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to investigate how older adults described their peer teaching experiences at a Lifelong Learning Institute (LLI), thereby providing a holistic view of the peer teaching experiences of older adults.

In this thesis, the suggested RFID system in the blood inventory management is associated with temperature sensors to monitor the condition in which blood over its life cycle. The temperature is recognized by the sensors and recorded on the RFID tag of the blood bag. The recorded temperature history can be used for identifying whether a blood unit is being exposed to proper temperature failing which it can deteriorate. The real-time blood information offered by the RFID system could influence the daily blood inventory level and order quantity. \nThe effectiveness of the proposed RFID system for blood supply chain is validated by modeling a simulation because as it is hard to obtain optimal solution reflecting the dynamic condition in blood supply chain.

Moreover, the demand for the blood units generally outruns the supply. So, it is important to use and manage blood units efficiently. A community blood bank normally struggles to distribute the blood units based on the demand at each hospital under its geographical reach in fair a manner, keeping shortage as low as possible. The community blood bank should assign blood units through a balanced assignment strategy. Hospitals strive to secure blood units through an efficient ordering policy through which they can fulfill orders, minimize wastage and shortage.  Each of these institutions - hospitals and blood banks have their own goals, are autonomous in decision making and exemplify a multi agent system.\nGiven the conflicting yet collaborative nature of the objectives, this research addresses the issue of generating optimal blood unit assignment policies for the blood bank and optimal ordering policies for hospitals working in a collaborative manner. We develop methods for communication between hospitals and blood banks. We formulate and solve for optimal ordering policies for hospitals and assignment policies for community blood banks. From this understanding we suggest two ordering policies to fulfill the shortfall to test whether the current ordering policies are appropriate or not.\nTo compare the effectiveness of optimal solutions, we build a multi-agent based simulation model in NetLogo and study different scenarios and the effectiveness of optimal solutions generated.

So, there is little information on how a visitor interacts with the works of art, what elements influence the interpretive processes of a visitor, what messages the museum presents to a visitor, or how a visitor internalizes or rejects those messages. In this context, this study investigated my experience as a visitor at the exhibition spaces of the museums in order to explore how the art museum\u2019s narrative influenced my interpretive experiences and also how I responded to the specific contexts of museum narratives when I interpreted a work of art. Namely, I investigated how the museum\u2019s narratives and my narratives can conflict, resist, and compromise each other. \n\nAs a methodology to pursue this investigation, I incorporate an autoethnography, so that the research text emerges from my bodily standpoint. To explore the multi-layered intersection of the museums\u2019 narratives and my narratives, this study investigated 1) what narratives the museums made available to me and what my narratives were when I visited the three museums with my family and individually; 2) what strategies I used to negotiate my meaning-making processes; and 3) how I was transformed through the negotiation processes. \n\nAs a result, I discovered that there are three types of narratives at the intersection of the two narratives\u20141) the at-a-glance narrative, 2) the exhibitionary narrative, and 3) the hidden narrative. Developed from the at-a-glance narratives through exhibitionary narratives up to the hidden narratives, these narratives evolved as a spiral, re-inviting each other, and finally revealed their substance into its third stages\u2014hidden narratives\u2014 when I revealed myself through investigation into my own folk psychology\u2014my lived experience such as my behaviors, my working belief, my assumption, and my deep-rooted painful memories. In particular, findings articulated through hidden narratives demonstrated how vague, incomplete, and inarticulate ideas, thoughts, and feelings residing at the stages of at-a-glance narratives and exhibitionary narratives actually had impacts on the interpretive experiences of a visitor in very subtle ways. Revelation into undercurrent but inarticulate emotions associated with interpretive experiences shows how a visitor is frustrated and encouraged, thereby implying ways to help visitors get more opportunities toward positive experiences. \n\nAs another finding through this autoethnographic investigation, I identified four strategies responding to the narrative of museums, when I was in troubling situations. These strategies for negotiation are 1) passive resistance, 2) active inquiry, 3) subverting, and 4) disguising. This finding of the four strategies demonstrates that a visitor is not a passive person toward troubling museum\u2019s narratives but an active agent to control a troubled scenario in her own ways. It also shows that the museum\u2019s narratives and a visitor\u2019s narratives do not need to be considered as separated, but permeated and negotiated, when a visitor interacts with works of art in a museum. \n\nOne available way for me to be an active agent was through narrative-making, which enabled me to be interested in my lived experience such as my interests, my concerns, and my deep-rooted memories. The power released through my revelation, as a result, enabled me to transform myself into a critical visitor who could read a hidden curriculum of the museums in the name of hidden narratives and helped me build more interests in looking at art works. \n\nThis study into the negotiation between museum\u2019s narratives and a visitor\u2019s narratives will provide museum professionals with an alternative picture of the interpretive experience of a visitor, thereby building in-depth understanding on cognitively, emotionally and socio-culturally diverse visitors and creating conceptually and physically empowered space in museums. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5596], "author_name_tesi": "Choi, Sunghee ", "last_name_ssi": "Choi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sunghee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Stankiewicz", "Mary Ann Stankiewicz", "Christine M Thompson", "Charles Richard Garoian", "Gregory John Kelly"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Stankiewicz, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Ann Stankiewicz, Committee Chair", "Christine M Thompson, Committee Member", "Charles Richard Garoian, Committee Member", "Gregory John Kelly, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["narrative", "interpretation", "museum pedagogy", "museum education", "identity", "museum's narratives", "visitor's narrative", "narrative identity", "empowerment"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Consumers' propensity of post fake online reviews", "id": "27304", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12090", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As the influence of online reviews on consumers increases, some companies ask people to write fake reviews, of their businesses or those of their competitors, and offer compensation in return.

Specific market needs include producing reliable and voltage sag-free power in a manner that is less disruptive to the environment as well as the ability to supply power where it is too expensive to string power lines. Fuel cells will start out as a high-cost technology, supplying electricity (and heat) to these niches and gradually become more attractive to mainstream electricity users as they improve in capability and decrease in cost.\nThe Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) stack dynamic model was developed to analyze a spectrum of dynamic responses. A simplified process flow diagram of the fuel cell power plant is presented. The massive parallelism, natural fault tolerance, and implicit programming of neural network (NN) computing architectures suggest that they may be good candidates for implementing real-time controllers for complicated, nonlinear dynamic systems. To reduce the complexity of the NN model, a fuel cell power plant can be divided into three subsystems. With fewer weights for each NN model, the random influence on the fuel cell model can be lowered.\nA new concept of an intelligent setpoint reference governor (I-SRG) using a heuristic algorithm will be developed to find the optimal setpoints based on system constraints and performance objectives. The NN Identification system realizes an adaptive NN identifier for the control of the MCFC.

That can give rise to better understand the generation and transport processes of ionic carriers in these polymers. On the practical side, the fundamental performance characteristics make it possible to optimize the design of ion-containing polymers for advanced devices. We studied dielectric properties and ion conduction of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) based polyester copolymer ionomers, with and without crown ether, using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. Addition of crown ether to PE600-0.5Li enhanced ionic conductivity. A physical model of electrode polarization enabled the ionic conductivity to be separated into conducting ion mobility and conducting ion concentration. The formation of Li-complex with crown ether causes a large increase in the static dielectric constant as well. The increase of the static dielectric constant boosts the number density of conducting ions, and this has the largest contribution to increased conductivity. In addition to the dielectric relaxation spectroscopy measurement, we suggested that a Hall Effect measurement may be able to directly measure both number density of conducting ions and their mobility even though the method has only been extensively used for the characterization of classical semiconductor materials. We defined and discussed fundamental equations of d.c. and a.c. Hall effect.

One example is the study of ion transport in ionomers which are polymers with one type of ion covalently bonded to the chain, allowing only the unattached counterions to move rapidly in response to an applied electric field.  Since designing ionomers for facile ion transport is a great challenge, it is necessary to investigate structures, dynamics, and ionic interactions, giving rise to better understanding of the generation and transport processes of ionic carriers in ionomers.  Therefore, the goal of this dissertation is to understand in detail the structure-property relations of single-ion conductors through morphological, electric, dielectric, and mechanical measurements.  \nPolymerizable imidazolium-based ionic liquids and their polymers were characterized to study the effect of different pendent structures and different counterions on ionic conductivity, dielectric constant, and morphology.  The larger counterions (Tf2N-) display higher ionic conductivity and mobility than the smaller counterions (PF6- or BF4-), owing to a lower glass transition temperature, as anticipated by ab initio calculations that show that the imidazolium cation is less prone to aggregation with Tf2N- counterions than with PF6- or BF4- counterions.  This is also observed by rheological measurements, as the terminal relaxation time increases with decreasing size of counterions, attributed to the increase of ionic interactions.  The diethyleneoxy units on the imidazlium cation afford higher mobility than the butyl or dodecyl terminal N-substituents, for both monomers and polymers, owing to a lower binding energy between the imidazolium cation and the counterions.  All monomers and polymers studied exhibit two dipolar relaxations, assigned to the usual segmental motion ( ) associated with the glass transition and a lower frequency relaxation ( ), attributed to ions rearranging.  Both   and   processes are strongly coupled with the ionic conductivity from the observation of a common Vogel temperature and BNN correlation.  From the analysis of the static dielectric constant using the Kirkwood   correlation factor, the dipoles in conventional ionic liquids prefer antiparallel alignment ( ), whereas the dipoles in the larger ionic liquid monomers show   of order unity.  The ionomers consistently exhibit around 2 times higher static dielectric constant than their monomers, suggesting the polymerization encourages synergistic dipole alignment, resulting in  .  X-ray scattering shows that the longer (n-dodecyl) tail caused strong ion aggregation over the whole temperature range studied, while the shorter (n-butyl) tail promoted very little ionic aggregation, with a significantly larger dielectric constant that agrees reasonably with the Onsager prediction.  \nImproving ion solvation and ionic conductivity was investigated in polysiloxane-based single-ion conductors containing weak-binding borates and cyclic carbonate side chains with plasticizing poly(ethylene glycol) with Mn =  600 g/mol, PEG600, whose ether oxygens can coordinate with cations for the effective dissociation of ionic aggregates through ion-dipole interactions.  As PEG600 is added, the conductivity systematically increases by three orders of magnitude, compared to the host ionomer.  A reduction in Tg with increasing PEG600 content boosts ion mobility, as observed by the analysis of electrode polarization.  Further, the PEG600 ether oxygens lower the activation energy of simultaneously conducting ions, significantly increasing conducting ion content by 100X, suggesting that ion aggregates observed in the host ionomer are homogenized by PEG600, which is directly reflected through an initial large increase in dielectric constant as PEG600 is added.  \nConsequently, understanding the basic properties of single-ion conductors such as morphology, ion conduction, concentration of charge carriers, their mobility, and dielectric constant can provide useful insights for the design of advanced ion-containing polymers for battery membranes, actuators, and electromechanical sensors.  In particular, this study should lead directly to improve the existing models for counterion motion in single-ion conducting ionomers and how that motion is correlated with molecular structures or facilitated by changes in charge density and dielectric constant.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8023], "author_name_tesi": "Choi, U Hyeok ", "last_name_ssi": "Choi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "U Hyeok", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby", "James Patrick Runt", "Qiming Zhang", "Scott Thomas Milner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby, Dissertation Advisor", "James Patrick Runt, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member", "Scott Thomas Milner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Polymerelectrolytes", "Ionomers", "Ion Conductivity", "Dielectric Constant", "Ionic liquids", "Lithium Ion Batteries"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "passivation of InGaN/GaN nanopillar light emitting diodes", "id": "18845", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8802", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recently, InGaN/GaN based blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) have become widely available commercially, but their efficiency is reduced due to the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE) induced by the InGaN/GaN mismatch. These LEDs, when combined with a phosphor or other LEDs, can be used to provide white lighting, and maximizing their energy efficiency is desirable. Therefore, a new LED structure using nanopillars has been studied, which increases the surface area for light to escape as well as reducing the quantum confined Stark effect in order to improve the device efficiency. However, when InGaN/GaN nanopillars are prepared by dry etching, N vacancies and group \u2162 oxides are created on the nanopillar sidewalls, causing excessive leakage current and non-radiative surface recombination. As a result, the internal quantum efficiency drops, and it degrades the device efficiency. In this research, reducing the etch rate and adding consecutive KOH wet etching and (NH4)2S/ isopropanol passivation steps were studied to reduce the sidewall damage and increase the device efficiency. The photoluminescence intensity in nanopillars prepared with the slow etch rate (0.18 nm/s) was 2 times higher than that of planar structures.

Critical flux can be a good indicator for the membrane system to keep its productivity constant with advantage of operational cost. Therefore, it is very important to understand the impact of operating modes (constant flux and constant pressure modes) on the system and the relationship between foulants (NOM and inorganic particles) and critical flux to use it as an indicator of the system performance. \nUnder sub-critical conditions, operating the system with constant flux mode resulted in better performance than with constant pressure mode. In both the sub-critical and the super-critical flux conditions, the hydraulic resistances of the system with constant flux mode were less than those with constant pressure mode. It was because there was \u201coverfouling\u201d of the system at the beginning of the ultrafiltration under the constant pressure mode.\nAromaticity, which mainly resides in hydrophobic fraction of humic substances, has been known to be the main component that decides the degree of fouling. Molecular weight of NOM also plays an important role in membrane fouling. As the soil-NOM can be differentiated from the water-NOM by its higher hydrophobicity and larger molecular size, the critical fluxes of those two NOM types can also be categorized by their origins. The critical fluxes of the soil-NOM group (117 ~ 268.3 lmh) were much lower than those of the water-NOM (not detected in the operational range of the tests).\nDissolved organic matter (DOM) was a major foulant as well as a pollutant hard to remove with UF membrane. Higher NOM concentration decreased the critical flux as increased NOM transport to the membrane surface increased the hydraulic resistances and fouling. As the NOM concentration increased, the critical flux of the system decreased.\nThere was controversy about the role of inorganic particles in the system performance. As the concentration of inorganic particle increased, the critical flux of the system also increased when the NOM concentration was fixed at 0.0, 5.0, or 10.0 mg/L of Aldrich humic acid (AHA). Inorganic particles increased the critical flux of the system as they acted as another adsorbent of the system and inhibited NOM accumulation on the membrane surface.\nFouling is one the biggest obstacles in using membrane filtration in water and wastewater treatment as it increases the hydraulic resistance of the membrane filtration system and, hence, increases operational cost. \nInorganic particle addition was known to reduce fouling of membrane in some cases. Increasing particle concentration can improve the performance of the membrane filtration system. Particles can play a role as an adsorbent of NOM molecules competing with membrane surface to reduce amount of NOM adsorption on the surface or in the pore of the membrane. The hydraulic resistances were affected little by particle concentration changes. The hydraulic resistance after chemical cleaning (Rch) which was related to the resistance by adsorbed layer decreased with increasing inorganic particle concentration.\nNOM has been known to be a major foulant in membrane filtration for water treatment. It is expected that increasing NOM concentration increases its transport to the membrane which will result in increased deposit layer or adsorption of NOM molecules and increased hydraulic resistance of the system. The system with more NOM molecules had higher hydraulic resistance than the system with less NOM.\nAmong the components of NOM, humic fraction, which is more hydrophobic and larger in its size, causes more fouling because of its adsorptive capacity on the membrane. Though it\u2019s hard to be categorized due to its diversity and heterogeneity, water-NOM can be differentiate from soil-NOM according to its hydrophobicity and molecular size which affect the fouling of the membrane system by each NOM type. The soil-NOM caused more resistance than the water-NOM. Hydrophobicity and molecular weight can be the distinct difference between those two NOM types.\nThe rejection of dissolved organic matter measured by UV254 or DOC did not change much with inorganic particle concentration or NOM concentration. When the rejection was studied in terms of different NOM types (water-borne and soil-borne NOM), the rejection was closely related with humic fraction of NOM (UV254) as more humic substances were removed from the NOM with higher humic fraction (UV254).\nThough the ultrafiltration is an efficient treatment process to remove various contaminants, it still has physical and chemical limitations (fouling and dissolved organic matters) in its use for water treatment. Coagulation pretreatment is an effective resort to overcome the obstacles in applying the ultrafiltration system to water treatment.\nDissolved organic matter has been known to be removed by coagulation with metal salts otherwise not be removed by the ultrafiltration alone. In this study, the turbidity removal by the UF was 99% with coagulation. Humic substances represented by UV254 could be removed completely by the UF with conventional coagulation conditions while little ( < 88%) with unconventional coagulation conditions.\nIt was hypothesized that though the conventional coagulation condition can be effective to improve the physical and chemical performance of the UF system, there can be other optimum conditions depending on the raw water characteristics. The flocs formed under charge neutralization conditions were less compressible and more permeable than those formed under sweep floc conditions. The hydraulic resistances of the membrane system with charge neutralization conditions were smaller than with sweep floc conditions. In some cases (condition #1, #3 and #4), the hydraulic resistance, an indicator of fouling, was lower with unconventional coagulation conditions than conventional ones.\nIt can be concluded that the optimum coagulation conditions in conventional water treatment are not always the optimum conditions for UF-with-coagulation system and the unconventional coagulation conditions can be much more effective than the conventional ones in the context of membrane filtration, depending on the raw water characteristics.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6722], "author_name_tesi": "Choi, Young-june ", "last_name_ssi": "Choi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Young-june", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott", "Fred Scott Cannon", "Brian Dempsey", "William D Burgos"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott, Committee Member", "Fred Scott Cannon, Committee Member", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Chair", "William D Burgos, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["critical flux", "natural organic matter (NOM)", "membrane", "ultrafiltration", "fouling"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The role of environmental attitude on the relationship between perceived quality, perceived value, and satisfaction on festival visitors' behavioral intention: The case of Boryeong Mud Festival\n", "id": "11680", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6911", "abstract_tesi": "Given that visitors to a nature-based festival are more likely to be exposed to the natural environment, it is important to combine consumer behavioral constructs with environmental attitudes. The purpose of this study was to extend festival research by examining the role of environmental attitude on individuals\u2019 perception of and satisfaction with a nature-based festival. This study examined the role of environmental attitude in the Boryeong Mud Festival, which is the most popular nature-based festival in South Korea. A questionnaire was developed to measure four latent constructs (quality, perceived value, satisfaction, and behavioral intention) related to visitors\u2019 evaluation of the festival and to investigate their environmental attitude by using the six-item NEP scale (Dunlap & Van Liere, 1978). In order to collect data, an on-site intercept survey was used with visitors who attended the 12th Boryeong Mud Festival from July 11th to 19th, 2009. Among 442 visitors who agreed to participate in the survey, 392 cases were used for the analyses. As a result, this study identified five quality dimensions of a nature-based festival: festival program, information service, festival product, convenient facilities, and natural environment. Also, festival visitors\u2019 environmental attitude was documented with the six-item NEP scale and they were divided into a favorable environmental attitude group (FEAG) and a moderate environmental attitude group (MEAG). Using a multi-group mediation analysis, the impact of visitors\u2019 environmental attitude on the interrelationships between quality, perceived value, satisfaction, and behavioral intention was examined. This study contributes to the tourism literature by providing empirical evidence that visitors differently perceive of the experience of a nature-based festival depending on their environmental attitude.

Drawing upon technological perspectives of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC), this dissertation aimed to articulate the distinctive psychological effects of certain technology affordances on multiple dimensions of touristic experience. In particular, this dissertation adopted a variable-centered approach to explain the underlying mechanism to elicit positive touristic experience. Three separate papers were proposed and developed with the overarching theme of media technology effects on touristic experience. In Chapter 2, a conceptual framework was designed to articulate the main effects of technology-centric variables (i.e., modality, agency, interactivity, and navigability) on three dimensions of touristic experience in a virtual environment: a) the quality of virtual experience, b) the formation of tourist destination image, and c) the evaluation of a web interface. Three groups of variables (i.e., user-, content-, and situation-centric variables) were also included as potential moderators in the relations between antecedents (technology-centric variables) and consequences (touristic experience). In Chapter 3, a computer-lab experimental study was conducted to examine two technology affordances a) determining the way of presenting pictorial information of a destination and b) creating the spatial structure of a virtual environment: modality and navigability. The effects of modality and navigability were discussed in terms of virtual travel experience and behavioral intention to visit and recommend a destination. By conducting an online experimental study, Chapter 4 articulated the sources of online travel information in terms of specialization, endorsement, and other users\u2019 star rating to understand its ontological functions and psychological effects in destination marketing. The findings supported the structural relationships between source-related visual cues, cue-induced perceptions, information credibility, and destination images. Combining three papers that investigate the psychological effects of online travel media, this dissertation is expected to provide meaningful theoretical contributions to tourism literature and provide important practical implications to tourism providers, web designers, and tourists.

It includes compiling relevant sources, reading those sources, and comprehending the information. We find that this information scales rapidly in the current information age. The use of automated text summarization, among other techniques (e.g., search engines), helps to improve efficiency in exploring data by distilling large amounts of information that is becoming prevalent. \n\nFor the purpose of summarizing entity and topic interaction in large information stores, in this dissertation a methodology of automatic entity summarization is presented. The methodology is broken into three steps:  Reading, Assembly, and Interpretation. In the Reading step, the appropriate information sources are determined and, subsequently, the interrelated entities are extracted within each source. Four inputs are necessary in this step:  a topic extraction algorithm, a named entity recognition algorithm, information sources, and property information for the entities. In the Assembly step, the relationships between entities across sources is represented through knowledge networks. A trimodal weighted co-occurrence hypergraph is presented and then projected into unimodal and bimodal graphs. Finally, in the Interpretation step, graph analytics are presented to summarize the graphs. A novel diversity heuristic is derived based on information entropy to compare information diversity in different streams of literature over time.\n\nTo test the methodology, three experiments were conducted. Data from the PubMed Central Open Access Subset, which consisted of 740,418 journal citations in 4,404 journals, was downloaded on July 14, 2014. The first experiment addressed the relationship between the size of the information network and the number of files input into the methodology. It was found that a power law relationship exists, as shown in linguistic theory. The second experiment addressed the validity of the methodology in extracting meaningful connections and predicting the top chemicals using two gold standards. Results indicate that the methodology can be used to determine the top chemicals and that meaningful connections are those with the highest weight in the network. Finally, the diversity heuristic was used in the third experiment to empirically compare the diversity of information in a stream of articles relating to honeybee research to the diversity of information in a stream of articles relating to diabetes research. It was seen that the existing heuristic provides quite noisy results when applied to information networks and that the new heuristic has better asymptotic properties.

PMV1 can be detected in hundreds of bird species and remains as disease threat to the poultry industry despite global vaccination efforts. Modified live vaccines were developed in the 1950s to relieve ND burden in domestic poultry. However, the consequence of live virus vaccines on the evolution of wild type strains has never been assessed. Further, there is considerable genetic diversity among PMV1 strains and new genotypes of PMV1 are continually reported. Given the economic importance of this pathogen, surprisingly little is known about the ecology and evolutionary history of this virus or the mechanism of strain emergence and dispersal. In addition, it is not known how diversification of PMV1 affects phenotypic properties. The studies in this dissertation explored these questions.\n\nWe first evaluated the effect of vaccination on the virus evolution. Based on phylogenetic analyses of whole-genome PMV1, we demonstrate that vaccination with live attenuated viruses has changed the evolution of PMV-1. Most notably, the vaccine-associated genotype II viruses have maintained constant population growth to the present despite vaccination efforts. Modified live virus vaccines allow coinfection and recombination of vaccine and wild type strains, and lead to unique selection profiles on gylcoproteins of viruses from related genotypes. \n\nSince vaccination was implemented in the 1950s new genotypes of PMV1 have emerged and caused disease in both wild and domestic birds. One of the newly emerged PMV1 lineage [Genotype VI-PMV1 (GVI-PMV1)], which has strong host specificity with Columbiformes, was first reported in the early 1980s and has been responsible for panzootics in both chickens and pigeons.  Our study applied evolutionary timescale analyses to a large data set derived from published and newly obtained viral gene sequences and revealed that a series of chicken-to-pigeon transmission events led to the establishment of the major GVI-PMV1 lineage in Columbiforme populations. The new strain emerged in Eastern Europe, and dispersed rapidly through Europe during a series of panzootics. The European continent then became the epicenter for global GVI-PMV1 dispersion. \n\nThe evolutionary dynamics of GVI-PMV1 in North America are poorly understood because of limited sequence data and lack of nationwide surveillance. In this study we derived new gene sequences from 61 GVI-PMV1 isolates collected in northeastern U.S from 2001-2009 in order to study the dynamics of emergent GVI-PMV1 in North America. The data presented here demonstrates that there were multiple introductions of GVI-PMV1 into North America from Europe. One lineage resulting from an introduction that was not represented in contemporary samples and likely suffered from lineage extinction, one is associated with Eurasian collared doves and endemic US Columbiformes and is maintaining constant population size, and one viral lineage is in a phase of population expansion. The complete genomes of ten selected GVI-PMV1 isolates of two major lineages were sequenced and characterized to determine the evolutionary pressures acting on emerging GVI strains. Our analysis detected positive selected sites in some codons of the P gene that were associated with predicted phosphorylation sites. Our data also reveal different population histories of two geographically structured GVI-PMV1 sublineages in North America: the Central sublineage has maintained a constant population size while the Northeastern sublineage has population growth over the recent decade. \n\nBased on our evolutionary analyses, we asked whether isolates differed in properties reflecting host-virus interaction in the original chickens host. Our in vitro and in ovo experiments showed that different genetic lineages of GVI-PMV1 exhibited unique phenotypic properties. Using multivariate analysis, we demonstrated that these phenotypic properties measured from cellular and organismal infections were able to discriminate virus lineages. Our data also show that GVI-PMV1 displayed unique pattern of altering host type 1 interferon expression and mode of replication in vitro; and the virus pathogenesis is associated with systemic infection and high replication efficiency in chicken embryos. In summary, the studies in this dissertation contribute to a greater understanding of the molecular evolution of PMV1 at global and regional scales, the emergence of one of the new strains, GVI-PMV1 and its global dispersal and establishment in the US, and the possible biological manifestation of the emergent strain to replicate in chickens. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7988], "author_name_tesi": "Chong, Yee Ling", "last_name_ssi": "Chong", "middle_name_ssi": "Ling", "first_name_ssi": "Yee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Poss", "Peter John Hudson", "Marilyn J Roossinck", "Francesca Chiaromonte"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Poss, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Chair", "Marilyn J Roossinck, Committee Member", "Francesca Chiaromonte, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Virus", "Newcastle disease", "evolution", "emergence", "population dynamics", "phylogeography."]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Healthy Whole Wheat Elementary Education Project\n", "id": "9315", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5719", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Increasing whole grain intake is associated with various health benefits. Numerous governmental and non-governmental organizations have collectively recommended an increased daily intake of whole-grains. In spite of these recommendations, however, recent dietary intake data show that children and adolescents consume only 0.8 to 1.0 mean servings of whole grains on a daily basis, which represent less than the recommended intakes.

Hence, there was a need to develop a streamlined educational and promotional whole wheat campaign which would be more likely to be adapted in schools. The objective of the Healthy Whole Wheat project was to determine the relative effectiveness of two interventions of varying intensity, involving classroom education and cafeteria promotion of whole wheat products, in increasing 4th and 5th grade student\u2019s selections of whole wheat products in the school cafeteria. A total of two hundred and three (n=203) students from two elementary schools of the same school district participated in the study.

In the present study, we observed that students, who received classroom education, increased their whole wheat item selections in the cafeteria from as low as 5% at baseline to a statistically significant 82% during intervention, as compared to students in the cafeteria promotions group and the control group. The students in the cafeteria promotions groups increased their whole wheat item selections in the cafeteria but did not reach statistical significance as compared to the control group. Our study showed that a school-based intervention of minimum intensity successfully increased the intake of whole-grain foods by children. However, further studies aimed at the implementation of a randomized intervention on a broader scale are recommended. In addition, the development of innovative whole wheat promotional strategies needs further investigation.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5713], "author_name_tesi": "Chopade, Smita Nilkanth", "last_name_ssi": "Chopade", "middle_name_ssi": "Nilkanth", "first_name_ssi": "Smita", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Claudia Kay Probart", "Claudia Kay Probart"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Claudia Kay Probart, Thesis Advisor", "Claudia Kay Probart, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Elementary School", "Whole Wheat"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Infrared Spectroscopic Studies of Hydrogen Bonding in Phenolic Polymers\n", "id": "9149", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "569", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Detailed analysis of the bands appearing in the OH stretching region of the infrared spectrum of phenolic compounds are presented, including those of ethyl phenol (EtPh), poly(vinyl phenol) (PVPh) and poly(styrene-co-vinyl phenol)/poly methyl ether blends (PSVPh/PVME).  This region of the spectrum of phenolic polymers is not well understood, and various issues need to be resolved in order to accomplish this work initially focused on EtPh.  When this material is dissolved in cyclohexane, the band due to \u201cfree\u201d (non-hydrogen-bonded groups) has been shown to contain overlapping contributions from both monomeric and end-group species.  \n\nOther assignments are made on the basis of whether the proton and oxygen in a particular OH group are both involved in hydrogen bonds (as \u201cdonors\u201d and \u201cacceptors\u201d, respectively), or if only the proton is acting as a donor. The strongest band in the spectra obtained at the highest concentration of ethyl phenol is due to OH groups present in linear chains of hydrogen-bonded OH groups (as recognized in numerous other studies), but a band due to cyclic trimers has also been identified. The assignment of other modes is more uncertain and various possibilities are discussed. In toluene solutions, assignments are more complicated, because bands due to OH\u2013&#960; hydrogen bonds are observed instead of free groups. Finally, the data from cyclohexane solutions was used to calculate equilibrium constants capable of describing the distribution of species present. A new methodology for determining the equilibrium constant describing association in the form of dimers is described.\n\nThese conclusions are then used in a detailed analysis of the bands appearing in the OH stretching region of the infrared spectrum of PVPh, and their changes with temperature is presented. Bands usually assigned to \u201cfree\u201d groups contain overlapping contributions from both monomeric and end-group species, both hydrogen-bonded to &#960; orbitals. Assignments of bands due to hydrogen-bonded groups are made on the basis of whether the proton and oxygen in a particular OH group are both involved in hydrogen bonds, or whether one or the other is \u201cfree\u201d. The assignment of other modes is more uncertain, and various possibilities are discussed. Changes in absorption coefficient with temperature appear to affect bands due to hydrogen-bonded groups in the interior of chains and monomeric species by essentially the same amount. The large change in absorption coefficient of the hydrogen-bonded band relative to a band assigned to free groups postulated in a previous study is more likely due to a change in the distribution of hydrogen-bonded and \u201cfree\u201d species that were not resolved in previous work.\n\nFinally, a detailed analysis of the bands appearing in the OH stretching region of the infrared spectrum of PSVPh/PVME blends is presented.

By using established models for predicting the extent of hydrogen bonding, it was possible to estimate the concentration of hydrogen bonds necessary for coupling of the dynamic behavior, and the size of the relevant \u201ccontrol volume\u201d.

However experiments designed to mimic fractionation in both an oxygen poor atmosphere through SO2 photolysis and a presumably oxygen rich atmosphere though thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) have thus far been unable to confirm a mechanism capable of creating the mass independent fractionation of sulfur (MIF-S) signatures observed in Archean age rocks.  This has created much controversy in how the MIF-S record is used to determine Archean environments.  However large amounts of geochemical evidence suggest at least appreciable amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere and ocean at different stages through the Archean.  This has motivated us to further explore TSR as a source of MIF-S through a rigorous investigation of how chemical speciation, experimental conditions, time, and rate effect sulfur isotope fractionation.  Our results show the importance of initial sulfur redox state and chemistry, temperature, and organic reductant type in creating characteristic mass dependent and independent fractionations.  Including previous TSR results (Watanabe et. al., 2009 and Oduro et. al., 2011) we report increased \u03b434S and \u039436S fractionation in TSR products to 15.50\u2030 and 1.5\u2030 respectively and increased \u039433S range from -.22 to 2.30\u2030 in H2S largely through the use of mixtures of glycine and alanine.  In sulfate we observe \u03b434S fractionation between 0.00 and 7.85\u2030 and \u039433S fractionation between -.15\u2030 and 0.0\u2030.  By quantifying fractionation amongst different sulfur bearing products produced during experiments and collected at experiment conclusions in addition to characterizing the effects due to various experimental conditions we are also able describe a schematic framework for the isotope effects during various steps of TSR.  Fractionation from the magnetic isotope effect (MIE), the vibrational energy discontinuity effect (VEDE), first described for heterogeneous reactions by Lasaga et. al, 2008, and normal stable isotope mass dependently driven kinetic isotope effects (KIE) are utilized in this schematic to describe the experimental results.  The MIE and VEDE are responsible for the MIF-S signatures observed in organic polysulfides and H2S at high temperatures.  Additionally the effects of these mechanisms are greatly influenced by amino acid type, specifically in experiments that use a mixture of glycine and alanine.  The VEDE and KIE are responsible for \u03b434S fractionation with the overall effect of producing sulfide depleted in 34S at lower temperatures.  The interplay of these mechanisms is responsible for \u039433S and \u03b434S trends observed in sulfides and sulfate samples.  Based on this proposed schematic for sulfur isotope fractionation during TSR major trends and features in the Archean \u039433S vs. \u03b434S and \u039436S vs. \u039433S record can be interpreted.

A rotating disk system (RDS) is used to deliver a \u201ccardiac pulse\u201d to a stainless steel disk with PUU attached to the bottom surface.  This pulse simulates the mean velocities typically seen at the inlet of a left ventricular assist device during the cardiac cycle.

Platelet adherence is quantified by immunofluorescent labeling using CAPP2A mouse anti-bovine &#945;IIb&#946;3 antibody and Alexa-Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG.  Two approaches were used to identify shear rates with high levels of platelet adhesion.  The first method applied a cardiac pulse continuously to a 15 mm disk for 2 hr.  The average adhesion coefficient (AC%) was 0.60% at the center, which is comparable to the values seen for a steady 2 hr rotation at 283 rpm (AC% = 0.36%).  In the second study, platelets were pre-adhered to the material surface and a cardiac pulse was applied continuously for 30 min.  At the disk center, 33% of the original platelet number remained following the 30 min pulse.  This value decreased to 10% at 300 s-1 (3 mm radius) and 5% at 840 s-1 (8 mm radius).  Steady rotation and cardiac pulse experiments all showed low platelet adhesion for shear rates higher than 500 s-1.

Even though much progress has been made for the development of synthetic approaches, synthetic methods to generate size- and shape-controlled nanocrystalline materials are still challenging, particularly for multi-metal and metal systems that have been less explored due to the lack of robust synthetic approaches.  This dissertation presents robust and facile solution based approaches to synthesize size- and shape-controlled intermetallic and metal nanocrystals.\nWe have been exploring the concept of chemical conversion for synthesizing a variety of nanomaterials with size- and shape-control.  In particular, this approach has shown to be an effective chemical route for synthesizing shape-and size-controlled intermetallic nanocrystals.  It has been known that size-and shape-controlled intermetallic compounds are not easily attainable since intermetallic compounds normally consist of elements possessing notably different reduction potentials, reduction kinetics, and reactivity.  This chemical conversion strategy utilizes a single metal as a reactive template for synthesizing more complex nanomaterials.  We have shown that \u00e2-Sn nanocrystals can chemically transform into size- and shape-controlled M-Sn intermetallic nanocrystals.  This chemical conversion method also affords compounds that can be hard to obtain by traditional solid state synthetic methods.   We have also established general and predictive guidelines for accessing dense and hollow single crystal nanorods in M-Sn systems.  Through this study, we have realized that reaction temperature plays a vital role in maintaining the morphology of the \u00e2-Sn nanorod templates in the products.\nFor the synthesis of a variety of nanomaterials by the exploitation of the established chemical conversion strategy, robust and general chemical approaches have been developed for the synthesis of shape-controlled In nanoparticles by understanding reduction kinetics.  Interestingly, metal precursors that have negative reduction potential vs standard hydrogen electrode have previously been synthesized by only harsh chemical and physical methods (high reaction temperatures and strong reducing agents), which can be inadequate for yielding precisely shape-controlled nanoparticles.  We have shown a simple and robust kinetically controlled borohydride reduction process for synthesizing shape-controlled In nanocrystals at room temperature.  By controlling the reduction rates via the rate of addition of sodium borohydride solution and controlling several reaction parameters, including reaction solvents, additives, solvents for sodium borohydride, and alcohol solutions containing metal precursors in the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), indium nanoparticles are formed that include shapes of high aspect ratio nanowires, uniform octahedra, truncated octahedra, decahedra, triangles, spheres, and star-like shapes.\nWe have shown that a simple kinetically controlled reduction process can also be applied to the synthesis of size- and shape-controlled Ge nanocrystals.  Again, representative chemical and physical approaches have been previously developed using harsh reaction conditions (high temperatures, high pressures, and strong reducing agents).  The kinetically controlled reduction process by sodium borohydride at room temperature leads to the formation of spherical Ge nanocrystals with high monodispersity, as well as cubic shape.  By varying concentration of metal precursors and reaction solvents, different sizes of germanium nanocrystals were obtained.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4740], "author_name_tesi": "Chou, Nam Hawn ", "last_name_ssi": "Chou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nam Hawn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Karl Todd Mueller", "Sridhar Komarneni"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Member", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chemical synthesis", "size- and shape-controlled nanocrystals", "intermetallic"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECT OF VARIED CONCEPT MAPS AND \nSELF-DIRECTED LEARNING ABILITY ON STUDENTS\u2019\nHYPERMEDIA LEARNING\n", "id": "9770", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4995", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the instructional effectiveness of varied concept maps in measuring different learning objectives for students with different levels of self-directed learning abilities in a hypertext environment.\nThis study adopted a randomized-based experimental design.

Moreover, picture books about bedtime are part of the ritual of bedtime separation, and function as substitutes to an absent attachment figure. The translation of U.S. picture books about bedtime in Taiwan, where parent-child co-sleeping is the norm and the attachment relationship is different from in the U.S., is a rich site for exploring how different ideas of children and childhood interplay across cultures. Three groups of picture books about bedtime were collected and analyzed: popular books in the U.S. (1943-2006), translated U.S. books in Taiwan (1986-2006), and books created by Taiwanese authors (1981-2005). The comparison focused on the portrayals of children's bedtime practices in the books and how fictional parents and children cope with bedtime problems, such as fear, separation, and sleeplessness. Guides for parents coming with Taiwanese and translated picture books were also examined for their advice to parents regarding children's sleep and fear. The findings show that children's attachment to inanimate objects and self-soothing to sleep as strategies are often encouraged in the U.S. and translated picture books. Fictional children in these two groups of books also often avoid using parents as a secure base when facing nighttime fear and distress. Influences from U.S. culture can be seen in both Taiwanese creations of picture books about bedtime and in the notes to parents in the translated books. The conclusion suggests that adults in Taiwan need to be aware of the ideas of children and childhood in children's books translated or imported from other cultures and be sensitive about how these ideas may be different from Taiwanese childrearing goals and practices.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6541], "author_name_tesi": "Chou, Wan-Hsiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Chou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wan-Hsiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade", "James Ewald Johnson", "Steven Herb", "Karen Treat Keifer Boyd", "Dr Mary Galbraith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade, Committee Chair", "James Ewald Johnson, Committee Member", "Steven Herb, Committee Member", "Karen Treat Keifer Boyd, Committee Member", "Dr Mary Galbraith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Taiwan", "childrearing practices", "fear", "transitional objects", "children's literature", "picture books", "attachment theory", "parent child relations", "sleep"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "AUTOMATED CONCEPT GENERATION USING BRANCHED FUNCTIONAL MODELS", "id": "10814", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "184", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis discusses a new concept generation technique that improves upon a previous automated concept generation theory and algorithm developed by Bryant, et al. at the University of Missouri \u2013 Rolla.

One of the key shale gas plays in United States is the Devonian aged, Marcellus shale in the Appalachian basin. The development of such shale plays has been made possible because of technological advances like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Marcellus Shale stretches across several states but is currently being commercially exploited in the states of West Virgina and Pennsylvania. These states have seen a tremendous increase in their oil and gas production during the last five years. However the industry still is in an evolving state and the process of fracturing can undergo a lot of improvement. A thorough evaluation of stimulation effectiveness can enhance the production parameters as well as throw light on the bottlenecks in the current practices adopted. To evaluate the prevalent practices the industry takes into considerations of geology, completions, and treatment parameters and field operations. Methods of effectiveness evaluation include micro-seismic data, fracture treatment analysis, production data analysis, and data mining techniques.\n\nThis research aims at understanding the effectiveness of the stimulation parameter treatment in the Marcellus shale. The first step was to collect and evaluate the geological properties of the Marcellus Shale. We then reviewed the currently producing wells and chose 125 wells which had the complete data. We proceeded with engineering and statistical analysis to better understand the correlations between the stimulation parameters adopted by the industry and the subsequent gas production. Economic analysis was also conducted for further evaluation of the effectiveness of the stimulation parameters. From the data generated and evaluated we found out that the lateral length ranged from 1096 ft to 10616 ft with a mean value of 4675 ft. Gas production increased with lateral length. Treatment range was between the range of 75bpm to 95 bpm with a mean value of 82 bpm. Gas production was found to be adversely affected by\ntreatment rate beyond a certain value. Similar observations were made for other controlling factors like the total pounds of proppant needed and the total volume of fluid needed.

For the application to information storage devices, the switchability of domains in a ferroelectric by an applied electric field is utilized.  The conventional thermodynamic approach to describe switching behavior typically assumes a material to be a perfect crystal while a real ferroelectric material is generally inhomogeneous and contains domains and domain walls, as well as defects such as surfaces, grain boundaries, dislocations and dipolar defects.  As a result, prior thermodynamic calculations predicted coercive fields, the minimum applied field to switch a domain, are at least one or more orders of magnitude too high compared to those measured experimentally. \n\n In this work, I developed a three-dimensional (3-D) phase-field model for predicting the domain structures and ferroelectric properties in the presence of structural inhomogenities in both bulk crystals and thin films.  The model takes into account realistic polycrystalline grain structures as well as various energetic contributions including elastic energy, electrostatic energy, and domain wall energy.  It is shown that the defects such as existing domain walls, and grain boundaries play a critical role in domain switching and in determining the magnitude of coercive field. It will be demonstrated that the phase-field approach is able to predict the coercive fields and remanent polarizations that are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements.  The effect of substrate constraint on phase stability and ferroelectric properties is also discussed.\n\n\tFurther, the phase-field model developed has been extended to study the local tip-induced polarization switching in the presence of twin defects.  Epitaxial lead zirconate titanate (PbZr(1-x)TixO3) thin film were studied as a model system. It was observed that the electric potential required to nucleate new domains during polarization switching in ferroelectric thin films varies spatially within the domain structure. The lowest electric field for nucleation is observed near the twin domain boundaries.  The spatial distribution of the nucleation voltage obtained from the phase-field approach shows an excellent agreement with experimental measurements using the switching spectroscopy piezoresponse force microscopy(sspfm) technique.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5922], "author_name_tesi": "Choudhury, Samrat ", "last_name_ssi": "Choudhury", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Samrat", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen", "Dr C A Randall", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Dr D G Schlom", "Dr X X Xi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen, Committee Chair", "Dr C A Randall, Committee Member", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "Dr D G Schlom, Committee Member", "Dr X X Xi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phase-field", "ceramics", "switching", "grain", "domains", "defects"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSICALLY ACTIVE LEISURE ACTIVITIES AND HEALTH FOR ADULTS AGE FIFTY AND OLDER", "id": "7344", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2391", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There are three purposes for this study: 1) To characterize seniors\u2019 leisure activities in terms of the physically active leisure index using the METs values, 2) To examine to what extent and in what ways three types of physical activity: leisure-time physical activity, household physical activity and occupational physical activity, are related to nine health dimensions: health perception, physical functioning, mental health, vitality, role functioning, pain, social functioning, number of doctor visits and obesity, and 3) To compare the physically active leisure index with the PASE scale in terms of explaining variance in older adults\u2019 health.\nThis study utilizes secondary data analysis from a study entitled--The Relation of Local Government Recreation and Park Services to the Health of Older Adults. The subjects were from Peoria, IL, San Diego, CA, Arlington, VA, Houston, TX, and Minneapolis, MN. The sample was predominately white and the majority of them were female with a mean age of 67.

In a standard auction, bidders bid more aggressively when the number of bidders increases.  However, Krishna and Rosenthal (1996, Games and Economic Behavior) show that when bidders have multiple-unit demand that generates positive synergies, bidders bid less aggressively as the number of bidders increases.  The first objective of this essay is to offer experimental evidence to support this seemingly counter-intuitive theoretical prediction.  We design a simultaneous second-price sealed-bid auction for two objects with two types of bidders: Local bidders with single-object demand and global bidders with multiple-object demand.  Our results show that bidders bid less aggressively with increased competition.  The second objective is to investigate the effect of offering bidders with multiple-unit demand the option of bidding for both objects as a package as well as submitting individual bids for each object.  We find that offering this package option increases allocation efficiency and seller\u2019s revenue.\n\nThe second essay investigates the impact of the method-of-sale on property prices.  More specifically, does the same property sell for the same price under auction versus negotiated sale?  Applying the Heckman two-step estimation procedure to test and correct for selectivity bias, we find that on average, properties sold through auction have a price premium of 8.2%.  We also find that the auction mechanism does not obtain consistent price premiums for the different property types.  More homogeneous properties (apartments) obtain higher price premiums than more heterogeneous properties (such as single-family dwellings) when sold through auction.\n\nThe third essay focuses on examining the impact of product heterogeneity on the magnitude of the price spread between auction and negotiated sales.  The price spread is the difference between what a property may fetch at an auction versus a negotiated sale.  Using atypicality and price variance as measures to quantify product heterogeneity, we find that more atypical properties obtain smaller price spreads.  Price variance leads to a smaller price spread in the low-end market segment but to a larger price spread in the high-end market segment.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6902], "author_name_tesi": "Chow, Yuen Leng ", "last_name_ssi": "Chow", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuen Leng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Abdullah Yavas", "Abdullah Yavas", "Austin Jay Jaffe", "Kenneth Michael Lusht", "Brent William Ambrose", "N Edward Coulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Abdullah Yavas, Dissertation Advisor", "Abdullah Yavas, Committee Chair", "Austin Jay Jaffe, Committee Member", "Kenneth Michael Lusht, Committee Member", "Brent William Ambrose, Committee Member", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Real Estate Auction", "Negotiated Sales", "Product Heterogeneity", "Positive Synergies", "Experiment", "Multi-Object Auction"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Developing optimization-based algorithms for rational engineering of microbial strains", "id": "13325axc1028", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13325", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Concerns regarding crude oil depletion and climate change have encouraged the development of renewable biochemicals and biofuels using carbohydrates as the feedstock. With increased familiarity of microbial metabolism and ever-accelerating pace of genome sequencing and annotation, the ease of genetic manipulation for accomplishing biotechnological objectives have rapidly matured from single gene manipulations to genome-wide perturbations and tunable control of pathways. Development in experimental practices has been concurrently supported with novel computational techniques aimed towards accurate a priori prediction of cellular behavior towards genetic manipulations. Complete understanding of chemical repertoire of microorganisms requires cataloguing their enzyme-catalyzed reactions, synthesized molecules along with their individual capabilities through construction of their genome-scale metabolic networks. De novo metabolic pathways can be carefully designed to outperform native pathways with higher carbon and energy efficiencies as well as expand the product range of a host organism. However, scanning through the huge repertoire of microbial enzymes to identify potential components of a novel pathway is a challenging task as one has to consider all the possible factors affecting the pathway efficiency. They include the stoichiometric and cofactor balance, thermodynamic feasibility, co-substrate and co-product choices and compatibility of the enzymes with the host. To this end, we have developed a two-stage (optStoic and minRxn/minFlux) optimization formalism. \u00a0The first step, optStoic, explores the maximum extent of converting carbon substrate(s) to desired product(s) through non-intuitive combination of co-reactants and co-products while remaining within the limits of mass, energy and thermodynamic balances. Subsequently, minRxn/minFlux identifies a minimal reaction network to achieve the overall conversion. Identified designs consisted of improvement on existing strategies in terms of both carbon and energy efficiency. Specifically, multiple alternatives for non-oxidative glycolysis and methanotrophy were identified that showed non-intuitive combinations of a core set of known pathways can lead to higher carbon and energy efficiency. Once the designed pathway is introduced in the host strain, the metabolic fluxes need to be re-apportioned towards the target product. Several optimization-based computational techniques have been developed to achieve this aim, including the OptForce algorithm, which was implemented to engineer E. coli for overproduction of medium-chain fatty acids in a novel integrated experimental and computational approach. However, we noted that existing strain-design approaches overlook the effects of metabolite concentrations and substrate-level enzyme regulation while identifying metabolic interventions. We addressed this issue by introducing k-OptForce, which integrates the available kinetic descriptions of metabolic steps with stoichiometric models to sharpen the prediction of intervention strategies. Application of k-OptForce to the overproduction of L-serine in E. coli and triacetic acid lactone (TAL) in S. cerevisiae revealed non-intuitive intervention strategies hitherto hidden due to inability of accounting kinetic bottlenecks in flux redirection. Likewise, a study on succinate overproduction in E. coli using a kinetic model of E. coli central metabolism shed light on the importance of condition-specific model parameterization and provides insight onto how to augment kinetic models so as to correctly respond to multiple environmental perturbations. In addition to substrate-level kinetic regulatory information, the integration of a number of additional layers of regulation at the transcription, translation, and post-translation levels is also desired. The ultimate aim remains to turn microorganisms into \u201cdesigner cells\u201d with user-defined control similar to those achieved for modern chemical factories. However, the practical integration of these complex biological processes into a unified framework amenable to design remains an ongoing challenge.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12901], "author_name_tesi": "Chowdhury, Anupam ", "last_name_ssi": "Chowdhury", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anupam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Costas D.

Although particular focus is laid on isolation of the initial reaction pathways, a detailed understanding of the effects of ring structure and the type and location of substituent groups on the secondary reactions are also of interest. \n\nThe imidazolium salts comprised of 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium as the cation, and nitrate, chloride, and bromide as the anions, and are found to be thermally most stable among the three families of salts. Examination of the evolution of gas-phase species reveal that the most probable sites for nucleophilic transfer and subsequent secondary reactions are primarily the methyl group and secondarily the ethyl group. The triazolium family is formed by pairing the 4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium cation with chloride (4ATCl), and nitrate (4ATN) anions, and rank second in thermal stability. Whereas a proton transfer from the N1 position primarily initiates decomposition in 4ATCl, the amino group is found to primarily participate in the initiation reaction in case of 4ATN. The substituted triazolium salts formed by pairing the 1-methyl-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium and 1-methyl-4-amino-1,2,3-triazolium cations with iodide and nitrate salts are also found to initiate decomposition through the amino group. \n\nThe compounds studied from the tetrazolium family are 2-amino-4,5-dimethyl-tetrazolium iodide (2AdMTZI) and nitrate (2AdMTZN), and 1-amino-4,5-dimethyl-tetrazolium iodide (1AdMTZI) and  nitrate (1AdMTZN). The major decomposition pathway involves a nucleophilic transfer to the anion leading to the formation of methyl iodide and methyl nitrate, from 2AdMTZI and 2AdMTZN, respectively. Unlike the 2AdMTZ salts, the 1AdMTZ salts are found to initiate decomposition through three major pathways - formation of the corresponding methylated anion and 1-amino-5-methyl-tetrazole, formation of ammonia by the amino group, and expulsion of nitrogen from the tetrazole cation itself.\n\nThe Arrhenius-type reaction rate parameters for the initiation reactions governing the thermal decomposition of several EILs are obtained by an evolutionary genetic algorithm that compares the difference between the experimental and simulated species evolution profiles from the decomposition process. The processes governing the decomposition of these energetic compounds are found to be autocatalytic in nature, and the autocatalytic agents are the strong acids generated by the initial decomposition step.

The first essay focuses on citation networks while the second one proposes a general model of network formation. The third essay is an empirical investigation of a person's kinship network.\n        Chapter 1: Citations and the Diffusion of Knowledge: An Economic Analysis (with Kalyan Chatterjee)\n        Citation patterns in many academic disciplines have displayed a pattern of connections similar to those observed in many other different real-world contexts, such as links on the world-wide web. The various models that have been proposed to generate such networks, generically called \"preferential attachment models\", rely solely on random link formation and copying and do not take into account rational choice among authors in an academic community, which would consider the competition for citations and ensuing professional success. In this paper we construct such a model with rational agents to understand some aspects of citation patterns and knowledge diffusion in a specific academic field .. We show that rivalry or competition in citations might be an obstacle to diffusion, depending on behavioral rules specific to the field. Increased heterogeneity in the quality of papers reduces this effect. After considering models with complete information, we analyse models with private information about quality of one's own paper and use the framework to consider the interaction of this process with acquaintance networks and strategic entry. Superimposing the citation process on an acquaintance network yields patterns different from preferential attachment. Strategic entry leads to cascades of papers. Though we might have ex-ante efficiency in some equilibria, ex-post efficiency is not guaranteed. Ex post efficiency cannot be guaranteed since it is always possible in equilibrium that a good paper \"dies\" and a worse one survives, but ex ante efficiency is sometimes attainable.\n    \n    Chapter 2: Competing to be a `Star': A model of sequential network formation\n        This paper studies a sequential-move game of network formation with capacity constrained agents. The sequential nature of the game allows us to focus on the the role played by foresight in the formation of particular network configurations. We find that the equilibrium network structure depends crucially on the rate of decreasing returns (decay) in the payoffs. With homogeneous agents and a capacity of one link, the equilibrium network is a fully connected graph for extreme levels of decay. The architectures for very low and very high levels of decay are a complete star and a graph similar to the hub-and-spoke architecture, respectively. For intermediate levels of decay, however, the network configuration might have more than one component. This occurs because agents have the incentive to reject a link in some subgame in order to become central in the network at some future date. With heterogeneous agents, the equilibrium network for both very high and very low levels of decay is a star with a high ability agent as the center. But it is possible to have structures where the high ability agent is kept isolated by the rest of the society comprising of low types. This depends on the decay factor and the difference in the abilities of agents. The equilibrium is, for most values of decay, inefficient. Hence, we can possibly explain the existence of multiple small groups in various social settings even when a single cohesive network would be more efficient.\n    \n    Chapter 3: Family Embeddedness: An Empirical Investigation\n    Using the Netherlands Kinship Panel Data, we investigate the relationship between an individual's embeddedness in family ties, effort exerted on the job and social attitude. In particular, we want to explore whether stronger familial ties are associated with any negative impact on personal incentives or on society. We find that agents with a higher level of family ties at birth maintain a higher level of ties at a later stage. They also have a higher involvement in volunteer work and are more tolerant of migrants. Moreover, the level of inherited ties affect a person's current work effort positively. This is possible due to peer effects or due to a correlation with the occupational choice of individuals. Other factors which influence both ties and effort have an opposite effect on the two.

However, there possibly exists a negative relationship between current ties and effort due to family obligations or time constraints. We also find that negative social attitudes could be nurtured by higher income or wealth.\n    \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [396], "author_name_tesi": "Chowdhury, Avantika ", "last_name_ssi": "Chowdhury", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Avantika", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Neil Wallace", "Marek Pycia", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Neil Wallace, Committee Member", "Marek Pycia, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microeconomics", "game theory", "networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "High-speed Indoor Optical Wireless Communications - Channel Modeling Methods and Applications", "id": "23549", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10638", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "  Optical wireless communications (OWC) is an important research area that promises to mitigate some problems currently existing in radio frequency based systems, such as shortage of radio frequency spectrum, interference and necessity of transmission at very high data rates. Optical wireless communications can be both indoors and outdoors. The focus of this dissertation is on indoor optical wireless communication channels and systems.\n\n  Indoor optical wireless channels pose some challenges to properly model and analyze propagation characteristics. Since light signals reflect from wall surfaces, receivers in an OWC system usually receive many reflections of the transmitted signals. This results in inter-symbol-interference (ISI) that has detrimental effects to the achievable performance of the system. Hence, it is necessary to understand reflection patterns and consequences of multiple bounces of light signals from reflecting surfaces by properly analyzing the channel impulse response. In this dissertation, methods of simulating indoor optical wireless channel impulse responses are discussed and an algorithm is elaborated that have been developed by combining two existing popular algorithms, namely Barry\u2019s algorithm and Modified Monte Carlo method, thereby carrying the best features of both.\n\n  Channel parameters that affect high speed data transmission such as rms delay spread is an important topic that has been discussed in details in this dissertation. Channel impulse responses of several channel conditions are simulated and associated rms delay spreads are found, thereby relating the results to the locations of the receiver and the source.\n\n  Every data transfer communication system has to be duplex, i.e. requires both a downlink as well as an uplink channel. Hence, for establishing a high-speed communication system we have proposed a design of a duplex optical wireless system in this dissertation. Some considerations related to cost efficiency at the user side have been taken into account. The system is capable of working in full-duplex mode.\n\n  Description of an experimental demonstration is also part of the dissertation where the demonstration was involved in establishing a bi-directional link that carries 10 Gbps data stream both ways and a uni-directional link that carries analog Cable Television transmission. The distance between the two ends of the system is 15 m.

Successful recruitment typically leads to spontaneous isomerization from double-stranded (closed) form to a single stranded state (open complex). Contrary to this, \u03c354 can bind along with RNAP to the promoter DNA and form stable closed complex, but cannot spontaneously isomerize to open complex. For this transition, \u03c354 dependent transcription machinery needs to be remodeled by activators belonging to AAA+ ATPases super-family (ATPases Associated with Various Cellular Activities) and are also known as bacterial Enhancer Binding Proteins (bEBPs). \nThese activators act as rings made up of chemically identical subunits. The exact mechanism by which the ring architecture or geometry assists them to perform mechanical work on targets is unknown. Prior structural studies have shown various changes in the ring conformation during different stages of nucleotide hydrolysis. Crystal structure (Sysoeva thesis and manuscript in preparation) of NtrC1 ATPase, from Aquifex aeolicus, in sub-saturating or stoichiometric amount of nucleotides have shown the formation of asymmetric gapped hexamer ring, with spiral staircase arrangement of the functional loops. Striking similarity of this structure with distantly related AAA+ ATPases like DNA and RNA translocases suggests that allostery within the ring geometry of the ATPase leads to asymmetric functional states that exerts directional force to remodel asymmetric target macromolecules.  \nIn order to understand if this asymmetric geometry directs interaction of the ATPase with the \u03c354 transcription apparatus, I present in this thesis Electron Microscopy (EM) reconstructions of the complexes of NtrC1 ATPase with \u03c354, promoter DNA and in presence or absence of RNAP.

Currently, more than 35% of adults and 15% of children in the U.S. are obese. The treatment of obesity-related illnesses accounts for $200 billion or more than 20% of total healthcare expenditures in the U.S. every year. Several diseases have been linked to obesity including cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes mellitus and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Nearly a quarter of adults in the U.S. have NAFLD. NAFLD is characterized by the accumulation of excess lipids in the liver in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. Steatosis can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in which hepatocytes become inflamed, and fibrosis develops. In a small number of cases, severe fibrosis can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and death. Dietary interventions offer a safer and more affordable means of treating obesity and its related pathologies compared to interventions such as medication or surgery. Previous research has shown that a large number of foods have physiological activities beyond their nutritional value. In this thesis, we investigated the efficacy of tart cherries, soy protein concentrate, and high-oleic soybean oil in treating obesity and its related pathologies. The objectives of this project were to: 1.) determine if substituting a fiber-rich soy protein concentrate into a high-fat fed mouse diet prevents the development of obesity and NAFLD 2.) determine if substituting high-oleic soybean oil into a high-fat fed mouse diet prevents the development of obesity and NAFLD 3.) determine if tart cherries reduce the severity of obesity and its related inflammation in vivo 4.) determine if a tart cherry derived extract is capable of mitigating inflammation in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated human colonic epithelial cells\nPrevious research has indicated that dietary supplementation with soy protein may mitigate the severity of NAFLD. Several studies have shown that replacing dietary saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) may also ameliorate NAFLD. We examined the efficacy of dietary supplementation with soy protein concentrate (SPC), high-oleic soybean oil (HOS), and the combination to reduce markers of fatty liver disease and its associated inflammation in a high-fat (HF) induced NAFLD mouse model. Male C57BL/6J mice were given experimental diets ad libitum. The HF diets consisted of 60% kcal from lard; the HOS diets consisted of 20% kcal from lard and 40% kcal from high-oleic soybean oil, and diets supplemented with SPC replaced one-third of the casein with soy protein. Mice fed SPC had reduced visceral adiposity, hepatic steatosis, and markers of inflammation compared to casein-fed control mice. Mice fed high-oleic soybean oil gained significantly less weight and visceral adipose but had increased expression of several inflammatory markers.\nSeveral studies have shown that tart cherry (TC) products may mitigate symptoms of obesity and obesity-related inflammation. Tart cherries contain large amounts of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.  We examined the effects of supplementing 1% tart cherry powder into a diet-induced obesity mouse model. Mice were provided ad libitum access to either a HF or a HF+TC diet for 18-weeks. No differences in weight gain or visceral adiposity were observed between the treatment groups. Mice fed the HF+TC diet had a slightly lower hepatic expression of inflammatory markers monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin (IL)-1\u00df, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. We also examined the effects of a tart cherry extract (TCE) on colonic inflammation in vitro. Inflammation was stimulated in HT29 colonic epithelial cells with TNF-\u03b1 and treated with TCE. Inflammation was measured as the concentration of IL-8 secreted by the cells and normalized to viability. The TCE had a small anti-inflammatory effect at higher concentrations when applied simultaneously with TNF-\u03b1.\nIn conclusion, we have found that both a fiber-rich soy protein concentrate and tart cherry powder may be effective in mitigating the effects of obesity-related inflammation and NAFLD in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. We also found that high-oleic soybean oil may be pro-inflammatory in the same model. Further research will evaluate the constituent compounds of these foods to identify the key active components. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15345], "author_name_tesi": "Chrisfield, Benjamin James", "last_name_ssi": "Chrisfield", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert", "Kathleen Loralee Keller", "Connie Jo Rogers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert, Thesis Advisor", "Kathleen Loralee Keller, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Obesity", "Fatty Liver", "NAFLD", "Soy", "High-oleic Soybean Oil", "Tart Cherry"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Not All Map Use is Created Equal: Influence of Mapping Tasks on Children's Performance, Strategy Use, and Acquisition of Survey Knowledge", "id": "12203", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "88", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ability to think and act spatially has a variety of implications for human functioning and survival. Maps are an important tool for both navigating through and learning about the environment. Better understanding of how maps influence our spatial thought will help us to develop more complete theories of spatial development and provide better spatial education. The present study investigated the following aspects of children\u2019s map-use: (a) whether or not two different mapping tasks elicit similar performance and strategies from children, (b) if using a map results in better survey knowledge compared to not using a map, and (c) how individual differences in spatial ability relate to map-use performance. \nTo address these issues, 9- to 10-year-old children (N = 58) were tested in one of three conditions: comprehension, production, or no-map. In the comprehension condition, children used a map marked with target locations and tried to place flags in the environment precisely at those target locations. In the production condition, children searched for flags in the environment and then placed stickers on a map to indicate the flags' locations. In the no-map condition, children searched for flags without a map in order to solve a riddle. After completing the search task in one of these three conditions, children completed measures of environmental survey knowledge and of spatial skills. \nComprehension and production tasks were hypothesized to be conducive to different levels of strategy use during the task. Performance was expected to be affected by these different strategies. Specifically, it was predicted that the comprehension task would elicit greater map use (looking at, aligning, and touching the map), which would, in turn, lead to better performance. It was also predicted that children in either map condition (comprehension or production) would do better on measures of survey knowledge in comparison to children in the no-map condition. Spatial skills as measured by paper-and-pencil tests were hypothesized to be positively related to performance on the mapping task.\nAs hypothesized, results showed that accuracy in placing the flags or stickers differed between children in the comprehension and production groups. This effect was mediated by strategy use such that those in the comprehension condition spent a greater proportion of time aligning, looking at, and touching the map and this greater use of strategies was associated with better performance on placing the flags. The hypothesis that map use would lead to better survey knowledge was not supported by the data and potential reasons for this finding are discussed. Results provided support for the hypothesis that performance on laboratory paper-and-pencil spatial tasks would predict performance on the mapping tasks.\nThis study shows that comprehension and production mapping tasks do not elicit equivalent strategies or performance, and thus implies that caution is needed when selecting methods for mapping research. The finding that performing a search task in an environment with a map does not necessarily lead to better survey knowledge than exploring it without a map raises several questions about how map use might be related to the acquisition of survey knowledge more generally. More broadly, this study has implications for the design of mobile mapping devices and the education of map skills.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [89], "author_name_tesi": "Christensen, Adam Eric", "last_name_ssi": "Christensen", "middle_name_ssi": "Eric", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lynn Susan Liben", "Lynn Susan Liben", "Rick Owen Gilmore", "Richard Alan Carlson", "Alexander Klippel", "Eric Loken"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lynn Susan Liben, Dissertation Advisor", "Lynn Susan Liben, Committee Chair", "Rick Owen Gilmore, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Carlson, Committee Member", "Alexander Klippel, Committee Member", "Eric Loken, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["spatial cognition", "developmental psychology", "map", "map-use strategies", "constructivist theory", "spatial ability"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Synthesis and Cross-linking of Anthracene-based Polymers and Optimization of Single-phase Suzuki Polycondensation", "id": "27147", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12120", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conjugated alternating copolymers containing cross-linkable 9,10-bis(hexyloxy)anthracene moieties were synthesized via Suzuki cross-coupling polymerization.

In recent years, scholars have increasingly examined how non-Western cultures make Christianity their own through existing linguistic, social, and cultural practices.  For scholars of colonial Latin America, this interest has chiefly settled on Central Mexico and the evangelization of the Nahuas (Aztecs).  Recent advances in the translation of the written language of the Nahuas (Nahuatl) have allowed for a better understanding of how the Nahuas and their culture contributed to the formation of a unique brand of Catholicism\u2014a Nahua version of Christianity sometimes referred to as \u201cMexican Catholicism.\u201d  Yet despite the excellence of such studies, their intimate focus on Central Mexico unintentionally creates a uniform, Nahua portrait of religion that encompasses all the diverse cultures of Mesoamerica.  Such studies also generally limit their examination to a particular set of Nahuatl sources, thus restricting their ability to appreciate the variation and evolution of the Catholic message that indigenous-language religious texts conveyed.

Overall, this study compares religious texts written in Nahuatl and Maya to illustrate how Christianity\u2019s continual negotiation with linguistic, cultural, and everyday barriers produced various Catholic messages\u2014and thus Catholicisms\u2014tailored to the local demands of a colonial New World.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4540], "author_name_tesi": "Christensen, Mark  Zinn", "last_name_ssi": "Christensen", "middle_name_ssi": "Zinn", "first_name_ssi": "Mark ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Bennett Restall", "Matthew Bennett Restall", "Anthony Roeber", "Solsiree Del Moral", "Kenneth Gale Hirth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Bennett Restall, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Bennett Restall, Committee Chair", "Anthony Roeber, Committee Member", "Solsiree Del Moral, Committee Member", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nahua", "Maya", "Aztec", "Religion", "Mesoamerica"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Flow Reactor Autoignition Studies of Iso-octane at High Pressures and Low-to-intermediate Temperatures", "id": "14556", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7152", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The trend in internal combustion engine and aviation gas turbine design is moving increasingly toward a computational approach, requiring well-validated chemical kinetics models. Autoignition delay measurements are among the key set of validation data used by chemical kinetics modelers. Autoignition is an ignition event that occurs when the mixture reaches conditions of temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio such that the rate of chain branching exceeds the rate of chain termination. In this case there is no external ignition source, such as a spark or initiating flame. Iso-octane, the compound studied in this work, is one of the fuels used to establish the octane rating for gasoline. Recently it has become of further interest as a component in fuel mixtures referred to as surrogate fuel mixtures such as JP-8. These surrogate fuel mixtures consist of only a few compounds that behave chemically in a manner similar to a practical fuel.\nStudies of autoignition of iso-octane were conducted in a high-pressure flow reactor. A novel methodology was employed in which the minimum equivalence ratio required for ignition was established for specific conditions of pressure, temperature, and residence time. Liquid iso-octane was spray injected into the products of a hydrogen/oxygen/argon preburner, and the resulting vaporized mixture was then rapidly mixed with air in the high-pressure flow reactor. Autoignition delay times were obtained at pressures of 15, 17.5, 20, and 22.5 atm, for a temperature range of 640-850 K. Residence times of approximately 70, 100, 125, 155, and 175 ms were investigated over equivalence ratios ranging from 0.25 to 0.8. \nVery few previous iso-octane ignition delay studies have investigated the conditions included in the present study. However, the current experiments have some overlapping pressure and temperature conditions (15 atm and 650-850 K) with rapid compression machine experiments. The rapid compression machine results are all for stoichiometric mixtures, whereas the current results are for equivalence ratios ranging from 0.37-0.8. The results from this work are useful for model validation as they are consistent with trends from previous studies and extend into a range of pressures, temperatures, and equivalence ratios not previously investigated.\nThe onset of autoignition for all pressures occurred at approximately 640K. Trends in the results showed that as temperature increased, the threshold equivalence ratio decreased. As temperature increased further into the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region, the threshold equivalence ratio increased with increasing temperature. The NTC behavior started at temperatures of approximately 700-725K and ended at approximately 775K. At temperatures above 775K, the threshold equivalence ratio again decreased with increasing temperature. Pressure also had a strong effect on ignition delay. For all conditions, as pressure increased the threshold equivalence ratio decreased.\nResults were compared with two chemical kinetics models. Good agreement was shown with a model from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) for the conditions studied in this work. The main discrepancy between the experimental and modeling results was the overprediction of the threshold equivalence ratio in the NTC region at the shorter ignition delay times. For example, at the residence time of 70 ms, a pressure of 15 atm, and temperature of 775 K, the threshold equivalence ratios found experimentally and by the model were 0.75 and 0.95, respectively. At the longest residence time of 175 ms at the same conditions of pressure (15 atm) and temperature (775 K), the threshold equivalence ratios found experimentally and by the model were much closer at 0.44 and 0.47, respectively. The second model from Chemical Reaction Engineering and Chemical Kinetics (CRECK) gave similar results as the experiment for the temperature at the onset of autoignition, but showed no presence of the NTC region that was observed experimentally and predicted by the LLNL model. Neither the LLNL nor CRECK model predicted autoignition below temperatures of 650 K.\nThe LLNL model was used to identify key reactions controlling ignition through reaction pathway and temperature sensitivity analyses for the conditions of this study. The results showed the importance of the location of H-atom abstraction from the         iso-octane molecule in determining how reactions proceeded.

Sturm (2007) found that herbivory on some species could be directly attributable to either horse or deer. However, the effects of sika (Cervus nippon) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herbivory could not be separated via an exclosure study design because of the difficulty of passively excluding one deer species but not the other. Thus, this research project was conducted to describe habitat use of sika and white-tailed deer and possibly attribute herbivory on some plant species to specific deer species if spatial separation in habitat use could be identified. \nI captured white-tailed deer and sika deer in January\u2013March of 2006 and 2007 throughout the Maryland portion of Assateague Island. Deer were fitted with radio-collars and their survival and locations monitored via ground telemetry. Up to four locations were acquired per deer each week during early (May\u2013June) and late (August\u2013September) growth periods for vegetation on the island. Also, I estimated deer locations during a dormant vegetation period (November\u00ac\u2013December 2006). I used these data to estimate survival and harvest rates, document movements, and model habitat use.\nI captured and fitted 50 deer with radio-collars over the course of the study. Of these 50 deer, 36 were sika and 14 were white-tailed deer. Of the 36 sika deer, 10 were harvested, three were likely killed by hunters but not recovered, and one died of natural causes while giving birth. Of the 14 white-tailed deer, three were harvested, one was illegally killed, and two were censored because of study-related mortality.\nAnnual survival was 0.48 (95% CI = 0.16\u20130.82) for male white-tailed deer, 0.74 (95% CI = 0.44\u20130.91) for female white-tailed deer, 0.56 (95% CI = 0.35\u20130.75) for male sika deer, and 0.86 (95% CI = 0.70\u20130.94) for female sika deer. The harvest rate was 0.12 (95% CI = 0.04\u20130.27) for female sika deer, 0.44 (95% CI = 0.25\u20130.65) for male sika deer, 0.18 (95% CI = 0.05\u20130.51) for female white-tailed deer, and 0.38 (95% CI = 0.10\u20130.78) for male white-tailed deer. Annual survival rates for both species were similar to what has been observed in other populations. Unfortunately, small sample sizes for male white-tailed deer limited inferences about harvest and survival rates, but harvest rates of females for both species were similar to other published studies.  Hunting was the primary cause of mortality, and outside the hunting season survival was 0.98\u20131.00 for all species and sexes.\nI found that the home range area of sika deer was much greater than the home range area of white-tailed deer, but failed to detect any difference between sexes or among seasons.  Sika deer also made long-distance movements and left the Maryland portion of Assateague Island. No sika deer left Assateague island during our study, but I did document the dispersal of a male white-tailed deer to the mainland. In their native range, sika deer have been able to readily expand populations and occupy vacant habitat (Kaji et al. 2000 and Kaji et al. 2004). The long distance movements I observed on Assateague Island, especially relative to white-tailed deer, may reflect the ability of this species to exploit food resources that may be limited in quality or quantity, or both.  However, I did not collect data to assess use of food resources by sika deer and whether this may have influenced long distance movements.\nI found both species of deer were less likely to use a habitat the further it was located from cover, which was defined as tall shrub or forest vegetation.  For every 10 m from cover each species of deer was 1.23\u20131.38 times less likely to use any given habitat.\nPatterns in use of vegetation classes were similar across species and seasons. Relative to forest habitat, both species avoided dune herbaceous, disturbed lands, sand, and water categories. Both species neither avoided nor preferred developed herbaceous, low shrub, marsh herbaceous, and tall shrub categories compared to the forest category.\nHowever, there were consistent differences between the two species. During spring white-tailed deer were more likely than sika deer to use forested, tall shrub, disturbed herbaceous, and sand areas, but were less likely to use all other habitats. During summer, habitat use was similar between the two species except that white-tailed deer tended to use forested habitat more. During winter, white-tailed deer were less likely to use dune herbaceous, low shrub, and forested habitats than sika deer.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5461], "author_name_tesi": "Christensen, Sonja Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Christensen", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Sonja", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["white-tailed deer", "resource selection", "Habitat use", "sika deer"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization Approach to Procedural Noise Mitigation for Near-ground Aircraft", "id": "17566", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8318", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis demonstrates the viability and utility of using contemporary multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to minimize the noise impact of military aircraft on residential areas in the vicinity of airbases by suggesting novel flight procedures. That is, this thesis is searching for an algorithmic means of finding paths through the sky that aircraft can take which offer good performance in terms of noise as well as in terms of other possible flight metrics (e.g. fuel consumption). To do this, the current version of the US Navy noise-modelling program (NoiseMap 7) is combined with a recent multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (epsilon-MOEA).\n\nFirst, an overview of the pertinent mathematics of optimization is given, during which the uses of both an evolutionary algorithm and the multi-objective approach are defended. The basic acoustics of noise are discussed and a method for the aggregation of noise exposure across physically distributed populations is presented. The formulation of NoiseMap as a multi-objective optimization problem follows. A complication that makes the NoiseMap/epsilon-MOEA combination inefficient is discussed, and a solution is proposed and shown to be effective. Several other multi-objective optimization problems are presented which will be used for benchmarking and refining the optimization method.\n\nThe population distribution of the Asheville, NC area is used as a hypothetical test case for this method. Several experimental optimizations are run serially so that the results of one inform the formulation of the next. The ultimate result is an optimization approach which, if appropriately parallelized on a modern desktop computer, can consistently produce subjectively accurate results within the span of 8 hours. The utility that is afforded to a decision maker by having these results is presented. Future directions for refinement and improvement of this method are discussed.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8233], "author_name_tesi": "Christian, Andrew W", "last_name_ssi": "Christian", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor Ward Sparrow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor Ward Sparrow, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Acoustics", "Aircraft noise", "Community noise", "Multi-objective optimization", "Evolutionary optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Modeling Laser-generated Cavitation Bubbles", "id": "15083", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7276", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cavitation erosion is a flow phenomenon where the collapse of cavitating vapor bubbles against a solid surface leads to the erosion of the surface. Cavitation affects various types of turbomachinery, including impeller blades, valves and ship propeller blades, and can affect both the performance and the life-cycle of a machine. A significant amount of research regarding cavitation erosion has focused on the formation and collapse of a single bubble. In experimental research a laser is often used to generate a bubble near a solid surface; mimicking the flow dynamics of cavitation erosion. An experimental setup was devised where a single cavitation bubble was generated using a Nd:YAG laser. A thermal analysis of the formation of a laser-generated cavitation bubble was conducted using the open source CFD package OpenFOAM to model the heating of the water by the laser. The collapse of a laser-generated cavitation bubble was also modeled computationally using a compressible multiphase finite volume method.\n\nIt was determined experimentally that a typical laser-generated cavitation bubble has a maximum radius on the order of 1 mm. A single bubble with a maximum radius of 1 mm and a collapse time of approximately 190 microseconds was used to model the size and shape of a laser-generated cavitation bubble. Using CFD the collapse of a single bubble in a free field was analyzed and compared to the solution of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation, as well as experimental data. The collapse of a single bubble against a solid wall was then modeled, varying the standoff distance to the wall in order to observe the different bubble dynamics discussed in the literature. The compressible multiphase flow method successfully modeled the dynamics of the bubble collapse; including both the high pressure pulse emitted upon collapse as well as the microjet that forms during collapse and travels from the center of the bubble towards the wall.
