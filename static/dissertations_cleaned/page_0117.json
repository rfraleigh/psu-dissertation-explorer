These issues are expanding the potential market for energy efficiency retrofits in commercial buildings since it is not viable to reconstruct all the existing inefficient building stock. There is an urgent need to change current energy-efficiency practices and rein in energy consumption. \nExisting commercial building stock in U.S. is currently being retrofitted at a low rate. Moreover, the current retrofit projects typically do not provide deep energy savings. The actual market for energy retrofits is small compared to its potential due to a variety of barriers. Conventional approaches to energy retrofits focus on individual energy efficiency measures and do not consider the interactions between building systems. To advance the energy retrofit process, it is vital to understand how buildings use energy. This issue typically prevents accurate predictions of baseline energy use and the technical potential for energy reduction in a building. In this context, building plug load is generally ignored or underestimated, and its potential for energy savings is underutilized.\nThis research examines two case studies through plug load field monitoring to characterize plug loads in office buildings. Data obtained from case studies and existing literature are used to construct improved case scenarios to reduce plug loads in a large office building that is undergoing a deep energy retrofit. The effectiveness of plug load reduction strategies and their interaction with the other building loads in office buildings are evaluated through whole building energy simulation to provide quantitative outcomes to reveal the relationship between plug loads and the potential for deep energy savings in office buildings.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6359], "author_name_tesi": "TUTAR, TOLGA ", "last_name_ssi": "TUTAR", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "TOLGA", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David R Riley Ii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David R Riley Ii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["plug load", "energy-efficiency", "deep energy retrofit", "energy audit"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Logarithmic Quantile Estimation and Its Applications to Nonparametric Factorial Designs", "id": "22451", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10104", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation we prove an almost sure weak limit theorem for simple linear rank statistics for samples with continuous distribution functions. As a corollary, the result extends to samples with ties and the vector version of an almost sure central limit theorem for vectors of linear rank statistics. Moreover, we derive a weak convergence result for some quadratic forms. These results are then applied to quantile estimation and to hypothesis testing for nonparametric statistical designs, here demonstrated by the c-sample problem, where the samples may be dependent.

Composite nanoparticles (NPs) are of special interest since the use of two or more materials in NP design imparts multifunctionality on the final NP constructs.  This is especially relevant for applications in areas of human healthcare, where the use of dye or drug doped composite NPs is expected to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other serious illnesses.  Since the physicochemical properties of NP suspensions dictate the success of these systems in biomedical applications, especially drug delivery of chemotherapeutics, synthetic routes which offer precise control of NP properties, especially particle diameter and colloidal stability, are utilized to form a variety of composite NPs.  Formation of NPs in reverse, or water-in-oil, micelles is one such synthetic approach.  However, while the use of reverse micelles to form composite NPs offers precise control over NP size and shape, the post-synthesis laundering and dispersion of synthesized NP suspensions can still be a challenge.  Reverse micelle synthetic approaches require the use of surfactants and low dielectric constant solvents, like hexane and cyclohexane, as the oil phase, which can compromise the biocompatibility and colloidal stability of the final composite NP suspensions.  Therefore, appropriate dispersants and solvents must be used during laundering and dispersion to remove surfactant and ensure stability of synthesized NPs.  In the work presented in this dissertation, two laundering and dispersion approaches, including packed column high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and centrifugation (sedimentation and redispersion), are investigated for silver core silica (Ag-SiO2) and calcium phosphosilicate (Caw(HxPO4)y(Si(OH)zOa)b.cH2O, CPS) composite NP suspensions synthesized in a cyclohexane/ polyoxyethylene (5) nonylphenylether (Igepal\u00ae CO-520) /water reverse micelle system.  \n\tIn Chapter 3, an HPLC laundering and dispersion approach for Ag-SiO2 composite NPs is studied.  The deposition and detachment behavior of 5 w/w 3- aminopropyltriethoxy silane (APTES) dispersed Ag-SiO2 suspensions on 1 w/o, 5 w/o and 15 w/o APTES treated SiO2 column stationary phase microspheres is investigated with respect to final % mass yields for collected NP suspensions.  Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) studies confirm multilayer deposition of Ag-SiO2 NPs during loading and retention on the column during laundering stages of the process independent of w/o APTES treatment on stationary phase microspheres, with individual deposited Ag-SiO2 NPs observed to be in the 20-30 nm diameter range.  Patchy deposition patterns and irreversible agglomeration are also confirmed via FESEM, as fractions of loaded Ag-SiO2 NPs remain attached on the 1 w/o, 5 w/o and 15 w/o APTES stationary phases after completion of the collecting stage of the process.  Column experiments monitored by UV \u2013visible spectroscopy, along with % mass yield calculations, suggest that the use of 5 w/o and 15 w/o APTES treated stationary phases increases overall Ag-SiO2 NP % mass yield in the final collected suspensions when compared to 1 w/o APTES treated materials when using 70:30 ethanol:water (by volume) at operational pH 6 as mobile phase solvent mixture during the collecting stage.  This is in agreement with the prediction that an increasing amine surface coverage on SiO2 stationary phase microspheres will result in increased electrostatic repulsive interactions during the collecting stage of the process.  A modified DLVO theory is used to calculate total interaction energies (kT) and attachment efficiencies (in %) for each of the three stages of the packed column HPLC process,  but is shown not to be in agreement with experimental observations due to low attachment efficiencies (%)calculated for the laundering stage of the process.  \n\tIn Chapter 4, a packed column HPLC process, which is used to launder and disperse CPSNPs synthesized in cyclohexane/Igepal\u00ae CO-520/water reverse micelles and dispersed with 50 w/w citrate, is investigated.  Similar to laundering approach reported in Chapter 3 for the Ag-SiO2 system, it consists of a loading, laundering and collecting stage, where solvent mixtures of varying dielectric constants are used as mobile phases to control colloidal interactions and support either deposition or detachment of CPSNPs from the packed column SiO2 stationary phase microspheres.  FESEM studies on stationary phase samples recovered after loading and laundering stages confirm multilayer deposition of CPSNPs, indicating favorable conditions for attachment.  SEM/EDS analysis of fractions collected during each stage of the process confirms removal of surfactant and spectator ions during the loading and laundering stages of the process, while presence of Ca, P and Si is confirmed for the NP suspensions collected during the collecting stage of the process.  The dielectric constant of the mobile phase solvent mixture is found to influence the deposition and detachment of CPSNPs, as confirmed via modified DLVO theory calculations for the loading, laundering and collecting stages of packed column HPLC process.  As expected, the DLVO calculations show that CPSNP removal is dependent on particle diameter, with smaller CPSNPs (< 20 nm) most likely lost during the loading and laundering stages of the process.  Based on modified DLVO theory, high (~100%) attachment efficiencies are predicted for the loading and laundering stages, indicating that CPSNPs are deposited and retained on the column media.  For the collecting stage of the process, detachment is predicted due to low attachment efficiencies calculated based on DLVO theory interaction energy curves.  \n\tIn Chapter 5, the development of two liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques for the measurement of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) dopant in CPSNP suspensions is presented and discussed.  The first LC-MS/MS technique is limited due to a lack of validation for accuracy and precision, while the second, improved technique is successfully employed to determine the dependence of 5-FU dopant concentrations in CPSNP suspensions based on key synthetic parameters, including: micelle exchange time, addition of 5-FU drug to microemulsion A versus microemulsion B during synthesis, and scaling up of synthetic volume from 1x to 3x.  Based on 5-FU concentrations (nM) measured by the improved LC-MS/MS method, a micelle exchange time of 2 minutes with the addition of the drug to microemulsion A is determined to be sufficient for adequate drug encapsulation for the typical 1x volume CPSNP synthetic procedure.  This synthetic approach is then used in all studies reported in the Chapter 6.\n\tIn Chapter 6, the effects of two laundering and dispersion approaches on the physicochemical properties, including particle diameter and morphology, drug encapsulation efficiencies and residual surfactant concentrations of final 5-FU doped CPSNP suspensions are studied.  A centrifugation (sedimentation and redispersion) laundering and dispersion approach is developed and compared to a packed column HPLC laundering and dispersion approach where ~200 \u00b5m soda lime silicate glass spheres are utilized as the column packing material.  Particle morphology and state of dispersion are assessed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and compared for 5-FU doped and ghost CPSNP suspensions laundered via either centrifugation or packed column HPLC.  Suspensions are confirmed to have a spherical morphology and appear well dispersed independent of laundering method.  Analyses of lognormal diameter distributions by number indicate that the doping of CPSNPs with 5-FU during CPSNP particle formation results in an increase in overall particle diameter independent of laundering method for the 50 w/w citrate CPSNP suspensions.  Post-laundering secondary functionalization with polyethyelene glycol (PEG) and gastrin 10 (g10) is found to improve the colloidal stability of the final 5-FU doped CPSNP suspensions.  Encapsulation efficiencies (%) determined from 5-FU dopant concentrations (nM) measured using LC-MS/MS and are low (< 1%), indicating that the synthetic approach reported here needs to modified to improve capture of 5-FU molecules in the CPSNP matrix.  Based on optical density (OD) measurements via UV-visible spectroscopy, the residual surfactant concentrations for both 5-FU-CPSNP-citrate and ghost-CPSNP-citrate suspensions laundered by centrifugation are approximately an order of magnitude lower when compared to packed column HPLC laundered CPSNP suspensions (10-5 M for centrifugation versus 10-4 M for packed column HPLC), suggesting that multiple laundering cycles are necessary to improve surfactant removal using the packed HPLC approach presented here.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11016], "author_name_tesi": "Tabakovic, Amra ", "last_name_ssi": "Tabakovic", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair", "Gary Lynn Messing", "Gail Lynn Matters", "Christine Dolan Keating"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Member", "Gail Lynn Matters, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanoparticles", "nanoparticle laundering", "nanotechnology", "biomedicine", "drug delivery"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "PREDICTIVE HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER MODEL OF PLANT-BASED ROOFING MATERIALS FOR ASSESSMENT OF ENERGY SAVINGS\n", "id": "10211", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4980", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Green roofs are becoming popular in the U.S. with the green roof industry growing at a rate of 30-50% from 2001 to 2008. Green roofs are a sustainable technology that could potentially offer several benefits to society and the environment. There have been several models proposing different ways to represent models of green roof systems. Until now, none of these models have been properly verified and validated.  Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no single study that has measured all of the important heat and mass transfer processes simultaneously.\n\nThus, the overall objective of this thesis is to develop a predictive heat and mass transfer model for green roof systems in summer conditions. The model is also verified and validated with experimental data from the \u201cCold Plate,\u201d an experimental apparatus specifically designed and built to quantify heat and mass transfer processes. The \u201cCold Plate\u201d apparatus represents a new kind of apparatus that addresses the shortcomings in the existing data sets on energy balance for green roofs. Experiments were conducted in a full-scale environmental chamber that simulated outdoor conditions. Currently, there is no other experimental apparatus that simultaneously measures the same physical phenomena.\n\nOverall, more than 10 experiments were conducted inside the environmental chamber.  Evapotranspiration had the role of controlling the intensity of all other heat fluxes by modulating or diverting incoming and outgoing heat fluxes, depending on the state of the plants and environmental conditions.  Interestingly, the lowest conductive heat fluxes through the green roof were consistently found when the green roof was the wettest. This finding also addresses the old dilemma regarding the tradeoffs between having a dry or a wet green roof.\n\nA new green roof model is proposed. The model considers heat and mass transfer processes between the sky, plants, and substrate. Based on laboratory experimental data collected in the \u201cCold Plate\u201d apparatus, a new substrate resistance to soil evaporation is introduced. Moreover, previous functions to calculate plant resistance for transpiration calculation are evaluated and the functions that best approximate the measured values are selected. These two steps are important for correct evapotranspiration calculations and have not been done previously. \n\nFinally, the new green roof model is validated using quasi-steady state experimental data from the \u201cCold Plate.\u201d The validation shows that the model tends to predict most of the heat and mass transfer appropriately, but tends to underestimate maximal evapotranspiration. Further research on convective heat transfer on plants is recommended, as well as a spectral reflectivity measurement of the substrate to improve the accuracy of the model. The final step before model implementation into a building energy simulation will be a dynamic validation using detailed laboratory and field data.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4957], "author_name_tesi": "Tabares Velasco, Paulo Cesar  ", "last_name_ssi": "Tabares Velasco", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Paulo Cesar ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jelena Srebric", "Jelena Srebric", "Bohumil Kasal", "Stanley Allan Mumma", "Robert Berghage Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jelena Srebric, Dissertation Advisor", "Jelena Srebric, Committee Chair", "Bohumil Kasal, Committee Member", "Stanley Allan Mumma, Committee Member", "Robert Berghage Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["roof heat fluxes", "heat and mass transfer", "building energy", "evapotranspiration", "green roofs", "vegetated roof"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "TISSUE CULTURE AND TRANSFORMATION STUDIES OF JATROPHA CURCAS, A SECOND GENERATION BIOFUEL CROP \n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12627", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "819", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Jatropha curcas L.

Time scales of cells signaling cascades triggered by shear stress spans seconds to hours. Hence, a single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy system was developed to investigate cellular molecular dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. We defined a procedure to locate lipoid dyes in cultured endothelial cells under physiological conditions. Thus, we assessed the photophysics and dynamics of the lipid analogues DiI-C12 and DiI-C18 in endothelial cells subjected to physiological fluid shear stress. These lipoid dyes have been proposed to segregate to domains of the membrane with thicknesses matching DiI alkyl chain length such that DiI-C12 partitions into the thinner liquid-disordered phase and DiI-C18 partitions into the thicker liquid-ordered phase. DiI fluorescence lifetime, molecular brightness, number of molecules, and lateral diffusion were obtained from time-correlated single photon counting data and analyzed as a function of shear stress and time. DiI-C12 fluorescence lifetime was 0.16 ns faster than DiI-C18 lifetime and the diffusion coefficient of DiI-C12 was 1.5 times greater than the DiI-C18 diffusion coefficient confirming that DiI-C12 probes more fluid membrane environments as compared to DiI-C18. Domains probed by DiI-C12 dye exhibited a decrease of fluorescence lifetime from 5 to 20 seconds after the onset of shear while domains probed by DiI-C18 exhibited a decrease of fluorescence lifetime that was delayed 10 seconds but was sustained for the 2 minutes the cells were subjected to flow. Determination of the number of fluorophores in the observation volume from moment analysis suggested that DiI-C12 -labeled domains increased in area while DiI-C18 -stained membrane did not. Taken together, the data suggest that shear stress induces an early rippling of DiI-C12 \u2013stained domains and later change in lipid mobility of DiI-C18 \u2013stained domains.

Activation of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) is critical for mediating the rewarding and addictive properties of opioids.  Recent research suggests that MOR signaling is modulated by proteins that interact with MOR to form multiprotein signalplexes.  The goal of my thesis research is to understand how MOR interacting proteins contribute to the molecular adaptations induced by opioid exposure and addiction.  To achieve this goal, I developed a rodent model for \"addiction-like\" behaviors for heroin that serves as a platform for investigating potential underlying neural substrates involved in the development of opioid addiction.  My central hypothesis is that the transition from opioid use to opioid addiction is accompanied by differential regulation of MOR interacting proteins. \nCriteria for \"addiction-like\" behaviors in rats have been established for cocaine (Deroche-Gamonet et. al., 2004), and I evaluated whether similar behaviors can be observed in rats following the intake of an opioid drug.  I used a rat model of heroin self-administration that included key features of human addiction.  Thus, responding for heroin was examined in 43 male Sprague-Dawley rats given the opportunity to intravenously self-administer heroin for 27 sessions.  Criteria for addiction-like behaviors included greater drug seeking during periods of signaled non-availability, an increased willingness to work for drug when tested with a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, and greater lack of satisfaction and increased drug-seeking during timeout periods.  My study revealed that although all rats self-administered approximately the same amount of heroin, only 9.3% of rats met all criteria for \"addiction-like\" behaviors.  Additionally, behavior during the initial timeout and signaled non-availability periods (onset activity) was found to be an early predictor of the severity of \"addiction-like\" behavior that a rat would develop by the end of the study.\nTo gain an understanding of the molecular changes that accompany the development of behavioral criteria for \"addiction-like\" behavior, I analyzed the protein expression of known MOR interacting proteins and the D2 dopamine receptor.  Western blotting was used to assess protein expression in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens from 14 rats from the heroin self-administration study.  I found a differential expression of the D2 dopamine receptor, spinophilin, and wntless that correlated with behavioral evidence of \"addiction-like behaviors.\"  These changes in protein expression may reflect molecular correlates of the development of opioid addiction.\nUsing a modified membrane yeast two-hybrid screen, our laboratory recently identified VAMP-associated protein A (VAPA) as a candidate MOR interacting protein.  VAPA is highly expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and functions in vesicular docking and exocytosis.  In this dissertation, I confirmed that VAPA is a bona fide MOR interacting protein in vivo using co-immunoprecipitation and immunoelectron microscopy.  To determine if VAPA plays a role in the transition to opioid dependence, I examined VAPA expression in morphine-treated mice harboring a common genetic variant of MOR (A112G allele).  In both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice expressing the variant allele, an increase in VAPA protein expression was found.  These results suggest that changes in VAPA expression may potentially contribute to the development of opioid addiction.\nThe research in this thesis is important because it uses a novel model of \"addiction-like\" behavior in rats self-administering heroin to analyze the expression of MOR interacting proteins in key brain regions that mediate reward and addiction.  My data suggest that spinophilin and wntless are potential molecular substrates that accompany the transition from opioid exposure to opioid addiction.  Future research is needed to demonstrate a cause and effect relationship between the expression of MOR interacting proteins and \"addiction-like\" behaviors.  To test whether wntless or spinophilin are important neural substrates for opioid addiction, experiments can be designed to determine if the development of \"addiction-like\" behaviors can be prevented by blocking the interaction of the MOR with wntless or spinophilin.  Further studies are also required to test my working hypothesis that VAPA is involved in the intracellular trafficking of MOR along the vesicular pathway and that this process is altered in the presence of a chronic opioid agonist.  Understanding the role of VAPA in MOR translocation to the cell surface will provide insight into additional mechanisms of receptor regulation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9081], "author_name_tesi": "Tacelosky, Diana Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Tacelosky", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Diana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson", "Robert G Levenson", "Richard Bernard Mailman", "Arthur Steven Berg", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy", "Willard Freeman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Chair", "Richard Bernard Mailman, Committee Member", "Arthur Steven Berg, Special Member", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy, Special Member", "Willard Freeman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["opioids", "heroin", "addiction", "animal model", "mu-opioid receptor", "addiction-like behavior"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Male Molding Fabrication Process Development with Composite Materials", "id": "16351", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8221", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Processes used to fabricate thick composite beams were developed.  The advantage of female molding, which is typically used, is that it provides a smooth outer molded surface.  However, the lay-up process is labor intensive, and the two halves need to be joined in a secondary operation.  Male molding is generally less labor intensive, and allows the beam to be fabricated as a single part, thus eliminates the need to join separately fabricated sections.  In the work described herein, a male molding beam fabrication process was developed that results in a smooth outer surface. This was achieved through the use of caul (external) tooling.  De-bulk cycles were used to consolidate the laminate and reduce the degree of wrinkling on the surface of the male molded part.  This paper also provides examples of innovative methods currently and formerly used in industry to both contrast and compare the methods to be used during experimentation.  Trials were done on a tapered male foam mandrel using lay-ups of 10 ply increments (about 0.25\u201d thick).  About 100 plys of composite prepreg material were used during the process trials, which involved innovative in-situ gap fillers implemented between caul sections.  In this way, the entire surface can be tooled.  It was found that this was necessary to eliminate the occurrence of wrinkles and ridges during de-bulk of the laminate.  Results showed that thick beams can be male molded to achieve a smooth outer surface with the use of corner and flat caul blocks accompanied by in-situ caul gap fillers.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8150], "author_name_tesi": "Tachie-menson, Yooku ", "last_name_ssi": "Tachie-menson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yooku", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis K Mclaughlin", "Thomas David Juska", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis K Mclaughlin, Thesis Advisor", "Thomas David Juska, Thesis Advisor", "George A Lesieutre, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["debulk", "spar", "composite", "materials", "caul", "male molding"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Protect My Child, A New Paradigm in Parental Control", "id": "13455jxt958", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "13455", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parental control systems have existed for years and enjoy a sizable market.  Recent advances in computing provide opportunities to apply new ideas to the parental control problem.  Protect My Child (PMC) is a new paradigm in parental control systems.  Targeted towards mobile devices, PMC relies on the notions of ubiquitous computing and high connectivity.  PMC is fully mobile, allowing parents to control child devices from their own tablets or smartphones without the need for physical access to the child\u2019s device.  PMC provides intuitive, fine-grained, remote control of sensitive operations including text messaging, phone calls and app installs.   By modeling the natural request-response paradigm that exists between parents and children, PMC facilitates in-band modification of access control policy.  Child devices initially deny access to sensitive operations.  When an operation is denied, the child is able, from his or her device, to request a policy change from the parents.  The parents are immediately notified of the request on their own devices, where they may grant or deny access to the operation.  The parental decision is sent back to the child device where it is stored and the access control policy is updated.  This approach to access control avoids unintentional access to, or unintentional denial of, sensitive operations.\n\nPMC mediates SMS text messages and phone calls by phone number, and app installation by app.  The fine-grained control described above may be combined with coarse-grained controls as well.  PMC mediation of phone calls and text messaging may be remotely enabled or disabled by the parents.  For app installs, PMC offers three modes of mediation: request-each, age appropriate and allow-all.  Request-each mode requires one-time explicit permission to install each app.  Age appropriate mode implicitly allows installation of age appropriate apps based on the child\u2019s age and app ratings, but requires one-time explicit permission to install each more restrictively rated app.  Allow-all mode implicitly allows all app installs.\n\nPMC also offers many industry standard parental control features, such as location tracking, emergency notifications, remote device locking, app locking and contact white/black lists.  The design employs proven security principles to provide an effective, privacy-respecting parental control system.  A prototype of the PMC system was implemented based on the Android Open Source Project and evaluated running on commodity devices.  The PMC system is found to mediate all sensitive operations with no unintentional denials and without unintentionally granting access to sensitive operations.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13410], "author_name_tesi": "Tack, Jonsimon ", "last_name_ssi": "Tack", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jonsimon", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu", "Danfeng Zhang", "Mahmut Kandemir"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu, Thesis Advisor", "Danfeng Zhang, Committee Member", "Mahmut Kandemir, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Parental Control", "Mobile Devices", "Child Safety"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Dendritic cells and IL-10 in nephrotoxic acute kidney injury\n\n", "id": "10292", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5235", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cisplatin is a highly effective chemotherapeutic agent used to treat a wide variety of tumors in humans. The key limitation with cisplatin therapy is nephrotoxicty affecting 25-35% of treated patients. Here we investigated the distribution of dendritic cells within the kidney and the role of dendritic cells and dendritic cell-produced IL-10 in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury using a mouse model in which dendritic cells express green fluorescent protein and diphtheria toxin receptor. Dendritic cells were found interspersed between renal tubules throughout the tubulointerstitium but not in glomeruli.  The functional significance of dendritic cells within their physiological context in cisplatin nephrotoxicity was examined by depleting dendritic cells using diphtheria toxin.  Mice depleted of dendritic cells either before or coincident with cisplatin treatment, but not at later stages, exhibited more severe renal dysfunction, kidney tubular injury, neutrophil infiltration and greater mortality than dendritic cell non-depleted mice. Neutrophils and monocytes were abundant in the kidney at later stages of cisplatin nephrotoxicity. In contrast, infiltration of inflammatory dendritic cells was insignificant after cisplatin treatment. Through the use of bone marrow chimeric mice, we also confirmed that the exacerbated renal injury was mediated through the effect of diphtheria toxin on dendritic cells. Using mixed bone marrow chimeric mice, we showed that the worsening of cisplatin nephrotoxicity in dendritic cell-depleted mice occured independent of diphtheria toxin-mediated death of dendritic cells. Analysis of markers on renal dendritic cells after cisplatin treatment showed almost steady-state levels of expression of antigen presentation (MHC class I and MHC class II) and costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80 and CD86), and an increase in expression of IL-10 and ICOS-L. Further investigation using mixed bone marrow chimeric mice lacking dendritic cell-derived IL-10 showed a moderate level of attenuation of kidney injury by dendritic cell-produced IL-10. These data demonstrate that dendritic cells protect mice from cisplatin nephrotoxicity.        \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5213], "author_name_tesi": "Tadagavadi, Raghu Kempegowda", "last_name_ssi": "Tadagavadi", "middle_name_ssi": "Kempegowda", "first_name_ssi": "Raghu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith S Bond", "Judith S Bond", "W.

Rewards are offered to the workers to complete tasks either in the form of cash or gift cards. Crowdsourcing has become a common platform for businesses including multi-national companies, academic institutions, research, etc. for problem-solving to increase productivity and improve cost efficiency. Typical jobs that are performed using these services are image tagging, data categorizations, data collection, data analysis, sentiment analysis and survey. The requester could customize the jobs as per requirements and needs. The first question that hovers on our mind when considering these services would be the quality of the responses. The tasks are available online to any worker who wishes to respond to the task unless the requester has set restrictions (i.e., demographics, skills, etc.). Certain platforms offer workers with higher trust and skill levels which directly affects the quality of the respective crowdsourcing platform.\nWith increase in the number of crowdsourcing platforms available today there has also been a steep escalation in the number of online workers. Crowdsourcing is an extremely easy method for earning extra income for anybody i.e. elders, college students, graduates and professionals across the globe, as these workers are not monitored physically. As a result there has also \nbeen an increase in spam and less reliable workforce, making it impossible for quality responses. Certain services could be more reliable with higher skilled workers compared to others. Certain services have restrictions for workers to register like geographical location, skills, education and minimum age requirement; this helps improve the quality of a platform and also improve the probability of getting quality results.\nKosinski, Yoram, Bachrach, Kasneci, Van-Gael and Graepel in [2] talk about only evaluating the performance of workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk using an IQ questionnaire.

But no study has so far evaluated the performance of workers across several platforms.\nThis study in particular evaluates the skills and the performance levels of workers across platforms to understand if all platforms are similar; if all the platforms provide solutions of same quality; to understand if all the solutions obtained on all these platforms are comparable in terms of their productivity and quality; to evaluate if all the workers are the same with similar efficiency producing comparable results and; lastly do any external factors like skills, difficulty of tasks, geographical locations, rewards offered affect the efficiency and performance of these workers.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9487], "author_name_tesi": "Tadikonda, Aishwarya ", "last_name_ssi": "Tadikonda", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aishwarya", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dongwon Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dongwon Lee, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["crowdsourcing", "crowdflower", "clixsense", "neobux"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "3D IMAGE ANALYSIS FOR DEFINITION OF THE CHEST VASCULATURE\n\n", "id": "11621", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5027", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Robust and accurate segmentation of major chest blood vessels from multi-detector computed-tomography (MDCT) chest scans is vital for many pulmonary-imaging applications.  Segmented vessels are particularly important for safe, effective image-based bronchoscopic planning and guidance during which a biopsy needle must sample a suspect cancer region while avoiding nearby blood vessels.  Therefore, information about blood vessels is critical, as it can be utilized to find optimal biopsy-needle poses.  Moreover, segmented vessels can be visualized with other anatomical structures, such as the airway tree and lymph nodes, so that the physician gains better insight into a patient's case.  Segmented vessels also provide anatomical landmarks important for identification of central-chest lymph nodes.  Unfortunately, existing segmentation methods are inadequate for comprehensive segmentation of major central-chest vessels.\n\n\nThis thesis proposes a set of methods for segmentation of major vessels in the central chest and lungs.  These vessels are the aorta, pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, superior vena cava, left/right innominate veins, azygos vein, brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and peripheral lung vessels.  The method set consists of three parts: (1) automatic segmentation of the aorta and pulmonary artery, (2) semi-automatic segmentation of other central chest vessels, and (3) automatic segmentation of peripheral lung vessels.  The methods in (1) locate vessel landmarks using deformable models and a model-selection technique.  The methods employ these landmarks to extract a medial axis of a vessel and recover a vessel region.  The semi-automatic method of (2) requires the user to provide landmarks along the medial axis of a target vessel.  The segmentation of peripheral lung vessels (3) searches the entire lung volume for likely vessel cross-sections.  The method then forms vessel branches and lung vascular trees that have root vessels in the central chest.\n\n\nTo be useful in practice, this thesis also presents a working software system that allows the user to conveniently execute the methods and obtain results that are ready to use by other software tools used in the clinical workflow.  In addition, this thesis gives a preliminary study of using PET-CT data to enhance a lung-cancer diagnosis and bronchoscopy procedure planning.  Also, we validate the efficacy of the vessel-segmentation methods using ground-truth studies.  These studies demonstrate the strong potential of our methods for enhancing the ability to plan and guide a safe bronchoscopic procedure.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5003], "author_name_tesi": "Taeprasartsit, Pinyo ", "last_name_ssi": "Taeprasartsit", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pinyo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Evan Higgins", "Henry Joseph Sommer Iii", "Robert T Collins", "Jesse Louis Barlow", "William Evan Higgins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Evan Higgins, Dissertation Advisor", "Henry Joseph Sommer Iii, Committee Member", "Robert T Collins, Committee Member", "Jesse Louis Barlow, Committee Member", "William Evan Higgins, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["deformable model", "pulmonary artery", "aorta", "vasculature", "blood vessel", "segmentation", "image processing", "medical imaging"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "UTILIZING A SELF-QUESTIONING STRATEGY DESIGNED WITHIN A SELF-REGULATED STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACH TO PROMOTE IDEA GENERATION IN STUDENTS WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES\n", "id": "10998", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5218", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Students with learning disabilities (LD) often have problems generating ideas across academic areas.

The main issue in this study is the provisioning of Quality-of-Service (QoS) in an efficient way. The efficiency of some already-developed or proposed broadband networking techniques are investigated in terms of their ability and reliability in delivering QoS guaranteed services. Mainly, Multi-Protocol Over ATM (MPOA), Differentiated Services (DS), and Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) technologies are frequently discussed in this thesis. Also, other techniques are proposed, analyzed, and compared to some existing techniques.\n\n\nThe work in this thesis focuses mainly on second and third layer issues, with respect to the OSI seven layers model. This thesis contributes to a better understanding of the interaction and relations between the concepts of QoS, service disciplines, pricing, and revenues. Optimizing network systems operation is difficult without considering these concepts and the interaction between them.\n\n\nToward these objectives, the thesis starts with analyzing the performance of MPOA. The difference in the efficiency of this technique when implemented in Local Area Networks (LANs) or Wide Area Networks (WANs) is investigated. The caching operation and the cache table are recognized as the bottleneck in MPOA technique. Thus, a new cache table management system based on neural network technique is proposed and evaluated. \n\n\nThe thesis continues by investigating the usefulness of a Multi-Class Internet, specifically a bandwidth segregation approach is considered and analyzed. A special emphasis is exercised on the importance of connection-oriented networking techniques in enabling guaranteed QoS parameters. For this objective, a new technique for emulating connection-oriented services over IP layer is proposed and compared to the existing technique in an MPLS architecture.\n\n\nResource allocation may be considered as the most fundamental operation for the success of any multi-class network. Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) operation is analyzed at the call level, controlling the call blocking rate at different Classes-of-Service (CoSs) is considered as the objective. A novel DBA algorithm called Virtual Demand Distribution (VDD) is proposed and evaluated. The VDD algorithm utilizes signaling messages in a connection-oriented multi-class network to achieve more accurate prediction of demands in a non-stationary environment.\n\n\nAn attempt is made to extend the multi-class concept to mobile wireless networks. Preliminary ideas are proposed to design fading-aware TDMA multi-class mobile wireless local area networks. However, a detailed Multiple Access Control mechanism is proposed to create a two-class Packet Reservation Multiple Access (PRMA) protocol. A revenue comparison framework is developed, and the efficiency of this new protocol is evaluated based on this framework. This framework clarifies the meaning and interaction between the concepts of QoS metric, QoS score, service disciplines, willingness-to-pay, and revenue.\n\n\nThe thesis ends by a brief study of a very practical form of dynamic pricing, namely; the call-setup dynamic pricing. The problem is modeled as a discounted Markov decision process and e-optimal policies are found for several scenarios.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5706], "author_name_tesi": "Taha, Samer Marwan", "last_name_ssi": "Taha", "middle_name_ssi": "Marwan", "first_name_ssi": "Samer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Natarajan Gautam", "Mohsen Kavehrad", "John Metzner", "John F Doherty", "George Kesidis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Natarajan Gautam, Committee Member", "Mohsen Kavehrad, Committee Chair", "John Metzner, Committee Member", "John F Doherty, Committee Member", "George Kesidis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DS", "MPLS", "Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation", "Multiclass Internet", "MPOA", "Two-Class PRMA", "Dynamic Pricing"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Teacher Autonomy and Responsibility Variation and Their Association with Student Science Performance in Didaktik and Curriculum Traditions in PISA 2009", "id": "24890", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11093", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study is a cross-national analysis of teacher autonomy and responsibility in 12 countries representing curriculum (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand and United States) and didaktik (Austria, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) traditions. It addresses two main research questions. First, what is the variation of teacher autonomy and responsibility across schools in curriculum and didaktik countries? And second, what is the association of teacher autonomy and responsibility measures with students\u2019 science performance? Nationally representative data from 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) are used to address the two questions. Overall, teachers in didaktik countries enjoy more autonomy than teachers in curriculum countries as measured through three autonomy-specific variables pertaining to the use of standardized tests, teacher-developed tests and teacher judgments. On the other hand, more teachers, on average, enjoy responsibility in curriculum than in didaktik countries as measured through the proportion of teachers who were responsible for assessment policies, textbooks to be used, course content and courses offered at school level. However, the differences were statistically significant but substantively weak. Further, within-country associations of autonomy and responsibility measures with students\u2019 science performance were found in a few countries. Most notably, the findings suggest that the use of standardized tests is negatively associated with science performance in some of the within-country models, while the use of teacher-developed tests was positively associated with science performance in some sample countries in PISA 2009. Responsibility measures had less predictive power of science performance, and relationships existed only in few countries as per the analytical models and covariates accounted for. Cross-sectional nature of the data limits the extent of causal arguments to be made. However, the findings suggest that global push towards more standardized testing at national level is harming student science performance in some of the nations in curriculum and didaktik countries, while teacher-developed tests tend to be positively associated with science performance. Therefore, policy-makers might reconsider the support for standardized testing, which limits teacher autonomy, in favor of more teacher-driven assessment practices that increase autonomy. Further research is recommended to address teacher responsibility and complexities that accompany it in current stakeholder-crowded school contexts. Also, further studies on how teacher autonomy and teacher responsibility are negotiated with school principals and other educational authorities could provide valuable insights to better understand how teacher autonomy and responsibility could be enhanced for the benefit of improving student learning and performance.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10665], "author_name_tesi": "Tahirsylaj, Armend ", "last_name_ssi": "Tahirsylaj", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Armend", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David P Baker", "Richard Alan Duschl", "Liang Zhang", "Soo Yong Byun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David P Baker, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Alan Duschl, Dissertation Advisor", "Liang Zhang, Committee Member", "Soo Yong Byun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Didaktik", "Curriculum", "Teacher Autonomy", "Teacher Responsibility", "International Comparative Education", "PISA"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "KINETIC AND MECHANISTIC STUDY FOR THE ABIOTIC OXIDATION OF Fe(II)\nCATALYZED AT THE FERRIC (OXYHYDR)OXIDE AND SOLUTION INTERFACE\n\n", "id": "10218", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6868", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research dealt with the heterogeneous oxidation of Fe(II) by some environmentally significant contaminants including nitrite, uranium, and arsenate using Hydrous Ferric Oxide (HFO) as the catalytical solid phase in anoxic soil medium and sediments. It is the first study of the Fe(II)/Fe(III)/HFO system in which mass balance has been performed for both Fe(II) and all the oxidant species using a strictly anoxic environment at circumneutral pH. Fe(II) and HFO were used as the electron donor and catalytical solid phase because Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox couple is often dominant in controlling the redox potential in anoxic groundwater system and HFO is ubiquitous in soils and sediments, and it is an important adsorbent for a wide range of chemicals. The results showed that the reaction between Fe(II) and either NO2- or U(VI) was fast in the presence of HFO. The rate for the oxidation of Fe(II) and the reduction of either NO2- or U(VI) was found to be a function of dissolved Fe(II), solid-bound Fe(II) and oxidant concentration, and can be described by Rate = - koverall \u2022 [Fe(II)diss] \u2022 [Fe(II)solid-bound] \u2022 [Oxidant]. However, the reaction rate for Fe(II)/HFO/U(VI) was an order of magnitude faster than for nitrite, possibly due to high affinity of U(VI) to the HFO surface which could provide a shorter pathway for electron-transfer. Conservation of solid-bound Fe(II) was observed for either oxidant throughout the reaction with Fe(II)/HFO, therefore solid-bound Fe(II) functioned as a catalyst for the reduction of either oxidant by Fe(II). In experiments with nitrite or no oxidant in Fe(II)/HFO, concentration of Fe(II)solid-bound first increased less than 100% and then decreased coincident with partial conversion of HFO to goethite. When U(VI) was used as an oxidant, Fe(II)solid-bound increased and then remained constant such that solid-bound Fe(II) density was increased by 3 to 5 times compared to absence of U(VI). The significant increase of solid-bound Fe(II) in Fe(II)/U(VI) reaction could be due to the newly formed sorption sites created by the sorption and reductive precipitation of U(VI) and oxidative precipitation of Fe(II). The characterization of Fe(II)/Fe(III) systems from this study is consistent with several other recent studies that have supported the hypothesis that Fe(II) is incorporated into the bulk phase of Fe(III) oxides, rather than remaining at the interface, and that this unusual behavior results in apparently unique redox reactivity. Interestingly, overall rate constants declined when Fe(II)solid-bound  exceeded 0.02 mol Fe(II) per mol Fe(III), similar to results from previous studies using O2 and NO2- as oxidants.\n\nWe also investigated the effectiveness of two extractants, bicarbonate and phosphoric acid, on the quantification of U(VI) species during Fe(II)/U(VI) reaction in HFO suspension. Higher phosphate extractable U(VI) (U(VI)phosphate) than bicarbonate extractable U(VI) ( U(VI)bicarbonate ) was observed in all experiments. Interestingly, consumed U(VI)bicarbonate /consumed U(VI)phosphate ratios were about 2 in all the experiments. Using H3PO4 as an extracting reagent could increase U(VI) extractability from HFO suspension due to high solubility of HFO at pH 1.5. It is also possible that carbonate ligand stabilize U(V) species which was formed as a intermediate product of U(VI) reduction to U(IV), consistent with the mechanism that U(VI) reduction is an one-electron-transfer reaction followed by disproportionation of U(V) to U(VI) and U(IV) species. It was also found that when freshly prepared HFO was used as the solid phase in Fe(II)/U(VI) reaction, multiple stages reaction and a lag phase was observed. This study showed that the presence of reducing agents and dynamic mineral phases could increase the complexity of both uranium removal processes and operational procedures for quantifying uranium reduction.\n\nFe(II)/NO2- reaction was simulated using quantum mechanical calculation in both homogeneous and heterogeneous system to identify the favorable reaction pathway for electron transfer. Molecular orbital/density function theory (MO/DFT) calculation showed that Fe(II)/NO2- redox reaction in aqueous phase without the presence of solid phase was thermodynamically favorable in contrast to the wet chemistry result. The absence of the spontaneous reaction could be due to the difficulty in forming inner-sphere Fe \u2013 O \u2013 N \u2013 O \u2013 Fe complexes in dilute solution in batch study. In heterogeneous system, the result showed that direct electron transfer pathway was more thermodynamically favorable than indirect electron transfer pathway for Fe(II)/NO2- reaction in the presence of Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxide.

Fundamental mechanisms governing cold start are not fully understood, although it is recognized that product water becomes ice or frost upon startup when PEFC internal temperature is below the freezing point of water. If the local pore volume of the cathode catalyst layer (CL) is insufficient to contain all of the accumulated water before cell operating temperature rises above freezing, ice may plug the CL and stop the electrochemical reaction by starving it of the reactant gases.\nIn this dissertation the characteristics of PEFC cold start are experimentally studied in three parts, as follows. In part one the cold start capability and characteristics of the PEFC are investigated, introducing the concept of isothermal cold start. For this study two methods of gas purge are used to generate the initial conditions prior to cold start. The first method is to precisely control the cell internal condition to examine the intrinsic capability of the membrane and electrode assembly (MEA), although the purge procedure to generate this condition is not practical for vehicular application. The second is designed to simulate realistic operation in a fuel cell vehicle, but is less controllable, and less efficient with respect to cold start performance. In both cases, it is found that the membrane water absorption during cold start is important for better cold start performance, and therefore the initial condition with low membrane water content is crucial.\nIn part two, the gas purge process is elucidated. Gas purge is an integral part of the PEFC shutdown process, and this process determines the initial conditions of the eventual cold start. To investigate purge effectiveness, the experimental procedure to provide excellent repeatability is first developed. Introducing two characteristic parameters for purge effectiveness which represent the through-plane diffusive flux of water vapor from the CL to gas channels, and the in-plane convective flux of water vapor through the gas channels, respectively, it is found that the cell high frequency resistance after 60 second purge can be uniquely determined by these two parameters.\nPart three provides a method to measure the time- and space-resolved water distribution along the gas channels. Purge effectiveness decreases as the purge gas flows down the channel because of the increasing water vapor pressure. Therefore, in order to develop a time-saving, energy-efficient purge protocol for vehicular applications, it becomes imperative to capture the spatial distribution of purge effectiveness. Measurement of local high frequency resistance (HFR) is non-trivial, because the imposed AC current can travel in-plane through the gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and pass across the membrane in the adjacent regions. In this study, we developed a novel method to estimate the local HFR during gas purge, and obtained the transient local HFR distribution data during gas purge.\nThese three sections form a comprehensive study of cold start capability and provide a route to prediction of cold start performance.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3589], "author_name_tesi": "Tajiri, Kazuya ", "last_name_ssi": "Tajiri", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kazuya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Stefan Thynell", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Evangelos Manias"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Stefan Thynell, Committee Member", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer electrolyte fuel cell", "cold start", "automotive"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Roles of Archaeal general transcription factors TFB1 and TFB2 in Thermococus Kodakarensis during heat stress response", "id": "8925", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4440", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation summarizes two projects concerning roles for homologues of a general\ntranscription factor (GTF), called transcription factor B (TFB) during transcription regulation\nin Archaea. Since the discovery of the third domain of life, Archaea, numerous e\u000bfforts have been made to understand life cycle of multiple archaeal species. The discovery of archaea with multiple homologues of GTFs in their genomes lead to the hypothesis that these archaea may use the\nmultiplicity to control gene expression. However, in what extent the roles of these factors diff\u000ber\nhas not been fully investigated.\n\nFirst part of the dissertation research uses both biochemical and genetic approaches to investigate roles of two TFB homologues from hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis. The overall goal of this study is to provide insights into how the multiple TFB\nhomologues are involved in transcription regulation. T. kodakarensis was chosen as a study\nmodel because of the the availability of well-established genetic systems, which is not true for many other archaea. T. kodakarensis also possess two homologues of TFB (annotated as TFB1\nand TFB2) with one TBP, providing simpli\fed system for investigation. Present study provided\nevidence that each TFB homologues has diff\u000berent characteristics in DNA binding and abortive\ntranscription activities. TFB1 appeared to have stronger association with DNA-TBP complex than TFB2. It was also found that TFB1-containing pre-initiation complex produced more abortive products than TFB2 suggesting the former spend more time for abortive transcription prior to promoter escape than the latter. Because both TFB homologues are transcribed at the same level in an optimum condition, more promoters possibly associate with TFB1 than TFB2 under that condition. Under heat stress, I found that transcription of tfb2 is induced more than\ntfb1. The population increase will potentially overcome less affinity of TFB2 to DNA and more\npromoter may be recognized by TFB2 than TFB1 under heat stress. Since TFB2 spend less time and resources for abortive transcription, it may be an ideal TFB homologue to be used to express stress response proteins. Possibly, T. kodakarensis manipulate population of the two\nTFB homologues in the cell to adjust for transcription activity. I did not observe clear diff\u000berences in gene expression patterns between tfb1 or tfb2 disrupted strains under heat stress. However,for multiple genes, larger fold changes in tfb1 disrupted strain were observed than tfb2 disrupted strain, suggesting these genes could be transcribed efficiently by TFB2 under heat stress. Over-all, observations suggest that a unique mechanism to utilize the two TFB homologues for \ffine adjustment of intracellular gene expression may exist in T. kodakarensis.\n\nSecond part of the research is the development of a new genetic methodologies to control gene expression in the cells. Using the inducible promoters from a T. kodakarensis enzyme,\n1,6 bis-phosphatase, conditional gene expression system was established. This is the system to\ncontrol gene expression in archaea and will provide various applications in genetic studies. The system was applied to over-express TFB homologues in cells and consequences of additional expression were observed. Interestingly, over-expression of tfb1 resulted in ineff\u000bective cell growth, whereas increased synthesis of tfb2 did not aff\u000bect cell growth properties. Both deletion and over-\nexpression of tfb1 resulted in ineff\u000bective cell growth suggesting TFB1 population need to be kept\nwithin certain range in T. kodakarensis for optimal growth.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4410], "author_name_tesi": "Tajiri, Momoko ", "last_name_ssi": "Tajiri", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Momoko", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katsuhiko Murakami", "Katsuhiko Murakami", "James Gregory Ferry", "B Tracy Nixon", "Christopher Howard House", "Sarah Ellen Ades"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katsuhiko Murakami, Dissertation Advisor", "Katsuhiko Murakami, Committee Chair", "James Gregory Ferry, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member", "Sarah Ellen Ades, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["general transcription factor", "archaea", "TFB"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Systems Infrastructure for Supporting Utility Computing in Clouds", "id": "13963", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7417", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent emergence of cloud computing is being considered an important enabler of the long-cherished paradigm of utility computing. Utility computing represents the desire to have computing resources delivered, used, paid for and managed with assured quality similar to other commoditized utilities such as electricity. The principal appeal of utility computing lies in the systemized framework it creates for the interaction between providers and consumers of computing resources. While current clouds are undoubtedly succeeding towards this goal, they lack some of the crucial features necessary to realize a mature utility. First, one foundational feature of a utility is the ability to accurately measure and manage the usage of the resources by its various consumers. Modern VM-based cloud platform, providers of the cloud services face significant difficulties in obtaining the accurate picture of resource consumption by their consumers. Second, consumers of a utility expect to have systematic ways to infer their resource needs so that they can make cost-effective resource procurement decisions. However, current consumers of the clouds are ill-equipped in making their resource procurement decisions because of lack of information regarding resource quantity and their implication on application performance.\nIn the first part of the dissertation, we consider provider-side issues of resource accounting. It is nontrivial to correctly apportion the usage of a shared resource in the cloud to its various users. Towards achieving accurate understanding of the overall resource usage within the cloud, we develop a technique for dynamically discovering the various resources that are directly or indirectly being used by a consumer\u2019s application. This, in turn, enables us to build techniques for accurately accounting the resource usage. The benefits of our approach are explained by comparing with and illustrating the problems of using state-of-the-art methods in resource accounting. In the next part of the dissertation, we focus on the problem of understating the cost of application deployments to the cloud from the consumers perspective. Employing empirical approaches to estimate the resource requirements of the target application, we present how to systematically incorporate important systems characteristics such as workload intensity, growth, and variances as well as comprehensive set of hosting options into determining the economic feasibility of application deployment in the cloud.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7366], "author_name_tesi": "Tak, Byung Chul ", "last_name_ssi": "Tak", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Byung Chul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bhuvan Urgaonkar", "Anand Sivasubramaniam", "Trent Ray Jaeger", "Qian Wang", "Rong N Chang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Committee Chair", "Anand Sivasubramaniam, Committee Member", "Trent Ray Jaeger, Committee Member", "Qian Wang, Committee Member", "Rong N Chang, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Utility Computing", "Cloud Computing", "Virtualization", "Operating System", "Distributed System", "Resource Accounting"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "STATIC AND DYNAMIC CONTROLS OF SOIL MOISTURE VARIABILITY IN THE SHALE HILLS CATCHMENT\n", "id": "10402", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3346", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soil moisture is an important component of the hydrologic cycle.  The spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture influences environmental processes at a wide range of spatial scales. This study utilized a four-year database consisting of soil moisture measurements at 106 locations from the surface down to 1.1-m depth within a forested catchment in central Pennsylvania to address the following objectives: 1) characterizing the relationship between soil moisture spatial variability and catchment-wide wetness to assess the uncertainty in estimating spatially-averaged soil moisture; 2) examining temporal changes in vertical soil moisture profile along a topographic gradient to identify processes that influence the above stated relationship; 3) compare the spatial organization of soil moisture at different measurement depths; 4) examine the correlation between soil moisture at different measurement depths and soil terrain indices.  Our results showed that spatial variability (defined as the standard deviation) increased exponentially with increasing catchment-wide spatially-averaged soil moisture (R2 = 0.863, p < 0.05).  This relationship led to the widening of confidence intervals as spatially-averaged soil moisture increased at all depths (increased CI of 0.040, 0.038, 0.033, 0.037, 0.031, 0.029-m3/m3 between lowest and highest spatially-averaged soil moisture for 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100-cm depths, respectively).  Similarly, the number of samples required for obtaining 95% confidence interval in the estimates of spatially-averaged soil moisture increased as spatially-averaged soil moisture increased at all depths (number of samples increased by 23, 25, 24, 27, 19, and 16 between lowest and highest spatially-averaged soil moisture for 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100-cm depths, respectively).   Our analysis of temporal changes in the vertical soil moisture profile indicated that during the winter through early summer, the emergence of a shallow water table in the valley and spatially and temporally limited concentrated lateral flow along hillslopes, increased catchment-wide soil moisture spatial variability during wet periods.  Conversely, during periods of low soil moisture, an increase in hydrological processes operating across the watershed, particularly evapotranspiration, acted to decrease the catchment-wide soil moisture variability.  The results of this analysis have implications for optimizing soil moisture monitoring in forested watersheds, particularly watersheds which exhibit strong seasonal fluctuations in water table height.\nAt the Shale Hills catchment, surface (<20-cm) soil moisture organization exhibited seasonal trends: during the winter through early summer, areas of high soil moisture were concentrated within convergent landforms, while during the summer through early fall, areas of high soil moisture were more randomly distributed throughout the catchment.  This indicates that seasonal removal of soil moisture, primarily through evapotranspiration, had a significant influence on near-surface soil moisture organization under dry conditions, while topography was an important control on soil moisture organization under wet conditions.  Sub-surface (>20-cm) soil moisture organization exhibited temporal persistence, with soil moisture above the catchment-wide average concentrated within convergent landforms under both wet and dry conditions.  Deep soil profiles in convergent landforms provide a store of soil moisture that persisted even under dry conditions, indicating that soil moisture organization within the subsurface is a function of both topographic controls and soil depth.  The results of linear regression between soil moisture and soil-terrain attributes indicate that terrain features generally outperformed soil textural properties in explaining the variability of soil moisture within the forested catchment.  Slope, depth to bedrock, topographic wetness index (TWI) and rock fragments were significant (&#945; = 0.05) on at least 85% of the measurement days for all depth intervals measured.  Intermediate depths (40 and 60-cm) exhibited the highest mean R2 values for TWI and upslope contributing area, while mean R2 values for slope and depth to bedrock increased with increased soil depth.   No seasonal trend is present in the R2 values for sub-surface soil moisture (60, 80 and 100-cm) and depth to bedrock and topographic wetness index, with depth to bedrock exhibiting high R2 values throughout the four-year period.  These results support our conclusion that both topography and soil depth are important in controlling soil moisture organization at depth, while seasonal fluctuations in evapotranspiration and topography are important controls on soil moisture organization at the near-surface.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3336], "author_name_tesi": "Takagi, Kenneth ", "last_name_ssi": "Takagi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry Lin", "Henry Lin", "Patrick Joseph Drohan", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry Lin, Thesis Advisor", "Henry Lin, Thesis Advisor", "Patrick Joseph Drohan, Thesis Advisor", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydropedology", "soil moisture"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Theory of Electromagnetic Waves in Anisotropic, Magneto-Dielectric, Antenna Substrates", "id": "14971gat131", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14971", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The unique electromagnetic properties of magneto-dielectric composite materials,\nincluding ferromagnetic particle composites, ferromagnetic film laminates, and\ncrystal-oriented ferrites have yet to be extensively leveraged in the design of modern\nmicrowave devices and antennas. By surveying the relevant literature, we first\ncompile the relevant information on the dynamic permeability of magneto-dielectric\nmaterials, focusing on the various formulations of Snoek\u2019s laws, their achievable\npermeability spectra, and the sources of anisotropy in a passive material medium.\nIn subsequent chapters, an electromagnetic theory is developed for the investigation\nof planar antennas printed on anisotropic, magneto-dielectric substrates.\nFor the case of a substrate whose in-plane permittivity and permeability are\nisotropic, expressions are derived for the surface wave modes. Similar to an isotropic\nsubstrate, the anisotropic magneto-dielectric substrate admits of a finite series of\nsurface wave modes, which exist only provided the frequency of operation is above\ntheir respective cutoff frequencies. In most cases, the primary TM mode has no\ncutoff frequency. However, contrary to an isotropic substrate, the primary TM\nsurface wave mode is suppressed completely in the anisotropic substrate provided\nthe in-plane permeability, and out-of-plane permittivity are equal to 1.\nThe more general theory for a fully anisotropic substrate can be developed\nindirectly through an investigation of wave propagation and radiation along principal\naxes and planes of the material. TE and TM decompositions of the electromagnetic\nfield may be given for waves propagating within principal planes, but are impossible\nfor arbitrary directions of propagation. An eigenvector approach shows how to\nresolve the electromagnetic field solutions into types, but these classifications are\nnot, in general, TE/TM. For planar antennas the anisotropic magnetic response\nof a magneto-dielectric substrate enables circularly polarized radiation, even for\nsingle-fed linear antennas. Furthermore, the cutoff frequencies for the surface wave\nmodes become directionally dependent.\nDyadic Green\u2019s functions are derived for a grounded, infinite, anisotropic\nmagneto-dielectric substrate using spectral domain techniques. Utilizing the dyadic\nGreen\u2019s functions, the surface wave excitations and radiation patterns of short\nelectric dipole antennas are calculated.

Notably, the results indicate that a higher\nefficiency is obtained if the permittivity of the substrate in the direction normal to\nthe air-substrate interface is small, an effect attributable to the suppression of the\nprimary TM surface wave mode.\nFrom these results, we also conclude that the permeability in the direction\nnormal to the air-substrate interface is unimportant for thin substrates. Consequently,\nno penalty is paid for utilizing anisotropic magnetic materials such as\nthe crystal-oriented ferrites, which only possess an in-plane permeability. The\nsuperior frequency-permeability Snoek product of the oriented magnetic materials\ncompared to traditional isotropic materials, combined with the unimportance of the\nout-of-plane permeability, lead to the conclusion that anisotropic magneto-dielectric\nmaterials are potentially better-suited for antenna applications than their isotropic\ncounterparts.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16349], "author_name_tesi": "Talalai, Gregory A", "last_name_ssi": "Talalai", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Kenneth Breakall", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Victor P Pasko", "Julio Urbina", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Kenneth Breakall, Dissertation Advisor", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Chair", "Victor P Pasko, Committee Member", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Magnetic Materials", "Antennas", "Electromagnetic Theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "How much information do men really want?

To close this model, static flow regime transition criteria and algebraic relations are utilized to estimate the interfacial area concentration (ai).  However, to better reflect the continuous evolution of two-phase flow, an interfacial area transport equation (IATE) can provide a dynamic estimation of ai through mechanistic models for bubble coalescence and disintegration.  While a significant amount of work has been performed in this area for vertical flows, less has been performed in horizontal flows.\nTherefore, the current work seeks to establish a one-dimensional, one-group, adiabatic IATE for horizontal bubbly flows.  An experimental database is acquired in a 3.81 cm pipe \nair-water facility with a total development length of 250 diameters.  A four-sensor conductivity probe is employed to measure time-averaged two-phase flow parameters at a maximum of 17 radial positions along 8 lines for L/D = 44, 116, and 244.  To develop the IATE for horizontal flow, the mechanistic models for vertical flow are revised by considering the separation distance between bubbles necessary for turbulence based interactions.  Furthermore, parameters to account for the effect of the asymmetric phase distribution on bubble interactions are developed through a construction of the local profiles using area-averaged information.  Based on these revisions, the IATE for horizontal bubbly flow is established and predicts the current data within \u00b15.5%.\nA study is also performed to implement and assess the IATE for vertical bubbly flows in the nuclear system analysis code TRACE.  In total, 50 conditions with ID pipe sizes ranging from 2.54 to 20.32 cm in co-current upward and downward flows are employed.  It is found that TRACE with the IATE capability (or TRACE-T1) predicts the ai data within \u00b113.0%, while the conventional TRACE underestimates the data on average by 43.6%.

The results from three separate baseline turbine rotor computations all showed good agreement with experimental measurements, validating the numerical procedure\u2019s ability to predict complex turbine rotor flowfields.  This agreement was, in part, due to an advanced, multi-block method of discretizing the turbine rotor into a computational mesh, which was developed as part of the study.\nAfter validating the numerical procedure, three different classifications of tip geometry modification were investigated through CFD simulation: chamfering of the suction side of the blade tip, rounding of the blade tip edge, and squealer-type cavities.  Chamfering of the blade tip was shown to cause the leakage flow inside the gap to turn toward the camber direction of the blade.  This turning led to reduced mass flow through the gap and a smaller leakage vortex.  Rounding of the suction side edge of the blade tip resulted in a considerable reduction in the size and strength of the leakage vortex, while rounding of the pressure side edge of the blade tip greatly increased the mass flow rate through the gap.  Rounded squealer cavities acted to reduce the mass flow through the gap and proved advantageous over traditional, square squealer cavities.  Final, detailed computations using a very refined mesh reconfirmed the findings of more rapid, preliminary computations.  Detailed, three-dimensional analysis of the computed flowfields revealed the physics behind the modified tip geometries\u2019 reduction of the leakage flow and vortex.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2536], "author_name_tesi": "Tallman, James Albert", "last_name_ssi": "Tallman", "middle_name_ssi": "Albert", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Savas Yavuzkurt", "Robert Francis Kunz", "Laura Pauley", "L Joel Peltier", "Dr Edward Hall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Chair", "Robert Francis Kunz, Committee Member", "Laura Pauley, Committee Member", "L Joel Peltier, Committee Member", "Dr Edward Hall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tip Treatment", "Tip Desensitization", "Leakage Vortex", "Computational Fluid Dynamics", "Turbine", "Leakage Flow", "Axial Flow Turbine"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Assessment of Error Processing and Category Learning in Children with ADHD \n", "id": "14030", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7307", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous studies have suggested that children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) show greater difficulty processing error feedback information as compared to their same-aged peers.

Furthermore, the degree to which specific gene-environment (GE) factors contribute to the underlying developmental processes that influence the presence of problems with inattention and impulsivity is unclear. To address some of these lingering questions, this dissertation evaluated the degree to which early developmental trajectories of cognitive control (CC) and negative emotional reactivity (nER) are (1) influenced by latent genetic risk factors for ADHD and (2) interact with parenting variables (i.e., environmental structuring) that are often implemented in the psychosocial treatment of children with ADHD. Cross-lagged and mixed growth models were applied to investigate these multi-tiered relationships in the Early Growth and Development Study (EGDS; R01 HD042608), a multisite longitudinal adoption study. Results indicated that CC is concurrently and predictively associated with nER in middle childhood, but not in infancy/toddlerhood. Low CC consistently predicted future ADHD-related behavior problems, but did not significantly interact with nER to produce increased problems. Latent birth parent genetic effects on child CC, nER, and ADHD were non-significant, and adoptive parent CC, nER, ADHD, and environmental structuring parenting practices did not mediate or interact with latent parent factors to influence child outcomes.

This reaction is catalyzed at a mononuclear non-heme-iron active site using molecular oxygen as the oxidant.  Baldwin and coworkers have advanced a mechanism for this unusual reaction on the basis of extensive bioorganic and X-ray crystallographic studies, which has subsequently been supported by computational studies.  The reaction proceeds in two steps.  The first step forms the \u03b2-lactam ring and is initiated by cleavage of the pro-S-CCys,\u03b2-H bond.  The second step forms the thiazolidine ring and begins with the cleavage of the CVal,\u03b2-H bond.  The Fe(III)-superoxo and Fe(IV)-oxo complexes are the proposed C-H-cleaving intermediates, targeting the pro-S-CCys,\u03b2-H and CVal,\u03b2-H bonds, respectively.  Despite significant insight into the bioorganic nature of this reaction, the bioinorganic chemistry, in particular the geometric and electronic structures of the proposed intermediates, is less well understood.  In this work, we employed a combination of kinetic and spectroscopic methods, along with use of the specifically deuterated substate isotopologes, A[d2-C]V and AC[d8-V], to trap and characterize both C-H-cleaving intermediates.  Our results suggest that the two intermediates are best described as high-spin Fe(III)-superoxo and high-spin Fe(IV)-oxo complexes, respectively.  A thorough kinetic dissection was also performed to produce a global kinetic mechanism that aligns all available data.

The majority of research examining foreign aid assumes that any and all aid is the same, and will lead to development as long as it does not fall prey to corrupt decision makers. Variation in the way aid actually works is usually attributed to characteristics or actions of the donors and the recipients. And in doing so, the context in which these actors operate is also considered. However, until recently, nature of aid itself did not get much attention. To this end, the present study aims to question these two assumptions about development aid, disaggregating it in order to explore whether outcomes differ with variation within aid activities.\n\nThis study is composed of a total of five chapters. After an introduction laying out the theoretical background in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 starts by examining the impact of having any kind of gender awareness has on aid effectiveness. Chapter 3 delineates two different ways aid projects can approach gendered social structures. Aid projects can integrate an explicit concern for gender into other issue areas they target or gender related issues may be the main target. This third chapter explores the potential of each of these approaches for improving aid effectiveness. Chapter 4 takes a subnational look into aid effectiveness in Malawi and evaluates whether awareness of gendered social organization results in more effective aid. The final chapter summarizes and synthesizes the findings from all of the chapters.

However, no comprehensive model has been established for neonates. Vitamin A plays critical roles in neonatal development. It is required for normal embryonic development, hematopoiesis, immune response, and growth and differentiation of many types of cells. Neonates have a high need for the formation of retinoic acid, the active metabolite of vitamin A, for function. However, neonates have a much lower level of body vitamin A as compared to the adults. These contrasting facts lead to a question: how can the high need for retinoic acid in neonates be met by a small body pool of vitamin A?  The vitamin A metabolism and kinetics in neonates are thus interesting. My first objective was to develop whole-body models of vitamin A metabolism and kinetics in neonatal rats by applying tracer kinetics and model-based compartmental analysis. \nPrevious work in this laboratory explored the effects of a mixture of vitamin A and a small proportion (one tenth) of retinoic acid (VARA) on vitamin A metabolism in specific organs (liver and lungs) in neonatal rats. VARA resulted in a rapid and dramatic increase in retinol uptake and esterification in the lungs of neonatal rats. VARA has also been shown to regulate the expression of enzymes involved in vitamin A metabolism in neonatal liver and lungs. My second objective was to determine the effects of bolus VARA supplementation on vitamin A kinetic behavior in neonatal rats at both the whole-body and organ-specific levels. \nOn postnatal day 4, rat pups received a single oral dose containing [3H]retinol admixed with either canola oil as placebo (group 1) or VARA (group 2). At 14 selected time points after dosing, pups were euthanized and different tissues were collected. For plasma, liver and lungs, [3H] and total retinol were determined. For other tissues, only radioactivity was determined. Based on tracer responses in plasma and tissues, whole-body models of vitamin A metabolism in neonatal rats were established using the Windows version of the Simulation, Analysis and Modeling (WinSAAM) computer program. Parameters characterizing vitamin A kinetics in neonatal rats were predicted from the models, and the effects of VARA on kinetic behavior of vitamin A were explored by comparing model parameters between groups.\nFollowing presentation of the experimental design, I present data on vitamin A mass in neonatal plasma, liver and lungs, as well as tracer responses in collected tissues, which were the basis for modeling. Tracer responses in plasma and all collected tissues were well defined, including the absorption phase. One-time VARA supplementation decreased the fraction of dose in plasma and increased the peak fraction in liver and lungs compared with placebo treatment. VARA supplementation also increased vitamin A mass in plasma, liver and lungs with a dramatic, rapid but transient effect. \nBased on the plasma tracer data, a whole-body compartmental model as viewed from \u201cplasma space\u201d (model 1) was developed. From the model, information about the absorption, turnover, recycling, uptake and utilization of retinol in neonatal rats was obtained.

All three models were satisfactorily fit to the observed kinetic data. Information regarding vitamin A kinetics in neonatal rats at both the whole-body and organ-specific levels was obtained.

However, researchers and clinicians have recognized that the clinical utility of ER research will remain limited without delineating the specific dimensions of ER that contribute to dysregulated emotion and psychopathology. This dissertation investigated an often-cited but rarely-studied dimension\u2013 strategy flexibility, or a person\u2019s ability to be able to vary the strategies used to regulate emotion across situational contexts and within a given situation. The present study tested the convergent and predictive validity of new strategy flexibility measures in children at ages 36 and 48 months.  If strategy flexibility is important to mental health, children with greater strategy flexibility should show greater self-regulation (e.g., fewer externalizing symptoms, better social self-control, and better general emotion regulation skill).  Convergent validity of two forms of strategy flexibility, specifically, children\u2019s flexible use of strategies (a) across different situations (situational flexibility) and (b) within a given situation (momentary flexibility), was tested by examining relations between these new flexibility measures and an observational measure of children\u2019s skill at ER. First, we compared the convergence of the variety of children\u2019s regulatory strategies (strategy variety) and (i) situational flexibility with independent ratings of children\u2019s overall quality of ER.  This approach was intended to capture children\u2019s ability to use different but appropriate strategies as a function of task objectives. Second, we compared the convergence of strategy variety and (ii) two new momentary flexibility measures assessing the frequency (ratio-of-switches) and speed (latency-to-switch) with which children switch strategies when a first strategy is ineffective with independent ratings of children\u2019s ER quality. The two momentary measures were intended to capture children\u2019s ability to change strategies when a current one was ineffective. Second, we tested the predictive validity of strategy flexibility measures by relating strategy flexibility measures to indices of child socio-emotional competence at ages 36 and 48 months. Finally, relations between measures of strategy flexibility and cognitive flexibility, assessed by young children\u2019s ability to shifts sets in a cognitive task, were examined. Results provided support for the convergent validity of situational flexibility and one measure of momentary flexibility, latency-to-switch, as measures of young children\u2019s flexible strategy use. These two newly-developed strategy flexibility measures systematically predicted independent ratings of children\u2019s global quality of emotion regulation at ages 36 and 48 months. In contrast, strategy variety and momentary ratio-of-switches were not consistently related with children\u2019s global emotion regulation; moreover, when predictive, they were associated with less skill at emotion regulation. Finally, set-shifting was not associated with strategy flexibility at either 36 or 48 months of age.

Web information systems such as search engines have to keep up with the growth\nand changes of the Web.\n\nThis thesis studies in a Web search engine how a crawler with limited computing resource can effectively crawl from the dynamically changing Web and acquire the most updated Web documents, and how a Web search engine can provide information-object--oriented indexing methods which enable users to retrieve desired information with high accuracy and high efficiency.\n\nTo address the first problem, existing solutions apply sampling techniques at the website level. That means, the crawler chooses a few webpages from each website as samples and  then re-downloads all the webpages in the website\nwith the largest number of changed samples. We argue that the level of a website may not be a good granularity for sampling because the update\npatterns of various webpages within the same website  could be  quite different,  while webpages  with similar update patterns may distribute across different websites. We design a set of sampling policies with various\ndownloading granularities for the sampling method, taking into account the link structure, the directory structure, and the content-based features which include the clustering technique. We further extend the clustering-based sampling approach by testing more dynamic features and strategically selecting samples from each cluster.\n\nFor the second problem, once the crawler has downloaded a set of documents and stored them in the search engine, a search engine should allow users to perform accurate search for desired information. As  more and more digital documents containing various information  objects become accessible on the Web, there is a growing  demand for a Web search system to provide\nusers with tools to retrieve documents based  on these information objects. The key challenges of this problem are that, a search engine needs\nto (1) improve the accuracy of returned ranking, (2) enrich the format of search objects, and (3) give informative results to users in different domains. Existing search engines typically maintain large-scale inverted indexes which are built on the whole local data set. These approaches do not focus on information objects  in a specific domain. Therefore, they do not meet\nthe above requirements. There are degradations in the accuracy of the returned ranking. To fully address these issues, we propose building\nindexes on extracted metadata of various information objects, instead of the whole document. This greatly improves the quality of the final returned ranking. As part of this dissertation, we set up a digital library, namely ArchSeer, for the domain of archeology.  Archaeologists have different search  needs which cannot be provided by a general purpose \nsearch engine associated with a digital library, like Google Scholar. Therefore, the need arises for a digital library like ArchSeer, which\nallows users to retrieve archeology literature via domain-specific search engines. For example, archaeologists often publish maps in their documents and need to search using geo-spatial references. In this dissertation, we show how to design a digital library that performs domain-specific information extraction and indexes them to allow user enhanced search capabilities. The most significant feature of ArchSeer is that  it can automatically extract metadata related to different scientific items (e.g., maps and locations) in archeology papers, and further design effective ranking algorithms and heuristics to retrieve these items in the system.\n\nThis dissertation also provides solid mathematical analyses, extensive simulations and experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and show the\napplicability of the proposed techniques. In addition, it discusses some open issues related to the proposed solutions and suggests some\ninteresting directions in designing efficient Web search engines.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5047], "author_name_tesi": "Tan, Qingzhao ", "last_name_ssi": "Tan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qingzhao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prasenjit Mitra", "Prasenjit Mitra", "C.

Epigenetic inheritance of a phenotype can be because of modifications in DNA methylation and/or chromatin structure. To study epigenetic gene regulation, pericarp color1 (p1), gene of maize has been used as a model system. The p1 gene regulates phlobaphenes biosynthesis and has been successfully used as a model for genetic studies because of its obvious pigmentation phenotypes. One of the p1 allelic patterns is white pericarp and red gob glumes conditioned by the P1-wr allele. The Unstable factor for orange 1 (Ufo1) was first described as a modifier of P1-wr expression. In the presence of the dominant mutant Ufo1-1, DNA methylation of P1-wr is reduced, resulting in increased accumulation of phlobaphenes in kernel pericarp, cob glumes and even an ectopic expression in vegetative tissues. In addition, P1-wr; Ufo1-1 plants also show pleiotropic defects of plant growth and development, such as reduced plant height, buggy whip phenotypes with rolled leaves and stunted growth in these plants. The Ufo1 mutant plants are unstable, reverting back to wild type phenotype. Within a population of Ufo1-1 expressing plants (U-E), we identified silent individuals (U-S) that show stable phenotypes resembling wild type P1-wr; ufo1 plants with colorless pericarp, red cob glumes and normal plant height. The first objective of this study is to investigate the inheritance of the silent phenotype of U-S. Genetic experiments have proven that the U-S phenotype is caused by an independent loss-of-function allele of Ufo1-1, namely Ufo1-1S. Also, the formation of Ufo1-1S probably depends on other loci (modifiers) in the genome because of the differences observed in different maize genetic backgrounds.\nIn order to further elucidate global effects of the functional Ufo1-1 allele (Ufo1-1E) and Ufo1-1S, RNA-Seq analysis was performed. Our results indicated that the U-S and wild type transcriptome profile are more similar to each other as compared to the U-E. The KEGG pathway and GO term enrichment assays showed that flavonoid biosynthesis pathway is up regulated in U-E, while it shows no significant difference in U-S and wild type. In addition, the pectinesterase gene expression was upregulated in the presence of Ufo1-1E.

In normal hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells committed to the myeloid lineage form platelets, white cells and red cells. AML patients have the characteristic feature of accumulated immature myeloid precursors known as blasts. Prognosis for AML patients depends on several risk factors, including cytogenetic abnormalities, age, prior exposure to chemotherapy, and pre-existing hematological disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The five-year survival rate for AML patients remains low and drug resistance is also a major problem for relapsed patients. Hence, AML patients require better treatments.\n\nSphingolipids are a group of sphingoid-based lipids that maintain cellular integrity and mediate signal transduction and gene regulation. Two sphingolipids are important in regulating cell survival: ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). The ceramide and S1P balance is known as the \u201csphingolipid rheostat\u201d, which modulates cell survival. Sphingolipids are dysregulated in many types of cancer, including AML. Acid ceramidase (AC) is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes ceramide breakdown into sphingosine and free fatty acids. Sphingosine is then phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases to form S1P. AC is crucial for embryonic development but is found in high levels in several different types of cancer, including prostate, colon and breast cancer. \n\nIn this study, we investigated the role of AC in AML blast survival and drug resistance. We show that AC expression and activity is elevated in AML patients. Corresponding to elevated AC activity is the elevation of S1P levels also detected in patient samples. Targeting AC using ceramide analog LCL204 and AC shRNA decreased viability and myeloid cell leukemia differentiation protein-1(Mcl-1) expression, a B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family protein essential for AML survival. AC inhibition also decreased the multidrug resistance protein (MDR1)/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and sensitized cells to AML chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, AC overexpression in AML cell line HL-60 increased S1P and decreased total ceramide levels. We also found that AC overexpression increased NF-\u03baB activation, a transcription factor responsible for many survival pathways including the regulation of Mcl-1 and P-gp transcription. We hypothesized that AC overexpression increases NF-\u03baB activation that then serves as a positive feedback loop back to AC. We demonstrate that NF-\u03baB inhibition decreased AC, Mcl-1 and P-gp expression, supporting the positive feedback loop hypothesis. Pharmacological inhibition of AC in a murine AML model also significantly increased the survival of leukemic mice.   \n\nTaken together, we show that AC is important for blast survival and drug resistance in AML. Targeting AC changes the sphingolipid rheostat to increase ceramide and decrease S1P levels, thereby leading to cell death. We also demonstrate for the first time that AC regulates Mcl-1 and P-gp expression, potentially through the NF- \u03baB pathway. Collectively, the results support AC as a promising and effective chemotherapeutic target in AML. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9138], "author_name_tesi": "Tan, Su-fern ", "last_name_ssi": "Tan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Su-fern", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Paul Loughran", "\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\"", "Charles H Lang", "Hong Gang Wang", "Jin Ming Yang", "David F Claxton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Paul Loughran, Dissertation Advisor", "\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\", Committee Chair", "Charles H Lang, Committee Chair", "Hong Gang Wang, Committee Member", "Jin Ming Yang, Committee Member", "David F Claxton, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["AML", "Acid Ceramidase", "Mcl-1", "P-glycoprotein", "NF-kB", "sphingolipids"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Study of microseismic events: their source mechanism, spatial and temporal distribution, and the evolution of transmitting medium", "id": "26724", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11868", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microseismic is commonly used to monitor the hydraulic fracturing process. Seismic signals are recorded using either surface or downhole geophones to invert for hypocenters of rock movements (moment magnitude usually between -3 and 0) happened during hydraulic fracturing. The location of these microseismic events are used to estimate the stimulated reservoir volume. This thesis focuses on further understanding of microseismic events beyond the cloud of locations. \nTo test whether the lineament of microseismic event cloud represent fluid filled open fractures, we looked at the change of S wave from perforations when it passes microseismic event cloud (Chapter 2). Strong attenuation of S wave suggests that the microseismic event cloud indicates fluid-filled open fractures.\nWe also studied the evolution of medium velocity structure during hydraulic fracturing. By inverting the arrival time of perforation shots recorded by downhole geophones, we found that the velocity of stimulated region is higher than the unstimulated region (Chapter 3).\nA new model (Rutledge-Eisner model) is introduced to describe the mechanism of microseismic event generation. This model states that the microseismic events are a results of shearing on bedding planes caused by opening of hydraulic fractures. Moment tensor inversion results from surface microseismic monitoring of the Marcellus shale is presented to validate this model (Chapter 4).\nBased on this model, we explained some phenomena in the temporal and spatial distribution of microseismic events under different geological and geomechanical conditions (Chapter 5). We found that microseismic events concentrate behind the fracture tip in a single planar fracture propagation. Low in-situ stress environment leads to early microseismic events while high in-situ stress lead to late microseismic events during fracturing. Natural fracture networks show unique microseismic temporal patterns with the increased sand concentration. Higher in-situ stress variation between layers lead to more microseismic events and larger magnitude.\nIn summary, microseismic monitoring is an effective method to reveal details about hydraulic fracturing. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11321], "author_name_tesi": "Tan, Yunhui ", "last_name_ssi": "Tan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yunhui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Terry Engelder", "Charles James Ammon", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "Yilin Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Terry Engelder, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Committee Member", "Yilin Wang, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microseismic", "hydraulic fracturing"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Politics, Budgetary Tradeoffs, and State Funding of Public Higher Education ", "id": "7794", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1329", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While state support of public higher education has garnered considerable attention in scholarly literature and the popular media, no study designed to explain state support has attempted to develop a theory-driven, comprehensive conceptualization of the state political system within a larger theoretical framework that consists of state economic and demographic factors, and higher education system attributes. Furthermore, no study has adequately addressed the issue of competing state budgetary areas, or how budgetary trade-offs affect higher education funding. This study attempts to fill this gap in the literature.\nThis study has two primary goals: 1) To examine the theoretical and empirical connections between state support for public higher education (measured as both state appropriations per $1,000 of personal income and higher education\u2019s share of state general fund expenditures), and the various political attributes of the U.S. States; and 2) to elucidate, both theoretically and empirically, budgetary trade-offs between higher education and other state budgetary areas. \nThis study presents an original framework based on theory and research drawn from political science, higher education, public administration, public policy, and economics. The Fiscal Policy Framework describes state support for higher education as a product of the attributes of the policymakers and the attributes of the decision situation. Interest group activity, mass political attributes, governmental institutions, state higher education factors, the previous year\u2019s appropriation, economic and demographic factors of the state, political culture, and other budgetary demands are all presumed to shape those attributes.\nOriginal and secondary data on the political, economic, demographic, and higher education characteristics of the U.S. states spanning several decades were collected from twenty six sources. Based on the Fiscal Policy Framework, cross-sectional time series analyses were conducted to predict state appropriations for public higher education per $1,000 of personal income, higher education\u2019s share of state general fund expenditures, and budgetary trade-offs between and among higher education and other state general fund expenditure areas.\n\tThese analyses provide strong empirical evidence that interest groups, mass political attributes, governmental institutions, political culture, and personal attributes of policymakers all shape how states support public higher education, and that compared to other budgetary areas, higher education is uniquely susceptible to such political forces. The evidence also shows not only that elected officials make trade-offs between higher education and other budgetary areas, but also that higher education is uniquely susceptible to trade-off behavior.\n\tMore specifically, higher education governance structure, higher education interest groups, political ideology, legislative professionalism, the parties of the governor and the legislature, voter turnout, and uniparty legislature are all significant factors influencing higher education appropriations and that interest group density, the budgetary power of the governor, legislative professionalism, term limits, political culture, and the party of the governor also significantly affect the share of state general fund expenditures higher education receives. This study also reveals the significant conditioning affect state higher education governance structures have on other political forces, namely interest groups, the legislature, and the governor. Furthermore, This study found that Medicaid, public assistance, K-12 education and public assistance all engage in trade-off behavior with higher education.\n\tThe inclusion of politics in the explanatory model produces a more robust and pragmatically useful model. It is more pragmatically useful in that many of the political variables may be impacted by those concerned with state support of higher education. This study clearly shows that the higher education appropriations process does not occur within a vacuum immune to politics and other budgetary forces. Indeed, higher education funding appears to be particularly susceptible to such forces. Because of its susceptibility to political influences and budgetary trade-offs, higher education may stand to benefit the most from its involvement\u2014or lose the most by refusing to engage\u2014in political and budgetary appropriations processes.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1318], "author_name_tesi": "Tandberg, David A.", "last_name_ssi": "Tandberg", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald E Heller", "Patrick T Terenzini", "Roger Lewis Geiger", "Michael Barth Berkman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald E Heller, Committee Chair", "Patrick T Terenzini, Committee Member", "Roger Lewis Geiger, Committee Member", "Michael Barth Berkman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Higher education", "politics", "budgetary trade-offs", "finance", "state support of higher education"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Antibacterial Polymers, Recyclable Palladium Catalysts for Coupling Reactions, and Catalytic Conversion of Cellulose into Liquid Fuels\n\n\n\n", "id": "8839", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6031", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis is focused mainly on two areas of chemistry- polymers and catalysis. In chapter 2, I have discussed the fundamentals of the chemical structure on the antibacterial activity of the imidazolium salts and polymers. The study correlates the effect of chemical nature of the alkyl tail and the positive charge on the potency of the antibacterial compounds studied. In chapter 3, I have reported the design and synthesis of silica nanoparticles supported N-heterocyclic carbene-palladium complexes and their application in carbon-carbon coupling reactions. The catalysts are air and moisture stable and because of the large surface to volume ratio of the nanoparticles, the catalyst sites are readily accessible to the reactants. Thus, they are effective catalyst for a wide range of substrates. However, conventionally, heterogeneous catalyst preparation is a multistep process including ligand synthesis, forming ligand-metal complex and then immobilization on to a solid support. In chapter 4, I have described a simple one step synthesis of heterogeneous palladium catalyst by crosslinking commercially available poly(allylamine) with a palladium salt. This method cuts down the time and cost involved otherwise and the catalyst proved to be an efficient catalyst for a number of carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. It was also easy to separate the catalyst and reused them without losing any activity. Further, in chapter 5, a mild reaction protocol for the synthesis of ether is reported. Finally, in chapter 6, I have discussed a thermo-catalytic method for converting cellulose into liquid fuels. This method used H+ ions formed from water at high temperature to bring about the acid hydrolysis of cellulose into dehydrated hexitols and finally into liquid fuels like dimethytetrahydrofuran and other C5 and C6 compounds.

The electric field is generated using electrodes made of the transparent conductor, indium tin oxide (ITO), which allows optical access to the atoms. The maximum electric field the electrodes can sustain is around 37 kV/cm, 2 to 3 times lower than the maximum fields attained in mock-ups. While we are continuing to work to increase the strength of the electric field, we have developed an alternative EDM measurement scheme that works at low field. This alternative measurement scheme begins by the simple process of preparing atoms in the $m=0$ magnetic sublevel. By measuring the probability of detecting atoms in the $m=0$ state after evolution in electric and magnetic fields, we can obtain a sensitivity \\cite{Heinzen} close to the original measurement scheme. \n\nWe enumerate several notable aspects of our alternative measurement scheme. First, detection of all magnetic sublevels recovers the full sensitivity of precession from the $m=0$ state, which is the same for all precession phases. Second, when the total population in the even magnetic sublevels is measured, it does not depend on quadratic energy shifts due to electric or magnetic fields that are perpendicular to the measurement axis. Third, we can construct a combination of the populations of magnetic sublevels to extract a pure sinusoidal signal. \n\nWe have also refined many experimental techniques in the process of restoring the vacuum and the atom signal. In particular, we constructed a stack of Cooke triplets for collecting the fluorescence from the atoms, which provides the essential data in the experiment.

Data mining techniques include algorithms in machining learning, artificial intelligence, and pattern recognition. \nConsiderable research has been done in data mining applications in the retail or manufacturing industry. This thesis reviews literature in both of these areas. In the retail analytics part of the thesis, the analysis of two retail datasets is presented. Hierarchical clustering and Apriori algorithm are used to cluster the customers and find associations rules within each customer group. In the material information modeling part of the thesis, an information system facilitating the analysis of manufacturing data (Material Information Model) is proposed and the implementation of one analysis application of the system is presented. The implemented software (Sustainability Metrics Computational Platform) consists of a local database storing related manufacturing information, functional modules that handle software functions, and a graphical user interface for user interaction with the software.\nThe retail analysis part considers both the transaction data as well as demographics data. Some interesting observations are generated from this data. For instance, among young couples with children living together and most women not employed cereal is the most frequently bought product type. Furthermore, cereal is the most frequently bought product type within most customer groups.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9273], "author_name_tesi": "Tang, Donghuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Tang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Donghuan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Soundar Kumara", "Dr Christopher Saldana", "Dr Akhil Kumar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Soundar Kumara, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Christopher Saldana, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Akhil Kumar, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Retail Analytics", "Clustering", "Association Rules", "Material Information Modeling", "Sustainability Metrics Computational Platform"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Prediction of clean-bed head loss in crumb rubber filters\n\n", "id": "9235", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2368", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Pilot crumb rubber filters were tested to study their clean-bed head loss under the influences of three design and operational parameters (media size, media depth, and filtration rate).

Because of the various biological treatment processes adopted at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the effluents may have a wide range of qualities, especially in DBP precursors. To minimize the risks posed by DBP-related issues, it is necessary to investigate the essence of DBP precursors in wastewater and evaluate the influence of biological treatment processes. \nBecause conventional practices for evaluating DBP precursors in drinking water cannot be used directly in wastewater due to the complexity of wastewater constituents, a DBP formation potential (FP) quantification method was developed and used for wastewater samples. Sample pretreatment was required to maintain the level of DBPFP and filtration coupled with acidification to pH less than 2 produced stable samples for DBPFP assessment and has advantages for long-term storage. The proposed method for quantification of DBPFP in wastewater is based on the standardized parameters in the chlorination conditions, which include 20 mg/L chlorine dose, pH 7, 25\u00c2\u00b0C, and an incubation of 3 days in the dark. Proper dilution is a key to assure that free chlorine residual remains after incubation. It is recommended that the dilution ratio be determined based on the ammonia level. The proposed method was validated by varying chlorine doses and ammonia levels, and could be used to quantify DBPFP for a broad range of wastewater samples. \nA survey on DBPFP of treated effluents from various WWTPs was conducted to explore the influence of different biological treatment processes on DBP precursors.  The WWTPs that achieved better organic matter removal and nitrification tended to result in low DBPFP in treated effluents. By focusing on a model WWTP that had two biological processes for the same primary effluent treatment, the survey found that haloacetic acid (HAA), trihalomethane (THM) and chloral hydrate (CH) precursors were in predominant concentrations in wastewater. The combination of trickling filter and modified Ludzack-Ettinger process was more efficient in dissolved organics and DBPFP removal than the activated sludge process. The FPs of haloacetonitriles and haloketones showed the highest removal efficiencies in both systems compared to the FPs of other predominant DBP species such as HAAs and THMs. In addition, WWTP changed the DBPFP speciation profile by lowering the HAAFP/THMFP ratio. The DBP yields and specific ultraviolet absorbance increased after secondary treatment, indicating that the remaining organic matters tend to be more humic. The study implied that oxic and anoxic conditions, soluble microbial products, nitrification, and solid retention time may impact DBPFPs. The study is a comprehensive survey on an assessment of DBP precursor removal efficiencies in a large-scale WWTP. \nThree continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) and two sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were designed to simulate different biological treatment processes in the laboratory. For the three CSTRs, HAAFP decreased as nitrification improved from a poor to a good level. THMFP, however, was not found to be clearly correlated with nitrification. For the two SBRs that were operated at the same SRTs and with complete nitrification, the oxic-anoxic SBR with better denitrification had decreased DBPFP. During an 8-h cycle of an SBR operation, the majority of DBP precursor removal was completed with the bulk removal of wastewater organics. The oxic reactions had a faster removal rate and greater removal efficiency than the anoxic reactions. Although the majority of wastewater organics were removed by biological treatment processes, the remaining organic matter had a higher potential to form DBPs upon chlorination. The study provides information on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes on a variety of wastewater parameters, organic matter, and precursors for DBPs. The information can be beneficially used by wastewater and water professionals to minimize the health risks posed by wastewater-derived DBPs. \nMaterials of human origin (MHOs) are the main constituents of wastewater organics. This research monitored DBPs in an indoor swimming pool over a 1-year period following water change, explored DBPFP from MHOs, and developed a model to simulate DBPs in swimming pool water. As the time since the water change increased, the HAA concentrations increased up to 1650 \u00c2\u00b5g/L while the THM concentrations fluctuated in a range between 40 and 181 \u00c2\u00b5g/L over the 1-year period in the monitored pool. The difference between the concentrations of HAAs and THMs is attributed to three factors: (1) MHOs from pool users; (2) slow HAA reduction; and (3) long water retention. The model developed based on a mass balance and pseudo first-order kinetics achieved a good simulation of a real swimming pool system at long water age. The sensitivity analysis indicates that MHO loadings would impact DBPs in swimming pool water. The research reveals that MHOs contribute to DBP formation and are an important source of DBPs in swimming pools. As MHOs are continuously brought in by swimmers and pools are continuously exposed to disinfectants, pool water represents extreme cases of disinfection that differ from the disinfection of drinking water, and the net-accumulated HAAs could pose negative health risks to human beings. The study can help water professionals to better understand the contribution of MHOs to DBP precursors.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12791], "author_name_tesi": "Tang, Hao ", "last_name_ssi": "Tang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John M.

The planning problem is heavily influenced by transportation costs, whose calculation is based on a stochastic environment\nwith random service and travel times. The main contributions of this thesis are the computational methodologies that solve the problem under different conditions. All these methodologies are developed in the context of supply chain procurement planning, but they are not necessarily restricted to this context. They can be modified and adapted to other distributed planning and scheduling problems.\n\nThe Double Auction Market Mechanism (DAMM) is an innovative distributed negotiation mechanism for supply chain procurement planning. It is developed to achieve a common objective among multiple individual decision makers by modeling their respective interests in a virtual market for trading transportation tasks. The trading mechanism emulates the double auction institutions of a real market. For trading, double auction institutions enable exchange of transportation tasks among a transportation company and its trucks, which are modeled as software agents. An agent's decision making among market interactions is based on a set of stochastic rules, which consider its self-interest with the support of transportation cost evaluation. Iterated task exchange among agents drives the task allocation to Pareto optimality, which is derived from the concept of market equilibrium. DAMM is an any-time negotiation\nprotocol, so it is useful for dynamic  ptimization and contingency planning.\n\nA Coordinated Reinforcement Learning (CRL) method is developed to refine the distributed transportation plans generated by distributed heuristics based on DAMM. Through analyzing the drawbacks of the distributed double auction\nheuristic due to its strict market rules, we enable the task agents in the virtual market to return to their previous stages and reconsider their decisions for market trading interactions. This is realized in the framework of reinforcement learning (RL). To be adaptive in the framework of RL, the task allocation derived from the transportation plans is defined as a state; the collective proposals of the task agents are defined as an action; the cost saving during one round of market interaction is defined as a reward; the update of  transportation plans resulting from updating task\nallocation is defined as a state transition. CRL with tabular representations effectively refines the distributed transportation plans generated by DAMM.\n\nA meta-heuristic enabled multi-agent optimization architecture is developed for\ndynamic supply chain procurement planning. This development is based on analyzing drawbacks of DAMM and the curse of dimensionality of CRL. To escape from local optimality towards a higher quality solution, we introduce meta-heuristics over agent interactions to advise agents' searching processes. We mainly propose the variable neighborhood search meta-heuristic (VNS-MH) over the distributed market based heuristic (DMBH), which is based on DAMM. VNS-MH not only performs better on achieving optimality than DMBH, but also requires less memory and computational time than its predecessor -- coordinated reinforcement learning (CRL).\n\nA multi-player game with multiple stages is designed to model task delegations among multiple self-interested transportation companies. The delegations are useful for dealing with infeasible or extremely expensive tasks because of transportation companies' limitations on vehicle capacities or restrictions on time windows. Task delegations have to address the self-interests of transportation companies. This turns into a game with multiple stages, each of which incurs a round of double auction interactions. In this game, multiple players, representing a set of transportation companies, aim to maximize their\nown payoffs summed over multiple stages. By playing the game repeatedly, we develop an evolutionary method, combining reinforcement learning and fictitious playing, to seek a solution. This method is based on the equilibrium concept of evolutionary stable strategy to successfully achieve a solution to the complex game.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3641], "author_name_tesi": "Tang, Kaizhi ", "last_name_ssi": "Tang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kaizhi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Natarajan Gautam", "Ernest Emory Enscore Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Chair", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Member", "Natarajan Gautam, Committee Member", "Ernest Emory Enscore Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["double auction", "market mechanism", "supply chain procurement", "transportation planning", "multi-agent system", "contingency planning", "reinforcement learning", "meta-heuristic", "variable neighborhood search", "dynamic optimization", "distributed heuristic", "multi-stage game", "evolutionary method", "fictitious playing", "evolutionary stable strategy"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "DISSOLVED COPPER REMOVAL BY ELECTROWINNING PROCESS FROM WASTE BRINE SOLUTION", "id": "15052lut34", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15052", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Copper in sewage sludge is regulated under the land application regulations by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in 1994. To comply with EPA regulations, Penn State University has been sending their sewage sludge to a landfill due to high copper concentrations for the past 30 years. A previous study indicates that the main source of copper was the corrosion of copper in the University\u2019s steam heating systems. The copper in condensates were captured by the ion exchange softening process and released into the university sanitary sewer systems through the waste brine solution. This study focused on removing dissolved copper from synthetic water samples and actual waste brine solutions which generated from Penn State University\u2019s Steam Plant. To aid in copper removal, a lab scale electrowinning process was constructed. At first, synthetic water samples were prepared for the test had similar copper concentration as the actual waste brine solution. Various levels (0 \u2013 4 M) of sodium chloride were evaluated in this study. The results indicated that the concentration of sodium chloride plays a major role in copper removal. More than 90% of copper reduction could be achieved after three hours of reaction at an appropriate salt concentration (0.04 \u2013 1.5 M). Several electrochemical parameters, distance between electrodes and the voltage applied into the system, were studied and verified. Both of them play important roles in copper removal. A significant positive correlation existed between voltage and maximum copper reduction. Current efficiency decreases with increasing time of electrowinning, and it is low, only 14 \u2013 23%. Two types of internal circulation reactors were constructed for copper electrowinning test. One has three square plate electrodes, two for anodes, one for cathode. Another use aluminum or titanium/platinum alloy basket electrode as cathode, anode still use graphite rod electrode. The copper remove efficiency for both reactors lower than 55% and some blue flocs were precipitated out. A bench scale test using batch reactor was conducted using actual waste brine solutions collected at University East Steam Plant. Around 50% of copper reduction achieved after three hours of reaction, which is much lower than the remove efficiency of synthetic water. 85% of copper reduction achieved after three hours of reaction, with high initial copper concentration (221 mg/L). High salt concentration (2.0 \u2013 2.5M) and low copper concentration of actual waste brine water (6.5 \u2013 63.5 mg/L) are likely the reasons. The extracted copper did not stick to the electrode very well, but those copper can be removed completely using a bag filter.

An important feature pertaining to the study of these markets is the large amount of capital investment in building local telephone networks or cable television system infrastructures.  Most of these costs are very industry-specific and irreversible.  The classic entry decision will then depend on both a firm's current state and its expected future values. Rapid technological development and progress during the past fifteen years, however, has dramatically reduced the costs in transmission and digital compression, which has not only lowed the general entry barrier but also indicated various ways to enter into the telecommunications service market. Heterogenous firms will seek the most profitable way to enter the targeted market by comparing the discounted present values of all entry alternatives.\n\n\n  The first chapter is an empirical study of entry and exit in local telephone markets.  It is in line with a large literature in industrial organization\nhas analyzed the relationship between the degree of firm\nheterogeneity and the entry and exit pattern of an industry over\ntime.  Using a panel data set on the entry and exit of firms in the\nlocal telephone market in Pennsylvania from 1996 to 2003, I examines two sources of firm heterogeneity: the level\nof pre-entry experience of the firm and whether the firm owns or\nrents its capital equipment.  In particular, this research studies\nhow differences in firms prior to their entry affects their\nsubsequent performance in the local telephone market. First, the firms renting its capital equipment(``reseller\") are found to consist of a higher percentage of experienced firms than the firms owning its equipment(``facilities-based\"). Second, the firms with many years of related-business experience pre-entry(``experienced\") have lower turnover rates than the firms with very few or zero years of experience(``inexperienced\"), and this difference is not observed in the group comparison between ``reseller\" and ``facilities-based\". Lastly, the early cohort of ``inexperienced\" firms is more likely to survive longer than the later cohort; yet, this is not true of ``experienced\" firms.   These findings indicate that heterogeneous firms choose a different entry or exit path to lower the total costs of large amount of investment when they make entry decisions into the local telephone market.\n\n\nWith a market-level panel data, I investigate the broadband diffusion among cable\nsystems, a type of facility-based broadband provider, and\nexamines how competition policy\n affects the diffusion pattern across over nine states in the U.S. during the period from 2000 to 2005.  Two stages of broadband investment are distinguished, namely\n the decision to upgrade a currently one-way system into\n a two-way system and the subsequent decision to offer digital\n products. The second chapter also examines the role of competition, regulation and other demand and cost factors\n in both decisions.  Empirical evidence shows that economies of scale and economies of\n scope both encourage the large cable system to upgrade its network\n infrastructure and offer more advanced broadband digital services. The digital video service competition and\n the high-speed Internet access service competition\n are found to have different influences on the cable systems' upgrading and\n diversification decisions. In addition, the local regulatory environment also affects the cable system's\nupgrading decision.\n\n\n   An interesting observation found in the data set used in the second chapter motivates my last paper.  I observe a substantial percentage of cable systems initially offering only one kind of broadband digital services (i.e. either high-speed Internet access or digital video programming service), after making a large amount of investment in upgrading their one-way cable system, and then adding the other broadband digital service a few years later.   This observation of sequential diversification suggests that the differences in entry costs along different entry paths may exist.  Given the panel length of only six years, the multinomial logistic model cannot capture the dynamic impact of different sunk entry costs in the broadband market to provide a valid explanation for such an observation.   In the last chapter, I build a dynamic structural model of individual cable operators' decisions to diversify into\noffering broadband digital services such as high-speed Internet\naccess and digital cable television when their cable systems have been upgraded already.   I estimate a dynamic programming model of these\ninvestment decisions and quantify how ownership, local market\ncharacteristics, economies of scope, economies of scale and sunk\ncosts in this industry together impact firms' investment\ndecisions, by affecting the discounted expected profits of\ndifferent choices.   I find that the\nentry costs and unobserved fixed costs of offering different\nbroadband digital services significantly affect cable operators'\nentry decisions. The entry cost for offering two digital services\nsimultaneously is substantially greater than the cost of offering\nonly one digital service as well as the sum of entry costs when\nsequential diversification is undertaken.  In addition, I find\nthat the probability of offering digital service rises with local\nmarket revenue for basic cable services, and economies of scope\nand economies of scale encourage cable operators to eventually\ndiversify into offering two digital services.\n\n  This study provides\nan explanation for the delayed broadband diffusion, and predicts\nthat policies to lower entry costs can help the cable operators to\naccelerate broadband diffusion.  When sunk cost parameters are reduced, the cable systems start their digital offering earlier and more systems end up offering two digital products.  Increasing the sunk cost for sequential diversification decreases the option value for delaying further broadband diversification.  The model also predicts that a non-discriminatory subsidy to the basic cable service will not accelerate the cable systems' broadband diversification and will decrease the total number of systems that offer both digital products at the end of the sample period.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4569], "author_name_tesi": "Tang, Mingzhe ", "last_name_ssi": "Tang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mingzhe", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts", "N Edward Coulson", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse", "Krishna Prasad Jayakar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts, Committee Chair", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse, Committee Member", "Krishna Prasad Jayakar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dynamic programming", "local competition", "broadband diffusion", "nested pseudo-loglikelihood estimation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "RANDOM LASER IN DISORDERED SOLUTIONS", "id": "14189rut141", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14189", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "       Random laser is a small laser source observed in disordered gain media, in-cluding disordered solutions, semiconductor powder, nanostructured thin films, and so on.

Basic geometric characteristics and mechanical properties of the geogrids, particularly tensile behavior at small displacements, were tested in air, followed by bench-scale testing, namely pullout and direct shear tests with geogrids embedded in pavement materials to characterize the geogrid-pavement interfaces. \nThe geogrids were further tested within scaled pavement sections using the one-third model mobile load simulator (MMLS3). During the accelerated testing, both elastic and permanent deformations at the top of the subgrade, vertical stress on top of the subgrade, and strains developed in geogrids were measured in addition to the surface rutting/total permanent deformation of the pavement sections at different stages of MMLS3 load applications. A finite element (FE) response model was created and calibrated through an inverse procedure based on the measurement of elastic pavement responses. Compressive strains in the pavement were extracted from the FE models for the subsequent development of subgrade permanent deformation models. \nA correlation study between the tested geogrid index properties, interface characterizations, and the accelerated tests on subgrade permanent deformation indicates that the geogrid tensile modulus and the geogrid-pavement materials interface shear modulus at small displacements play critical roles in affecting the performance of the geogrids while reinforcing the pavement subgrade. It is noted that the correlation was developed on the basis of a limited number of tested samples. The tensile modulus and interface shear modulus were incorporated into the FE model. \nIn light of the widely-recognized mechanistic-empirical (ME) approach to pavement design, attempts were made to develop a model for predicting permanent deformation of the geogrid-stabilized subgrade. The model adopted in the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) for permanent deformation of unbound pavement layers was modified to accommodate the testing conditions in this study. The model was then calibrated and verified by using the measurements from accelerated tests. It was found that the model underestimated the subgrade permanent deformation to various degrees, although the model was able to predict the rank of the performance among the sections. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6685], "author_name_tesi": "Tang, Xiaochao ", "last_name_ssi": "Tang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaochao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Angelica Palomino", "Angelica M Palomino", "Shelley Marie Stoffels", "Maria Lopez De Murphy", "Charles E Bakis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Angelica Palomino, Dissertation Advisor", "Angelica M Palomino, Committee Chair", "Shelley Marie Stoffels, Committee Chair", "Maria Lopez De Murphy, Committee Member", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pavements", "geogrid", "soft soil subgrade", "accelerated testing", "instrumentation", "mechanistic empirical design", "finite element"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "DYE-DOPED CALCIUM PHOSPHOSILICATE NANOPARTICLES FOR EARLY DETECTION OF HUMAN CANCERS", "id": "13206xxt104", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "13206", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "About 1.7 million new cancer cases are projected by the American Cancer Society to occur in the United States in 2016.

In particular, the manufacture of large quantities of CPSNPs is the prerequisite of the transition from in vivo animal experiments to human clinical trials. Surface modification of CPSNPs is essential for the targeted delivery of active agents. Moreover, the design and preparation of CPSNP-based nanocomposite as the contrast agent for multimodal imaging will benefit the early diagnosis of human cancers.\nIn Chapter 3, a benchtop scale-up van der Waals assisted microsphere laundering (VAML) approach is investigated to launder and disperse a large quantity of CPSNPs synthesized in Igepal\u00ae CO-520/cyclohexane/water reverse micelles. The laundering is conducted in a 1L separatory funnel with buoyant polymeric microspheres are used as the media for CPSNPs deposition. Similar to the previously published HPLC laundering approach, VAML includes three stages; namely loading, laundering and eluting, where solvents with different dielectric constants are used to control the colloidal interaction between the microsphere media and CPSNPs. During the loading and washing stages, 25 vol% cyclohexane/ethanol and pure ethanol are used and the van der Waals attraction between the media and CPSNPs is stronger than the electrostatic repulsion as the result of the low dielectric constants of the solvents. While in the eluting step, 70/30 ethanol/water (V/V) with a higher dielectric constant is used and the CPSNPs are detached due to the predominant repulsive interaction. The total interaction energies (kT) and attachment efficiencies among CPSNPs and microspheres, as well as among CPSNPs for each stage are calculated using a modified DLVO theory. As expected, the attachment efficiencies for the loading and washing step are high, predicting the detention of CPSNPs on the media. For the eluting step, low attachment efficiency is calculated, agreeing with the detachment of dispersed CPSNPs from the microspheres. With the VAML method, a batch of CPSNPs with 25-fold of the standard HPLC laundering is produced. The zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency of the active reagents, fluorescent emission intensity, particle size distribution, dispersion state and cytotoxicity of the CPSNPs prepared with the standard and scale-up preparation processes are also compared. The results verify that the VAML is an effective scale-up laundering approach to produce a large quantity of CPSNPs for future clinical study.\nIn Chapter 4, the bioconjugation of indocyanine green (ICG)-doped CPSNPs with selected aptamer to target receptor cholecystokinin B (CCKBR) and the application of bioconjugated CPSNPs for the near infrared (NIR) imaging of pancreatic tumor in vivo are examined. The citrate-terminated ICG-CPSNPs are synthesized and laundered with standard synthesis and HPLC laundering approaches. The CPSNPs are PEGylated with Amine-PEG-Carboxyl and then bioconjugated with the selected aptamer (AP1153) via EDC/Sulfo-NHS crosslinking reaction. ICG-CPSNPs are also bioconjugated with natural CCKBR targeting ligand, Gastrin 16 peptide (G16), for the comparison with aptamer in efficacy. The mean zeta potential of ICG-CPSNPs with different surface modifications is measured to verify the chemical functionalization. Athymic mice established with PANC-1 orthotopic tumors are tail-vein injected with a single dose of AP1153-PEG-ICG-CPSNPs, G16-PEG-ICG-CPSNPs, Methoxy-PEG-ICG-CPSNPs, Methoxy-PEG-Ghost-CPSNPs and free ICG (100 \uf06dL, 1.0x10-5 M ICG). The whole animal NIR imaging study is conducted 15 hours post-injection and the distribution of ICG-CPSNPs is examined with excised organs, confirming that the bioconjugated aptamer effectively targets the pancreatic tumors in vivo. A more intensive emission signal is observed with AP1153-PEG-ICG-CPSNs compared with the controls, fully demonstrating the potential of AP1153-PEG-ICG-CPSNPs for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\nIn Chapter 5, the preparation of novel ensemble nanocomposites based on ICG-CPSNPs and magnetite NPs as the contrast agent for multimodal imaging is investigated. Citrate-ICG-CPSNPs are synthesized with double reverse micelle approach, laundered with HPLC laundering method, and then PEGylated with Amine-PEG-Thiol. Magnetite NPs are synthesized via aqueous co-precipitation of iron (II) sulfate, iron (III) chloride and potassium hydroxide and surface modified with sodium citrate and Amine-PEG-Maleimide. Magnetite NPs are laundered with centrifugation method after synthesis and each surface functionalization, and the changes in isoelectric point of magnetite NPs verify the surface modification. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are used to determine the magnetite NP size distribution and morphology. The use of ICG-CPSNPs as the contrast agent of NIR imaging is confirmed with both bovine blood and porcine muscle tissue. The photoacoustic properties of ICG-CPSNPs are also evaluated using tissue-mimicking phantom and the detection limit of ICG-CPSNPs is 0.1 \uf06dM. The ensemble nanocomposite is formed via the thioether linkage among Thiol-PEG-ICG-CPSNPs and Maleimide-PEG-Magnetite NPs with the morphology determined using TEM. With the combination of ICG-CPSNPs and magnetite NPs, the ensemble nanocomposite is a promising contrast agent for multimodal imaging, including NIR imaging, photoacoustic imaging and magnetic resonance imaging, which can improve the diagnosis of human cancers.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12894], "author_name_tesi": "Tang, Xiaomeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Tang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaomeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Paul S Cremer", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Paul S Cremer, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Calcium phosphosilicate", "Cancer diagnosis", "Bioimaging", "Bioconjugation", "Targeted delivery"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Use of Human induced-pluripotent Stem Cells to Understand Molecular Mechanisms of Autism", "id": "21451", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9748", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite having diverse capabilties, the human brain has limited ability in regenerating itself. This drawback hinders brain repair process in brain injury or neurodegenerative conditions, and imposes serious limitations to research efforts using human brain cells. In a major paradigm-shift, recent advances in stem cell biology have empowered scientists with the ability to generate a large quantity of human brain cells from stem cells. These technological breakthroughs not only offer great hope for regenerative medicine, but also make it possible to systematically study brain functions utilizing human brain cells.\n\nIn order to realize the full potential of stem cell technology in studying the human brain, it is critical to derive various human brain cell types in significant amount, at the maturation stages similar to the endogenous human brain cells. Different protocols have been used to differentiate human iPS cells (induced-Pluripotent Stem Cells) into neurons for disease modeling and tranplantation, but their functional maturation process has varied greatly among different studies. In this dissertation, we demonstrate that laminin, a commonly used substrate for iPSC cultures, was inefficient in promoting full functional maturation of hiPSC-derived neurons. In contrast, astroglial substrate greatly accelerated the neurodevelopmental processes of hiPSC-derived neurons, which highlight a critical role of astrocytes in promoting neural differentiation and functional maturation of human neurons derived from hiPSCs. Moreover, our data provide a reliable protocol to generate functionally mature human neurons from stem cells, and present a thorough developmental timeline of normal human iPSC-derived neurons, as benchmarks to detect disease-relevant phenotypes and assess the efficiency of therapeutic agents.\n\nWe next employed our glia-NPC (Neuroprogenitor Cell) co-culture system to study the molecular mechanisms of Rett syndrome, a severe form of autism spectrum disorder mainly caused by dysfunction of a single gene MeCP2 (Methyl-CpG binding Protein 2) located on the X-chromosome (Chahrour and Zoghbi, 2007). Rett patients develop relatively normally within 6-18 months after birth but then display developmental regression with impaired motor function, cognitive deficit, and even premature death (Chahrour and Zoghbi, 2007). Previous studies have demonstrated that MeCP2 regulates global gene transcription, and have identified a variety of downstream signaling molecules in neurons (Zoghbi and Bear, 2012; Ebert et al., 2013a). However, why Rett patients show a delayed developmental regression after birth is still an unanswered question. In this dissertation, we demonstrated that KCC2 (Potassium Chloride Co-transporter 2), a K+-Cl- co-transporter that directly regulates both GABA and glutamatergic functions, may mediate the functional output of MeCP2 in governing the course of brain development. We discovered that human neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) originated from Rett patient showed a significant deficit in KCC2 expression and a delayed GABA functional switch, which were rescued by IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor-1) treatment. Moreover, introduction of KCC2 into Rett human neurons lead to a rescue of Rett-relevant deficits in excitatory synapse function to levels comparable as using MeCP2 restoration. We have confirmed our major findings from human neuron experiments in parallel studies carried out in cultured mouse neurons utilizing gene expression manipulation methods. We further demonstrated that MeCP2 interacts with REST (RE1-Silencing Transcription factor) to regulate KCC2 expression. Together, we propose that reduction in KCC2 expression in Rett neurons may contribute to the developmental regression due to deficits in GABA functional switch and glutamatergic synapses. Therefore, increasing KCC2 expression level may be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of Rett syndrome and other autism spectrum disorders at large.\n\nIn addition to our work on iPS cell-derived human neurons, we have developed a protocol to reproducibly generate human glial cells from iPS cells. Using the iPS cell-derived human glial cells and human astroglial cell lines, we have carefully analyzed the differences between human and mouse astrocytes in their gene expression and functional output. Interestingly, comparing to mouse glial cells, human glial cells strongly promote stem cell proliferation, but not their neuronal differentiation. When mouse neurons were cultured on human astrocytes, the formation of inhibitory synapses were greatly facilitated, while excitatory synapse formation was not changed. In addition, cultured human astrocytes secrete large amount of glutamate. Co-culture with neurons halted the secretion of glutamate from human astrocytes. Our functional experiments and parallel transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling highlight the inter-species difference between human and mouse astrocytes to aid future researches on understanding the unique functions of human brain, and will help develop effective therapies that target astrocytes to treat human brain diseases.\n\nIn summary, our work has established a streamlined procedure to reliably generate human neurons and glial cells from iPS cells, characterized the molecular and functional differences between human and mouse astrocytes, and discovered that deficiency in KCC2 is a core symptom of Rett syndrome. Our novel understandings on the biology of human neurons and glial cells in health and disease conditions will provide critical insight into the inner workings of human brain, and lead to rational development of novel therapeutic strategies to effectively rectify disturbances thereof.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9499], "author_name_tesi": "Tang, Xin ", "last_name_ssi": "Tang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gong Chen", "Douglas Cavener", "Bernhard Luscher", "Melissa Rolls", "Yingwei Mao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gong Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Chair", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Member", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member", "Yingwei Mao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Human iPSC", "astrocyte", "neuron", "functional maturation", "synapse", "KCC2", "GABA functional switch", "MeCP2", "REST", "Rett syndrome", "Autism"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "HIDDEN RNA CODES REVEALED FROM THE PLANT IN VIVO RNA STRUCTUROME", "id": "14297yxt148", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "14297", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "RNA plays vital roles in cell function. For instance, regulation of translation, polyadenylation and splicing controls. RNAs can fold into secondary and tertiary structures, which perform key biological functions such as gene regulation. The understanding of RNA structure has been greatly improved during the last decade, including computational RNA secondary and tertiary structure prediction. Several chemicals, including DMS and SHAPE, can modify single stranded nucleotides on the RNA secondary structure, and the probability of base-pairing for each nucleotide on the RNA can be derived from these wet bench data known as reactivity. Those reactivities can be used as structural restraints that greatly improve the accuracy of RNA structure prediction. In order to understand how RNAs fold genome-wide in living cells and their roles in gene regulation, we developed a method that employs high-throughput sequencing to perform genome-wide RNA structure mapping in vivo using DMS, which can penetrate the cell walls and membranes. This is the first in vivo genome-wide RNA structurome ever provided in any organism. For computational processing of this new type of high-throughput sequencing data, I have also developed a new computational pipeline that includes reads mapping, reactivity calculations and RNA secondary structure prediction. The computational pipeline was packaged, integrated and implemented on the PSU Galaxy platform as a strong bioinformatics tool for computational analysis of high-throughput RNA structural profiling data. \n    From my computational analysis of our high-throughput RNA structural profiling data in Arabidopsis thaliana, we found a repeat pattern of DMS reactivity in the coding region of the mRNAs as a global pattern. The pattern also shows a strong correlation of this feature with translation efficiency. We also revealed a strong secondary structure at the 3\u2019 ends of alternatively spliced exons that are not spliced. That implies an important role of RNA structure in the regulation of alternative splicing. In addition, we observed a conserved structural motif at alternative polyadenylation sites, which implies a role of RNA structure in alternative polyadenylation. Most surprisingly, we found that mRNAs associated with stress responses tend to have special features that include more single-strandedness and longer maximal loop length. Those features could enable easier conformational changes in response to environmental conditions. \n    In addition to these biological findings, we also found a relationship between RNA structure and the encoded protein structure, wherein regions of individual mRNAs that code for protein domains (or ordered regions) generally have significantly higher structural reactivity than regions that encode protein domain junctions (or disordered regions).\n    We have recently applied Structure-seq to rice (Oryza sativa), the most widely consumed staple food for humans, to investigate changes in RNA structure induced by heat stress. Significantly elevated average structural reactivity was observed at 42 \u00b0C on all mRNAs regions as compared to 22 \u00b0C. Among these regions, 3\u2019 UTRs saw the most significant elevation of average structural reactivity at high temperature, and 5\u2019 UTRs saw the largest scatter in average structural reactivity between temperatures, indicating regulatory roles of RNA structure within these regions. We have also found a negative correlation between the change of average structural reactivity and RNA abundance between 22 oC and 42 oC, suggesting that the rice whole transcriptome is a thermo-sensor. \n    Lastly, I have identified thousands of SNPs as riboSNitches in Arabidopsis thaliana, which are predicted to induce significant RNA secondary structure change. Surprisingly, a large portion of these identified riboSNitches are synonymous mutations, which do not lead to change of the encoded protein sequence, suggesting that synonymous substitutions are not silent in numerous cases. These riboSNitches are good candidates for future investigation and validation by wet lab experiments.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15447], "author_name_tesi": "Tang, Yin ", "last_name_ssi": "Tang", "first_name_ssi": "Yin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah M.

In 1990, she was at the center of a controversy that started around her publication of a novel titled \"Was bleibt\" (\"What remains\"). The controversy expanded to consider more generally the role of the Stasi (secret police) in GDR culture and affected in particular the generation of GDR writers born around 1930, who were not dissidents, and had not left the country in the 40 years of its existence. Prior to the demise of the GDR, Wolf\u00a1\u00afs stories, novels and essays, as well as her political interventions during 1989, were highly considered for their moral and political standing and she was regarded, especially by feminist and progressive intellectuals, as one of the few women intellectuals of the 20th century, among the likes of Simone de Beauvoir and Hannah Arendt.\n\nAs a response to the controversy around Christa Wolf, my dissertation attempts to understand Wolf less as an isolated \u00a1\u00b0writer\u00a1\u00b1 than as an \u00a1\u00b0effect\u00a1\u00b1 of political and cultural discourse about the GDR in the Federal Republic of Germany prior to unification and in united Germany after 1989. However, my investigations also take into consideration Wolf\u00a1\u00afs own opinions about her role as intellectual active in the GDR, as well as her explicit pacifist and feminist positions, which she enunciated in both essays and her literature. Thus, I play the writer\u00a1\u00afs own \u00a1\u00aeself-reflective\u00a1\u00af texts over and against the texts that made Wolf first into the banner of an alternative socialism and second, after the Wende, into the target of conservative accusations. Her literature was suddenly regarded as bad, moralistic, writing. In short, I try to answer the question: how is it possible that one writer\u00a1\u00afs literature is praised universally as \u00a1\u00b0critical\u00a1\u00b1 one moment, and denigrated as banal and simply moralistic the next?  \n\nDavid Bathrick\u00a1\u00afs \"The Powers of Speech\" deals with similar issues from a Foucaultian perspective. In particular, Bathrick engages language and discourse in the GDR. He focuses on the notion of a literary public sphere in the GDR, the meaning of socialist public intellectuals, and the distinctions between dissidence and the GDR intellectuals\u00a1\u00af opposition to a stultified party system. Bathrick\u00a1\u00afs study helped me elaborate the main framework of my dissertation. \n\nTwo questions specifically guide my approach to Wolf: i.) How could Wolf\u00a1\u00afs texts operate within and without the GDR as critical while at the same time be socialist - and thus have the approval of the state? ii.) How and to what extent could Wolf\u00a1\u00afs dissidence be constructed in non-socialist countries and, also, to a limited extent, within the GDR State? Accordingly, my dissertation has two parts. Part One deals with Wolf\u00a1\u00afs own understanding of the function of literature and its relation to socialism. As a case in point I analyze her 1968 novel Nachdenken \u00a8\u00b9ber Christa T.  Part Two studies literary critical responses to Wolf\u00a1\u00afs work more extensively, including more recent texts, in different time periods and different places. In particular I look at the GDR, the FRG, the USA and post 1989 Germany. Here, I look specifically at the role and function of feminism in both Wolf\u00a1\u00afs texts and the reception of Wolf. My dissertation, unlike Bathrick\u00a1\u00afs work, focuses on the specificity of the case of a woman intellectual, both a socialist and a feminist. Ultimately, the dissertation makes a point that this is the difference that constitutes the case \u00a1\u00b0Wolf.\u00a1\u00b1\n\nThe dissertation argues that Wolf understood literature as a means to uncover \u00a1\u00b0the blind spot\u00a1\u00b1 of the subject first and of culture second. This act of \u00a1\u00b0uncovering\u00a1\u00b1 is the first step on the way to find healing for past traumas (fascism, for example) and, hence, to make changes (improve real existing socialism). In Wolf\u00a1\u00afs notion of \u00a1\u00b0the blind spot\u00a1\u00b1, priority is given to the repression and exclusion of values associated with the feminine \u00a1\u00b0space,\u00a1\u00b1 a space left out of dominant culture or the history of the victors.  This could be seen as Wolf\u00a1\u00afs feminist critique of universal (bourgeois) values, including the notions of the theoretical intellectual proposed by Julien Benda and Pierre Bourdieu. Moreover, Wolf\u00a1\u00afs focus on a feminine space of culture from which to critique instrumental reason, the blind spot of Western civilization, and from which to imagine an alternative mythology, also helps expose the insufficiency of Bathrick\u00a1\u00afs mode of analysis. For example, I argue that no matter how exhaustive his analysis of the socialist public intellectual in the GDR is, his work (like Foucault\u00a1\u00afs) does not do justice to Wolf\u00a1\u00afs case due to its lack of a gender perspective.\n\nIn Wolf\u00a1\u00afs case, a feminist/gendered approach does enrich our understanding of the concept of the intellectual. In effect, her critical involvement with society was always the product of socialism with a feminist accent. However, it seems that in the reception of her texts, feminism and socialism have been dissociated. Wolf\u00a1\u00afs commitment to socialism - an important aspect in Wolf\u00a1\u00afs political engagement as an intellectual - was largely ignored by feminist critics in the FRG and the US. Wolf is very often put into a Western theoretical discourse about feminism and her works are read only as embodiment of the wide-ranging power of certain Western feminist theories. The tension existing between Wolf\u00a1\u00afs own understanding of feminism and the feminist literary responses to her texts seems to suggest that in defining Wolf\u00a1\u00afs oeuvre from a feminist perspective, not only is gendered difference given priority over other modes of difference, but socialism has been totally ignored. Wolf\u00a1\u00afs reluctance to call herself a feminist might be understood as her resistance to distinguish between feminism and socialism, or rather, her critique of Western liberal feminism. My dissertation, by considering Wolf\u00a1\u00afs own intellectual positions, alongside the discourse that constructed her as either a feminist writer/intellectual or a dissident writer, corrects this blind spot in the reception of Wolf.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6789], "author_name_tesi": "Tang, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Tang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cecilia Novero", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Joan Landes", "Hartmut Heep"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cecilia Novero, Committee Chair", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Member", "Joan Landes, Committee Member", "Hartmut Heep, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Christa Wolf", "women intellectuals", "feminism and socialism"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "ADVANCING HYDROLOGIC MODEL EVALUATION AND IDENTIFICATION USING MULTIOBJECTIVE CALIBRATION, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND PARALLEL COMPUTATION", "id": "7452", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6869", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-01-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis work has comprehensively compared, developed, and implemented tools for advancing the evaluation and identification of hydrologic models including the lumped conceptual Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model coupled with a snow accumulation and ablation model (SNOW-17), the distributed conceptual Hydrology Laboratory Research Modeling System (HL-RMS), and a semi-distributed version of the physical Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM). The thesis work was partitioned into four component studies. Study 1 assesses the efficiency, effectiveness, reliability, and ease-of-use of state-of-the-art evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) tools used in calibrating the SAC-SMA and PIHM. This research proposes a formal metrics-based methodology for algorithm evaluation. Understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses of the currently available EMO algorithms was important for Study 2 in which two parallelization schemes were developed to improve EMO algorithms' performance in terms of their computational cost, solution quality and robustness on a variety of applications including test functions, hydrologic model calibration, and long-term groundwater monitoring design. \nStudy 3 compares the repeatability, robustness, efficiency, and ease-of-implementation of four sensitivity analysis (SA) methods ranging from local analysis using parameter estimation software (PEST) to global approaches including regional sensitivity analysis (RSA), analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Sobol\u00a1\u00afs method.

The law compels Chinese administrative agencies at various levels to publicly and proactively disseminate certain categories of government-held records and documents. The statute also grants Chinese citizens an unprecedented legal right of access to government information. Under the law, any Chinese citizen, legal person and other organization could ask government agencies to disclose records, reports and other official documents that are not exempt.  If the requests are not granted, requesters could apply for administrative reconsideration or sue relevant government agencies for judicial-authorized disclosure. \nThis dissertation assesses and critiques the legal right of access to government-held information in China with a special focus on legislative history, rationales, significance and efficacy of OGI Regulations. The dissertation employs legal research and many other research methodologies such as qualitative historical research, political economic research, firsthand experiences with the use of OGI Regulations, and personal interviews, via emails and telephone, with Chinese legal scholars, lawyers, journalists and government officials. Building upon large volumes of primary and secondary sources, the dissertation traces the historical development of over 4000 years of governmental secrecy and transparency in China. The project examines the gradual and incremental legislative movement toward the final passage of Chinese OGI Regulations in 2007, analyses the statutory language of OGI Regulations, comparing the law with international best practices and other relevant Chinese legal documents, and examines implementation of OGI Regulations in terms of both proactive and reactive disclosure of governmental information. The dissertation examines two types of secretive documents that are exempt from the disclosure requirements of OGI Regulations: internal working documents and journalistic internal reference. The project also explores the relationship between the FOI law and Chinese news media. \nThe study has found that hundred schools of thought (e.g., Confucianism, Mohism, Legalism, Taoism), flourishing during the Zhou Dynasty, influenced imperial, modern and even contemporary Chinese leaders in terms of their crafting particular policies toward dissemination of official information. As the two of the most influential ancient Chinese philosophies and ruling ideologies, Confucianism and Legalism were known for suppressing free flow of information. However, pre-modern mass media (e.g., palace gates, court gazettes, short reports) still played a significant role in publicizing official information inside and outside of the bureaucracy in ancient China.\n\nConsistent with many other research findings, this dissertation has found that the entire OGI legislative process in China was elite-driven and policy-driven, although the movement toward greater government transparency in China began in the early 1980s in rural areas and slowly expanded to higher levels of government. The movement culminated in the 2000s when Jintao Hu and Jiabao Wen carried on the torch of transparency and formulated the country\u2019s first freedom of information law, thus marking the fourth peak period of Chinese official transparency (the first three are the Zhou Dynasty, the Tang and Song dynasties, the Republic of China period).\n\nThis dissertation identifies some major external and internal factors that contributed to the enactment of FOI law: China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization and pressure from the United States; top political leaders\u2019 unswerving commitment to openness and transparency; administrative law reform; the improved capacity for government to distribute information; the changed social and informational environments in the early 2000s; reduced political sensitivity of OGI reform made possible by law reformers who reinterpreted Marxism and modified the Western concept of the right to know, and framed the proposed FOI law as a tool for promoting economic growth and social stability rather than as a vehicle for freedom of expression.\n\nThis research project has found that China has embraced many international best practices in statutory language of its FOI law and even go beyond international standards in some regards, at the same time, the country tends to be conservative in many key aspects of the law. Overall, the FOI law is strongly proactive for disclosure but generally weak regarding information disclosure upon request thanks to the legislation\u2019s poorly drafted exemptions. The half-heartedness of the government in accepting international best practices reflects the gradual and incremental nature of China\u2019s political reform. \n\nThe dissertation has found that, overall, the Chinese government has been successful in establishing the foundational FOI platforms and forceful in enforcing proactive disclosure requirements under OGI Regulations. This remarkable and surprising achievement shows viability of a FOI system in an authoritarian regime. This research project also identifies some significant problems in the enforcement of OGI Regulations, such as ineffectiveness of administrative reconsideration and judicial review for rectifying non-compliance with OGI Regulations, widespread use of non-statutory or non-legal reasons for denials of information requests, lack of disclosure of governmental information held by military and national security agencies (e.g., the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of State Security).\n\nThis dissertation has also found that Chinese laws regulating two special kinds of government documents (journalistic internal reference and internal working documents) are problematic. OGI Regulations have no provisions for whether or not internal working documents or journalistic internal reference should be exempt. Chinese administrations have used internal working documents as shields for disclosing information. Agencies may use journalistic internal reference as a reason to deny disclosure in the near future.\n\nThe research has found that, unlike many foreign journalists who have played pivotal roles for proposing, formulating, and using freedom of information laws, Chinese journalists had no involvement in recommending and formulating OGI Regulations. More importantly, Chinese journalists have not systemically and vigorously used OGI Regulations to obtain official information for news reporting purpose. One reason, among many others, for Chinese journalists\u2019 limited use of the FOI law is the lack of strong legal protections for press freedom.\n\nThe dissertation presents a series of legal and policy remedies for Chinese law reformers to consider. Recommendations include but are not limited to: revise OGI Regulations to reflect more international best practices; formulate OGI Law to enhance legal status of FOI legislation; amend Constitution 1982 and explicitly enshrine the key phrase \u201cthe right to know\u201d in the amended document as a foundational constitutional principle; amend existing laws relating to FOI to make sure that disclosure takes precedence; subject the party, the people\u2019s congress, the courts, the procuratorate, and the political consultative conference and other branches of government to information disclosure requirements; expand the people\u2019s right to know by developing a set of OGI-related transparency laws to ensure sufficient access of the public and news media to governmental meetings and facilities.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8061], "author_name_tesi": "Tang, Yong ", "last_name_ssi": "Tang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Martin Halstuk", "Martin Halstuk", "James Ford Risley", "Gretchen G Casper", "Anthony Olorunnisola", "Marie Hardin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Martin Halstuk, Dissertation Advisor", "Martin Halstuk, Committee Chair", "James Ford Risley, Committee Member", "Gretchen G Casper, Committee Member", "Anthony Olorunnisola, Committee Member", "Marie Hardin, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["OGI Regulations", "China", "Government Transparency", "Freedom of Information", "Secrecy and Transparency"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Two Dimensional Layered materials: First-principle Investigation", "id": "28914", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12496", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two-dimensional layered materials have emerged as a fascinating research area\ndue to their unique physical and chemical properties, which di\ufb00er from those of\ntheir bulk counterparts.

We proposed a location-\nbased Sybil detection framework for MANET. In our framework, mobile nodes\nvoluntarily and cooperatively participate in Sybil attack detection by monitoring\ntheir neighbors\u2019 network activities. For each packet observed, a traffic observation\nrecord is created or updated and periodically shared. Our secure observation exchange\nprotocol guarantee the tamper-proof observation. Periodically, the peers\nreconstruct the path that each peer has traversed. Peers with similar paths are\ngrouped together with a simple clustering algorithm. Peers in the same cluster are\nconsidered Sybil identities owned by the same attacker. Our framework yielded\nabove 80% accuracy (true positive rate) at about a 10% false positive rate.\nWe also proposed a sybilproof referral system for BitTorrent. We first introduce\na simple incentive framework, based on a stochastic game model, to encourage\npeers to share their content. From experimental results, the incentives successfully\nmotivate the peers to better contribute in form of the clustering of the peers\naccording to their allocated upload rate. This incentive mechanism was a form of\ndirect reputation which was of rather limited use for a large system like BitTorrent.\nA peer might not have adequate information to make a future judgment about\nanother. We then propose a simple form of reputation sharing, namely chokelist\ndissemination, where the peers shared their lists of free-riders. The experimental\nresults showed that chokelist sharing helped accelerate the process of banning freeriders.\nWe also investigated the behavior of BitTorrent users in quasi steady state\nwith a deterministic game. This game revealed that proper selection of Internet\naccess fees could discourage free-riders.\nThough more effective, reputation sharing (i.e. indirect reputation through\nreferrals such as chokelist dissemination) is vulnerable to Sybil attack. A group\nof Sybil identities owned by the same attacker can collude to manipulate their reputation scores, and significantly affect other innocent peers, as well. To address\nthis problem, we propose a sybilproof referral system. In this system, the total\nreputation score of a referral chain is the product of reputation scores of referrals\nin the chain beginning with \u201cdirect\u201d reputation based on transactional experience.\nThe Sybil attacker can only improve the direct reputation via benign contributions.\nOur reputation system ensure that the direct reputation of each Sybil identity is\nlimited thus limiting the effect of false referrals by them.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [551], "author_name_tesi": "Tangpong, Athichart ", "last_name_ssi": "Tangpong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Athichart", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George Kesidis", "George Kesidis", "Dr Ali R Hurson", "John Metzner", "David Jonathan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George Kesidis, Dissertation Advisor", "George Kesidis, Committee Chair", "Dr Ali R Hurson, Committee Chair", "John Metzner, Committee Member", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mobil Ad-hoc Network (MANET)", "Sybil Attack Detection", "Game Theory", "Sybilproof Referral System", "BitTorrent Incentives"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Stochastic Financial Analytics for Cash-flow Bullwhip, Cash-flow Forecast, and Optimizing Working Capital", "id": "22574", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8483", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Managing modern supply chains involves dealing with complex dynamics of materials, information, and cash flows around the globe, and is a key determinant of business success today. One of the well-recognized challenges in supply chain management is the inventory bullwhip effect in which demand forecast errors are amplified as it propagates upstream from a retailer, in part because of lags and errors in information flows. Adverse effects of such bullwhip effect include excessive inventory, stock-outs, backorders, and wasteful swings in manufacturing production. In this dissertation we theorize that inventory bullwhip also leads to cash-flow bullwhip (CFB). Specifically, this research focuses on studying CFB by developing mathematical and simulation models to analyze the relationship between inventory and cash-flow bullwhip by using Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) as a metric. CFB predicted by the proposed mathematical models approximately differ 14% from detailed simulation models. We find that increasing variability increases inventory and cash-flow bullwhip along with lead time, whereas increasing the demand observation period has the opposite effect. The average marginal impact of the bullwhip effect on the CFB is approximately 20%. Additionally, the CFB is also an increasing function of an expected value of inventory and a decreasing function of an expected value of demand.\n\nNext, we develop stochastic financial analytics for cash flow forecasting for firms by integrating two models: (1) Markov chain model of the aggregate payment behavior across all customers of the firm using accounts receivable aging and; (2) Bayesian model of individual customer payment behavior at the individual invoice level. As the stochastic dynamics of cash flow evolves every day, the forecast can be updated every time an invoice is paid. The proposed model is back-tested using empirical data from a small manufacturing firm and found to differ 3%-6% from actual monthly cash flow, and differs approximately 2%-4% compared to actual annual cash flow. The forecast accuracy of the proposed stochastic financial analytics model is found to be considerably superior to other techniques commonly used. Furthermore, in computer simulation experiments, the proposed model is found to be largely robust to supply chain dynamics, including when subjected to severe bullwhip effect. The proposed model has been implemented in Excel, which allows it to be easily integrated with the accounts receivable aging data, making it practicable for small and large firms.\n\nLastly, we identify a potential strategy to engineer a solution for dynamic financial decisions. This part focuses on maximizing profit of two types of manufacturing firms: firms with non-recurring customers and firms with recurring customers. The proposed model determines the optimal pricing of products sold to different customers using an integer programming model in which Friedman\u2019s model is used to estimate bid winning probability and the model is constrained by several operational factors including working capital and customer credit risk. Customer credit risk is modeled as the probability of payment delay or default, which is used to add a risk premium into the bid price. The model can be used for decision-support in business development to select an optimal portfolio of customer projects or bids to pursue. Detailed industrial case studies used to test the efficacy of the proposed model show that the Price/Cost ratio has an inversely proportional relationship to the winning probability, and the winning probability has the inversely proportional relationship to the risk premium. However, at a high winning probability, the firm may not be able to make a profit due to the unrealistically low bidding price. The results also show the bidding price at which the firm is expected to maximize its profit.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8384], "author_name_tesi": "Tangsucheeva, Rattachut ", "last_name_ssi": "Tangsucheeva", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rattachut", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vittaldas V Prabhu", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "Tao Yao", "Douglas J Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vittaldas V Prabhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "Douglas J Thomas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Stochastic", "Analytics", "Cash flow", "Optimization", "Working Capital", "Forecast", "Bullwhip", "Supply chain", "Decision support", "Finance"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Properties and Structure of Coconut Milk Emulsions", "id": "8628", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4803", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Coconut milk is the natural oil-in-water emulsion extracted from coconut (<i>Cocos nucifera</i> L.) endosperm. The emulsion is stabilized by coconut proteins, but is poorly stable due to the insufficient quantity and quality of the proteins present. In order to improve the stability and quality of coconut milk products, various processes and food additives are normally used. However, the underlying emulsion science is still unclear.\n\nThe first objective was to investigate the effects of homogenization and heat treatment. Fresh milk had large but non-flocculated droplets. Homogenization reduced the droplet size, but increased the degree of flocculation via a bridging mechanism. Extensive flocculation and slight coalescence was observed in coconut milk after treatment at temperatures above the denaturation temperature of coconut proteins. Flocculation was responsible for increased viscosity and retarded creaming.\n\nThe second objective was to determine the influence of pH, and ionic strength. Coconut milk flocculated when the pH was close to the isoelectric point of coconut proteins as the electrostatic repulsion between droplets is reduced due to the loss in surface charge. The addition of NaCl induced flocculation only when the surface charge was insufficient to prevent aggregation due to the screening effect.\n\nThe third objective was to understand the changes in bulk quality and surface properties of coconut milk due to the addition of model surface-active stabilizers [sodium caseinate, whey protein isolate (WPI), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), or polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20)]. When added after homogenization, small-molecule surfactants broke up the flocs while protein stabilizers did not. The addition of any surface-active stabilizer before homogenization increased the efficacy of homogenization and produced stable sub-micron sized emulsion droplets. The improved stability resulted from the displacement of interfacial coconut proteins by the added stabilizers.\n\nThe final objective of this work was to determine the effect of thermal treatments on the stability of stable emulsions prepared with surface-active stabilizers. Coconut milks homogenized with proteins were stable the freeze-thaw cycles while those prepared with small-molecule surfactants were not.

Lithium ion battery technology is the leading candidate for vehicle electrification. Despite many advantages of lithium ion battery technology, over-conservative pack design due to a lack of advanced battery management hinders its widespread deployment in the transportation sector. This dissertation introduces a model-based approach for safe and efficient advanced lithium ion battery management.\nLow order, explicit models of lithium ion cells are critical for real-time battery management system (BMS) applications. Li-ion cell response varies significantly with temperature and cell temperature measurements are often available. This study presents a 7th order, single particle model with electrolyte diffusion and temperature dependent parameters (ESPM-T model). The impedance transfer function coefficients are explicit in terms of the model parameters, simplifying the implementation of temperature dependence yet providing an accurate model. The 7th order, linear, electrolyte enhanced, single particle model (ESPM) is used as the basis for a Luenberger SOC observer for a lithium ion cell. Isothermal and non-isothermal observer performances are compared with a commercially-available finite volume code and the benefits of temperature measurement are shown for a wide range of temperature and pulse C-rates.\nThe ESPM is then extended to a nonlinear, electrolyte-enhanced, single particle model (NESPM), which includes nonlinearities associated with open circuit voltage and Butler-Volmer (B-V) kinetics. The model is validated with experimental full charge, discharge, and HEV cycles from 4.5 Ah high power and 20 Ah high energy graphite (gr)/LiFePO4 (LFP) cells. The NESPM is capable of operating up to 3C constant charge-discharge cycles and up to 25C and 10 sec charge-discharge pulses within 35-65% state of charge (SOC) with less than 2% error for the 4.5 Ah high power cell. For the 20 Ah high energy cell, the NESPM model is capable of operating up to 2C constant charge-discharge cycles and up to 10C and 10 sec charge-discharge pulses within 30-90% SOC window with 3.7% maximum error. \nAn aging model due to solid electrolyte interphase layer growth is added to the NESPM model. The NESPM aging model is then simplified to obtain explicit formulas for capacity fade and impedance rise that depend on the battery parameters and current input history. These simple aging models can be implemented in online model based battery SOH estimation. The formulas show that aging increases with SOC, operating temperature, time, and root mean square (RMS) current. The formula predicts that HEV current profiles with the (i) same average SOC, (ii) small SOC swing, (iii) same operating temperature, (iv) same cycle length, and (v) same RMS current, will have the same cell capacity fade. \n\n\nThe single cell ESPM-T model is extended to a pack model with three cells in parallel to develop thermal management strategies to extend battery life within a desired performance window. Instead of defining battery End of Life (EOL) as an arbitrary percent of capacity loss, it is defined as the cycle number when the battery voltage first hits the maximum or minimum voltage limits for a given drive cycle. In practice, this is when the battery management system must reduce the input current, and the desired performance can no longer be achieved. Three thermal management strategies are simulated to show that elevated temperature operation can significantly extend battery life/reduce battery size while maintaining the desired performance. The effect of cell mismatch in pack performance and life is also analyzed and thermal management strategies to mitigate the mismatch effect are proposed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11315], "author_name_tesi": "Tanim, Tanvir Reza", "last_name_ssi": "Tanim", "middle_name_ssi": "Reza", "first_name_ssi": "Tanvir", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn", "Christopher Rahn", "Chao Yang Wang", "Hosam Kadry Fathy", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Chair", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Member", "Hosam Kadry Fathy, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lithium Battery Modeling", "Battery Management System", "Battery State Estimation", "Hybrid Electric Vehicles"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Exploring Play/playfulness and Learning in the Adult and Higher Education Classroom", "id": "16086", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8154", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Play and playfulness and their role in learning are researched extensively in early childhood education.  However, as the child matures into an adult, play and playfulness are given less attention in the teaching and learning process.  In adult education, there is very little research about play/playfulness and its significance for learning.  Despite this oversight, there are adult educators who routinely incorporate play and playfulness in their classrooms and see it as central in the teaching of adults.  This study used a comparative case study approach to explore the role of play and playfulness in learning in an adult and higher education classroom context.  Based on specific criteria, four playful classrooms were identified and investigated through classroom observations, interviews with the educators, focus group interviews with students, and paper and pencil surveys administered to all students in these classrooms.  Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and the classroom observations were videotaped and reviewed.  Inductive analysis and constant comparative technique were utilized to analyze the data. The findings revealed that educators associated the following elements with play and playfulness: fun, spontaneity, relationship and connection, silliness or goofiness, creativity and imagination.  Furthermore, play and playfulness were most frequently manifested in the classroom through risk taking, storytelling, and physical activities.  Students identified cognitive gains in terms of engagement, retention, and understanding.  More significantly, students indicated that play and playfulness created a unique learning environment that felt safe and encouraged risk taking.  Additionally, play and playfulness created positive affect such as fun, enjoyment, and laughter in the classroom environment. This study addresses the lack of empirical research on play and playfulness in adult learning.  It identifies positive benefits of incorporating play and playfulness in a classroom context and suggests that to fully realize these benefits, educators should adopt a model of learning that embraces the significance of emotions and affect.

This study followed a multi-participant case study approach. Nine science pre-service teachers enrolled in the Secondary Science Teaching course at a large mid-Atlantic University constitute the participants of the study.  Seven videos of lessons were analyzed for the inscription use.  Data analysis demonstrated that preservice teachers used inscriptions in pedagogical and normative ways and the complexity of inscriptions used across different disciplines varies. Preservice teachers used inscriptions 1) to convey final form scientific knowledge, 2) to engage students in scientific practice, 3) to make thinking visible, 4) to connect multiple ideas with multiple inscriptions, and 5) to provide data or example from nature.

In addition, these different uses of inscriptions may impact students\u2019 understandings of how scientists use inscriptions and inscriptional practices. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [554], "author_name_tesi": "Tanis Ozcelik, Arzu ", "last_name_ssi": "Tanis Ozcelik", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Arzu", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott Mc Donald", "Scott Mc Donald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott Mc Donald, Thesis Advisor", "Scott Mc Donald, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Inscriptions", "Science Education", "Preservice Teacher Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Science Teacher Candidates Developing Professional Pedagogical Vision Around Ambitious Science Teaching Practices", "id": "13458axt252", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13458", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines how science teacher candidates negotiate ambitious science teaching practices and how they develop professional pedagogical vision during a science teaching methods course. Specifically, the following research questions are investigated: \u20281) How do teacher candidates negotiate and make meaning of ambitious science teaching practices when they engage in discussions in the first five weeks of methods course? 2) How does the professional pedagogical vision of science teacher candidates develop around teaching practices related to student ideas in a semester-long secondary science teaching methods course? Ambitious science teaching practices are used as part of the curriculum of the science teaching methods course. Using case study design and grounded theory for analysis, the research study investigated six TCs and their instructor during a science teaching methods course. Through using Studiocode video analysis, creating event maps, and applying interactional discourse analysis, I answered the two research questions. Analysis of how TCs negotiate meaning of ambitious science teaching practices yielded three themes: TCs negotiated agency: who is responsible for generating the scientific explanations, what counted as an explanation along with focusing on certain aspects of scientific explanations, and what counted as a phenomenon in the lesson and its relation to the content storyline of the lesson. Analysis of how TCs develop professional pedagogical vision provided four claims: TCs initially identified a small set of important practices and over time identified additional practices, as well as becoming more sophisticated about all of the practices; thus they developed a professional pedagogical vision increasingly aligned with ambitious science teaching. TCs develop professional pedagogical vision through in-the-moment and over-time negotiations of the teaching practices. Findings also showed that material representations of decompositions of teaching practice were important in supporting the negotiation of professional pedagogical vision. TCs negotiate professional pedagogical vision more intensely in the context of local examples of practice than in distal exemplars of practice. Study implications for the preservice teacher education context are discussed.

Environmental issues like global warming and pollution create concerns about continuing consumption of coal and other conventional fossil fuels. Lignocellulosic biomass, such as agricultural residue, can be fermented to ethanol which can act as a good alternative fuel source. Corn stover is the largest currently available lignocellulosic biomass residue in the US, and thus makes an important substrate to evaluate.  The present research aims to employ and enhance biological routes of corn stover conversion to ethanol.  An attempt has been made to combine three upstream unit operations: storage, pretreatment, and hydrolysis, in a simple and robust solid substrate fermentation.  Ensilage was chosen to be the preferred storage method due to low dry matter losses.  White rot fungi which preferentially degrade lignin over cellulose were grown on stover to pretreat the biomass.  Cellulase and xylanase producing Trichoderma species were employed in an attempt to convert crystalline cellulose and hemicellulose to glucose and xylose molecules, respectively.\nInitially, the effect of drying, freezing and refrigeration of corn stover prior to ensilage was studied.  This first experiment was essential to see if lab studies being conducted on frozen stover can be extrapolated to real world scenarios where stover is ensiled fresh or dry.  The treatments were conducted for 2 and 7 days.  No affect of treatments was observed when tested for 2 day time period, while 7 days produced significantly different biomass for each treatment (p < 0.05).  The lowest pH levels were observed in control samples (3.73 \u00b1 0.03) after 21 days of ensilage. All other treatments showed similar pH levels averaging 4.26 \u00b1 0.15.  Water soluble carbohydrate content was observed to be highest in control samples, i.e., freshly ensiled biomass (7.73 \u00b1 0.26 % g/ g initial DM) and lowest in refrigerated biomass (3.86 \u00b1 0.49 %g/ g initial DM).  Addition of enzyme decreased pH values and increased sugar production significantly (p < 0.05). Fiber content of biomass was mostly not affected by the treatments.  Dry and frozen corn stover produced comparable results to the control after ensilage; however refrigeration changed biomass properties considerably.  Based on these results, we selected freezing as our method of storing substrate between harvest and experimentation, with the expectation that real world results would be as good as or better than our experimental trials.\nAs demonstrated in this initial sample pre-storage study, several parameters are useful to understand the effects of treatments and ensilage on the biomass.  These parameters include pH, dry matter loss, water soluble carbohydrates, fiber content (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin), monosaccharides (mainly glucose, xylose, mannose, and arabinose), and organic acids (lactic, acetic, propionic, isobutyric, and butyric acids).  The methods developed to study these variables are highly dependent on sample handling techniques and extraction procedures. In a second methods-development investigation, the effects of particle size, post ensilage biomass drying temperatures, and modified phenol-sulfuric acid methods were evaluated to identify the best approach for post ensilage parameter measurement methods.  A smaller particle size was tested to see if it would decrease the error associated with average sugar measurements.  More sugars were produced in biomass with a smaller particle size, but the variance associated with the sugar averages was similar to the larger particle size for the same number of replicates.   Since particle size reduction did not improve the quality of data and may create problems with translating results to the real world, larger particle sizes are recommended.  Drying at a lower temperature 60\u00b0C, compared to the traditional 105\u00baC, did not lead to significantly higher dry matter loss by possible microbial activity (p > 0.05).  This could be due to low pH values of the biomass after ensilage.  Also, biomass dried at 60\u00baC showed higher sugar concentrations, avoiding possible Maillard reactions at higher temperatures like 105\u00b0C (p < 0.05), so the lower temperature drying appears preferable.  Washing plant material without drying produced higher sugar concentrations than biomass dried at 105\u00b0C.  For sugar concentration measurements, a modified phenol-sulfuric acid method with lower reaction temperatures has been previously recommended to avoid the formation of phenolsulfonic acid.  The acid reduces color intensity and thereby underestimates the sugar concentration.  When tested with corn stover biomass in the present study, the modified phenol-sulfuric acid exhibited much higher sugar concentrations than the traditional method (p < 0.0005), improving the sensitivity of the test.  From this study, a set of post-ensilage paramenter measurement methods have been developed for use in subsequent studies.\nAfter developing pre- and post- ensilage methods, an experiment was designed to combine anaerobic ensilage treatment with an aerobic lignin degradation process in a two step procedure.  The following four factors were considered as issues to be addressed in developing an efficient pretreatment-storage process. (a) Economically, for real world scenarios, it is ideal for the fermentation to be conducted in unsterile conditions.  However, fungi performance might get a boost if the biomass was sterilized and the inoculated fungi do not have to compete with the indigenous microbial community.  Therefore, sterilization was evaluated as an experimental treatment.  (b) White rot fungi usually require 4 days to produce lignin degrading enzymes.  Two time periods, 7 and 14 days, were tested to study lignin degradation levels along with dry matter losses.  (c) Two storage phases, aerobic and anaerobic, were tested in both possible orders.  The sequence of aerobic and anaerobic phases was important because of the following two scenarios.  Starting with an aerobic phase may lead to substantial dry matter loss and also exposes cellulose and hemicellulose polysaccharides to degradation by the indigenous microbial community during ensilage which is undesirable.  Biomass with an aerobic phase after ensilage already has low pH levels which can impede microbial metabolism (see section 3.2).  However, exposure to oxygen can lead to the oxidation of organic acids produced during ensilage.  This situation could raise the pH levels, which is undesirable. Thus testing both the orders is required to identify the potential sequence. (d) A robust competitive fungal population is required to perform in the preferred unsterile conditions. Three white rot fungi: Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, and Pluerotus ostreatus were tested.  \nSterilization through autoclaving decreased initial pH values by 1 pH unit, suggesting a mild pretreatment effect. However, the final pH values were significantly higher, presumably due to elimination of indigenous lactic acid producing bacteria during sterilization (p < 0.01).  Surprisingly, sterilized biomass showed significantly higher dry matter loss (p < 0.0001).  This could be due to freely available sugars and lack of competition in the biomass encouraging high metabolic rates for the surviving and inoculated organisms.  Contrary to expectations, introducing an aerobic phase after ensilage did not increase pH values (p > 0.5) indicating no loss of organic acids due to oxidation.  As expected, 14 days of an aerobic phase caused higher dry matter loss of biomass compared to 7 days, but also produced higher water soluble carbohydrates (p < 0.0001).  P. chrysosporium showed best performance among the white rot fungi and produced the highest water soluble carbohydrate levels in unsterile conditions (5.38 \u00b1 0.36 g/g initial dry matter).  P. ostreatus exhibited reasonable lignin degradation with dry matter loss comparable to the un-inoculated control treatment.\nIn addition to biological pretreatment, hydrolysis can also be considered during storage.  To explore this option, Trichoderma reesei Rut C30 was tested in a sequenced aerobic and anaerobic system. T. reesei Rut C30 produces cellulases and xylanases, which are expected to convert polysaccharides of cellulose and hemicellulose, respectively, to simpler sugars.  However, inoculation with the organism failed to produce any additional sugars. In fact, the xylose content of biomass pretreated with the T. reesei Rut C30 was lower than in the control samples.  Sterilization, once again, caused higher dry matter loss (24.21 \u00b1 2.52 %g/ g initial DM) compared to unsterile biomass (13.83 \u00b1 1.24 %g/ initial g initial DM).  Introducing an aerobic phase after ensilage increased the pH values (5.67 \u00b1 0.23) significantly (p < 0.0005) compared to sequencing the aerobic phase before ensilage (4.79 \u00b1 0.006), indicating loss of organic acids.  The optimal hydrolysis temperature is 50\u00b0C, while maximum enzyme production for T. reesei RutC30 occurs at 30\u00baC. Accordingly, a higher temperature, 50\u00b0C, was tested for 7 days after 7 days of incubation at 30\u00baC.  As expected, higher temperatures almost doubled the dry matter loss, but did not produce significantly higher water soluble carbohydrates (p > 0.1). Increasing the aerobic phase from 7 to 14 days doubled the dry matter loss and produced significantly higher carbohydrate contents (p < 0.01).\nThe final experiment attempted to combine the three unit operations, storage, pretreatment and hydrolysis into a single stage, two phase process.  P. ostreatus was chosen as white rot fungi for this test due to the low dry matter losses and reasonable lignin degradation levels produced by the organism.  As previously noted, T. reesei Rut C30 failed to perform in an experiment where in was the only inoculated organism. However, this could be due to the lack of lignin degrading organisms in that system.  For this study, two co-cultures: co-culture A (P. ostreatus with T. reesei Rut C30) and co-culture B (P. ostreatus with T. reesei wild type organism) were tested to identify the more robust hydrolytic fungi combinations.  Autoclaving was replaced with irradiation as sterilization technique to avoid the previously observed mild pretreatment affect in chapters 5 and 6.  As anticipated, the initial pH values were unaffected by irradiation.  Sterilization through irradiation resulted in the lowest dry matter loss in control samples, but the highest dry matter losses when inoculated with the co-culture (0.87 \u00b1 0.34, and 1.94 \u00b1 0.29 g/ g initial dry matter).  Increasing the number days increased the dry matter loss (p < 0.0001), while having a negative effect on sugar production. Both the co-cultures and the order of treatments had no affect on the fiber content of biomass.  Again, the sugar production with inoculated cultures was lower than the controls, indicating the inefficacy of the T. reesei species in this system.  A 3 X 3 factorial experiment was designed to study the effect of temperature, moisture and number of days of an aerobic phase.  The three variables were tested at three levels.  Temperature was tested at 30\u00baC, 50\u00baC, 70\u00baC, moisture was tested at 40%, 55%, 70%, and aerobic phase time period was tested at 7, 14, 21 days.  The ideal results, i.e., lowest pH values, lowest dry matter loss and highest sugar production occurred at 30\u00b0C, 40% moisture, and 7 days of aerobic phase.  Extending the aerobic phase to 14 days produced higher sugar concentration, but by 21 days, the sugar levels started to fall.  A statistical model was developed to describe dry matter loss along with lignin degradation (ADL) based on the results from the factorial experiment.\nThe set of experiments designed to develop a simple, low cost solid state fermentation system incorporating storage, pretreatment and hydrolysis answered several questions related to issues including the benefits of sterilization, order of treatment, length of aerobic phase, and temperature and moisture levels.  However, the tested organism for hydrolysis, T reesei, was not found to be effective in this system.  The designed system of sequenced aerobic and anaerobic phases did have several advantages, and can be developed with other naturally occurring or robust genetically modified organisms that can act competitively to produce the desired result.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1655], "author_name_tesi": "Tanjore, Deepti ", "last_name_ssi": "Tanjore", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Deepti", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Lehman Richard", "Thomas Lehman Richard", "Dr Patrick Cirino", "Ali Demirci", "John Michael Regan", "Ming Tien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Lehman Richard, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Lehman Richard, Committee Chair", "Dr Patrick Cirino, Committee Member", "Ali Demirci, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ensilage", "storage", "pretreatment", "biomass", "corn stover", "fermentation", "ethanol", "biofuel", "lignocellulosic biomass", "white rot fungi"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Side Channel Attack for Keystroke Logging\n", "id": "8366", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "301", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The problem of maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information in computer systems is typically addressed by mechanisms such as memory protection and access controls to resources.

Activation of AHR has been associated with toxicity through its binding to dioxin response element (DRE) sequences in its target genes (e.g. CYP1A1). Evolutionary conservation of the receptor and the phenotype of mice lacking the AHR suggest an endogenous role for the receptor beyond responding to xenobiotic exposure. Based on previous work in our lab showing the ability of the receptor to alter gene expression independent of DRE sequences, we set out to explore a possible involvement of the receptor in key cellular pathways. We performed a microarray analysis on liver isolated from ligand-treated transgenic mice expressing a wild-type Ahr or a DRE-binding mutant Ahr (A78D). The results revealed that AHR ligand treatment suppressed cholesterol synthesis but did not require DRE binding. In order to confirm this finding in humans, primary human hepatocytes were administered an AHR ligand and subsequent analysis of mRNA levels revealed a significant trend of repression in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis genes. Our lab has also established the ability of the ligand SGA360 to activate AHR without inducing DRE-mediated activity. Since toxicity associated with hyperactivation of the AHR is a DRE-mediated event and our microarray data revealed that DRE-binding is not essential for the regulation of our genes of interest, we tested the effect of SGA360 in primary human hepatocytes. Selective activation of the receptor showed a significant attenuation in the expression of our target genes and the ability of the receptor to inhibit the compensatory mechanism of statins on cholesterol synthesis gene expression. In addition, SGA360 exhibited a higher degree of repression of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis gene expression than the AHR agonist BNF. Mirroring our gene expression results, a significant repression of fatty acid and cholesterol secretion was observed in human cells. In an effort to elucidate the mechanism of this regulation by AHR, we investigated the activity of AHR on the sterol element binding proteins (SREBPs), the key regulators of both pathways. Our results indicated the targeted proteosomal degradation of the cleaved active form of those transcription factors when AHR is activated causing the attenuation of their transcriptional signaling. The discovery of AHR as a regulator of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways independently of its DRE-binding and the ability to selectively activate the receptor for this purpose suggests that AHR may be a previously unrecognized therapeutic target.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7711], "author_name_tesi": "Tanos , Rachel  ", "last_name_ssi": "Tanos ", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary H Perdew", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Richard John Frisque", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Joshua D Lambert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary H Perdew, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ah receptor", "AHR", "cholesterol", "Fatty acid", "lipid", "SREBP"]}, {"year_isi": 1999, "title_ssi": "Managers/Non-Managers\u2019 Perceived Importance and Implementation of Skills and Information Workplace Practices at IBM Thailand\n\n", "id": "5804", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1668", "defended_at_dtsi": "1999-10-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research investigated the perceptions of IBM Thailand managers and non-managers regarding the importance and implementation levels of the high-performance workplace practices as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor (1994).

Small-amplitude random moisture perturbations are introduced in the lower troposphere as the initial-condition uncertainties to generate the ensembles under different environmental conditions. Both the composites and members of ensemble sets are analyzed in this study to examine the mean dynamics of sheared TCs as well as the predictability of tropical cyclone rapid intensification onset. \nFrom the ensemble-mean aspect, it is found that the environmental shear can significantly affect the timing of tropical cyclone formation by influencing the spatial distribution of convection and subsequently changing the positive feedback between diabatic heating and the TC vortex primary circulation. Except for the initial spin-up periods, the larger the vertical wind shear, the farther and weaker the convection from the TC center, which leads to a weakening TC vortex circulation and more time is needed to start the onset of rapid intensification (RI). The simulated tropical cyclones cannot start rapid intensification during a 9-day simulation if the shear between 200 hPa and 850 hPa approaches 7.5 m  or higher for a constant SST of 27 \u00b0C. Increasing SST to 29 \u00b0C reduces the tilt magnitude and thus shortens the RI onset time because of faster generation of diabatic heating at the very beginning which strengthens vortex column to resist shear effect. Reduction in the environmental moisture content will eventually lead to weakened convection and delayed or failed precession in the later stages if the TC forms at all. In summary, the development of tropical cyclones is largely depending on the magnitude of vertical wind shear and diabatic heating, which can be further altered by other environmental conditions, such as the sea-surface temperature and ambient moisture content.\nFrom the ensemble aspect, it is found that the intrinsic predictability of the RI onset time is getting worse with increasing shear magnitude until the shear magnitude is large enough to prevent the TC formation. Based on ensemble sensitivity and correlation analysis, the RI onset timing within one set is largely related to the vortex tilt magnitude, the diabatic heating distribution and the strength of the vortex primary circulation. It appears that systematic differences amongst the ensemble members begin to arise right after the initial burst of moist convection associated with the incipient vortex. This difference from the randomness inherent in moist convection first changes the TC vortex structure subtly and then leads to the deviations in systematic scales and eventually in the development of the TC vortices. On average, a higher SST has a positive effect on the TC formation and reduces the uncertainty of development under all shear conditions, while a drier environment has a negative impact on the TCs development and either broadens the ensemble spread of RI onset time or prevents the storm from forming when the shear-induced tilt is large. It is also found that the shear modulation is quite significant that the effect of randomness of moist convection at the very beginning is overwritten by the difference in shear magnitudes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10673], "author_name_tesi": "Tao, Dandan ", "last_name_ssi": "Tao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dandan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fuqing Zhang", "Jenni Evans", "Yvette Pamela Richardson", "Zhibiao Zhao", "Richard Rotunno"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fuqing Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Jenni Evans, Committee Member", "Yvette Pamela Richardson, Committee Member", "Zhibiao Zhao, Committee Member", "Richard Rotunno, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vertical wind shear", "tropical cyclones", "predictability", "precession", "alignment", "rapid intensification"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Microtubule destabilizers control axon and dendrite disassembly after injury and during pruning  \n", "id": "23448", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10712", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract \n\tA neuron extends one axon and several dendrites far from its cell body, leaving these extremely thin processes subject to various insults, including physical damages, strokes, and neurodegenerative diseases during aging. Axon degeneration after injury, called Wallerian degeneration, was discovered in mice two decades ago, yet few molecular mechanisms that control the degeneration process have been identified. To study injury-induced and developmental degeneration, our lab used Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) neurons. These neurons are classified into 4 types based on their dendrite branch complexity.  I used the most simple ddaE classI and most complex ddaC classIV neurons in the experiments.  DdaC neurons go through dendrite remodeling during the pupae stage. This characteristic of ddaC neurons allows me to compare three types of degeneration, including injury-induced axon degeneration, injury-induced dendrite degeneration and developmental pruning, in the same cell type on a single cell level of a living animal. Our lab developed a laser-cutting assay to precisely sever the dendrites or the axons proximal to the soma in whole, live Drosophila larvae. I observed that both axons and dendrites are able to initiate a rapid intrinsic program to clear the severely damaged part in a short period of time. Interestingly, I found that these processes looked similar to developmental pruning, in which dendrites of ddaC neurons are severed near soma and then quickly degraded within 18 hours after pupae formation. Due to this morphological similarity, I first wanted to know whether these processes share common machineries. I tested known pathways that have been reported to be involved in dendrite pruning. However, I discovered that none of these pathways had an effect on injury-induced degeneration. I concluded that axons and dendrites each have their own disassembly machinery that is activated by damage and is distinct from the ones employed in dendrite pruning. \n\n\tI next wanted to investigate the intracellular mediators involved in each injury-induced degeneration. I have observed fragmentation of microtubules during axon and dendrite degeneration. Additionally, our lab has done extensive work on microtubule polarity research. I decided to focus on the regulation of microtubules during degeneration. As an important component of neuron cytoskeleton, microtubules play a crucial role in cargo transport and cell shape maintenance. The role of microtubules in neuronal degeneration remains mysterious. I performed a genetic screen of all the potential microtubule severing proteins and microtubule depolymerizing proteins, and I identified two proteins, klp59C and fidgetin, involved in neuron degeneration. Klp59C, a microtubule-depolymerizing protein, serves as a general microtubule regulator involved in all types of degeneration. In contrast, fidgetin, a microtubule severing protein, is specifically required in dendrite degeneration. I further confirmed the RNAi result by repeating the same cutting assay in mutant and deficiency flies. Additionally, I investigated the working mechanism of klp59C and fidgetin through an EB1 comet assay. I found that EB1 dynamics lasted longer in klp59C knockdown neurons while EB1 dynamics disappeared around the same time in controls and fidgetin RNAi neurons. I thus concluded that fidgetin severs the microtubule in the middle to generate short fragments and klp59C further depolymerizes the microtubule fragments from the plus ends. \n\tThrough a large-scale screen of potential pathways responsible for protein and organelle turnover during degeneration, I also discovered a new role of Rab GTPase. Rab5 or Rab11 GFP, which are usually used as an endocytosis marker, can serve as an energy monitor in live cells. I first observed that Rab5 GTP altered its punctate morphology to a diffused distribution 3.5h after axon severing. I also observed that all the other Rab GTPase family members, including Rab7, Rab8 and Rab11, share the same pattern after axon injury. Furthermore, I confirmed the observation that Rab protein changes its morphology after ATP depletion in Hela cell cultures. This is the first time that the function of Rab as an energy indicator has been observed. \n\tIn my work, I also examined whether the autophagy pathway and the endocytosis pathway are required for neuron degeneration. Down regulating the key proteins in both pathways through RNAi did not delay injury- induced axon or dendrite degeneration. However, I discovered that a decrease in the protein level of VPS4 and shrb (ESCRTIII in fly) significantly affects normal developmental pruning. This result provides additional evidence that developmental pruning and injury \u2013induced degeneration are distinct processes, which involve different machineries. \n\tMy work presented here demonstrated that microtubule regulators play important roles in degrading injured axons or dendrites. Klp59C plays a general role in all types of degeneration while fidgetin only acts in dendrite degeneration. Future work elucidating other pathways responsible for the degradation of other components of neurons will be crucial to dissect the comprehensive network of neuron disassembly after injury or in developmental settings. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10343], "author_name_tesi": "Tao, Juan ", "last_name_ssi": "Tao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Juan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Rolls", "Melissa Rolls", "Lorraine C Santy", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Richard W Ordway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Rolls, Dissertation Advisor", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Chair", "Lorraine C Santy, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Drosophila axon dendrite degeneration"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The differential pro-oxidant effects of the tea (Camellia Sinensis) catechin, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), in the context of oral cancer", "id": "25070", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10988", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the United States, an estimated 45,780 new cases and 8,650 deaths from cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (throat) are expected in 2015. Dietary intervention is one potential strategy to reduce cancer burden. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant polyphenol in green tea. Although widely considered as an antioxidant, recently a growing number of evidence shows that EGCG may exert pro-oxidant effects. EGCG has been found to undergo auto-oxidation upon the exposure to oxygen and transition metals to form reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the role of EGCG-induced ROS and the differential effects of EGCG-induced ROS in cancer versus normal cells are poorly understood. Therefore, this thesis aims to provide insight into EGCG\u2019s pro-oxidant activities, with a focus on the potential differential effects in oral cancer and normal cells.\n\nTo explore the question, I treated the oral cancer cells with EGCG and detected intracellular ROS. First, I found that in oral cancer cells EGCG initially caused ROS formation localized in mitochondria, which resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction including the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the opening of the mitochondrial membrane transition pore. The accumulated mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction led to a systemic ROS burst and ultimately cell death. Interestingly, EGCG did not induce significant cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis in normal cells. In contrast to the ROS burst in oral cancer cells, no significant increase of ROS was observed in normal cells as well. PCR array analysis showed that EGCG down-regulated several antioxidant related genes in cancer cells (superoxide dismutase 2/3 and thioredoxin reductase 2), but up-regulated them in normal cells. The data suggest that EGCG exerts differential pro-oxidant effects in oral cancer and normal cells, in part through modulating antioxidant signaling.\n\nIn order to better understand the differential effects of EGCG, I examined the impact of EGCG on sirtuin3 (SIRT3). SIRT3 is a deacetylase localized in mitochondria that regulates the redox balance in that organelle. I found that EGCG suppressed the gene and protein expression as well as the activity of SIRT3 in cancer cells. By contrast, EGCG activated SIRT3 in normal cells, however, no significant changes in the mRNA and protein level of SIRT3 were observed. Further, I observed that estrogen-related receptor \u03b1 (ERR\u03b1), a transcriptional factor of SIRT3, was selectively down-regulated by EGCG in cancer cells, indicating that EGCG may differentially modulate the mRNA expression of SIRT3 through ERR\u03b1. EGCG also differentially modulated the mRNA levels of SIRT3-associated downstream genes including glutathione peroxidase 1 and superoxide dismutase 2 in normal and oral cancer cells.\n\nTo determine the necessity of SIRT3 for EGCG\u2019s differential pro-oxidant effects, I knocked down SIRT3 through siRNA technology. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knock-down of SIRT3 in cancer cells (SCC-25) resulted in decreased ROS, rendering a cell resistance to EGCG-induced growth inhibition. Accordingly, the mRNA levels of MT1G, MT1X and metal regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF1), a transcriptional factor of MTs were significantly increased. MTs belong to a group of cysteine-rich, low molecular weight proteins. They are localized in cytoplasm and function as antioxidant through oxidation of thiol groups. Therefore, the up-regulated MTs and MTF1 expressions in si-SIRT3 cells suggest that MT may be an alternative modulator of intracellular antioxidant signaling. Further, I found EGCG down-regulated most MT isoforms in oral cancer cells, while up-regulating several MTs in normal cells, particularly MT1G (+20,900%) and MT1X (+350%). On the other hand, knocking down MTF1 in SCC-25 cells significantly decreased mRNA expression of MTs, SIRT3, NFE2L1 and NFE2L2. This indicates a crosstalk between SIRT3 and MT signaling that may be mediated by MTF1. Furthermore, EGCG decreased the transcriptional activity of MTF1 in cancer cells but slightly increased the activity in normal cells.\n\nIn conclusion, EGCG induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in oral cancer cells, but triggered antioxidant responses in normal cells. SIRT3 and MT appear to be molecular mediators of EGCG-induced differential pro-oxidant effects in oral cells. Moreover, a potential crosstalk between SIRT3 and MT signaling was identified and may be mediated by MTF1. Taken together, the current study provides novel mechanisms under which EGCG exerts differential pro-oxidant effects in oral cancer versus normal cells. The mechanistic study will provide helpful information for future work with oral cancer animal model.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10568], "author_name_tesi": "Tao, Ling ", "last_name_ssi": "Tao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ling", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert", "Gregory Ray Ziegler", "Ryan John Elias", "Karam E El Bayoumy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert, Dissertation Advisor", "Gregory Ray Ziegler, Committee Member", "Ryan John Elias, Committee Member", "Karam E El Bayoumy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)", "Oral cancer", "Pro-oxidant effects", "Sirtuin3", "Metallothionein", "Tea"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONAL DATA BASED INFERENCE FOR HIGH FREQUENCY FINANCIAL DATA", "id": "13392but129", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13392", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis is concerned with developing new functional data techniques for high frequency financial applications.

It studies the works of Eduardo Mendoza (La ciudad de los prodigios, 1986), Juan Mars\u00e9 (El amante biling\u00fce, 1990), Enrique Vila-Matas (El viaje vertical, 1997), Nuria Amat (La intimidad, 1997 y El pa\u00eds del alma, 1999), and Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n (El hombre de mi vida, 2000).\n\nThe first chapter is dedicated to La ciudad de los prodigios, a postmodernist parody of the symbolic and discursive constructs of bourgeois Catalanism, and the first novel in a group of works that approach nationalism from different angles. This study demonstrates that Mendoza\u2019s apparent ideological relativism does not prevent him from passing judgment on the Catalan bourgeoisie of the turn-of-the-century period, a criticism that implies an indirect attack on the Catalan ruling class and its use of nationalist discourse during the years that followed the Spanish democratic transition of the late nineteen seventies.\n\nMars\u00e9\u2019s work continues this critical trend at the end of the nineteen eighties and reflects the complex reality of Catalonia during a time in which the regional Administration was striving to implement the so-called process of normalization of the Catalan language and culture. The novel implies that this was often done at the expense of the immigrant population from poorer parts of Spain, who suffered the negative consequences of the normalization effort. This  \nanalysis offers a new interpretation of the novel that focuses on the author\u2019s metaliterary concerns and puts this work in the context of a narrative production that pays increasing attention to ethical and hermeneutical problems.\n\nThe novels of Enrique Vila-Matas, Nuria-Amat, and Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n, which were written a decade later, confirm a clear evolution in the treatment of nationalist themes. They represent a variety of narrative perspectives that range from ironic ambiguity to a nuanced apology of the Catalan bourgeoisie during the postwar period. It is argued here that the appearance of this new trend in the fiction of three authors of different age, ideology, and social origin must be explained in the context of a society were traditional nationalist values enjoy a greater degree of prestige and consensus among Catalans than they did a decade earlier. The recurrent presence and the change in the perception of nationalist discourse in the Spanish novel during the last two decades are proof of the central role that this subject has in the current social, political, and intellectual debate in Spain and Catalonia.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4518], "author_name_tesi": "Tapia Fern\u00e1ndez, Mar\u00eda Rosa ", "last_name_ssi": "Tapia Fern\u00e1ndez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mar\u00eda Rosa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Javier Escudero", "Anibal Gonzalez Perez", "Mary Elizabeth Barnard", "Ralph Rodriguez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Javier Escudero, Committee Chair", "Anibal Gonzalez Perez, Committee Member", "Mary Elizabeth Barnard, Committee Member", "Ralph Rodriguez, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spain", "Spanish literature", "Catalan nationalism", "20th Century", "Novel", "Catalonia"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "An Initial Investigation Into The Subcellular Localization Of Lipid-regulated Atypical Protein Kinase C Zeta", "id": "11902", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5670", "abstract_tesi": "The PKC family of serine/threonine lipid regulated kinases consists of 12 isotypes divided into 3 classes; classical, novel, and atypical.  The differences between the classes are dependent on structure and regulation by cofactor requirements, ligand activation, substrate specificity, expression, and subcellular localization.  Within the atypical family of PKCs is PKC\u03b6 which is DAG and calcium independent.  PKC\u03b6 has been shown to be activated by the sphingolipid molecule ceramide.  The activation of PKC\u03b6 causes the initiation of the SAPK cascade and the inhibition of AKT resulting in senescence or death of the cell.\nPKC\u03b6 is mostly located within the cytoplasm of the cell but can translocate to the cell membrane and the nucleus.  At the cell membrane PKC\u03b6 accumulates in ceramide rich microdomains allow for its activation and phosphorylation activity. PKC\u03b6 can translocate to the cell nucleus as result of PI3 lipids in the nucleus and has been shown to phosphorylate nucleolin. PKC\u03b6 is imported and exported out of the nucleus with the help of importin and exportin proteins.  The export of PKC\u03b6 is a CRM1 regulated system, while the import may be a \u03b2 importin system similar to that of atypical PKC\u03b9.  A specific sequence within a protein is needed for the binding of importins and exportins known as NLS and NES.  The NLS of PKC\u03b6 is located at the end of the C1 domain and the NES at the beginning of the catalytic domain.\nThrough the cloning of PKC\u03b6 constructs into expression vectors and then transfecting the vectors into cells, we initially investigated the subcellular localization of the protein within the cell.  By using confocal microscopy and western blotting, we documented Leptomyacin B, an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear protein export, restricted PKC\u03b6 to the nucleus.  We then documented a direct interaction of PKC\u03b6 and CRM1 utilizing an in vitro binding assays that included purified PKC\u03b6, CRM1, and a mutant Ran-GTP with and without ceramide.  \nOur initial results confirm previous findings that PKC\u03b6 utilizes a CRM1-dependent export system.  Further optimization to the protocols will be necessary to obtain more information on PKC\u03b6 nuclear translocation.  There are also other factors that need to be taken into consideration such as the possibility of PKC\u03b6 being regulated by other lipids besides ceramide.  By continuing to research the areas of PKC\u03b6 subcellular location and nuclear translocation, we hope to better understand the physiological and pathophysiological regulation of nuclear protein kinases by lipid-derived second messengers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5666], "author_name_tesi": "Tappen, Shannon L", "last_name_ssi": "Tappen", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Shannon", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Kester"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Kester, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ceramide", "PKCz"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Visualization Development Process for a Military Setting", "id": "19821", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9118", "abstract_tesi": "Information visualization allows users to interpret large quantities of data in order to efficiently make decisions.

It shows that inequality may be good for the poor via a trickle-down effect operating through entry. I consider a general equilibrium model of monopolistic competition with free entry, heterogenous firms and consumers that share identical but non-homothetic preferences. The general model is formulated. The case of two types of consumers, which are different in terms of efficiency units of labor they are endowed with, is considered in detail. I show that higher income inequality in the economy can benefit the poor. An increase in personal income of the rich raises welfare of the poor, while an increase in the fraction of the rich has an ambiguous impact on the poor: welfare of the poor has an inverted U shape as a function of the fraction of the rich. In addition, an increase in the personal income of the rich together with a decrease in the fraction of the rich, keeping the aggregate income in the economy fixed, raises the well-being of the poor. I also analyze the effect of changes in market size and entry cost. I show that the rich gain more from an increase in market size and lose more from an increase in the cost of entry than the poor.\n\nCHAPTER 2: Globalization: Intensive versus Extensive Margins\n\nThere is empirical evidence that globalization leads to higher income inequality within a country. However, in the economic literature not much attention is paid to the fact that globalization may influence inequality through the consumption channel. In particular, if different groups of consumers consume different sets of goods and in different amounts, then globalization can change consumption patterns and increase or decrease welfare inequality among the groups. In this essay, I look at two margins of globalization, namely trade liberalization (the intensive margin) and a rise in the number of trading partners (the extensive margin), and explore their impact on the economic well-being of different population groups through the consumption channel. I extend the model formulated in Chapter 1 to a world with many symmetric countries. I show that the impact of globalization on the relative welfare of the rich with respect to the poor depends on the margin of globalization considered. In particular, the relative welfare of the rich is first increasing and then decreasing as transportation costs fall. As for a rise in the number of trading partners, the rich always gain more than the poor. Moreover, in some cases the rich can even be worse off from trade liberalization, while welfare of the poor and aggregate welfare both increase.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3: Per Capita Income, Market Access Costs, and Trade Volumes\n\nIn this essay, I document and analyze several phenomena of trade data. First, countries with higher per capita income tend to have greater trade volumes even after controlling for total income. Second, many country pairs in the world do not trade with each other in one or both directions. Finally, there are substantial costs of access to foreign markets. I construct and estimate a general equilibrium model of trade in an asymmetric world with many countries that squares the above data features. There are two novelties in the essay. First, in my model I introduce a relationship between the costs of access to foreign markets and exporter development level. I show that this relationship can account for the effect of per capita income on trade volumes and explain the many zeros in bilateral trade data. Second, I develop an estimation procedure, which allows me to identify separate effects of variable and fixed costs of trade on trade volumes. The model performs well in fitting the data. The trade elasticities with respect to aggregate and per capita incomes predicted by the model are close to those in the data. I find that the aggregate spending on access to foreign markets constitutes on average around the half of the total export profits.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [142], "author_name_tesi": "Tarasov, Alexander ", "last_name_ssi": "Tarasov", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alexander", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kala Krishna", "Kala Krishna", "John Raymond Moran Jr.", "Prof Andres Rodriguez Clare", "James R.

Recent times have witnessed an increasing use of certification programs that seek to evaluate the reliability and compatibility of platform-based products. While various studies have focused on the phenomenon of certification, the evolution and diffusion of platforms, and the influence of certification and platforms on industry structure per se; to date little is known about platform certification programs and their implications for firms that supply platform-based products. \n\nTo address these gaps, this study examines platform certification by conceptualizing it as a market regulatory mechanism that is expected to influence the dynamics of the platform-based product market. In particular, the study investigates certification programs for mobile computing platforms and evaluates their implications for the mobile applications/software market. The study employs a multiple-case study design to explore three platform certification programs \u2013 Symbian Signed, Java Verified, and True BREW \u2013 and qualitatively assess their influences on the firms in the mobile applications market. The cases are analyzed using a conceptual framework that relates key attributes of platform certification systems, namely certification authority structure, imposed certification constraints, and perceived certification benefits, to their implications for vertical product compatibility and market entry barriers. \n\nThe study finds that platform certification systems can influence their platform-based product market through at least two mechanisms. First, the research suggests that the ways in which a certification program is managed (control structure), increases vertical product compatibility. Second, the degree to which certifications are a pre-requisite to market participation (coerciveness) and the level of accommodations made by the certification program to application developer needs (flexibility), influence the level of market entry barriers. \n\nThe study extends the literature on certification by providing a conceptual framework for understanding platform certifications and assessing their impact on market development, structure, and competition. In addition, the study contributes to practice by highlighting various technical and business barriers, issues, and recommendations for effective development, deployment, and distribution of mobile applications that can potentially assist software vendors in supplying innovative and cost-effective mobile applications.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [445], "author_name_tesi": "Tarnacha, Ankur ", "last_name_ssi": "Tarnacha", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ankur", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carleen Frances Maitland", "Steven B Sawyer", "Irene Johnston Petrick", "Thomas F Laporta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carleen Frances Maitland, Committee Chair", "Steven B Sawyer, Committee Member", "Irene Johnston Petrick, Committee Member", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Market Entry", "Vertical Compatibility", "Complementary Products", "Computing Platforms", "Software Certification", "Mobile Application Ecosystem"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ESTABLISHING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF APPLYING GRAY\u2019S SENTENCE RATIO AS A COMPONENT IN A 10-STEP SOCIAL STORIES INTERVENTION MODEL,\nTEACHING SOCIAL SKILLS TO STUDENTS WITH ASD\n\n\n", "id": "8956", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "818", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Literature on Social Stories refers to the method as a \u201cpopular trend\u201d in the instruction of students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and describes potential benefits but also cautions that there is little empirical evidence for their effectiveness. Reviews of the literature report variable effects, along with inconsistencies in Social Story structure, research design, and variation across participants and behaviors. In a recent study (Tarnai, Wolfe, & Rusch, under review), a 10-step approach to constructing and evaluating Social Stories for students with ASD was developed to guide procedural fidelity of Social Stories implementations.\nResearchers have called for further investigations to determine the components of Social Stories intervention packages that contribute to their efficacy. One claim of Gray, the originator of the method is that Social Stories describe rather than direct behavior, which differentiates them from a mere task analysis chain. To create a contextual-descriptive framework, Gray has introduced a ratio of sentence types to be used in a Social Story. The present study seeks to investigate if, as Gray maintained, her recommended sentence ratio is an essential component of Social Stories in an instructional situation (remote from actual skill practice) for which they were designed. For this purpose, a 10-Step Social Stories intervention model using Gray\u2019s sentence ratio (i.e., a \u2018contextual\u2019 Social Story), and a similarly composed method omitting Gray\u2019s sentence ratio (i.e., a \u2018directive\u2019 Social Story), was compared in teaching social skills to students with ASD. Dependent measures evaluated teaching efficiency by student outcome indicators such as percentage of criterion attained (pre-defined task analysis steps); and number of necessary trials to criterion. Contextual Social Stories consistently yielded fewer trials to criterion and maintained stable performance at criterion.\nResults suggest the relative importance of applying Gray\u2019s sentence ratio as a component in a Social Stories intervention package. This finding is consistent with implications from other special education research studies that suggest that descriptive social-contextual information be added to instruction, beyond purely teaching the performance of a target task.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [811], "author_name_tesi": "Tarnai, Balazs ", "last_name_ssi": "Tarnai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Balazs", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Special Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pamela S Wolfe", "Pamela S Wolfe", "Frank R Rusch", "David Lee", "Kathryn D R Drager"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pamela S Wolfe, Dissertation Advisor", "Pamela S Wolfe, Committee Chair", "Frank R Rusch, Committee Member", "David Lee, Committee Member", "Kathryn D R Drager, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sentence ratio", "autism", "ASD", "social skills", "Social Stories"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Improving the Image Quality of Time-of-flight Secondary Ion Mass spectrometry Images", "id": "27090", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11860", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As the boundaries of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) are pushed to chemically image biological systems with even greater spatial resolution, an inherent lack of information to analyze becomes more pronounced.

The combined influence of stress-enhanced dissolution, thermal-hydro-mechanical asperity strain, and mineral reaction alter the permeability of fractures during thermal, hydraulic, and chemical stimulation. Chapter II examines a prototypical enhanced geothermal system (EGS) for the relative, temporal arrival of hydro-mechanical vs. thermo-mechanical vs. chemical changes in fluid transmission as cold water is injected at geochemical disequilibrium within a heated reservoir. Chapter III develops a relationship to examine dissolution precipitation creep in crustal rocks with implicit coupling of the dissolution-diffusion-precipitation system. Long-term compaction, previously ill-constrained, is explored with two alternate methods. Chapter IV presents a model to represent these permeability change mechanisms as innately hysteretic and interlinked processes in rough contacting fractures.

The major transmembrane proteins of the TJ are occludin (bicellular-TJ) and tricellulin (tricellular-TJ), which regulate TJ barrier properties, and the claudins, which form the TJ barrier.  These proteins are anchored to the actin cytoskeleton through the membrane peripheral scaffolding protein, ZO1.  Specifically, the coiled-coil domain of occludin (occCC) located at the distal end of their intracellular C-terminal tail, interacts with the SH3-GuK domains of ZO1.  \nThe role of the occludin-ZO1 interaction in the regulation of TJ barrier properties has been studied extensively.  Loss of this interaction correlates with reduced barrier properties of the TJ.  Studies have supported a role for multi-site phosphorylation of occludin in regulating complex formation.  It has been shown that phosphorylation on Ser490, within occCC, is involved in regulation of tight junction barrier properties by controlling binding to ZO1, occludin ubiquitination, and trafficking into early endosomes.  However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the occludin-ZO1 interaction are unknown, and how Ser490 phosphorylation regulates TJ properties is obscure.  A second site, Ser471, located in the negatively charged head of occCC, was also found to be phosphorylated in vivo, but its role is also unclear.   The related, but distinct, tricellulin-ZO1 interaction is less well characterized and its phosphorylation state unclear.\nThe hypothesis of this thesis is that phosphorylation of specific sites on occCC regulates its interaction with ZO1, thereby potentially regulating bicellular TJ complex formation and by extension, the equivalent region in tricellulin and tricellular TJs.  To test this, experiments were designed to structurally characterize the interactions between the coiled-coil domains of either occludin or tricellulin, respectively, with the PDZ3-SH3-GuK (PSG) domains of ZO1.  \n\nA range of biophysical techniques were used to characterize the PSG domains of ZO1 and occCC individually and in a complex, including  circular dichroism (CD), hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectroscopy (HDEX) , multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  The functional state of the protein was assessed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift perturbation assays.  These studies revealed that binding of occCC to the GuK domain of ZO1 altered the structure of its PDZ3 domain, suggesting a mode of communication between the various protein binding sites within ZO1.\nTo gain an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the occludin-ZO1 protein complex and the location of Ser490 and Ser471 in this complex, various biophysical tools were used to characterize structurally occCC in a complex with the PSG domains of ZO1.  Initially, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to directly visualize protein complex formation in solution.  These data revealed that occCC binds to the GuK domain of ZO1.  However, due to the pseudo-symmetrical shape of the occCC molecule, it was unclear which of the two potential regions on occCC mediated the interaction.  To resolve this ambiguity, NMR experiments were utilized to identify which residues in occCC are at, or near, ZO1 in the protein complex:  Residues in the negatively charged head of occCC are adjacent to the ZO1 GuK domain in the complex.  Ser490 is ~35 \u00c5 from the interface and unlikely to directly affect complex formation, whereas Ser471, in the negatively charged head of occCC, is uniquely positioned at the interface between occludin and ZO1.  Together, this led to a model in which phosphorylation of Ser471 would strengthen complex formation, facilitated by ionic interactions between oppositely charged regions in each protein.  \nTo determine whether the distal C-terminal tail of tricellulin folds into a coiled-coil similar to occCC, and if so, whether it interacts with the PSG domain of ZO1 in a similar manner to occCC, CD, SEC-MALLS, NMR and SAXS were used.   This region of tricellulin does adopt a coiled-coil structure (tricCC) similar to occCC, consistent with the high level of primary sequence similarity between the two.  However, SAXS and NMR studies with tricCC and ZO1 PSG demonstrated that these proteins do not interact under the conditions tested.  Although Ser471 is conserved in tricCC, the surface charge distribution of the head of tricCC is less negatively charged than the analogous region in occCC consistent with its inability to interact with ZO1 PSG under the conditions tested.\nTogether, the data presented in this thesis identifies which residues in occCC interact with the scaffolding protein ZO1 and implicates Ser471 in complex formation. Further, although tricCC has a similar tertiary structure and a serine at the equivalent position of residue 471 in occludin, the charge distribution is sufficiently different that an analogous complex between tricCC and ZO1 is not formed. This leads to a model in which the negatively charged residues within the head of occCC are critical to mediate its interaction with ZO1.  This charge density would be further strengthened by phosphorylation of Ser471.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [775], "author_name_tesi": "Tash, Brian Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Tash", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Flanagan Jr.", "John Michael Flanagan Jr.", "David Antonetti", "Ira Joseph Ropson", "Thomas E Spratt", "Anthony Edward Pegg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Flanagan Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "John Michael Flanagan Jr., Committee Chair", "David Antonetti, Committee Member", "Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member", "Anthony Edward Pegg, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ZO-1", "tight junctions", "occludin"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Design of a Computer Controlled Sun-tracking Fa\u00e7ade Model", "id": "21370", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7357", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes the development of a computer controlled sun-tracking device model that aims at improving the environmental performance (daylighting, shading, energy harvesting) of a building fa\u00e7ade system.

In this study, three EFL teachers in a private language school in the Czech Republic participated in the fourteen-week project. The data consisted of transcripts of teacher and administrator interviews, teacher workshops, teacher journal entries, meetings with the school\u2019s administrators, and the research lesson plan created by the teachers. The data were analyzed using a grounded content analysis (Bogdan and Bilken, 2007; Glaser and Strauss, 1967), and according to the principles of ethnographic semantics. The findings indicate that 1) school administrator involvement is necessary to effect school change; 2) outside experts might need to take a more active, longer-term role to help teachers adopt a critical perspective; 3) EFL teacher professionalization should include participation in professional development activities; 4) Lesson Study is a viable \u2018second stimulus\u2019 (Vygotsky & Luria, 1994) in DWR methodology that has the potential to provide teachers with an effective conceptual tool to mediate their learning and bring about expansive transformation; and 5) sociocultural theory provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how teachers learn through participation in Lesson Study.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9771], "author_name_tesi": "Tasker, Thomas Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Tasker", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen E Johnson", "Karen E Johnson", "Robert William Schrauf", "James F Nolan Jr.", "Meredith Christine Doran", "Steve L Thorne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen E Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen E Johnson, Committee Chair", "Robert William Schrauf, Committee Member", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "Meredith Christine Doran, Committee Member", "Steve L Thorne, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lesson study", "EFL", "professional development", "activity theory", "developmental work research", "teacher cognition"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Contaminant mobilization by reactions between Marcellus Shale and organic additive in synthetic hydraulic fracturing fluids", "id": "26377", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11298", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hydraulic fracturing of unconventional fossil fuel reserves poses complex environmental problems. Well permits for extracting natural gas from Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, US have been steadily increasing since 2007. To extract the gas, up to 5 million gallons of fluid, composed of acid, inorganics, organics, and salt, is pumped into the shale formation at high pressure. Approximately 10-30% of this fluid returns to the surface along with inorganic, organic, and radioactive contaminants from the geologic formation and initial fluid additives. A mechanistic understanding of the relationship between injected fracture fluids and flowback contaminant origination within the shale formation will be a challenge to attain. However, such knowledge could help redesign fracturing fluids and promote methods for pollution prevention. Highly organic fracturing fluids could promote metal dissolution from shale through partitioning of organically bound shale metals or complexation reactions. In this study we reacted two synthetic fracturing fluids (SFFs), fluids with high and low organic content based on chemicals used in drilling logs posted on fracfocus.org, with Marcellus Shale outcrop from Frankstown, Pennsylvania. The Marcellus Shale samples were pulverized, sieved, and then reacted with the SFFs for up to 36 h in a high pressure (85 bar), elevated temperature (80oC), stirred-tank reaction cell. The reacted fluids were analyzed for a suite of analytes including: total organic carbon, chemical oxygen demand, organic speciation by GC, gross alpha and beta radioactivity, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, and metals. \n\tThe outcrop used for studying fluid-shale interactions was highly weathered and resulted in dissolved metal and radioactivity concentrations significantly lower than unconventional flowback waters. Common halite salts in flowback fluids were not detected in the shale sample. Additionally, the concentrations and ratios of gross beta to gross alpha radioactivity in solutions reacted with the outcrop sample were different than flowback fluids, suggesting that radioactivity and halite evaporites are associated with water soluble fractions of the shale that were leached during weathering. The metals present were preferentially bound to specific phases in the Marcellus Shale, affecting their ability to be mobilized by various fluid chemistries. Iron, aluminum, strontium, and barium were mostly associated with oxides and organic material that were only mobilized under low pH, oxidizing conditions. Calcium and magnesium were mostly associated with surface exchangeable positions and carbonates that were easily mobilized from the shale outcrop.  \n\tThe chromatographic characteristics of the synthetic fracturing fluids changed after reacting at high pressure and temperature and mobilized more metals from the shale depending on their fluid chemistries. Low pH synthetic fracturing fluids mobilized the most metals from the shale. The organic content of the fluids and high pressure conditions had little effect on metal dissolution. However, the organic composition did change significantly depending on the pH, shale, and pressure conditions. Reacting synthetic hydraulic fracturing fluids at high pressure and temperature resulted in a 40-80% loss of gelling additives, friction reducers, and 1-octanol and d-limonene in the surfactant additive, indicating that the functionality and abundance of additives in solution change in down-hole fracturing environments. Longer chain surfactants, such as ethoxylated alcohols, were not affected by high pressure and temperature. A considerable portion of the organic additives were also taken up by the shale, influencing their effective fracturing concentrations and mobility in flowback fluids. Changes in pH also affected organic fate, with highest additive losses occurring at a pH of 3.5 in the presence of shale. These results suggest that characterizing transformation byproducts and organic partitioning of the additives used in hydraulic fracturing fluids could be useful in optimizing these fluids, identifying additives with high mobility in the environment, and determining potential toxic byproducts. Additionally, similar work involving high pressure and temperature experiments with Marcellus Shale samples could be important in understanding the geochemistry of shale and factors affecting metal dissolution.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10838], "author_name_tesi": "Tasker, Travis Lindsay", "last_name_ssi": "Tasker", "middle_name_ssi": "Lindsay", "first_name_ssi": "Travis", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William D Burgos"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William D Burgos, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydraulic fracturing", "Marcellus Shale", "fracturing fluids"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Bad to the bone: Empirically defining and measuring negative leadership", "id": "9937", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "841", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research on negative leadership has grown in popularity in recent years.

In the early 20th century, the semi-pictographic figures of Chinese ideographs and their synthetic forms of composition attracted the attention of more than a few Modernist poets and writers.  This study concerns three Modernist writers, two Anglo-American and one Japanese, Ernest Fenollosa (1853-1908), Ezra Pound (1885-1972), and Yokomitsu Riichi (1898-1947), and argues that their ideogrammic theories of composition transformed Modernist conceptions of textual space.  In particular, this research examines their tropes of textual organicism, which I define as a sense of textual entities as autonomous, equating an artwork to an organism and seeking the creation of holistic harmony and totality within the artwork itself.  The close alliance between the figures of a body and a text in these writers\u2019 works means that their theories of composition can be contextualized in both Eastern and Western literary traditions: the Japanese organic conception of language as buntai (literally, sentence + body) and the Western discourses of social and aesthetic organicism.  The transforming figures of textual organicism demonstrate a paradigmatic shift of spatio-temporal perception from Romanticism to Modernism, driven by Eastern and Western textual interactions. \n\nThree distinct metaphors represent these writers\u2019 arts of ideogrammic composition: Fenollosa\u2019s line system, Pound\u2019s machine organum, and Yokomitsu\u2019s view of the nationalist/capitalist mechanism as chimerical monstrosity.  These organicist metaphors exhibit an ingrained urge for totality and, therefore, inevitably locate the intersection of their aesthetic search for ideogrammic totality in relation to particular political discourses (such as Hegelian cosmopolitanism, Italian Fascism, and Japanese Nationalism).  While foregrounding the aesthetic and political tensions in the Modernists\u2019 efforts to reorganize textual, conceptual, and social space, this study highlights their aesthetic resistance: the ideogrammic pleasure in articulation; the potential for interactive communication via image, visual figuration, and bodies; and the synesthetic experience of wholeness in life.  Ultimately, I propose the Modernist ideogram as an emblem of these writers\u2019 compositions, reclaiming their own textual and physical presence against the fragmentation and the incomprehensibility of the modern period.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3588], "author_name_tesi": "Tateishi, Kahori ", "last_name_ssi": "Tateishi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kahori", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Reiko Tachibana", "Djelal Kadir", "Charlotte Diane Eubanks", "Robert Lawrence Caserio Jr.", "Shu Kuge"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Reiko Tachibana, Committee Chair", "Djelal Kadir, Committee Chair", "Charlotte Diane Eubanks, Committee Member", "Robert Lawrence Caserio Jr., Committee Member", "Shu Kuge, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ezra Pound", "Ernest Fenollosa", "Textual Space", "Modernism", "Ideogram", "Yokomitsu Riichi"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Exploring the Impact of Failures on Network Monitoring Techniques", "id": "22687", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9807", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, we investigate the impact of failures on network monitoring systems. Network monitoring either explicitly focuses on diagnosing the performance bottlenecks or on localizing the failures in the network. Depending on the objective of network monitoring and the characteristics of failures, different types of challenges and problems arise. We work on two main problems: diagnosis of large-scale failures and robust network tomography to diagnose bottlenecks. In both problems, a Network Operation Controller (NOC) requires end-to-end measurements or connectivity information from end nodes in the network; and failures may impede this process significantly. \n\nIn the first two chapters, I focus on the effects of failures on collection of end-to-end connectivity information at NOC while diagnosing large-scale failures. We propose inference algorithms that accomplish high accuracy in reasonable time compared to existing approaches that are developed for independent failures. In the first chapter, we propose a combinatorial algorithm called netCSI, and in the second chapter, we introduce a greedy approach called CMC, which performs better than netCSI in terms of runtime. We validate our algorithms with extensive simulations using realistic topologies and realistic failure models.  In the latter part of the thesis, I focus on the impact of independent failures on measurement collection in when using network tomography techniques. We model the robustness of paths in this setting by a metric called expected rank. We formulate an optimization problem to cover two complementary performance metrics: robustness and probing cost. We propose an efficient algorithm called RoMe (RObust MEasurements) with a guaranteed approximation ratio and polynomial time complexity.

In addition to targeting infected cells within the host, CD8+ T cells are capable of eradicating tumors.  CD8+ T cells respond to antigen by recognizing distinct peptide epitopes presented on the surface of infected cells or cells specialized for antigen presentation.  Often a CD8+ T cell response can be directed towards multiple epitopes.  During such a response, a phenomenon termed \u201cimmunodominance\u201d can occur in which a particular epitope is targeted by a larger frequency of CD8+ T cells compared to the other epitopes.  Immunodominance is observed in a variety of systems including bacterial, viral and transplantation antigens as well as tumor antigens.  Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the size and complexity of the CD8+ T cell response is important for developing CD8+ T cell-based immunotherapeutic approaches.  \n\tSV40 T antigen (Tag) is a virus-derived oncoprotein and tumor antigen that lends itself to the study of both immunodominance and tumor immunotherapy.  Expression of Tag as a transgene in mice promotes the development of tumors from specifically targeted tissues, providing a model of spontaneous cancer.  Four well-defined epitopes recognized by CD8+ T cells can be targeted in Tag, designated as sites I, II/III, IV and V.  Following immunization of C57BL/6 mice with Tag-expressing cells, a hierarchal CD8+ T cell response is induced in which epitope IV is dominant, and epitopes I and II/III are subdominant.  Using the SV40 Tag model of CD8+ T cell immunity, the following two questions were addressed in this study:\n1)\tWhat mechanisms regulate the size and complexity of the CD8+ T cell response to SV40 Tag?\n2)\tHow does targeting the dominant epitope of Tag lead to successful tumor immunotherapy?\n\nPrevious studies that described the immunodominance hierarchy of the Tag-specific CD8+ T cell response relied on data obtained at the peak of the response (day 10), leaving unknown how quickly immunodominance to Tag is established following immunization.  In the current study, we determined both the kinetics of immunodominance and mechanisms that regulate the complexity and magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response toward the two most dominant Tag epitopes, I and IV.  Both the endogenous T cells as well as T cell receptor transgenic T cells specific for epitopes I and IV were used for this analysis.  We found that dominance toward epitope IV is established by 3 days post-immunization and maintained throughout the response.  As indicated by experiments that quantitate the number of na\u00efve epitope-specific CD8+ T cells per mouse, this result may be explained by a higher number of na\u00efve precursors specific for epitope IV relative to epitope I.  By increasing the number of na\u00efve precursor T cells specific for epitope I the immunodominance hierarchy was reversed, indicating that the number of precursors present at the time of immunization dramatically influences the relative magnitude of the response.  The role of CD8+ T cell competition in determining the immunodominance hierarchy also was investigated, but was found to play only a minor role in limiting the ability of Tag-specific CD8+ T cells to accumulate to their maximum levels.  Lastly, we found that direct presentation of the Tag epitopes by Tag-expressing cells promotes optimal accumulation of Tag-specific CD8+ T cells compared to when only cross-presented Tag is available, suggesting that direct presentation by cell-based vaccines can enhance the overall efficiency of immunization.  \nIn a second focus, we examined whether CD8+ T cells targeting a single dominant epitope could lead to effective tumor immunotherapy of established Tag-induced brain tumors.  Line SV11 mice succumb to Tag-induced tumor burden at approximately 105 days of age.  Previous evidence suggested the importance of epitope IV-specific CD8+ T cells in the control of tumor progression in these mice.  Therefore, we examined whether epitope IV-specific CD8+ T cells were necessary and sufficient for the control of tumor progression in SV11 mice.  The adoptive transfer of a donor population devoid of epitope IV-specific CD8+ T cells demonstrated the need for epitope IV-specific CD8+ T cells in the control of tumors in SV11 mice.  Epitope IV-specific T cell receptor transgenic mice (TCR-IV) were used to determine whether epitope IV-specific CD8+ T cells alone could control tumor burden in SV11 mice.  Purified TCR-IV T cells were able to control tumor burden in combination with conditioning whole body irradiation, but were dramatically less effective in the absence of irradiation.  Although we observed no difference in the frequency of epitope IV-specific CD8+ T cells that accumulated in the brains of SV11 mice 10 days following adoptive transfer, epitope IV-specific CD8+ T cells were detected much earlier, by day 5, in the brains of SV11 mice that received irradiation than those receiving only adoptive transfer.  The combination of adoptive T cell transfer and conditioning irradiation resulted in the complete regression of established brain tumors by 10 days post adoptive transfer and was accompanied by long-term persistence of epitope IV-specific CD8+ T cells in the brain of SV11 mice.  Finally, using gene knockout donor lymphocytes, we found that interferon gamma (IFN&#947;), a cytokine with anti-tumor properties, was a necessary component of the donor cells to control tumor progression.  These studies indicate that epitope IV-specific CD8+ T cells are both necessary and sufficient to control tumor burden in SV11 mice, but require preconditioning of the host with irradiation to promote complete tumor regression.  The results suggest that both the magnitude of T cell infiltration at early time points and production of IFN&#947; are critical to achieve long-term tumor-free survival.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [296], "author_name_tesi": "Tatum, Angela Megin", "last_name_ssi": "Tatum", "middle_name_ssi": "Megin", "first_name_ssi": "Angela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Todd Schell", "Todd Schell", "Christopher Charles Norbury", "David Joseph Spector", "Kristin Ann Eckert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Todd Schell, Dissertation Advisor", "Todd Schell, Committee Chair", "Christopher Charles Norbury, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["SV40", "T antigen", "immunodominance", "CD8+ T cells", "tumor", "immunotherapy"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Testing and optimizaton of a miniature microwave ion thruster\n", "id": "14569", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7252", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ion thrusters are able to provide low thrust and high specific impulse, making them suitable for station keeping missions and interplanetary travel. One important feature of this type of space propulsion is the emission of charged particles away from the spacecraft, requiring the use of a neutralizer emitting electrons in order to ensure thrust.\n\nThis thesis presents the design and testing of a microwave miniature of ion thruster using an electron cyclotron resonance discharge. The propellant (argon or xenon) flows inside a discharge chamber at an operational mass flow rate of 0.15 sccm and is then ionized by the coupling between an oscillating electromagnetic field of frequency 5 GHz fed by a ring-type antenna and a permanent magnetic field created by two concentric magnets. Only 4 W of total absorbed power is required to obtain ionization of the plasma, and 0.4 W to sustain it. The plasma created then is accelerated through a pair of grids that have a given\npotential across them. Our device can operate either in an ion thruster mode, accelerating the argon or xenon atoms, or in an electron emission mode, accelerating only electrons. In the ion thruster mode the thruster is predicted to produce a thrust of 217 \u03bcN with a mass utilization efficiency of 46% and a total efficiency of 75% if the propellant used is argon. \n\nA numerical analysis of both the permanent magnetic fields and electromagnetic radiation inside the discharge chamber was also conducted. It was found that the thickness of the yoke plate to which the magnets are connected does not have any effect on the magnetic\nfield inside the chamber and that the the antenna had to be positioned 2 mm away from the magnets in order to provide the best permanent magnetic field-electromagnetic radiation coupling.
