Bone plates and cardiovascular stents are the biomedical devices that, in some cases, can be classified as temporary devices. Magnesium alloys are currently under investigation for these products due to their biocompatible mechanical properties. Among metals, pure magnesium (Mg) corrodes readily. Therefore, magnesium alloys are needed to alter the rate of corrosion to ensure a device would be present throughout tissue healing.\nThe primary goal of this thesis research was to test a three-electrode planar device that was developed for corrosion monitoring under in-vivo conditions. The device was produced using micro-electronic lithographic patterning. This device was designed to eventually be used to test candidate bioabsorbable magnesium-titanium (Mg-Ti) alloys produced via evaporation. Prior to in-vivo testing, devices were tested under in-vitro conditions (outside the body in a simulated environment). A corrosion resistant material (sputtered Ti) was used for initial testing, while sputtered platinum (Pt) was used for both the counter and quasi-reference electrodes. Through open circuit potential monitoring and corrosion rate determination, it was concluded that the device was able to provide reliable data. An average corrosion rate of 0.005 \u00b1 0.008 mm/year was found for the sputtered Ti. This value is comparable to those found in literature.\nA secondary goal of this thesis was to evaluate the corrosion rates of candidate Mg-Ti alloys for possible use as implant materials. The most promising of these will eventually be used in the three-electrode device in the future. The candidate alloys were produced via physical vapor evaporation. Alloys with varying amount of Ti were investigated using electrochemical corrosion techniques. A Mg-Ti composition of 2 wt.% Ti would be the most ideal for these biomedical applications. A corrosion rate of 3.38 mm/year was determined and would allow for significant healing time.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8202], "author_name_tesi": "Hartsock, Anna ", "last_name_ssi": "Hartsock", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Shaw", "Mark William Horn", "Elzbieta Sikora"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Shaw, Thesis Advisor", "Mark William Horn, Thesis Advisor", "Elzbieta Sikora, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Corrosion monitoring", "magnesium", "titanium", "in vitro"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Exploring Novice Teachers' Perceptions of Data-driven Decision Making: A Case Study\n", "id": "22039", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10137", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "  With the passing of No Child Left Behind (2001), data from statewide tests are now being used to shape curriculum, evaluate teacher effectiveness, and determine the success of individual schools.  Consequently, data analysis and data-driven decision making have become common terms in the educational world.   Teachers are now required to utilize the data to drive their instructional practice to best meet the needs of individual students.  However, little research has explored the factors that influence novice teachers\u2019 data-driven decision making.\n   This qualitative study explored novice teachers\u2019 perceptions regarding data-driven decision making through an in-depth case study of four novice teachers, each teaching in a different elementary school, in a rural Pennsylvania district.  Specifically, this study examined how factors, such as training and social influences, impacted novices\u2019 data use.  \n   Data collection occurred over a six-month period and included in-depth conversations with novice teachers and the district\u2019s Director of Elementary Education. Additionally, relevant documents were collected and analyzed.  Extensive data analysis was accomplished through thematic coding based upon the research questions and Ajzen\u2019s theory of planned behavior (1991).  The research resulted in a rich description of the factors that novice teachers perceived to have influenced their data-driven decision making.  \n   Four broad conclusions can be drawn from this study.  First, training is imperative for data use. The novices\u2019 lack of pre-service and in-service professional development regarding assessments and data use negatively impacted their decision to engage in data-driven decision making.  Second, novices perceived incongruity between the assessment data and their instruction.  Thus, the teachers in this study perceived the assessment data as invalid; consequently, they relied heavily on their personal observations rather than the data when making instructional decisions.  Third, the underlying culture of the schools significantly impacted novice teachers\u2019 perceptions regarding data-driven decision making.  While on the surface it appeared that the novices experienced pressure from the district administration and the state to use data, in reality the beliefs and values exemplified by their colleagues deterred them from whole-heartedly embracing data use.  Fourth, principal leadership is crucial for meaningful data use.  The principal leadership in this study\u2019s schools influenced the teachers\u2019 beliefs regarding data and how the data were used.

This concern, coupled with fossil fuel resources becoming increasingly scarce, has caused a push for alternative fuel research.   \n\nThis work focuses on converting a renewable feedstock, corn stover, to produce a useful gaseous fuel.  Corn stover is the portion of the corn plant that is left over after the corn has been harvested from the stalk.  Corn stover was selected for this study due to its relatively low ash content, which in turn allows for removal of catalytic inorganic content that would interfere with the investigation of potassium\u2019s effects on conversion.  The conversion process carried out in this study is pyrolysis, which is the thermal decomposition of organic matter in an oxygen-free environment.  Different pyrolysis conditions determine whether bio-oil or biogas will be a major byproduct.  This study\u2019s pyrolysis conditions are designed to maximize the biogas fraction, and more specifically, to produce a high quality syngas consisting of mainly H2 and CO.  Syngas can be efficiently burned in a small gas turbine to generate electricity, or utilized in a Fischer-Tropsch process to produce liquid fuel.  \n\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the effects of potassium between conventional and microwave pyrolysis.  This objective was met by carrying out laboratory scale pyrolysis experiments in both an electrical tube furnace, and a multimode microwave operating at 2.45 GHz.  Three different corn stover samples were investigated: stripped (S), stripped with 0.7 percent potassium addition (K0.7), stripped with 3.5 percent potassium addition (K3.5).  All feedstocks were brought to 700 \u00b0C in the conventional pyrolysis experiments.  All feedstocks were brought to both 700 and 1000 \u00b0C in the microwave experiments in order to get a qualitative trend on the influence of microwave pyrolysis temperature.  To get a quantitative understanding of potassium\u2019s response to microwave pyrolysis temperature, K3.5 was also brought to 800, 900 and 1100 \u00b0C in the microwave.\nIt was observed in both microwave and conventional pyrolysis that potassium\u2019s main effects on pyrolysis in order of descending influence are: inhibiting volatile release, promoting secondary cracking reactions of heavy hydrocarbons (oil) and promoting the decomposition reaction of methane at 700 \u00b0C. Potassium did not however appear to promote the carbon/CO2 heterogeneous reaction which would have rejuvenated catalyst sites for further methane decomposition, as proposed in a previous study [1].  Potassium was shown to significantly inhibit the release of oxygen containing volatiles during pyrolysis at temperatures 700 to 1100 \u00b0C, even with a loading of 0.7 percent.  The result from this is a much larger char fraction when potassium was added.  This inhibiting effect of potassium was found to be important at higher temperatures.\n\nA consistent trend among all temperatures tested in this study was that in microwave pyrolysis, potassium addition decreased the oil fraction produced. This means that potassium promoted the secondary reactions that broke down the heavy hydrocarbons into non-condensable gases. \n\nA potassium loading between 0.7 and 3.5 percent was found to promote the decomposition of methane reaction at 700 \u00b0C, but not at 1000 \u00b0C.  The reason why the decomposition of methane was not observed at the higher temperature is because at higher temperatures, potassium\u2019s pyrolysis inhibiting affect is the dominant effect.  As a result of this, there was no increase in H2 at the expense of CH4.  Potassium\u2019s promoting of the decomposition of methane was 60 percent more pronounced in microwave pyrolysis compared to conventional pyrolysis at 700 \u00b0C.  A likely reason for this difference is that in microwave heating, the potassium could have achieved temperatures much higher than the rest of the sample, because in microwave heating, microwave receptive materials reach much higher temperatures than adjacent materials.  This anisothermal heating has been demonstrated to enhance reactions taking place within a sample [2].  Anisothermal conditions were the most likely reason for the microwave pyrolysis\u2019 increased methane decomposition reactions.  Methane decomposition was promoted with a potassium loading between 0.7 and 3.5 percent.\nThe experiment that showed the best syngas production was for sample S brought to 1000 \u00b0C in the microwave.  This experiment yielded 88 mL/g (ash free) of H2 and 120 mL/g (ash free) of CO.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [689], "author_name_tesi": "Hartwell, Bradley J.", "last_name_ssi": "Hartwell", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Bradley", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati", "Sarma V Pisupati"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati, Thesis Advisor", "Sarma V Pisupati, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["catalysis", "catalyst", "gas fraction", "potassium", "corn stalk", "corn stover", "pyrolysis", "microwave", "hydrogasification"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Development of Proppants from Ion Exchanged Recycled Glass And Metabasalt Glass-Ceramics\n\n\n\n", "id": "12251", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1397", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Proppants are used in the hydrofracturing process by the oil and natural gas industry.  The purpose of the proppant is to hold fractures in rocks open providing a path of permeability for hydrocarbons out of the well.  Demand for proppants has increased 400% in the last decade with the worldwide demand currently claiming 5 million metric tons of proppant per year.  This number is estimated to increase by another 1 million metric tons as the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania is developed.  Shortages of high strength spherical ceramic proppant material, such as bauxite and kaolin, are forcing well service companies to use angular quartz sand which has insufficient crush strength and allows poor gas permeability.  Two alternative raw materials, recycled soda-lime silicate glass and metabasalt, that are widely available and come at a low cost will be studied for use as a proppant material.\nSoda-lime silicate glass was successfully spheroidized for use as proppant.  Ion exchange processing was performed on the proppants in an attempt to increase fracture strength, narrow the strength distribution, and cause the proppant to fail into large pieces instead of bed blinding glass powder.  An initial exchange, using K+ ions to produce a region of compression on the surface of the glass proppant, showed an increase in fracture strength from un-exchanged proppants when diametrally compressed.  A reverse exchange performed after the initial exchange, using Na+ ions to produce a region of tensile stress along the very surface of the proppant, showed a decrease in failure strength from the initial exchanged proppants and a narrowing of the strength distribution when diametrally compressed.  Reverse exchanges could shift the strength distribution to lower failure strengths such that an increase in the number of large fracture pieces occurred.  The reverse exchanges did not however alter the fracture mechanism of the proppants.  Little difference was seen in the crush stress and fragment size analysis between the ion exchanged and un-exchanged proppants during the industry standard, proppant crush-resistance test.  Due to these results, ion exchanging soda-lime silicate glass spheres is not believed to be economically viable for the proppant application.  \nMetabasalt was successfully fused and spheroidized for use as proppant.  Controlled devitrification was performed through heat treatment to develop crystal phases that would toughen the material through crack deflection, thereby increasing the propensity of large fracture pieces.  A time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram was constructed from x-ray diffraction data with the magnetite, augite, labradorite, and hematite phases identified.  Phase morphology, diametral compression strength, Weibull modulus, fracture type, hardness, and fracture toughness were correlated to the TTT diagram.  A region of the TTT diagram, where samples showed a combination of a high propensity for large failure pieces, high failure strength, and a consistent microstructure, was chosen for further study.  A sample heated according to the favorable time and temperature identified was produced and tested according to the industry standard proppant crush-resistance test and found to have an improved crush stress and size of fracture pieces, over the original metabasalt glass and soda-lime silicate glass of similar size.  These results predict that the hydraulic conductivity of the heat treated metabasalt proppant pack should improve over un-modified glass proppants.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1386], "author_name_tesi": "Hartwich, David G.", "last_name_ssi": "Hartwich", "middle_name_ssi": "G.", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Richard Hellmann Jr.", "John Richard Hellmann Jr.", "Barry Earl Scheetz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Richard Hellmann Jr., Thesis Advisor", "John Richard Hellmann Jr., Thesis Advisor", "Barry Earl Scheetz, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ion Exchange", "Glass-Ceramics", "Hydrofracturing", "Proppants", "Glass"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "From Colonialism to Neocolonialism?\nGeographies of Tourism in the Indian Himalaya\n\n\n", "id": "8479", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3964", "abstract_tesi": "In colonial India, hill stations in the Himalaya were simultaneously enclaves for European leisure-seekers and outposts of power, hegemony, and territorial ambition. Today the Himalaya continue to attract independent foreign tourists in the form of backpackers, ecotourists, and trekkers. Critics in the tourism literature allege that these tourists, fixated on discovering new \u2018off the beaten path\u2019 places, replicate colonial patterns and processes and thus contribute to kind of modern-day \u2018neocolonialism.\u2019 This thesis assesses the validity of this allegation by tracing changes over time in the geography of tourism in the Indian Himalaya, thus framing the alleged \u2018neocolonial\u2019 tourism of today in juxtaposition with the \u2018actual colonial\u2019 tourism of the past. The \u2018geographies\u2019 at the core of this work are broad, encompassing not just physical locations, patterns, and connectivities that can be drawn on a map,  but human spatialities and discourses that are colored by human agency, power relations, and the geographical imagination.

This varied and layered evidence is combined to illustrate the complexities, cultural conflicts, politics, and economics that underlie patterns of tourism, and backpacker tourism specifically, in the Indian Himalaya. While this research does find that there is evidence of neocolonialism to be found, it acknowledges that any conclusions are highly context-specific and vary from person to person and place to place.

This study examined the roles of four emergent states: Goal Commitment, Knowledge of Team Roles, Transactive Memory Systems and Performance Feedback in influencing Team Conflict and consequently, team effectiveness (Performance and Innovation).  It was hypothesized that Team Trust would moderate the relationship between the emergent states and conflict and between conflict and the two team outcomes, Innovation and Performance. It was also hypothesized that team conflict would mediate the relationship between the emergent states and the two team outcomes.\nStudy participants consisted of 231 members of thirty-three (33) work teams from organizations in the Washington, DC region.

A key step is to develop what some have termed a \u201cQI infrastructure.\u201d However, there is little empirical evidence to guide alliances in developing the QI strategies and programs that comprise this infrastructure. The purpose of this study is to determine the key components of community-level QI, develop a system to measure QI infrastructure, and examine the relationship between infrastructure and outcomes.\n\nStudy Design: Using a multiple case study approach we examine the evolution of QI work in communities participating in the Aligning Forces for Quality (AF4Q) program. AF4Q is a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation effort, providing multi-stakeholder alliances with funding and technical assistance to lift the overall quality of health care. Using the AF4Q qualitative data, cases were analyzed to determine how alliances attempt community-level QI, comparing the commonalities and differences. Based on the findings from the cross-case analysis a system to measure community-level QI was developed. Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between community-level QI and health care outcomes.\n\nPopulation Studied: This thesis examines multi-stakeholder alliances (payers, providers, consumers, and purchasers) in 14 communities. The alliances represent a diverse set of communities across the nation, including states, metropolitan areas, and rural counties (e.g., Minnesota, Cleveland, Humboldt County, CA). The alliances vary in a number of contexts, including its experience with community-level QI, the size and composition of the health care delivery system, resources, economic climate, and needs. \n\nPrincipal Findings: Through the cross-case analysis we conclude that there are several components of community-level QI (strategy, resources, measurement, stakeholder engagement, leadership, neutral forum for collaboration, and Health Information Technology). Successful alliances also facilitate QI interventions, work across provider settings, and include patient-centered approaches. There was variation across alliances related to the maturity of the QI infrastructure. Alliances with lower infrastructure scores had fewer resources and QI governance and strategies that were less organized. Several alliances with mid-range scores had strong histories of measurement and reporting. These alliances initially focused on its strengths and are only more recently developing QI strategies and initiatives. The alliances with higher infrastructure scores had well-balanced activities across all infrastructure components. Finally, a significant relationship was found between infrastructure and three QI outcomes for diabetic patients (blood lipid testing, eye exams, and hospital admissions).\n\nConclusions: This study provides detailed context on how alliances develop community-level QI programs. Local context is important in establishing community-level QI and the AF4Q alliances tailored the work to meet its individual needs and goals. Another theme was the evolving nature of the QI activities. Alliances described the importance of having a flexible strategy and adapting to the changing health care environment. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9536], "author_name_tesi": "Harvey, Jillian B", "last_name_ssi": "Harvey", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Jillian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Patrick Scanlon", "Dennis Patrick Scanlon", "Susan Diane Brannon", "Jonathan Rogers Clark", "Robert Gabbay"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis Patrick Scanlon, Dissertation Advisor", "Dennis Patrick Scanlon, Committee Chair", "Susan Diane Brannon, Committee Member", "Jonathan Rogers Clark, Committee Member", "Robert Gabbay, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["quality improvement", "collaboration", "qualitative research"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of two Sustainable Practices for Plant Pathogen Eradication", "id": "14990rjh346", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14990", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Boxwood blight is a disease impacting much of the United States, at least 26 states as of the time of this writing. Caused by the pathogens Calonectria pseudonaviculata and C. henricotiae, the disease is found worldwide. Currently, only C. pseudonaviculata is found in the United States, while both species are found in Europe. Like other species in the genus, both C. pseudonaviculata and C. henricotiae are prolific microsclerotia producers. Due to the resistant nature of these survival structures, extended survival under extreme environmental conditions is possible, which could then lead to subsequent dissemination of the pathogen. During the past 10-20 years, much attention has been given to diverting organic matter from our landfills, with composting often being the proposed method for the disposal of organic matter. However, if infected plant material containing microsclerotia are present in the organic waste stream, it is possible that the pathogen could survive the composting process, therefore the use of finished compost could inadvertently serve as a vector for the pathogen. Another area of concern potentially leading to the spread of the pathogen is through water runoff from nurseries. This wastewater can also be high in nutrients, like nitrate and ammonium, spurring eutrophication processes in bodies of water in which they discharge. Capturing and reusing this wastewater can help reduce fertilizer costs, and prevent pollution, however it may also lead to pathogen levels building up due to water recirculation in these systems. Treatment solutions like constructed wetlands could possibly serve to mitigate this problem. \nTo address these challenges, two systems were constructed, one consisting of nine composting bioreactors, and one consisting of nine constructed wetlands. To evaluate compost survival, microsclerotia of C. pseudonaviculata were grown on cellophane and inoculated into compost. Survival was compared at 24, 48, and 72 h at temperatures of 40, 50, and . Based on the results of these experiments, it was conclusively demonstrated that microsclerotia survival in compost \u2265  for 24 h or longer is not expected. Survival in compost was less than that of heat alone, leading to an experiment evaluating the impacts of ammonia. Both species of Calonectria were evaluated for ammonia sensitivity at the USDA BSL-3 facility housed at Ft. Detrick (Frederick, MD). Based on these results no significant differences in ammonia sensitivity between the two species were observed. Exposing the C. pseudonaviculata microsclerotia to gaseous ammonia at  for 24 h reduced survival rates compared to heat alone, but still not as efficient as compost. Similar work was done to evaluate C. pseudonaviculata survival in a wetland, with a few key differences. Due to the regulatory nature of C. pseudonaviculata research, Verticillium dahliae was used as a proxy. Microsclerotia were grown on cellophane and inoculated into the wetlands. Nine wetlands were constructed using one of three different substrates: unplanted gravel, planted gravel, and planted gravel/spent mushroom compost mix, with three cells per treatment. None of the three treatments caused complete eradication of the microsclerotia through 7 days. This indicates that while constructed wetlands could serve as a filter reducing the number of pathogens in the irrigation water system, survival of the pathogens can be expected, leading to future reintroduction.

Bitterness was investigated because it is a necessary component of chocolate flavor at low levels but can become objectionable at higher levels.

It proceeds in three distinct parts: First, the Nicomachean Ethics is mined to establish the understanding and importance of phron&#275;sis. Second, the Politics is read in light of this, reworking the traditional definitions of that which constitutes \u201chealthy\u201d or \u201csick\u201d regimes. Third, three distinct moments from Aristotle\u2019s ethico-political dialectic are isolated and discussed to examine their rhetorical force: the God Among Men, slavery, and nobility.\n\tThe thesis is that Aristotle uses rhetoric in order to present a politically revolutionary doctrine regarding the perfection and completion of the polis as a natural kind. The best polis is revealed as an aristocratic polity wherein the government and citizens rule each other in turn. The aristoi or \u201cbest\u201d are chosen by the people on the basis of their possession of phron&#275;sis, as it is described in the Nicomachean Ethics. The logistical structure of government is inconsequential to the criterion of rule by and through phron&#275;sis. All other poleis are shown to be different forms of despotism, whereas this is the sole government that is both possible via human artifice and properly called a \u201chealthy\u201d polis. The ultimately best government, which requires the assistance of nature, is that ruled by an individual whom Aristotle calls the God Among Men, a person who exceeds all others in his possession of philosophical and phronetic ability. The aristocratic polity would recognize the emergence of this individual by willingly ceding power to him, whereas all others would either exile or kill him. The significance of Aristotle\u2019s rhetoric is reinforced by a rereading of his account of slavery in the Politics and that of nobility in On Noble Birth. Both of these are shown to be ad absurdum arguments, proving the invalidity of the institutions rather than their proper or natural implementation. \n\tIn this manner Aristotle is allowed to mean what he says, removing the generally accepted impression of the latter two issues as inconsistent or problematic. Rather, when read literally with the Ethics as the constant backdrop, Aristotle\u2019s account remains both consistent and remarkably prescient. As seen in the conclusion, not only does his anatomy of the polis as a natural entity survive scrutiny, it also provides a cipher for examining contemporary ethico-political issues while it predicts a great deal of the future ethico-political history of the West. By misreading Aristotle on these issues, the West has enacted some of the more common and heinous examples of despotism, particularly by biologizing the political in a manner disguised as a remedy for the sake of the many.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6512], "author_name_tesi": "Harwood, William Henry", "last_name_ssi": "Harwood", "middle_name_ssi": "Henry", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Veronique Marion Foti", "Christopher P Long", "Mark Munn", "Paul C Taylor", "Daniel Joseph Conway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Veronique Marion Foti, Committee Chair", "Christopher P Long, Committee Member", "Mark Munn, Committee Member", "Paul C Taylor, Committee Member", "Daniel Joseph Conway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aristotle", "phronesis", "political philosophy", "politics", "ancient philosophy", "God Among Men"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Metaphysics, War And The Critique Of The Conatus Essendi In Emmanuel Levinas", "id": "h989r3203", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12977", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation concerns Emmanuel Levinas\u2019 critique of the conatus essendi. I will argue that Levinas\u2019 critique of the conatus is indispensable to understanding his engagement with Western metaphysics and its relation to the subject of war. The problem of war is not defined by the actual violence of war but by the ways in which we are conditioned for war and are consequently susceptible to mobilization. According to Levinas, the susceptibility to war or mobilization is the direct result of thought or thinking of being in general. I contend that the connection of thought to war is articulated in his critique of the idea of the conatus. The conatus is the tendency towards self-preservation and for Levinas it represents the positing of being as war or a struggle-to-be. However, the relation between the conatus, metaphysics, and war is absent from many interpretations of Levinas. This is because Levinas is best known for his ethics. The ethics of responsibility or the face-to-face and the ethics that will develop later in his account of substitution overshadow his work as a whole. The overemphasis on his ethics often results in the under-examination of his metaphysics and political thought, specifically his revision to the ways in which we think of both together. I contend that although the present analysis does not directly take on the question of the ethical in Levinas\u2019 work, the introduction of the critique of the conatus deepens the role of ethics within his metaphysics. This, as I will demonstrate, is due to that fact that Levinas\u2019 engagement with the idea of the conatus is not just that of critique but also of revision. Levinas\u2019 notion of the conatus existendi, which is found in his late works, reverses the meaning and utility of the idea of the conatus in the history of philosophy and its bearing on how we conceive of the body, time, and existence.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12631], "author_name_tesi": "Hasan, Aminah Amatullah", "last_name_ssi": "Hasan", "middle_name_ssi": "Amatullah", "first_name_ssi": "Aminah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Lambert Bernasconi", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi", "Leonard Richard Lawlor", "Emily Rolfe Grosholz", "Benjamin Jared Schreier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Lambert Bernasconi, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi, Committee Chair", "Leonard Richard Lawlor, Committee Member", "Emily Rolfe Grosholz, Committee Member", "Benjamin Jared Schreier, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Levinas", "french philosophy", "phenomenology", "early modern", "20th century philosophy", "17th century philosohphy", "spinoza", "Heidegger", "metaphysics", "ethics", "politics", "war", "peace", "conatus", "philosophy", "17th/18th century philosophy"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Have We Come Up Short?

First, I determined whether immigrants had greater unmet medical need than their U.S.-born counterparts, after accounting for group differences in demographic risk factors, available resources, including income and health insurance coverage, and family context.  Second, I assessed the roles of length of stay in the U.S., English language proficiency, and state-level destination type in explaining the unmet medical need of the foreign-born, controlling for covariates.  Multivariate logistic regression results for two measures of unmet medical need, subjective and objective, indicated that compared to the U.S. born, immigrants reported less subjective unmet need and equal objective unmet need.  Among immigrants only, length of stay in the U.S. and state-level destination type were significantly associated with objective unmet need, but not subjective unmet need.

The goal of this research is, generally, to assess how immigration policy influences immigrants\u2019 access to and utilization of health care services, and the implications for health care policy. It builds on earlier work on socioeconomic disparities in health and health care and postulates that both immigrant status and education are fundamental causes of health care utilization. As the foreign-born population in the U.S. continues to expand, who these immigrants are and how they manage their health, and in turn how this affects the health care industry, become increasingly important topics for research.\n\tThe first analytic chapter uses linked National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and Medical\nExpenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data to compare immigrants\u2019 and natives\u2019 health care expenditures. Immigrants, particularly noncitizens, those who have lived in the U.S. for less than five years, and those who are not comfortable speaking English, spend less money on health care than natives. Also, in contrast to previous studies that have documented flat education gradients in physical health and some health behaviors among immigrants, immigrants as a whole are found to have a steeper education gradient in health care expenditures than natives. Immigrant and U.S.-born women have steeper education gradients than the corresponding groups of men.\n\tThe second analytic chapter evaluates the role of immigration policy on future immigrants\u2019 age, sex, and education composition and their health care utilization. Specifically, it compares a more high-skilled immigration policy regime, as measured by recent Canadian National Household Survey (NHS) data, to the steady-state policy regime, as measured by American Community Survey (ACS) data. The population projection results through 2060 stress that regardless of policy regime the immigrant population will become increasingly educated (i.e., have a bachelor\u2019s degree or more) and use more health care. The high-skilled policy regime bolsters the higher-educated working-age immigrant population and further boosts immigrants\u2019 health care expenditures and probability of having a routine annual doctor visit.\n\tThe final analytic chapter estimates the impact of legalization on health insurance coverage among undocumented immigrants who were legalized under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA). It uses difference-in-difference methodology to compare the health insurance trajectories of legalized immigrants to U.S.-born Hispanics. The results do not support the hypothesis that legalization increased immigrants\u2019 health insurance coverage. There is some limited evidence that female legalized immigrants were more likely to gain health insurance coverage than their male counterparts and that younger legalized immigrants (18-24 years of age) were more likely to gain health insurance than similarly aged U.S.-born Hispanics.

An effective example of personalized therapy is the drug brentuximab vedotin, a humanized antibody against the cell surface receptor CD30 conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E. CD30 is expressed mainly on the surface of activated lymphocytes. Brentuximab vedotin targets CD30-positive cells for auristatin E, a potent and effective mitotic spindle toxin. The side effect profile is low and efficacy high in CD30-positive cells. CD30 is a great drug target, but there are few CD30-positive leukemias and lymphomas. But what if there was a way to force CD30 expression? It would open the door for brentuximab vedotin use in other lymphoid malignancies. The induction of CD30 expression is the main focus of this dissertation. We approached this goal in two ways, to uncover agents that could induce CD30 and to understand the mechanism by which induction occurs. We performed three independent studies in pursuit of this goal.\n\nOur first study was directed at finding a better treatment for the aggressive and rapidly fatal disease T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL). Treatment with monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab, anti-CD52, has good efficacy in treatment na\u00efve patients, but relapse is inevitable and refractory to further alemtuzumab treatment. We used the epigenetic drugs, cladribine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, and vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, in combination with alemtuzumab. We noted that all patients responded and remained amenable to treatment even after relapse. This treatment has the potential to slow an aggressive and fatal disease and to allow time for bone marrow transplant, the only currently curative measure. During this study, we discovered that certain patients had upregulated the expression of CD30 after epigenetic treatment. This finding was useful, because it allowed for brentuximab vedotin treatment of a patient that had alemtuzumab resistant T-PLL in his skin. Epigenetic drugs maintain treatment susceptibility and create new treatment targets such as CD30.\n\nDuring our T-PLL study, we noticed that patients treated with only cladribine and alemtuzumab were CD30-positive. After addition of vorinostat, CD30 expression was silenced. One patient was switched from vorinostat to romidepsin and then induced CD30. To study this phenomenon more closely, we tested the effects of vorinostat treatment of three CD30-positive cell lines in vitro. We found that vorinostat reversibly silenced CD30 mRNA and protein expression. This finding indicates that HDAC enzymes are critical to the expression of CD30. We also tested whether vorinostat mediated decreases in CD30 had an effect on the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin. All three cell lines were susceptible to brentuximab vedotin prior to the addition of vorinostat, but all three became significantly less so after concurrent treatment. If a subclinical concentration of vorinostat was used that did not decrease CD30 levels by more than 40-50%, the effect of brentuximab vedotin was increased. As long as the target for brentuximab vedotin, CD30, remained high enough, the anti-tumor effects of vorinostat were additive. \n\nSeveral previous studies have linked some EBV positive tumors to CD30 expression. EBV enters into latency in order to evade the immune system and persist. There are three latency states expressing unique patterns of latency proteins. Using Burkitt lymphoma cell lines that were either in Latency I or III, we showed that Latency III was CD30 positive and Latency I was not. This explained why some EBV-positive tumors are CD30-positive and others are not. By expressing latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) in an EBV-negative cell line, we showed that it is responsible for CD30 upregulation. In order for LMP1 to upregulate CD30, the CD30 promoter has to be hypomethylated, specifically the region around the Sp1 transcription factor binding site. LMP1 triggers all arms of the MAP kinase, Akt and NF-\u03baB pathways through its intracellular domains. This signaling activates expression of c-jun and JunB, two major regulators of the CD30 promoter, and leads to its expression. We also proved that an LMP1-negative, CD30-negative Latency I cell line could be treated with 5-azacytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, and forced to express low levels of LMP1 and CD30. EBV positive Latency I tumors could be treated with 5-azacytidine or a similar drug to force expression of CD30 and then brentuximab vedotin to kill CD30 positive cells. These studies lay the foundation for a new treatment option in the fight against EBV positive lymphoid malignancies.\n \nOur studies provide proof of concept for CD30 induction and highlight some of the mechanisms involved. These findings lay the groundwork for the expansion of brentuximab vedotin treatment into EBV-positive lymphoid malignancies. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10538], "author_name_tesi": "Hasanali, Zainul Shoyeb", "last_name_ssi": "Hasanali", "middle_name_ssi": "Shoyeb", "first_name_ssi": "Zainul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clare E Sample", "Thomas Loughran Jr", "Clare E Sample", "Leslie Joan Parent", "Diane M Thiboutot", "Neil David Christensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clare E Sample, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Loughran Jr, Dissertation Advisor", "Clare E Sample, Committee Chair", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Member", "Diane M Thiboutot, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CD30", "brentuximab vedotin", "EBV", "T-PLL", "LMP1", "cladribine", "vorinostat", "alemtuzumab", "romidepsin", "SAHA", "BL"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THERMODYNAMIC MODELING AND FIRST-PRINCIPLES CALCULATIONS OF THE CR-HF-Y TERNARY SYSTEM\n", "id": "10778", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "634", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes the thermodynamic modeling of the ternary Cr-Hf-Y system.

Nickel superalloys usually contain many different alloying elements, so there becomes a need to understand the phase equilibria of large, multicomponent systems.  This can be accomplished by using the CALPHAD method of modeling.  CALPHAD modeling requires experimental data to better model the system.  In the absence of experimental data, first-principles calculations can be used to predict thermochemical data.\nBefore modeling the Cr-Hf-Y system, the binary Cr-Hf, Cr-Y, and Hf-Y systems must be modeled.

The centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified a number of infectious diseases states that have been associated with inappropriate use of antibiotics, including acute otitis media (AOM). The objective of this study is to assess the variation in the rate of antibiotic prescribing for children with acute otitis media over time across the U.S. \n\nMethods\nWe analyzed data from the Truven Health MarketScan Research database.  The database includes primarily commercial health insurance data submitted from 2005 through 2011. The study sample included all children under the age of 12 years old with an ICD-9 diagnosis for acute otitis media (382, 384.20, 384.29). The primary outcome is filling a prescription for an antibiotic medication.  Rates of antibiotic prescribing were compared over time and across U.S. Census regions.  Logistic regression was used to identify demographic (age and sex) and geographic (U.S. Census regions) factors associated with antibiotic use for AOM. \n\nResults\nA total of 6,764,655 children aged less than 12 years old with a diagnosis of acute otitis media were identified after eliminating children with any missing values.  Overall, the mean age was 4.33.2 years. The distribution of the sample by U.S. Census region was as follows: 15.6% (n=1,059,978) in the North region, 23.3% (n=1,577,475) in the Midwest region, 43.8% (n=2,959,741) in the South region and 17.3% (n=1,167,461) in the West region. Overall, 60.7% of AOM children received an antibiotic, with rates of antibiotic use being highest in the West (62.7%), followed by the Midwest (61.8%), the South (60.5%), and the North (57.4%). \n\nConclusion\nBased on the results of this study, overall antibiotic usage for acute otitis media for children with under age of 12 appears to be stable over the past decade, although rates vary dramatically by U.S. Census region. This shows the inconsistence of practice among different regions and need for standardization for treatment of AOM. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15303], "author_name_tesi": "Hashem, Nehal Gamal", "last_name_ssi": "Hashem", "middle_name_ssi": "Gamal", "first_name_ssi": "Nehal", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas L Leslie", "Du, Ping", "Kristen H Kjerulff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas L Leslie, Thesis Advisor", "Du, Ping, Committee Member", "Kristen H Kjerulff, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Acute otitis media", "children", "antibiotics"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ESTIMATION AND CONTROL OF TWO-COMPONENT GRANULATION PROCESSES", "id": "13993suh245", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13993", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There are many systems in different fields which consist of particle populations such as crystallization, polymerization, granulations and viral infections. The particles in these systems are characterized by their properties e.g. type, size and/or composition. Mostly, the governing equation for these dispersed systems includes a population balance resulting in an equation that involves both integrals and derivatives of an unknown function called integro-differential equation. In general, there is no analytical solution for these types of dynamic systems. This paper studies one of this particulate processes has been enhanced for application in the pharmaceutical industry; two-component high shear granulation. In this process, the granules are stuck together and form bigger particles through use of inactive binder droplets called excipient. In an ideal granulation process the composition and size of produced granules is the same, however, in reality the particle size and composition are distributed over a range.\nWe address the issue of state estimation and control of a stochastic particulate process through (i) using model reduction to obtain a tractable approximation of the governing dynamics, (ii) designing a fast moving-horizon estimator for the reduced-order model and (iii) developing a Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) for the system. \n\nWe first use the method of moments to reduce the governing integro-differential equation down to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE). In order to simplify the results of the method of moments, we exploit Taylor expansion and derive a closed finite-dimensional ordinary differential equation set.  However, this approach cannot be used for composition-dependent models. To address this issue, this dissertation proposes a new model reduction approach using the method of moments in conjunction with Laguerre polynomials. In this way, we expand the distribution function over the set of orthogonal Laguerre polynomials which are function of moments. Also, we evaluate our new reduced models with the results obtained from a Monte Carlo simulation as a bench mark. These models will be the foundation for efficient observer and controller design for such bi-component agglomeration processes.\n\n Next, the states of the reduced order model are estimated in a Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) approach. MHE is an optimization-based technique to estimate the unmeasurable state variables of a nonlinear dynamic system with noise in transition and measurement. One of the advantages of MHE over Extended Kalman Filter, the alternative approach in this area, is that it considers the physical constraints in its formulation. However, to offer this feature, MHE needs to solve a constrained nonlinear dynamic optimization problem which slows down the estimation process. In this work, we introduce and employ the Carleman approximation method in MHE design to accelerate the solution of the optimization problem. The Carleman method approximates the nonlinear system with a polynomial system at a desired accuracy level and recasts it in a bilinear form. By making this approximation, the KKT matrix required to solve the optimization problem becomes analytically available. Additionally, we perform a stability analysis for the proposed MHE design. As a result of this analysis, we derive a criterion for choosing an order of Carleman approximation procedure that ensures convergence of the scheme. Finally, some simulation results are included that show a significant reduction in the estimation time when the proposed method is employed.\n\n\nMoreover, a Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) design is employed to shape the distribution of the particles as required. The reduced-order model is employed in the SMPC formulation. The probabilistic constraints in this formulation keeps the variance of particles' drug concentration in an admissible range. To solve the resulting stochastic optimization problem, we first employ polynomial chaos expansion to obtain the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of state variables using the uncertain variables' distributions. As a result, the original stochastic optimization problem for a particulate system is converted to a deterministic dynamic optimization. This representation lessens the computation burden of the controller and makes its real time application possible.\n\nMoisture content is a critical quality attribute in drying of pharmaceutical formulations. This work proposes a hybrid soft sensor for online real-time estimation of the product moisture in batch fluid bed dryers (FBD). Major applications include end-point detection, feed-back control, and process optimization resulting from increased process understanding. The proposed soft sensor utilizes commonly available measurements in a hybrid first-principle/empirical mathematical framework with few parameters to calibrate. Each parameter has a physical meaning in the model, enabling quantitative comparison of the drying dynamics of different formulations, products, and equipment. The soft sensor model requires experimental data from few batches for calibration, and historical data from production batches can be used for this purpose when available. Three case studies, two in pilot plant using different formulations and one using historical data from manufacturing batches,  are presented in this work. The results support the proposed soft sensor model as a robust, practical and accurate method for online estimation of moisture in FBDs.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15602], "author_name_tesi": "Hashemian, Seyedeh Negar ", "last_name_ssi": "Hashemian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seyedeh Negar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Antonios Armaou", "Antonios Armaou", "Themis Matsoukas", "Ali Borhan", "Hosam Fathy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Antonios Armaou, Dissertation Advisor", "Antonios Armaou, Committee Chair", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Hosam Fathy, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Moving Horizon Estimation", "Two Component Granulation", "Monte Carlo Simulation", "Carleman Approximation", "Laguerre polynomials", "Stochastic Model Predictive Control", "Polynomial Chaos", "Method of Moments", "Soft Sensor", "Fluid Bed Dryer", "Pharmaceutical Processes", "Model Order Reduction"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "How The No Child Left Behind Act Impacted Bilingual Education In A Rural School With Navajo Children\n", "id": "7520", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4239", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nHow the No Child Left Behind Act Impacted Bilingual Education in a Rural School with Navajo Students\n\nThis study focused on how educational policies can bring about change within school systems.

Data collection included reviewing relevant documents and interviews with 15 participants at the school.  \nThe findings of the study indicate that the bilingual program used at Rock Point Community School before the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act was not clearly identified or perceived by the school participants.  After No Child Left Behind there was a clearer understanding of the type of bilingual education program being used at the school.  Also, there was more of an emphasis on learning the English language and making Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP).  In other words, the Partial Immersion bilingual program was better known but its effectiveness seems to be less because of limited Navajo language use, increased emphasis on learning the English language and pressure to make AYP.  \nThere was more parental involvement with stable leadership before No Child Left Behind.  After No Child Left Behind parents were less involved with the bilingual program and the leadership was not stable. Additionally, funding sources for bilingual education are limited thus minimizing bilingual education programs and the usage of the Navajo language for instruction.  The findings in this study indicate a need for additional research on the partial immersion program to gain reliable evidence that would prove that it is an effective method in helping the children at RPCS learn the same rigorous content as other children across the United States.

These components require determining the means (nominal values) and acceptable tolerances of their relevant quality characteristics. The process of setting the means and tolerances of the components characteristics is called parameter and tolerance designs. These designs are found to be most effective when conducted simultaneously (integrated designs). In the classical models of integrated parameter and tolerance designs, the objective is to minimize the total costs while meeting the customer requirements and expectations using available technological capabilities. Total costs can be divided into two categories. The first category is the manufacturing costs, which include production and internal failure costs, i.e. costs incurred before the product is shipped to the customer. The second category is the quality losses or external failure costs, which include warranty costs, loss of market share, etc., i.e. costs incurred after the product is shipped to the customer. The major limitation of most existing integrated parameter and tolerance designs models is the use of the quadratic loss function. It is used to capture all external failure costs incurred by the manufacturer, customer, and the society as a whole as a function of the deviation of the product\u2019s quality characteristic from its ideal value using a single proportionality constant. Despite the merits of its idea, the quadratic loss function suffers from its simplistic form and the difficulty of estimating its proportionality constant.     \n\nIn this research, integrated parameter and tolerance designs models are proposed that use warranty costs instead of the quadratic loss function for estimating external failure costs. The advantage of using warranty costs is that they are related to product reliability, which can be modeled fairly accurately using empirical product failure data. However, since warranty costs are only part of the external failure costs, the first set of proposed integrated models run the risk of underestimating the external failure costs and jeopardizing the accuracy of the models results. This issue is addressed by proposing a second set of integrated parameter and tolerance designs models, which incorporate in them microeconomic and marketing concepts, such as pricing and demand functions. In these integrated models, instead of listing and estimating all external failure costs other than the warranty costs, these external failure costs are modeled as part of the customer\u2019s decision of the amount he or she is willing to pay for the product. That is, the customer sets the purchase price based on a tradeoff between the amount of gained satisfaction and the perceived risk of using the product. As a result, the objective of these integrated models is to maximize the profit, which is the difference between the selling price and the total cost of the product, as opposed to minimizing total cost. After surveying pricing and demand models from the microeconomic and marketing literature, it is found that most pricing models use product manufacturing and quality costs in a very crude manner. Therefore, not only do the proposed integrated parameter and tolerance designs models provide a better representation of the external failure costs, but they also provide a better representation of manufacturing and quality costs of the product in the microeconomic and marketing decisions models. That is, the proposed integrated models bridge the gap between marketing and manufacturing operations and decisions by eliminating unnecessary assumptions and poor links from both areas.\n\nSeveral numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed models and show their flexibility and applicability to a wide range of problems. For the first set of integrated models, in which microeconomic and marketing decisions are not considered, the examples include the cases of linear and nonlinear relationships between the product\u2019s main quality characteristic and the quality characteristics of its components as well as the case of finite manufacturing processes. For the second set of integrated models, in which microeconomic and marketing decisions are considered, the numerical examples include the cases of static market analysis approach for a general demand function, a monopoly, and a duopoly competition as well as the case of a dynamic market analysis approach. In the different numerical examples, a variety of optimization and analysis techniques, such as nonlinear programming, integer programming, response surface methodology, simulation, and sensitivity analysis, are employed to show the methodology of handling the different design problems.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7562], "author_name_tesi": "Hassan, Jawad S.", "last_name_ssi": "Hassan", "middle_name_ssi": "S.", "first_name_ssi": "Jawad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["M Jeya Chandra", "Dr Paul Griffin", "Tao Yao", "David Russell Hunter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["M Jeya Chandra, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Paul Griffin, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "David Russell Hunter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["parameter design", "tolerance design", "product reliability", "warranty costs", "pricing", "market models", "oligopoly"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Security Enforcement in Mobile Telephony Server \n\n\n", "id": "8803", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4300", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The increasing market share of Linux based mobile phones has motivated developers to make use of the Linux flexible environment to write applications that provide services for mobile users.

This method enabled us to understand the scattering behavior of materials. The formulation of this new approach, which is based on the Dipole Moment Method, is useful for solving electromagnetic scattering problems at low frequencies and in finding the scattered fields of the scattering object at any given distance from the object. By replacing scatterers with their equivalent dipole moment weight, the method can be used to analyze a wide variety of materials, including magneto-dielectric materials. This approach is first investigated using simple geometries. Following this simple and useful method, the method was extended to the study of multiple scattering objects. The dipole weights for these objects can be obtained using either the near field or the far field approach. More complex and realistic bodies and three-dimensional problems can be solved by using this new electromagnetic method.\nOnce the materials have been modeled, the developed technique is then compared with effective medium theories, to decide which one can use to choose a mixing rule. For the case of complex reservoirs and large fractures, one can easily use the effective medium theory formulations, and the results do not show much difference, which serves as a validation to the dipole moment method. A low-frequency Finite Element Method was implemented to handle forward modeling of fractures with magnetic permeability contrasts that can be created by injecting fluids with magnetic proppants. The Finite Element Method is found to handle complex geometries and overcomes the limitations of the Finite Difference Time Domain Method at low frequencies, as is needed to investigate deep fractures. The depth of the fractures was correlated with the scattered fields. Given the measured value of the fields scattered by a given fracture, we can estimate the depth of the fracture.

Modern TKR has proven to be a safe and e\u000bffective means to restore the quality of life for patients, and the number of TKR procedures performed per year continues to rise. The motivation of this dissertation was the\neff\u000bective use and development of novel muscle-controlled dynamic simulations of TKR that can characterize knee joint loads.\n\nThe \ffirst study involved the use of a previously developed dynamic elastic foundation model of an \"Oxford Rig.\" The Oxford Rig is a commonly used cadaveric jig that simulates loaded knee flexion under quadriceps control. Undesirable collateral ligament laxities were introduced into the knee joint, and the model was utilized to predict the kinetic and kinematic eff\u000bects of a surgical method, called joint line elevation, that is commonly used to address ligament laxity. The result of these simulations concurred with guidelines that have been qualitatively\nestablished through years of clinical experience.\n\nThe second study used the same Oxford Rig simulation to investigate an alternative surgical method that is used to address collateral ligament laxity, called femoral upsizing. To date, the mechanical implications of mismatching femoral and tibial component sizes has received little attention. The results of this study suggested that the magnitude of collateral ligament laxity should be indicative of the\nmethod used to address collateral ligament laxity. Specifi\fcally, if ligament laxity is\nmild it is suggested that femoral upsizing should be avoided, but if more moderate or severe ligament laxity is encountered, a combination of femoral upsizing and joint line elevation should be employed.\n\nThe third study augmented the Oxford Rig model to investigate the eff\u000bects of changing the \ffixation point of linear displacement quadriceps actuators. A review of the literature revealed that many labs are using Oxford Rigs to investigate TKR mechanics, but the location of the quadriceps actuator has varied from lab to lab.  It was found that the fi\fxation point of the quadriceps actuator had influence over the joint loads within the knee, but the kinematics of the knee joint were relatively unaff\u000bected by changes in actuator position.\n\nThe fi\fnal study developed a novel methodology to predict tibiofemoral contact forces during gait. The accurate simultaneous prediction of muscle forces and tibiofemoral contact forces continues to be a challenging task for researchers,and is the goal of the \"Grand Challenge Competition to Predict In Vivo Knee Loads,\" hosted by the ASME Summer Bioengineering Conference. To address\nthis challenge, we developed an dynamic elastic foundation model that employed a dual-joint paradigm to represent the knee joint, and incorporated in vivo kinematics and EMG data as inputs. The simulations provided kinematics, muscle forces, and tibiofemoral contact forces that compared well with data collected from an\ninstrumented implant.\n\nIn conclusion, this dissertation described several novel computational simulations that were used to investigate TKR kinematics and kinetics during dynamic activities. These simulations have the potential to be used by surgeons to elucidate\nthe eff\u000bects of choices made within the operating room, and by implant designers to evaluate implant designs before they are put into production. Although TKR is e\u000bffectively restoring the quality of life to many patients, the post operative function of the implants can be improved with computer models by optimizing surgical techniques and by streamlining the implant design cycle.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4431], "author_name_tesi": "Hast, Michael W", "last_name_ssi": "Hast", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Andris Freivalds", "Matthew B Parkinson", "Henry Joseph Sommer Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Chair", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "Matthew B Parkinson, Committee Member", "Henry Joseph Sommer Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["computational simulation", "total knee replacements"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Multi-Platform Analysis of Morning Transition and Evolution of Shallow Mesoscale Convection on 21 June 2002", "id": "10205", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5270", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite research that has detailed the characteristics of nocturnal boundary layers \nand convective boundary layers, the morning transition from the nocturnal to \nthe convective is still not well understood.

The simplest\nmode of merger is one in which out\now from the new cell cuts o\u000b in\now to the original.\nIf the new cell is not producing a cold pool su\u000eciently strong to cut o\u000b the in\now to the\noriginal cell, the minimum separation of the updraft maxima during the merger becomes\na key controlling factor. If the minimum separation of the updraft maxima is less than\n10 km, an updraft collision occurs. If the minimum separation of the updraft maxima is\ngreater than 20 km and the new cell merges into the forward \nank of the original cell, a\ndual-cell system results. If the minimum separation of the updraft maxima is between 10\nand 20 km, the combination of precipitation produced in the updrafts leads to a cold pool\nsurge and subsequent formation of an updraft bridge, joining the updrafts. The outcome\nin this type of merger is controlled by the distribution of precipitation in the merging\nsystem.

The Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) reported energy use intensity (kBtu/ft2) of convenience stores is 2.9 times more than commercial office buildings. Understanding convenience store\u2019s energy use and consumption patterns will provide useful information, which will help to inform owners and operators as to what operational changes can be made to reduce energy consumption. Continually monitoring the energy consumption of convenience stores in order to identify typical energy use patterns is necessary.\nMonitoring includes sufficient sub-metering of specific subsystem (lighting, HVAC, refrigeration, and food preparation) energy use in specific weather and customer interactions. The monitoring data is used within a  with a set of monitoring and targeting (M&T) analysis tools  that establishes expected energy use relative to a data-based baseline. Actual convenience store  operational data is used to demonstrate the usefulness of the M&T practice. In order to determine the electricity consumption pattern of main meter and sub-meters in each store, the inverse modeling method is applied to the convenience energy utilization data and the associated accumulated sum of differences between expected and observed energy use (CUSUM) M&T for the whole building and specific subsystem energy uses  allows facility managers to immediately determine the end-use cause of energy use deviations observed in the energy use CUSUM reporting. The results indicate that the similarly designed stores exhibit very similar qualitative energy use dependencies with changes in ambient weather conditions with respect to whole building energy use and subsystem energy uses. However, the quantitative levels of energy use as well as the changes in energy use with change in ambient temperatures are specific, even for stores in close physical proximity. The energy use patterns are quite reproducible for a given location and deviations are observed to occur only when significant changes in site equipment performance or building envelope changes occur. It\u2019s believed, with some modification, this technique could be used in continues energy monitoring of an entire fleet of similar, high energy utilization commercial building types, allowing for automated notification of unexpected deviations from expected energy use at a site and probable subsystem root causes of such deviations.

The right selection of equipment for controlling reactive power and voltage stability are among the major challenges of system engineering. With today\u2019s modern equipment designs and the modern control techniques, it is appropriate to again examine synchronous condensers as a reactive power solution.

Both classical and quantum mechanical treatments of the proton donor-acceptor vibrational motion are presented.  The temperature dependence of the calculated rates and kinetic isotope effects is in agreement with the experimental data.  The temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effect is strongly influenced by the proton donor-acceptor distance.  Thus, the proton donor-acceptor vibrational motion plays a vital role in facilitating the proton-coupled electron transfer reaction.\nA general theoretical formulation for proton-coupled electron transfer reactions is presented.  The solute is represented by a multistate valence bond model, and the active electrons and transferring proton(s) are treated quantum mechanically.  This formulation enables the classical or quantum mechanical treatment of the proton donor-acceptor vibrational mode, as well as the dynamical treatment of the proton donor-acceptor mode and the solvent.  Nonadiabatic rate expressions are presented for PCET reactions in a number of well-defined limits for both dielectric continuum and molecular representations of the environment.  The dynamical rate expressions account for correlations between the fluctuations of the proton donor-acceptor distance and the nonadiabatic PCET coupling.  The significance of the quantum and dynamical effects of the proton donor-acceptor mode is illustrated with applications to model PCET systems.\nThe dynamical aspects of a model proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction in solution are analyzed with molecular dynamics simulations.  The rate constant for nonadiabatic PCET reactions is expressed in terms of a time-dependent probability flux correlation function.

The analysis of PCET reactions is compared to previous analyses of single electron and proton transfer reactions.  \nFundamental aspects of PCET reactions in solution are analyzed with molecular dynamics simulations for a series of model systems.  The analysis addresses the impact of the solvent reorganization energy, the proton donor-acceptor mode vibrational frequency, and the distance dependence of the nonadiabatic coupling on the dynamics of the reaction and the magnitude of the rate.  The approximations underlying a previously derived analytical PCET rate expression are also investigated.  \nThe dynamical behavior and the temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effects are examined for the PCET reaction catalyzed by the enzyme soybean lipoxygenase.  The calculations are based on a vibronically nonadiabatic formulation that includes the quantum mechanical effects of the active electrons and the transferring proton, as well as the motions of all atoms in the complete solvated enzyme system.

The conventional approach to ensuring adequate whirl flutter stability will not scale easily to larger tiltrotor designs. This study constitutes an investigation of several alternatives for improving tiltrotor aerolastic stability. A whirl flutter stability analysis is developed that does not rely on more complex models to determine the variations in crucial input parameters with flight condition. Variation of blade flap and lag frequency, and pitch-flap, pitch-lag, and flap-lag couplings, are calculated from physical parameters, such as blade structural flap and lag stiffness distribution (inboard or outboard of pitch bearing), collective pitch, and precone. The analysis is used to perform a study of the influence of various design parameters on whirl flutter stability. While previous studies have investigated the individual influence of various design parameters, the present investigation uses formal optimization techniques to determine a unique combination of parameters that maximizes whirl flutter stability. The optimal designs require only modest changes in the key rotor and wing design parameters to significantly increase flutter speed. When constraints on design parameters are relaxed, optimized configurations are obtained that allow large values of kinematic pitch-flap (delta-3) coupling without degrading aeroelastic stability. Larger values of delta-3 may be desirable for advanced tiltrotor configurations. An investigation of active control of wing flaperons for stability augmentation is also conducted. Both stiff and soft-inplane tiltrotor configurations are examined. Control systems that increase flutter speed and wing mode sub-critical damping are designed while observing realistic limits on flaperon deflection. The flaperon is shown to be particularly effective for increasing wing vertical bending mode damping.

Unlike design and manufacturing process development activities that generally have access to a wealth of material information, sustainability assessment activities are generally made difficult by lack of a centralized source of information to incorporate sustainability knowledge into current manufacturing life cycle strategies. Even though considerable research has been accomplished in sustainable manufacturing domain, its application to real life problems is known to be in the early stages due to complexity in information representation, model compositions, system integrations, and computation. Moreover, isolated activities of process planning within the gate-to-gate life cycle can lead to localized solutions in sustainability assessment. Integrating operation plans and process plans provides globalized sustainable and productive solutions in the manufacturing gate-to-gate life cycle.\tThis thesis, first, presents an attempt to understand these complexities for building material information model by addressing the requirements for defining a high-level material information model for sustainability that can capture this information across different life cycle stages as well as primary stakeholders.  Second, the performance of job shop manufacturing is often related to diversified activities that impact sustainability and productivity. Process and operation plans are particularly considered as the main activities that significantly impact different key performance indicators. The research proposed a systematic methodology for supporting manufacturing decision-making regarding sustainability and productivity assessment by integrating these plans.\nIn the first stage the different ways in which materials and material information influence the decision-making process were analyzed. For this purpose information modeling techniques were employed to generate manufacturing scenarios. Activity models were generated and analyzed to collect and categorize key concepts towards constructing a Materials Information Model for Sustainability. The analysis helped in identifying locations where materials factor into the decision-making process, the key information requirements that help build a material information model for sustainability. In the second stage of this research, a systematic methodology was developed for enabling the sustainability and productivity performance assessment for integrated process and operation plans at the machine cell level of manufacturing systems. Selection of processes and operations is accomplished through building a Multi-Criteria-Decision-Making formulation. This formulation enables the combined assessment of sustainability and productivity in selecting the optimum process and operation plans. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) is employed to address the problem of conflicting key performance indicators during process planning. Discrete event simulation (ArenaTM) and optimization techniques (heuristic search algorithms in OptQuest) are combined to determine the set of inputs out of a number of possible planning scenarios and their interactions that optimize system sustainability and productivity performances.

Despite the fact that the sensitivity has been the major magnetic sensor specification, the bulkiness, overall price and the power consumption of the sensors also act as important specifications for practical applications. Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) are the chip-scale actuators and sensors, which can offer very sensitive sensors that can i) operate at room temperature, ii) consume very low power iii) be manufactured in arrays iv) the overall cost is extremely cheap.\nIn this dissertation, two different MEMS magnetic sensors are proposed utilizing quartz micro-resonators. First sensor operates on quantifying the magnetoviscosity of ferrofluids. Magnetovisvosity is defined as the viscosity changes occuring at ferrofluids as a function of applied magnetic field. These viscosity changes as a function of magnetic field are detected utilizing micromachined AT-cut thickness Shear Mode Quartz arrays acting as micro-viscometers. Ferrofluids typically consist of 10 \uf020\uf0b1 3 nm iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanoparticles suspended in mineral oil. However, the high magnetic susceptibility of ferrofluid suspensions results in the modulation of the magnetoviscosity due to applied magnetic fields. These viscosity changes due to in-plane incident field shifts the at-resonance admittance characteristics of \u00b5QCR and is tracked in real time to achieve a novel magnetic sensing mechanism to detect and quantify the low frequency, low strength magnetic fields For improved sensitivity, the in-plane sensed magnetic flux density is concentrated using a high relative permeability (\u00b5r = 45000 as bulk) thin film of Metglas\u00ae (Fe85B5Si10) deposited on the resonator electrode. Furthermore, by patterning the Metglas\u00ae film in a bow-tie shape and aligned at the center of the \u00b5QCR electrode  2D vector sensing is achieved. Using these improvements, a minimum detectable field of 1.5 nT/\u221aHz at 1 Hz has been experimentally demonstrated. Furthermore, the high frequency and small amplitude shear waves are created with the Quartz resonators and the highly magnetoviscous interface is modeled. The ferrofluid is modeled as a viscous loading on the thickness-shear mode resonator via the modified Buttorworth-Van-Dyke Model. This sensor will be referred as the magnetoviscous sensor throughout the dissertation. \nSecond magnetic sensor concept also exploits micro-machined quartz resonators\u2019 admittance shifts, but the mechanism is based on the transverse force-frequency effect.  Magnetostrictive Metglas\uf0d2 thin film coated AT-cut thickness shear mode (TSM) Quartz thin plate microresonator structures are uniquely released using focused ion beam (FIB) milling. Therefore, the whole structure is able to do flexural bending due to magnetostriction induced as a result of applied magnetic field in the magnetic thin film that is elastically coupled to the quartz microresonator. As a result of transverse loading and bending, the admittance characteristics of the resonator shifts. The transverse force-frequency sensitivity as a function of azimuth angle for magnetostrictive thin film coated AT-cut thickness shear mode (TSM) quartz thin plate are experimentally tested and successfully modeled via coupling Lee\u2019s theory and magnetostrictive unimorph equations. The first device (500 x 500 x 19 \u00b5m) has been tested as the proof-of-concept device, where 1 \u00b5T at 10 Hz was measured. The latter thinner device (750 x 500 \u00b5m x 7.5 \u00b5m) is the optimized device, where the sensitivity is improved to 79 nT at 10 Hz input frequency inducing 94.5 nS of conductance shift. This corresponds to a frequency shift of \u0394f / f0 that is equal to 1.4692 x 10-9. The ultimate expected sensitivity for this system is simulated using the coupled domain analysis. According to the theoretical model, it is predicted that low nanoTesla to high picoTesla magnetic flux densities would be detected after further thickness reduction.\nTo sum up, both sensors are proposed and studied as unique MEMS sensing mechanisms. They i) are relatively low power consuming devices, ii) can be manufactured in arrays, which improves the spatial density, and iii) can both operate at room temperature. All aspects of the devices, sensing mechanisms along with the experimentations and theoretical modeling will be discussed in this dissertation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11131], "author_name_tesi": "Hatipoglu, Gokhan ", "last_name_ssi": "Hatipoglu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gokhan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Suman Datta", "Sumeet Kumar Gupta", "Nitin Samarth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Dissertation Advisor", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Chair", "Suman Datta, Committee Member", "Sumeet Kumar Gupta, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Magnetic Sensors", "Magnetostriction", "Quartz resonators"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Congressional Activism in Foreign Policy: The Case of Economic Sanctions\n", "id": "11320", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4412", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In many democracies, legislatures have increasingly been asserting their preferences in foreign policy decisions.

State and federal allocations for school districts have declined and legislation has limited the ability of Pennsylvania\u2019s school districts to generate revenue by increasing local property taxes.  At the same time, school district expenditures continue to rise creating considerable fiscal pressures.  Educational mandates and changing student enrollment patterns further exacerbate these pressures by limiting the degrees of freedom districts have to reduce expenditures in response to fiscal pressures. \nThe purpose of this study was to examine how Pennsylvania\u2019s small, rural, and low income school districts respond when faced with fiscal pressures.  Thirty-six Pennsylvania school districts simultaneously met all three of the relevant criteria and were selected for the study.  School district financial data provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) and the Pennsylvania School Boards Association (PSBA) were reviewed for the time period studied.  To enrich the analysis, a survey was designed to gather additional financial data not available from PDE or PSBA and to determine the extent of and responses to fiscal pressures being experienced by the districts.\nTotal revenues increased for the school districts studied from FY 2006 to FY 2010.  However, a more in-depth review of school district financial data revealed that several local, state, and federal funding category allocations started to reflect the impact of the nation\u2019s economic troubles toward the end of the five year period.  In 2009-10, the districts were buffered from a significant revenue decrease because of the infusion of federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding.  With the expiration of ARRA funds following the 2010-11 school year, districts experienced a substantial decrease in their recurring revenues.  \nWhen faced with fiscal pressures, the school districts in this study responded by raising local property taxes and implementing fees in order to increase revenues.  In order to reduce expenditures, they first employed numerous measures designed to achieve cost savings by improving efficiencies.  Then, when additional reductions were necessary, they made more painful program and staff cuts.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4611], "author_name_tesi": "Hatten, Jr., Norman E.", "last_name_ssi": "Hatten, Jr.", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Norman", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Hartman", "William Hartman", "Kai Arthur Schafft", "Roger C Shouse", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Hartman, Dissertation Advisor", "William Hartman, Committee Chair", "Kai Arthur Schafft, Committee Member", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fiscal pressure", "school finance", "revenues", "expenditures", "rural schools", "small schools"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Optimal Charging Protocols for LiFEPO4 Batteries via Deterministic Dynamic Programming", "id": "14476", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7248", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis developed a single state equivalent circuit model of a Lithium Iron Nanophosphate battery and applied the model with optimal control strategies to explore an optimal charging problem.

The change in distribution of liquid saturation with time revealed two different mechanisms of water transport within the DM acting in opposite directions, and the balance between these two mechanisms was investigated.

Two electricity producing SGE systems are reverse electrodialysis (RED) and capacitive mixing (CapMix). RED captures mixing energy using a series of ion exchange membranes that drive electrochemical reactions at redox electrodes. CapMix utilizes polarizable electrodes to store charge in the surfaces electric double layer (EDL). Energy generation can then occur when the EDL is expanded and compressed in different concentration solutions.\n\nThe use of themolytic salt solutions (e.g. ammonium bicarbonate\u2013AmB) within a RED system is promising, as AmB can be regenerated using low-grade waste\u2013heat (e.g. 40-60oC). One disadvantage to using AmB is the potential for gas bubbles (CO2, NH3) to form within the stack. Accumulation of bubbles can impede ion migration, and reduce system performance. The management and minimization of gaseous bubbles in RED flow fields is an important operational issue, and has not previously been addressed within RED literature. Flow field design with and without spacers in a RED stack was analyzed to determine how fluid flow and geometry effected the accumulation and removal of bubbles. In addition, the performance changes, in terms of power and resistance were measured in the presence of bubbles. Gaseous bubble accumulation was minimized using short vertically aligned channels, which resulted in a reduction in the amount of the membrane area which was restricted due to bubbles from ~20% to 7%. The stack power density improved by 12% when all gaseous bubbles were removed from the cell. \n\nAmB-RED systems can potentially produce hydrogen or electrical energy through altering the cathodic reaction. With a kinetically favorable cathodic reaction (oxygen reduction reaction), the projected electrical energy generated by a single pass AmB\u2013RED system approached 78 Wh per m\u20133 (low concentrate). However, when RED was operated with the less kinetically favorable reaction (hydrogen evolution reaction), and hydrogen gas was harvested, the energy recovered increased by as much ~1.5 times to 118 Wh m\u20133 (low concentrate). Indirect hydrogen production through coupling an RED stack with an external electrolysis system was only projected to achieve 35 Wh m\u20133 (low concentrate) or a third of that produced through direct hydrogen generation. The flexibility of the RED architecture allows for the potential for simultaneous hydrogen and electricity production, whereas competing technologies such as PRO and CapMix only produce electricity. \n\nSeveral approaches to generate electrical power using CapMix have recently been developed, but power densities have remained low. By immersing the capacitive electrodes in ionic fields generated by exoelectrogenic microorganisms in bioelectrochemical reactors, it was shown that energy capture using synthetic river and seawater could be increased ~65 times, and power generation ~46 times, when compared to controls (no ionic fields). Favorable electrochemical reactions due to microbial oxidation of organic matter, coupled to oxygen reduction at the cathode, created this ionic flow field that enabled more effective passive charging of the capacitive electrodes, and higher energy capture. This ionic-based approach is not limited to the use of river water-seawater solutions. Forced charging of the capacitive electrodes, using energy generated by the bioelectrochemical system and a thermolytic solution, further increased the maximum power density to 7 W m\u20132 (capacitive electrode). \n\nThe amount of salinity gradient energy that can be obtained through capacitive\u2013mixing based on double layer expansion (CDLE) also depends on the extent that the materials electric double layer (EDL) expands in a low concentration electrolyte (e.g. river water). I show here that the individual electrode rise potential, which is a measure of the EDL expansion process, significantly (P = 10\u20135) depends on the concentration of strong acid surface functional groups. Electrodes with a low concentration of strong acid functional groups (0.05 mmol g\u20131) resulted in a positive\u2013potential\u2013rise of dU+/\u2013 = +59 \u00b1 4 mV (dUcell = 16 \u00b1 0.7 mV) in synthetic river water, whereas activated carbons with high concentrations of strong acid groups (0.36 mmol g\u20131) produced a negative-potential-rise of dU+/\u2013 = \u201331 \u00b1 5 mV (dUcell ~\u201311 \u00b1 1 mV). Dissimilar electrodes, which coupled a negative electrode with a high concentration of strong acid groups with positive electrode with a low concentrations of strong acid groups, produced a whole cell potential rise which was 5.7 times greater than produced with similar electrodes (from 15 \u00b1 0.2 to 89 \u00b1 3 mV). Therefore, tuning the surface chemistry of known materials can be conducted through a variety of methods (oxidation, ammonia treatment, etc.) to more optimally extract energy through CapMix processes. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9920], "author_name_tesi": "Hatzell, Marta  Catherine", "last_name_ssi": "Hatzell", "middle_name_ssi": "Catherine", "first_name_ssi": "Marta ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Chao Yang Wang", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Dissertation Advisor", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Salinity Gradient Energy", "Reverse Electrodialysis", "Capacitive Mixing", "Electrochemical Conversion", "Hydrogen", "Capacitor"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Dendrochemistry: Seeing the forest through the trees", "id": "10136", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1451", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dendrochemistry is a term used to describe the compositional analysis of tree-rings and its application to biomonitoring of the tree\u2019s environment. The central hypothesis of this study is that the concentrations of silver and gold in tree-rings in the Mediterranean region record the history of African dust storms. Although there have been previous studies of tree-ring composition using both NAA and other analytical techniques, to the author\u2019s knowledge, this is the first dendrochemical study to consider the effects of dust storms on tree-ring chemistry. However, the results, as with many other dendrochemical studies, are promising at best.\n\nThe tree-ring concentrations in a single tree in west-central Turkey were highly correlated with the local aerosol index obtained from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS). This suggests that silver and gold concentrations in carefully selected trees may serve as a proxy indicator of dust storm activity and indirectly, the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation.\n\nThree other trees from the same forest did not have any silver or gold concentration peaks and possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. The correlation with dust storms is still uncertain because it was impossible to gather appropriate information about soil characteristics or additional trees for sampling to prove or disprove the hypothesis. However, the chemistries of silver and gold are discussed to elucidate why they may be uniquely good at recording environmental signals in tree-rings.\n\nSome previous dendrochemical studies indicated that tree-ring chemistries record volcanic\neruptions. Although some data were obtained in this study that support this view, the four long\n(300+ year) tree chronologies that were analyzed were not correlated with each other or with the timing of major volcanic eruptions. The concentrations in these trees were not accurately\nrecreated when they were re-analyzed for the current study. Therefore, the failure to correlate\nthe tree-ring concentrations may be the result of poor analysis methodology and contamination\nproblems early in the dendrochemistry project.\n\nSome promising results for detecting eruptions in tree-rings were obtained on tree samples of a\nshorter duration (20-30 years) from Catacik Turkey that were prepared for irradiation under\nimproved conditions of cleanliness. These tree samples were analyzed later in the project after\nsample preparation procedures were altered to reduce the possibility of sample contamination.\nConcentration peaks in the Catacik samples were correlated with the timing of the Pinatubo\neruption (1991) and the El Chichon eruption in 1982. However, many of the concentration\npeaks were in single trees and could not be verified by comparison to other trees that grew\nnearby. The relative success of correlating concentration peaks in these shorter tree sequences may have been due to the improved sample preparation procedures. Another possible\nexplanation is that concentration peaks do not remain in the tree-rings over time due to\ndiffusion or mobilization by the tree. This would make it more difficult to find or identify\npossible environmental signals in the older rings of a long tree sequence.\n\nThis study establishes a methodology for using Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) for\ndendrochemistry. In the process of analyzing more than 2200 tree-rings, in some cases using\nmultiple irradiation schedules, a range of NAA procedures and a set of tools for analyzing\ndendrochemical data were developed. During the course of the study many improvements were\nmade to the NAA procedures, including 1) reducing the possibility of sample contamination through better sample preparation, 2) refining the NAA methodology to produce more data with higher accuracy and 3) determining and minimizing the major sources of errors in the concentration data.\nUnfortunately, this study contributes to the overwhelming number of feasibility studies that\nhave been performed since the 1950s. There is still no consensus regarding the mechanisms\nresponsible for recording environmental events in tree-rings beyond passive uptake. The feasibility of dendrochemistry will be more firmly established by moving forward with thoughtfully planned control studies. The refined NAA procedures developed here are necessary for future experiments which should strive to understand the actual mechanisms responsible for uptake.\n\nThere are several different aspects of dendrochemistry that could be tested with control studies and that would be useful for interpreting tree-ring chemistry. For instance, dendrochemical\nstudies could focus on the variation in specific elements between trees and the creation of\ncomposite forest chronologies for the appropriate elements. If this was successful, it would\nindicate that tree-ring compositions faithfully record environmental conditions in some cases\nand for some elements. A possible correlation was found between the Ag and Au concentration in tree-rings and the intensity and frequency of dust storms. However, the promising results were only found for one tree out of four sampled in the Catacik forest. A future study could be dedicated to verifying the presence of the Ag and Au signals in other trees in the same forest.\nFuture studies could also analyze the ground water near sample sites to monitor the changes in\nsoluble concentrations of metals, especially silver and gold in response to dust storms.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1436], "author_name_tesi": "Hauck, Danielle Kristin", "last_name_ssi": "Hauck", "middle_name_ssi": "Kristin", "first_name_ssi": "Danielle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye", "Yousry Azmy", "Peter I Kuniholm", "Sturt W Manning", "Jack Brenizer Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu, Committee Chair", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye, Committee Member", "Yousry Azmy, Committee Member", "Peter I Kuniholm, Committee Member", "Sturt W Manning, Committee Member", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["trace elements", "eruptions", "tree rings", "neutron activation analysis", "dendrochemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Advancing Digital Design Through Openly Available Digital Human Models", "id": "22624", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10163", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The consideration of human factors such as anthropometry, fit, reach, strength, and others through Digital Human Models (DHMs) can lead to reduced development time and cost and ultimately improve interaction between humans and their environment.

It forms part of an attempt to construct a formalized general theory of neural networks in the setting of algebraic and Riemannian geometry. Geometry allows for a rigorous formulation, and therefore understanding, of neural networks as they act on data manifolds, which is certainly of great importance as these tools become ubiquitous in engineering applications. From this perspective, the following theoretical results are developed and proven for feedforward networks. First it is shown that residual neural networks are finite difference approximations to dynamical systems of first order differential equations, as opposed to ordinary networks that are static. This implies that the network is learning systems of differential equations governing the coordinate transformations that represent the data. Second it is shown that a closed form solution of the metric tensor on the underlying data manifold can be found by backpropagating the coordinate representation through the neural network. This is formulated in a formal abstract sense as a sequence of pullback Lie group actions on the metric fibre space in the principal and associated bundles on the data manifold, where backpropagation is shown to be the pullback of tensor bundles. A model based on perturbation theory is developed as well, and used to understand how neural networks treat testing data differently than they do training data.\n\nThe second part of this dissertation makes use of neural networks for forecasting probability distributions of time series in terms of discrete symbols that are quantized from real-valued data. The developed framework formulates the forecasting problem into a probabilistic paradigm of forecasting densities over symbols. The main advantage of formulating probabilistic forecasting in the symbolic setting is that density predictions are obtained without any significantly restrictive assumptions, such as second order statistics.

This dissertation uses a combination of laboratory experiments, field work, and modeling to study weathering rates under conditions relevant to early Earth and Mars.  \nBasalt weathering profiles have been characterized in arctic Mars analog Svalbard (Norway).  Modeling of basalt weathering in Svalbard is used to groundtruth the reactive transport model CrunchFlow, which is then used to interpret observed alteration on the surface of Mars.  Mineral dissolution as a function of time and pH is compared in terrestrial environments, and then extrapolated to the surface of Mars.  In compiled terrestrial environments, mineral persistence times are approximately:  olivine (~10 ka), glass (~250 ka), pyroxene (~1Ma), and plagioclase (~5Ma).    \nReconnaissance batch experiments were performed to test the dissolution rates of basalt glass and olivine under conditions specifically designed to be relevant to Mars:  low temperature, low pH, high ionic strength and oxic and anoxic atmospheres.

To fabricate an MAE, a magnetic material is dispersed in an elastomer matrix.  Typically a hard magnetic ferrite is used in conjunction with a silicone elastomer. To create a magnetically aligned MAE, the hard magnetic material is mixed in the elastomer solution, then cured in a strong external magnetic field causing particle alignment. Past research has shown that higher magnetic remanence is desirable to increase MAE actuation and produce the most magnetic work.  A high degree of alignment of magnetic particles is expected to result in improved remanence. However, in MAEs with soft magnetic particles cured in a field, past research has shown that the degree of alignment, vs. less ordered clustering, varies with particulate volume content. Consequently, it is important to study the degree to which volume content of magnetic material affects physical particle alignment, bulk magnetic properties, and the coupling between the two in MAEs with hard magnetic filler particles. \nIn this work the physical particle alignment of MAEs fabricated using barium hexaferrite (BaM) as the filler material, Sylgard 184 as the matrix material, and with varying particle concentration of 5 - 30% by volume were estimated using data obtained from x-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM).  To date, studies on MAEs have not yet linked the physical assessment of x-ray diffraction techniques to the magnetic assessment of vibrating sample magnetometry to determine the effects of increase magnetic particle volume fraction on magnetization and alignment as this study proposes. \nThe results of the collected experimental data were analytically classified using assumed Gaussian orientation distribution functions of the magnetic domains determined from VSM and a measure of the degree of orientation of physical crystallites based on the March parameter determined from XRD. Results and analysis of the XRD data showed the degree of physical alignment of BaM in MAEs varies with volume content of magnetic material. The trends in the data suggest poled samples of each volume fraction had significant growth in preferred alignment beyond their unpoled counterparts; the lowest degree of preferred alignment occurred in the 15% by volume samples, an intermediate value. Although 15% by volume showed the lowest degree of preferred alignment among poled batches, the calculated alignment parameter for this volume fraction was still at least 196.1% higher than unpoled samples with the same volume content. \nAs volume fraction increased or decreased away from 15% by volume, physical particle alignment, estimated from XRD data, increased with a more significant increase for decreasing volume fractions. The lowest volume fraction tested, 5% by volume, showed the highest degree of preferred alignment with a calculated alignment parameter 125% above the local minimum at 15%.  The highest volume fraction tested, 30% by volume, also showed a heightened degree of preferred alignment with the calculated alignment parameter 74.8% above the local minimum at 15%.  \nThe ratio of magnetic remanence to magnetic saturation was used to calculate a width of an assumed magnetic orientation distribution function for all poled samples, showing that low volume fractions have a more narrow distribution of magnetic domains. As volume fraction increased, the distribution parameter also increased and approached a constant value. The 5% by volume samples showed the lowest distribution parameter, 40.2% lower than the average determined for higher volume fractions. A smaller distribution parameter indicates magnetic domains form a more narrow distribution about the direction of poling. This distribution parameter was also compared to the normalized remanent magnetization of each volume fraction. The results showed a linear relationship; as the normalized remanent magnetization increased the distribution parameter decreased proportionally. Comparing the calculated physical crystallite orientation parameter to the magnetic orientation parameter showed similar general trends between microscale particle alignment and bulk magnetic properties in an MAE, where the parameters were monotonic with each other but with a nonlinear relationship.\nResults of normalized remanent magnetization values across volume fractions suggest there is no increased benefit in bulk magnetization per unit magnetic material by adding more BaM in MAEs. In other words, the results of this study show the efficiency, or the ratio of normalized remanent magnetization to normalized saturation magnetization of a sample, of MAE performance using BaM as a filler material cannot be increased by altering the volume content of the magnetic filler. Although the degree of particle alignment of BaM particles may increase for known volume fractions, the remanent magnetization per unit volume of magnetic material, which is directly related to the work produced by an MAE, remains fairly constant for each volume fraction tested. This indicates the work produced per volume of magnetic material of an MAE cannot be increased by changing the volume content of filler in the material. All volume fractions tested (5%-30% by volume) will produce the same net work per unit volume fraction. Therefore, as MAE applications are designed and scaled larger or smaller the volume content of magnetic filler must also be scaled accordingly. This study is a necessary step toward increasing the efficiency and optimizing the performance of future MAEs as developing means of assessing particle and magnetic alignment relationships. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12392], "author_name_tesi": "Haussener, Tyler Kress", "last_name_ssi": "Haussener", "middle_name_ssi": "Kress", "first_name_ssi": "Tyler", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paris R Vonlockette", "Zoubeida Ounaies", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paris R Vonlockette, Thesis Advisor", "Zoubeida Ounaies, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Barium Ferrite", "X-ray Diffraction", "Magneto-active elastomers", "Vibrating Sample Magnetometry", "Magneto-rheological elastomers", "Magnetic Materials"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Fatherhood and Father Involvement Across the Life Course: Differing Effects on the Quality of Men's Lives\n", "id": "7151", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1520", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The effects of fatherhood and father involvement on the quality of men\u2019s lives have been relatively neglected areas of family research. Utilizing a life course framework and a nationally representative sample of men drawn from the first two waves of the National Survey of Families and Households, this study demonstrates that fatherhood status, the transition to fatherhood, and father involvement have both positive and negative effects on the quality of men\u2019s lives. The quality of life is assessed by multiple dimensions of well-being, social involvement, work behavior, and marital quality. Among all father types (resident biological father, stepfather, nonresident father, and father of adult children), resident fathers differ the most on quality of life outcomes compared to men without children, and nonresident fathers are most similar to childless men. The transition to fatherhood is negatively related to changes in the quality of men\u2019s lives, specifically psychological well-being and marital happiness. Although the multiple dimensions of paternal involvement (availability, engagement, and affection) have differing effects on some outcomes, involved fathering is generally positively related to the quality of men\u2019s lives. An examination of the reciprocal relationship between father engagement and men\u2019s outcomes suggests that father involvement is the cause rather than the consequence of several aspects of the quality of men\u2019s lives. A number of life course factors moderate the relationship between fatherhood and men\u2019s outcomes, although the majority of aspects of the quality of life are not conditioned by characteristics of fathers or their families, suggesting that fatherhood is a universal experience that affects men in a similar fashion across a variety of life course and social positions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1505], "author_name_tesi": "Hawkins, Daniel Nathan", "last_name_ssi": "Hawkins", "middle_name_ssi": "Nathan", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan Booth", "Paul Amato", "Valarie Elizabeth King", "David Eggebeen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan Booth, Committee Chair", "Paul Amato, Committee Member", "Valarie Elizabeth King, Committee Member", "David Eggebeen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["life course", "parenting", "father involvement", "fatherhood", "quality of life"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "QUANTIZATION OF MULTIPLY CONNECTED MANIFOLDS\n", "id": "6023", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1785", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-08-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I propose that integrality obstructions to geometric quantization can be circumvented\nfor some compact Kaehler manifolds by passing to the universal covering\nspace.

A nonstationary label only identifies an absence of static properties and does not define the nature of nonstationarity. A universally-accepted methodology for analysis of underwater ambient sound does not exist. Because the distribution of underwater ambient sound does not always follow a Gaussian structure and is nonstationary in time, analysis over an extended period is required to accurately characterize the data. In examining long time series, large fluctuations in the ambient sound level caused by the variable duration of transient sounds create a need to determine the optimal sampling window based on a robust statistical analysis of variability. Failure to do so can lead to inaccurate representations of the actual ambient sound level.\n\nUtilizing data from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban-Treaty International Monitoring System (CTBT IMS) at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, the temporal variation in ambient sound was examined over multiple time scales and sampling intervals. Periodicity and geographical region of sources were also examined. The data were analyzed using various window lengths and subsampling, or using data at specifically defined intervals, to determine the dependence of the characterization on sampling protocol. Detection of periodicity with subsampling was also examined.\n\nResults indicated significant differences for both the varying window lengths and varying subsampling intervals in the 1-110 Hz range.

This show was notable for acquainting the New York School with the medium as its artists would go on to embrace collage, creating objects that ranged from small compositions of handmade paper to mural-sized works of torn and reassembled canvas. Despite the significance of this development, art historians consistently overlook collage during the era of Abstract Expressionism. This project examines four artists who based significant portions of their oeuvre on papier coll\u00e9 during this period (i.e. the late 1940s and early 1950s): Lee Krasner, Robert Motherwell, Anne Ryan, and Esteban Vicente. Working primarily with fine art materials in an abstract manner, these artists challenged many of the characteristics that supposedly typified collage: its appropriative tactics, disjointed aesthetics, and abandonment of \u201chigh\u201d culture. Although many of their contemporaries focused on the formal attributes of the cut and paste, Krasner, Motherwell, Ryan, and Vicente explored the semiotic potential and metaphoric implications of the medium. Their approach to collage overlapped in several ways\u2014for example their nonobjective styles, autobiographical mapping of identity, political resonance, and preference for papier coll\u00e9\u2014yet a great variety defines their work. Anne Ryan juxtaposed traditional formats with recycled materials, eschewing the conventions of consumerism and femininity available in the postwar years. The hybrid nature of collage appealed to Esteban Vicente, a Spanish-American artist who mined the duality of his cultural inheritance for syncretic constructions. The critical language of the pastoral affords an opportunity to reconsider Lee Krasner\u2019s work in collage because it features many rhetorical devices of the bucolic tradition, including irony and dialectics, in addition to the contingency, naturalism, and escapist reverie that characterize the genre. And finally, Robert Motherwell executed an abstract tribute to composer John Cage on a large scale, conflating music with collage while testing notions of composition and historicism. Hardly the apolitical or clich\u00e9d medium that critics deemphasized at mid-century, collage offered unlimited possibilities in the era of Abstract Expressionism, ranging from the formal and the aesthetic to the social and the political.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1455], "author_name_tesi": "Haxall, Daniel Louis", "last_name_ssi": "Haxall", "middle_name_ssi": "Louis", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah K Rich", "Sarah K Rich", "Leo G Mazow", "Joyce Henri Robinson", "Adam Rome"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah K Rich, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarah K Rich, Committee Chair", "Leo G Mazow, Committee Member", "Joyce Henri Robinson, Committee Member", "Adam Rome, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Anne Ryan", "Robert Motherwell", "Lee Krasner", "Abstract Expressionism", "collage", "Esteban Vicente", "John Cage"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A Global Analysis of the Atmospheric Available Energy and its Trends", "id": "22773", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9988", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The available energy is the sum of the internal and potential energies relative to an isothermal and hydrostatic equilibrium atmosphere. It includes both baroclinic and convective contributions. The method used to determine the equilibrium atmosphere is general and includes contributions due to terrain, dry air, water vapor, and hydrometeors. The available energy of the atmosphere is calculated using monthly mean ECMWF ERA-Interim data from 1979 to 2012. The analysis is done for water vapor and dry air only, but the effects of hydrometeors are estimated. The effect of using a single climatological equilibrium temperature or allowing it to vary is demonstrated. \n\nThe trends in the global available energy as well as in the global available energies of dry air and water vapor are examined in terms of annual and seasonal means. The geographical and vertical distribution of the available energy and the trends are also examined in terms of column integrals, zonal means, and tropical means. The available energy is also linearized to determine the available elastic and available potential contributions. Finally, the available energy is compared to traditional measures of available potential energy (e.g., the available potential energy of Lorenz, the convective available potential energy) and potential and kinetic energies.\n\nGlobally, the dry air component accounts for approximately 80% of the available energy, with the rest being made up of that of water vapor. The analysis indicates that the global available energy of the atmosphere has been increasing over the period analyzed. Geographically, the largest values of available energy are near the surface in the tropics coincident with the highest sea surface temperatures and the equatorial rainforests, at the tropopause and in the upper stratosphere. Trends vary geographically and seasonally, though a common feature indicates that the Walker circulation is increasing in strength.\n\nUsing a single equilibrium temperature found for that month, the available energy is calculated each six hours during the March 1993 \u201cstorm of the century\u201d to evaluate the evolution of available energy in a mid-latitude cyclone. The cyclone modifies the mean available energy field up to 200 hPa, and depletes it near the center of the storm.

In the decade after the war, formerly enslaved southern African Americans moved North; women and girls faced poverty and incarceration while faced with severely limited economic opportunities and even fewer public resources. For these women, physical survival was the first \u201cfreedom struggle.\u201d Wealthier women whose families could provide access to education became a vital part of private and religious benevolent work that supported the poor.

The onset of stall both limits the envelope as well as significantly increases the power requirement.  The ability to generate additional lift can reduce the power requirement and expand the envelope.  One approach to generating higher lift is through chord extension morphing of sections of the main rotor blade.\n\nThis study presents a mechanism for increasing the blade chord by extending a flat plate through a slit in the trailing edge.  In order to minimize the structural impact on the blade, the device was constrained to be aft of the spar.  In view of the available space constraints, the mechanism consists of a single linkage which transforms spanwise actuation output into chordwise displacement.   The study has considered both electromechanical and pneumatic actuation methods.  As with any morphing rotor technology, the system must be able to operate within the high-g environment present in a helicopter blade.  The current prototypes have been spin tested on the Pennsylvania State University\u2019s Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand (AERTS).  The test section  for each prototype used a 16 in chord NACA 0015 airfoil with an 11.5 in span.  The goal of the spin test was to show successful actuation of the design under the centrifugal acceleration present in a UH-60 helicopter blade at 73% rotor radius.\n\nThe electromechanically actuated extendable chord system was able to achieve 1.3 in of chordwise extension (8.13 % chord extension) at a maximum rotational speed of 385 RPM.  The corresponding centrifugal acceleration of 210 g\u2019s is approximately 47% of the full-scale loading.  The system was ultimately limited by the capabilities of the commercially available off-the-shelf electromechanical actuator.  Under these conditions, the electromechanical motor required 40W of power.\n\nThe pneumatically actuated system was able to provide 1.9 in of chordwise extension (11.88% chord extension).  With the pressure limited to 105 psi using the AERTS facility, the system was only able to operate successfully up to 315 RPM, or at 32% of full-scale centrifugal acceleration.  The experimental result showed good correlation with the numerical simulation.  The analysis also showed that by balancing the chordwise and spanwise forces, actuation requirements can be dramatically reduced in subsequent designs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7649], "author_name_tesi": "Hayden, Eric William", "last_name_ssi": "Hayden", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["aerospace", "helicopter", "morphing", "rotor", "chord", "extension", "design", "test"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTION OF THE EXTRACYTOPLASMIC FUNCTION SIGMA FACTOR &#963;E IN ESCHERICHIA COLI", "id": "10680", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2619", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "All organisms encounter many challenges from their environment.  A cell must first sense a stress, transduce information about the stress to other cellular compartments, and mount an appropriate response.  Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, have two cellular compartments: the cytoplasm and the cell envelope.  The cell envelope is composed of the outer membrane, the inner membrane, and a thin layer of peptidoglycan, which lies in the space between the membranes, called the periplasmic space.  Cellular functions must be coordinated between the cytoplasm and the cell envelope, and when stress is sensed in the cell envelope, a signal must be transduced across the inner membrane in order for an appropriate response to be elicited in the cytoplasm.  \nOne cell envelope stress response is mediated by the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor, &#963;E.  Sigma factors are responsible for binding to and directing RNA polymerase to particular promoters.  Various alternative sigma factors are upregulated after a stress is sensed, such that transcription can be redirected and the cell can better respond to the stress.  &#963;E is held inactive by its anti-sigma, the inner membrane protein RseA, and is also negatively regulated by the periplasmic protein RseB.  Stresses that result in unfolded outer membrane proteins in the cell envelope activate proteolysis of RseA, freeing &#963;E to bind RNA polymerase.  &#963;E is known to regulate an array of genes that help the cell respond to stress, such as periplasmic chaperones and foldases.  &#963;E also regulates genes involved in outer membrane protein and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and assembly.  These genes are crucial for rebuilding the cell envelope after a stress is encountered, but must also be properly regulated during non-stress conditions.  The gene for &#963;E, rpoE, is essential; although the role of &#963;E in cell envelope stress response is well-understood, it is unclear why &#963;E is required for viability in E. coli.\nWe addressed the question of the requirement for &#963;E by determining the effects of its inhibition.  Cells with inhibited &#963;E activity show increased levels of other cell envelope stress responses and morphological defects, called cell envelope blebs; inhibition of &#963;E activity caused eventual cell lysis.  Using a genetic selection, we isolated two multicopy suppressors of the need for &#963;E; ptsN and yhbW.  We further explored the role of these previously poorly understood genes to determine the mechanism of suppression of the essentiality of &#963;E.  Overexpression of ptsN and yhbW lowers basal cell envelope stress responses and suppresses defects caused by disruptions in the flux of outer membrane proteins to the cell envelope.  By determining the effects of inhibiting &#963;E activity and isolating multicopy suppressors of lethality due to the lack of &#963;E, we have expanded understanding of the essential function of &#963;E in cell envelope maintenance.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2612], "author_name_tesi": "Hayden, Jennifer Diane", "last_name_ssi": "Hayden", "middle_name_ssi": "Diane", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Ellen Ades", "Sarah Ellen Ades", "Jean Elnora Brenchley", "Kenneth Charles Keiler", "B Tracy Nixon", "Edward G Dudley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Ellen Ades, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarah Ellen Ades, Committee Chair", "Jean Elnora Brenchley, Committee Member", "Kenneth Charles Keiler, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sigmaE", "bacterial physiology", "phosphotransferase system"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Social Life of Soil", "id": "26875", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10655", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soil health is emerging as a national and international priority, with the United Nations declaring 2015 as the International Year of Soil.

The purpose of this dissertation is to understand the influences on farmers\u2019 soil management decisions and in turn what those decisions do to support or constrain soil health across the Chesapeake Bay watershed. \n\nQualitative inquiry guided by Actor-Network Theory (ANT) supports the generation of data. ANT is apt because it insists on the influence of non-human actors, such as landscape, wildlife and machinery. Four purposefully diverse, grain-producing farms located across the watershed formed the core cases that inform the findings. Forty-seven farmers and related agricultural specialists participated in interviews, farm walks, participatory photography and focus groups from which data were generated. These qualitative techniques were complemented by soil health lab analyses. \n\nFindings include four case studies describing the soil health actor-networks on the core farms. Each case\u2019s actor-network is given a descriptive label: Observation, Experimentation, Innovation, and Privilege. Patterns that emerge from the case data reveal ten categories of influence on the key soil-health affecting practices of tillage, rotation, and amendments. These categories of influence are: worldview; farming norms; learning; policy; labor; technology; crops; landscape & soil; manure; and the farming system. \n\nThree main conclusions are drawn from the findings. First, to foster soil health there must be an explicit goal of soil health at the farm or policy scales and this goal must be supported by networks that value farmer knowledge, on-farm observation, experimentation and innovation. Second, the proliferation of influences on tillage, amendment and rotation practices means that there are ample opportunities to shift actor-networks to support soil health. And, finally, research, or interventions, that focus on the adoption of specific practices belies the specificity of whole farm cases. These conclusions have real-world implications that cluster around designing policy and research from an interdisciplinary, participatory perspective with the explicit goal of supporting agricultural soil health by working with farmers rather than on or for farmers. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10287], "author_name_tesi": "Hayden, Jennifer Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Hayden", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "Cynthia Clare Hinrichs", "Leland Luther Glenna", "Mary Ellen Barbercheck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Dissertation Advisor", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Chair", "Cynthia Clare Hinrichs, Committee Member", "Leland Luther Glenna, Committee Member", "Mary Ellen Barbercheck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Soil Health", "Agriculture", "U.S.", "Chesapeake Bay", "Qualitative", "Focus Groups", "Case Study", "Policy", "Actor Network Theory", "Geography"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "A Detailed Investigation of the Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer Related to Injection from a Compound Angled Shaped Film Cooling Hole", "id": "14999seh5130", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14999", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Gas turbines are used around the world to provide thrust for airplanes and to generate electricity.

One such cooling method is shaped film cooling, which ejects low momentum coolant with the goal of it staying attached to the wall, spreading laterally, and providing a lower driving temperature for convection.\nIn some film cooling manufacturing processes, the meter and diffuser are created in separate steps with separate machines, and an offset can occur in that process.

All offset directions caused a detriment to film cooling performance, except for the fore offset, which improved adiabatic effectiveness relative to a no offset case.  CFD helped show that the fore offset created a separation in the region of the film cooling metering section where jetting occurs, which decreased the high momentum and made the cooling jet more likely to remain attached to the surface.  This study resulted in a patent.\n\tA large range of area ratios and blowing ratios were examined in a study designed to isolate the effect of area ratio by lengthening the diffuser of a shaped hole.  Very high area ratios were generated that resulted in significant cooling potential.  It was shown that at each area ratio there is an optimal blowing ratio beyond which the effectiveness will decrease or plateau.  This was reduced to an optimal effective blowing ratio, M/AR, which was shown through CFD to be the condition when the coolant jet core has similar velocity magnitude to the mainstream flow.  This results in a weak shear layer and a weak counter-rotating vortex pair.\n\tIn an axially oriented hole, the mainstream flows over the top of a cooling jet and around the sides, in equal measure, creating a symmetric flowfield.  In a compound angled shaped hole, the mainstream flows primarily around the leeward side, creating a strong shear layer and an asymmetric streamwise vortex.  Compound angled shaped holes are used commonly in gas turbines, but there has been no work examining the adiabatic effectiveness and heat transfer coefficient augmentation at a range of compound angles, and there are no flowfield measurements.  A comprehensive study of the flowfield, cooling effectiveness, and heat transfer coefficient were obtained for compound angled shaped holes for compound angles ranging from 0\u00b0-60\u00b0 in 15\u00b0 increments.  It is shown that asymmetry and vorticity magnitude increase with increasing compound angle and increasing blowing ratio.  Holes with high compound angles can maintain jet attachment at high blowing ratios because the streamwise component of blowing ratio is reduced, which leads to high effectiveness.  \nThe most important contribution of this work was showing that the streamwise vortex increases heat transfer coefficient in a region adjacent to the jet, where very little coolant coverage exists.  For this reason, compound angled shaped holes can cause local regions of increased heat flux relative to an uncooled surface, which may be an issue for some designs if not properly accounted for.  Heat transfer coefficient augmentation increases as compound angle and blowing ratio increase.  Designs that promote jet interaction, such as holes with a smaller pitchwise spacing or holes with significant lateral motion, cover the entire endwall in coolant and lessen the negative effects of high heat transfer coefficient augmentation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16740], "author_name_tesi": "Haydt, Shane Elliott", "last_name_ssi": "Haydt", "middle_name_ssi": "Elliott", "first_name_ssi": "Shane", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen P Lynch", "Karen Ann Thole", "Jacqueline Antonia O'Connor", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Robert Francis Kunz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen P Lynch, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Chair", "Jacqueline Antonia O'Connor, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Robert Francis Kunz, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["film cooling", "heat transfer", "fluid dynamics", "gas turbines", "turbomachinery", "heat transfer augmentation", "particle image velocimetry", "ir thermography"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "USING TRANSFORMATIVE LEARNING AS A FRAMEWORK TO EXPLORE WOMEN AND RUNNING\n\n", "id": "12074", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1489", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This qualitative narrative inquiry explored women&#8223;s self-perceptions changed through regular participation in running.

(Cucurbitaceae) and identify factors that influence the severity of inbreeding depression.  In the first study, I compared the magnitude of inbreeding depression within male and female functions at an intermediate level of inbreeding.  I found that male and female functions respond independently to inbreeding, and that there was a slight tendency for inbreeding depression to be more severe for female function than for male function, implying that estimates of inbreeding depression based solely on female fitness traits might be misleading.\n\n\n     In the second study, I examined the relationship between coefficient of inbreeding (f) and fitness across a range of f for both male and female fitness.  Fitness declined linearly with f for most traits, suggesting a simple additive among-locus genetic model for inbreeding depression in C. pepo ssp. texana and modest purging of deleterious recessives.\n\n\n     In the third study, I grew inbred and outcrossed plants under high and low nitrogen conditions to examine the effect of environmental stress on the magnitude of inbreeding depression.  I found that differences among inbred and outcrossed individuals were more pronounced under the more stressful low nitrogen conditions.  I also found evidence of fluctuating asymmetry for leaf shape among inbred plants, suggesting that inbreeding reduces developmental stability in C. pepo ssp. texana.\n\n\n     In the final study, I examined the relationship between inbreeding and herbivory by diabroticite beetles.  Beetles preferentially attacked inbred plants and damaged a larger proportion of the leaves on inbred plants, reducing the resources available for growth and reproduction.  When inbred plants were sprayed with pesticides, they had higher fitness and less severe inbreeding depression than untreated control plants, although the increase in female fitness was more pronounced than in male fitness.\n\n\n     I conclude that the magnitude of inbreeding depression is not a fixed property of an individual with a particular coefficient of inbreeding but rather a function of the severity of the environment in which the individual grows and matures.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1088], "author_name_tesi": "Hayes, Clair Nelson", "last_name_ssi": "Hayes", "middle_name_ssi": "Nelson", "first_name_ssi": "Clair", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew George Stephenson", "James Alan Winsor", "Hong Ma", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Chair", "James Alan Winsor, Committee Member", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["inbreeding", "inbreeding depression", "mating systems", "Cucurbita", "pollen", "male function"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Micrototal Analysis System For Enzymatic Drug Metabolism and Analysis", "id": "6265", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1421", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-01-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this thesis was to develop a laser based, matrix free, desorption and ionization mass spectrometry technique in a microscale array format that would have immediate application for drug and drug metabolite studies.

How this deformation is expressed reflects both present-day plate configurations and how plate boundaries evolve. To understand the behavior of plate boundaries, we must study how they have developed. The advances made in seismology over the past fifty years \u2013 both in observation and application - provide tools ideal for such analysis. Here, I use these tools to investigate the tectonic evolution of complex plate boundaries. I focus on two areas that have experienced geologically recent plate tectonic variations \u2013 the Mendocino triple junction in northern California, and the Australia:Pacific plate boundary south of New Zealand. In northern California, the northward migration of the Mendocino triple junction over the past ~10Ma has driven a synchronous pattern of thickening and thinning of North American crust. In studying this deformation I find major thinning is localized to a narrow region of crust in the Redwood Valley area. This thinning is accompanied by a steeply dipping Moho (>15\u00b0), and by high Poisson\u2019s Ratio\u2019s in the lower crust, characteristic of layers of melt. These melts may link to shallow (~10km) dike injections that drive a migrating sequence of seismicity in the shallow crust near Lake Pillsbury. The limited data sets available led me to develop new tools in receiver function and crustal velocity ratio analyses that significantly improve our ability to resolve spatial changes in crustal properties. The application of these techniques forms a second major aspect of this thesis. Finally, I analyze the deformation of Australian lithosphere adjacent to the plate boundary south of New Zealand. I perform earthquake relocations on the distribution of intra- and inter-plate seismicity, and combined with plate reconstructions since the late Oligocene show that deformation occurs over a ~150km wide area west of the current plate boundary. This may be related to resistance to subduction of the Australian Plate at the Puysegur Trench further north. Persistence of this stress transfer may lead to a southward jump in the subduction zone and a capturing of this lithospheric block by the Pacific Plate.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2067], "author_name_tesi": "Hayes, Gavin P.", "last_name_ssi": "Hayes", "middle_name_ssi": "P.", "first_name_ssi": "Gavin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin Patrick Furlong", "Charles James Ammon", "Robert George Crane", "Donald Myron Fisher", "Chris J Marone"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin Patrick Furlong, Committee Chair", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Robert George Crane, Committee Member", "Donald Myron Fisher, Committee Member", "Chris J Marone, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["velocity ratio", "tectonics", "Macquarie Ridge", "receiver functions", "seismology", "Mendocino triple junction", "plate reconstructions", "dike injection"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Mesoscale Fabrication and Design", "id": "11717", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2087", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-01-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A strong link between mechanical engineering design and materials science and engineering fabrication can facilitate an effective and adaptable prototyping process.  In this dissertation, new developments in the lost mold-rapid infiltration forming (LM-RIF) process is presented which demonstrates the relationship between these two fields of engineering in the context of two device applications.  Within the LM-RIF process, changes in materials processing and mechanical design are updated iteratively, often aided by statistical design of experiments (DOE).  This approach allows fast and reliable prototyping of devices that are not readily manufacturable with tradition techniques.\nThe first of these device applications is a new surgical instrument designed for natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery procedures (NOTES).  NOTES aims to eliminate external incisions during surgery by performing surgical procedures using an endoscope inserted into the body via a natural orifice (e.g., the mouth).  Therefore, surgical instruments used in NOTES procedures must be used through the working channel of the endoscope; typically 2-6mm in diameter.  The instrument designed and fabricated herein has length dimensions on the millimeter scale with small features on the micron scale making it ideally suited to be fabricated via the LM-RIF process.  \nThe second device application explored is a high stiffness, large elastic deformation, cellular structure.  These cellular contact aided compliant mechanisms (C3M), find application in aviation, as morphing technology in aircraft wings has been proven to increase flight efficiency as well as improve maneuverability.  The high stiffness and high elastic strain of a material consisting of a large number of small C3M cells can facilitate morphing in aircraft structures.  While large arrays of C3M devices can be meters in scale, single cells have length scales on the millimeter scale and thickness and features on the micron scale making them suitable for fabrication with the LM-RIF process.\nThe LM-RIF process was originally developed by Antolino and Hayes et al to fabricate mesoscale components.  In this dissertation the focus is on advancements in the process and underlying science.  The presented advancements to the LM-RIF process include an augmented lithography procedure, the incorporation of engineered aqueous and non-aqueous colloidal suspensions, an assessment of constrained drying forces during LM-RIF processing, mechanical property evaluation, and finally prototype testing and validation.  Specifically, the molding procedure within the LM-RIF process is capable of producing molds with thickness upwards of 1mm, as well as multi-layering to create three dimensional structures.   Increasing the mold thickness leads to an increase in the smallest feature resolvable; however, the increase in mold thickness and three dimensional capability has expanded the mechanical design space.  \nTetragonally stabilized zirconia (3Y-TZP) is an ideal material for mesoscale instruments, as it is biocompatible, exhibits high strength, and is chemically stable.  In this work, aqueous colloidal suspensions were formulated with two new gel-binder systems, increasing final NOTES instrument yield from 0% to upwards of 40% in the best case scenario.  The effects of the gel-binder system on the rheological behavior of the suspension along with the thermal characteristics of the gel-binder system were characterized.  Finally, mechanical properties of ceramic specimens were obtained via 3-point bend testing. \nOne of the main yield limiting steps in mesoscale instrument fabrication via the LM-RIF process is cracking during drying.  New one dimensional and three dimensional drying models were developed for the system.  Within the analysis, drying time, drying stress, and constrained drying stress are calculated and a comparison is made between the geometric design and the state of constrained drying stress.  NOTES instruments with a filleted connection between segments show a higher final yield and a lower constrained drying stress than those with angular segment joints.\nAnother candidate material for NOTES devices as well as C3M devices is 300 series stainless steel (300 series stainless steel).  300 series stainless steel is a common biocompatible material; it is used in surgical applications, exhibits a high corrosion resistance, and has high strength to failure.  New, high solids loading, non-aqueous colloidal suspensions of 300 series stainless steel were formulated and incorporated into the LM-RIF process.  The rheological behavior and thermal characteristics of the non-aqueous colloidal suspensions were analyzed and engineered to operate within the LM-RIF process.  Final part yield with the non-aqueous colloidal suspensions was higher than that of the aqueous ceramic suspensions.  Mechanical properties of 300 series stainless steel specimens were determined via 3-point bend testing. \nFurthermore, new composite non-aqueous colloidal suspensions of 3Y-TZP and 300 series stainless steel were formulated and incorporated into the LM-RIF process.  The composite materials showed an increase in final part yield, and an increase in yield strength compared to pure 300 series stainless steel was determined by Vickers hardness testing.  The successful incorporation of composite suspensions in the LM-RIF process was facilitated through an analysis of the rheological behavior as a function of solids loading and ceramic to metal ratio.\nOptimized designs of NOTES instruments, as well as C3M devices were manufactured using the LM-RIF process with the non-aqueous 300 series stainless steel suspension.  The performance of the prototype NOTES instruments was evaluated and compared against the theoretically predicted performance results, showing good agreement.  Similarly, good agreement was seen between the stress-displacement behavior of prototype C3M devices when compared to the theoretically calculated stress-displacement results.  Finally, in a comparison by endoscopic surgeons at Hershey Medical Center between an existing industry standard endoscopic device and the mesoscale instrument prototypes fabricated via the LM-RIF process, the prototype design performed favorably in almost all categories.  \nIn this dissertation, advancements to the LM-RIF process are presented outlining an improved meso-scale fabrication process capable of producing large arrays of millimeter scale parts with micron scale resolution.  The formulation of new aqueous binder systems and non-aqueous binder systems was completed for the 3Y-TZP and 300 series stainless steel material systems, respectively.  A theoretical analysis of constrained drying within the LM-RIF was completed with results influencing the topology of the devices being fabricated.  Finally, prototype NOTES instruments and C3M devices were tested and showed good agreement when compared with theoretical performance calculations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2069], "author_name_tesi": "Hayes, Gregory Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Hayes", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair", "James Hansell Adair", "Mary I Frecker", "Christopher L Muhlstein", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Harriet Black Nembhard", "Donald Albert Koss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair, Dissertation Advisor", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Chair", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Chair", "Christopher L Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Committee Member", "Donald Albert Koss, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["colloidal processing", "powder processing", "drying", "microfabrication", "mesoscale fabrication", "colloidal chemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Role of Facebook in the Formation of Romantic Relationships Among College Students", "id": "16207", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8232", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Taking together several recent trends including the rise in the number of young people attending college and delaying family formation processes, the decline of traditional modes of relationship formation, and the proliferation of internet technologies and online social networks on college campuses, it stands to reason that many young adults may turn to the internet as a means for facilitating the process of finding partners.

In this project, I conduct both descriptive and analytical investigations of the longitudinal data from two cohorts of nationally representative National Longitudinal Survey of Youths (1979 and 1997 cohorts). First, using both cohorts of the NLSY, I investigate several sociodemographic factors that are hypothesized to predict the length of time women spend out of work following their first births. My findings indicate that women\u2019s postpartum employment break duration is stratified by education and income at first birth. Women with the greatest pre-birth SES have the shortest breaks, and women who are most disadvantaged at first birth have both short breaks and very long breaks.

There is a zero-tolerance policy for the presence of L. monocytogenes in RTE foods and many food recalls are due to the presence of this pathogen.

Transmission electron microscopy and other experiments showed that the cell wall and cell membrane of L. monocytogenes may not be affected by HPP.  The effects of growth phase (exponential, late-exponential or mid-stationary) and growth temperature (4, 15, 25, 35 and 43\u00b0C) on inactivation of L. monocytogenes by HPP at 400 MPa were investigated.  Stationary phase cells were significantly more barotolerant than exponential phase cells.  Growth temperature also had a significant effect on barotolerance, which generally increased with increasing growth temperature.  Tailing inactivation kinetics were observed in stationary phase cells grown at 35 or 43\u00b0C, but not in stationary phase cells grown at 4, 15 or 25\u00b0C or exponential phase cells grown at 4, 15, 25, 35 or 43\u00b0C.  The effect of water activity on the barotolerance of L. monocytogenes was also investigated.  Lyophilized cells (starting concentration 7.5 x 107 CFU/g) were suspended in water/glycerol solutions or left dry and HP-processed at 600 MPa for 5 min.  Dry cells or cells suspended in 100% glycerol showed no inactivation, but cells suspended in 100% water were completely inactivated.  Glycerol concentrations greater than 40% (aw = 0.80) significantly increased barotolerance, there was a log-linear relationship between glycerol concentration and log CFU/ml of survivors.  The effect of heat shock on barotolerance was also investigated.  L. monocytogenes was grown to stationary phase at 15\u00b0C and heat shocked at 48\u00b0C.  Heat shock significantly enhanced the barotolerance of L. monocytogenes at 400 MPa, with 5 min of heat shock conferring maximal barotolerance.  Addition of chloramphenicol (a protein synthesis inhibitor) prior to heat shock reduced barotolerance to the level of non-heat-shocked cells, indicating that synthesis of heat shock proteins (which are involved in stabilization and/or renaturation of proteins) were responsible for increased barotolerance. The above results indicated that proteins may play an important role in barotolerance.  Therefore, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed to investigate the effect of HPP on proteins in whole cells.  Thermograms of pressure-treated cells of L. monocytogenes showed that the largest peak, which is associated with cellular proteins, occurred at approximately 70\u00b0C and was irreversible.  Lethal high pressure treatments significantly reduced this peak, indicating that HPP caused protein denaturation in whole cells.  While inactivation of L. monocytogenes by HPP may be multi-factorial, our results indicate that protein denaturation plays an important or even dominant role.  Understanding the mechanism of microbial inactivation by HPP and the factors that influence barotolerance will aid in the development of process guidelines for the manufacture of HP-processed foods.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4248], "author_name_tesi": "Hayman, Melinda ", "last_name_ssi": "Hayman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Melinda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen John Knabel", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "John Floros", "Allen T Phillips", "Hassan Gourama", "Maryann Victoria Bruns"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen John Knabel, Committee Chair", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Committee Chair", "John Floros, Committee Member", "Allen T Phillips, Committee Member", "Hassan Gourama, Committee Member", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["injury", "high pressure processing", "Listeria monocytogenes", "differential scanning calorimetry"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The roles of indigenous tour guides in providing authentic experience on guided tours in the Caribbean ", "id": "27299", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10568", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This present study examined the current roles of indigenous tour-guides on the Caribbean islands of Grenada and St. Lucia.

However, many scholars and victim advocates have argued that these reforms were merely symbolic, in that they have not produced any meaningful change in the treatment of crime victims by the criminal justice system.  To investigate this claim, I examined how the implementation of victim reforms has affected criminal justice outcomes across the state of Pennsylvania.  I started by examining how community contextual factors (i.e., characteristics of the economic, political, and social contexts) affected three types of victim-related contextual factors likely influenced by the implementation of victim reforms: the availability of victim resources, county-level indicators of justice, and victim participation in the criminal justice system.  Specifically, I analyzed how community contextual factors affected the availability of victim resources and county-level indicators of four types of justice \u2013 distributive justice, procedural justice, interpersonal justice, and informational justice \u2013 and, in turn, how these factors affected victim participation in the criminal justice system.  I then examined how community contextual factors and victim-related contextual factors combined to influence sentencing outcomes.  \n\nChapter 1 describes the rise of the victims\u2019 rights movement and discusses three types of victim reforms: victim compensation, victim service programs, and victim participation in the criminal justice system.  These reforms focused, respectively, on improving victims\u2019 economic situation through programs for compensation from the state and for restitution from the offender, providing psychological counseling and addressing victims\u2019 need for better treatment and more information, and integrating victims into the criminal justice process, such as by consulting the victim during plea bargaining and allowing victim input during sentencing.  \n\nChapter 2 discusses some of the arguments that have been made regarding the impact of victim reforms on the criminal justice system.  Because contextual factors likely affect the implementation and subsequent impact of victim reforms, I describe the effects of both community contextual factors and victim-related contextual factors on the criminal justice system.  To explain the relationships among community contextual factors, victim-related contextual factors, and sentencing outcomes, I draw on theory and research on justice.  Although social and organizational psychologists generally discuss justice at an interpersonal level, most other disciplines think about justice at a societal level.  As a result, I discuss why aggregate-level measures of justice are necessary for examining the effects of victim reforms on the criminal justice system.  \n\nChapter 3 describes the current study, including the hypotheses that were tested and the theoretical model that guided this research.  The data for this study consisted primarily of sentencing information from the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing for the years 1990-1994 and 1996-2006 and contextual information from the U.S. Census, the Uniform Crime Reports, and the Pennsylvania Office of Victims\u2019 Services.  \n\nI conducted separate analyses for the years 1990-1994 and 1996-2006.  Chapter 4 describes the results from the years 1996-2006 and Chapter 5 describes the results from the years 1990-1994.  I discuss the results in this order because more information about victim-related contextual factors was available for the later years.  The results showed that the availability of victim resources, distributive justice, and the imposition of restitution increased over time.  Furthermore, victim resources and county-level indicators of justice affected victim participation in the criminal justice system and sentencing outcomes.  \n\nChapter 6 concludes by summarizing the findings and the results of the hypothesis tests.  I also discuss implications for theory and policy, as well as directions for future research.  \n\nIn sum, the findings from this dissertation suggest that the implementation of victim reforms has had an effect on the criminal justice system, both directly, as evidenced by the fact that there have been increases in the availability of victim resources, distributive justice, and the imposition of restitution, and indirectly, as evidenced by the fact that resources and justice affected victim participation in the criminal justice system and sentencing outcomes.  It remains to be seen, however, whether these changes have actually improved the treatment of crime victims by the criminal justice system and whether greater justice for victims means less justice for offenders.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5717], "author_name_tesi": "Haynes, Stacy Hoskins", "last_name_ssi": "Haynes", "middle_name_ssi": "Hoskins", "first_name_ssi": "Stacy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback", "John Henry Kramer", "Eric Silver", "Melvin Michael Mark"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback, Committee Chair", "John Henry Kramer, Committee Member", "Eric Silver, Committee Member", "Melvin Michael Mark, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["victims", "sentencing", "contextual effects", "justice"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Performance of Membrane Electrode Assembly Microbial Fuel Cells Using Activated Carbon Cathodes with Various Diffusion Layers\n", "id": "11719", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5574", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a device that uses bacteria to generate electricity through the oxidation of organic matter. MFCs continue to be extensively researched with various chemical feed sources using a conventional setup with widely spaced electrodes, and cathodes containing platinum. However, these specifications make scale-up expensive and difficult to construct. Many anode and cathode materials have been used in different configurations in the past; however, most of these studies chose to use idealized substrates, which is unrealistic for practical applications.\nIn this study, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) MFC was constructed using activated carbon (AC) cathodes and either a carbon brush or flat carbon mesh anode, and domestic wastewater as a feed substrate. The use of carbon brush anodes produced consistently higher voltage and power density results than carbon mesh anodes. Over time, the average voltage from the carbon brush anode reactor configurations was 360 \u00b1 63 mV, while the carbon mesh anode configuration was 200 \u00b1 81 mV. The average decrease in power density over time (89 days) from the carbon brush anode reactor configurations was 15 mW/m2, while the carbon mesh anode configuration dropped 190 mW/m2 over time. The maximum Coulombic efficiency (CE) for the mesh anode configuration was 22 \u00b1 0.4%, while for the brush anode configuration it was 13 \u00b1 2.9%.The CE for the mesh anode decreased 17% over time and the average CE was only 7.8 \u00b1 7.1%. The average CE for the brush anode configuration was 8.6 \u00b1 2.9% with a 4.6% decrease over time.  Brush anodes measured consistently higher average COD removal values per cycle (80 \u00b1 3%) than carbon mesh anodes (58 \u00b1 7%).\nTo optimize the use of carbon mesh anodes, additional diffusion layers (DLs) were added to the AC cathodes. This hindered oxygen diffusion to the anode, which was expected to be contributing to the decline in performance of reactors using carbon mesh anodes. Increased voltage and power generation correlated directly to an increase in the number of diffusion layers added. The setup which allowed the least oxygen diffusion used two layers of generic cling wrap (G2-PG), and achieved an average voltage of 310 \u00b1 52 mV and a maximum power density of 160 mW/m2. CE values positively correlated with the addition of diffusion layers. However, as seen with the original setups which did not have additional DLs, there was a steady decrease in CE over time. The addition of DLs positively correlated to lower effluent BOD5 values.\nThese findings showed that the addition of diffusion layers improved the performance of carbon mesh anodes in a MEA reactor configuration. However, the use of brush anodes provided more consistent, reliable results over time than the use of thinner carbon mesh anodes with domestic wastewater.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5565], "author_name_tesi": "Hays, Sarah Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Hays", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["membrane electrode assembly", "microbial fuel cells", "carbon mesh anode"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE DOUBLY VICTIMIZED RESIDENTS OF DISORGANIZED NEIGHBORHOODS: SOCIAL DISORGANIZATION, COLLECTIVE EFFICACY, AND POLICE OFFICERS\u2019 USE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE", "id": "8530", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6963", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Police use of force has received much empirical attention over the last few decades, but little of that research has been driven by theory.

The objective of this dissertation is therefore to explore the viability of this new theory by examining the relationship between neighborhood social disorganization, neighborhood collective efficacy, and police officers\u2019 use of excessive force.

Opportunities for crime increase when neighborhood land-use patterns are conducive to crime. Criminogenic land-uses include intermixed patterns of residential, commercial, industrial, and vacant lands within neighborhoods, as well as the presence of particular establishments, such as shopping mall. Routine activity theorists suggest that criminogenic land-uses influence crime in two ways: (a) by inhibiting an area\u2019s social control capacity, and (b) by attracting particular types of routine activities (e.g., consuming alcohol at a bar, selling/using drugs in abandoned structures). These land-use patterns may explain why disadvantaged neighborhoods have higher crime rates than more advantaged areas. \n\nThis dissertation examined whether the effect of neighborhood disadvantage on crime may be a function of its association with criminogenic land-use patterns. This research also examined whether criminogenic land-uses have greater effects in disadvantaged neighborhoods. By understanding the effects of land-use, planners and managers could make changes in land-use patterns that decrease crime rates.\nThis dissertation examined the possible relationships between criminogenic land-use and crime, as measured by calls-for-service to the police. To address these issues, this research uses census and tax parcel data from three cities (Lincoln, NE; Columbus, OH; and San Antonio, TX), which vary in terms of size and racial composition. Within each city, census data are being used to create measures of neighborhood social composition, including concentrated disadvantage, population density, and residential mobility. In addition, land-use diversity indices, created from tax parcel data, are used to indicate the degree to which single-family residential, multiple-family residential, commercial, industrial, and vacant or abandoned lands are intermixed within neighborhoods. Land-use diversity is measured using the Shannon Index, where the highest value occurs when equal areas of all types of land-use are present in a neighborhood. The three cities vary in both the size of their populations and their social composition.  Thus, this dissertation also examined whether the effects of land-use are consistent across the three research sites. \n\nOne problem with prior research on communities and crime is that it has largely ignored spatial autocorrelation\u2014the fact that locations that are near to each other are also likely to have similar levels of poverty, residential instability, and crime. Because ordinary regression models cannot control for spatial autocorrelation, traditional estimates are biased and inferences based on these models are likely to be incorrect.

The results indicate that there was a significant overall increase in after-school program use from 18.1% in 1999 to 21.5% in 2005.

The ubiquitous two-parent family has given way to the second demographic transition, characterized by delays in marriage and fertility as well as increases in cohabitation, divorce, and nonmarital fertility.  Given the increasing diversity in American families, children are likely to grow up in remarkably complex family systems.  Families are no longer limited to those who live together in the same household; many families span across multiple households and include adults who are not biologically related to the children as well as siblings who are not biologically related to each other.  Children are increasingly called upon to navigate complicated family structures and relationships, from visitation with nonresidential parents to the introduction of their parents\u2019 romantic partners and the forging of new relationships with step- and half-siblings, all of which have the potential to impact child wellbeing.\nAlthough previous empirical studies have identified differences in child wellbeing by the structure of the family within the household and the number of family structure transitions a child has undergone, less attention has been given to the role of the sheer complexity of modern families in impacting child outcomes.  This project uses the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to further explore the associations between family complexity, family functioning, and child wellbeing using a family systems perspective.  The notion of family complexity \u2013 that families span across multiple households and include both biological and non-biological members \u2013 necessitates a novel approach to measuring family structure.  In this dissertation, I compare a unique measure of family complexity to traditional measures of family structure, and determine how these various approaches to quantifying the family are associated with family functioning and child wellbeing.  \nI find that the unique measure of family complexity and the traditional measures of family structure all capture similar patterns of demographic characteristics among families in terms of race/ethnicity, maternal age, and poverty.  All three measures of family structure are correlated with child behavior problems, but are not significant predictors above basic demographic characteristics.  However, family structure plays a large role in predicting family functioning. The relationship status of the members of the family, the instability of the family, and the complexity of the family all impact the way the family members interact with each other, a finding that is consistent with a family systems approach.  In addition, I find that nearly half of all American families in urban areas deal with some level of family complexity, and higher levels of complexity lead to lower levels of family functioning.  Lower family functioning, in turn, is linked to child behavior problems.  Given these associations, this project provides compelling evidence that family complexity is an important issue to consider in the study of the new American family.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8351], "author_name_tesi": "Hazlett, Emily Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Hazlett", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathryn Bancroft Hynes", "Paul Amato", "Gregory M Fosco", "Nilam Ram"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathryn Bancroft Hynes, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Amato, Committee Member", "Gregory M Fosco, Committee Member", "Nilam Ram, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["family structure", "family functioning", "child wellbeing"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Interactions in a Dilute Fermi Gas", "id": "16275", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7991", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates the role of interactions in a dilute Fermi gas of $^6$Li atoms. Interactions between atoms play an important role in both strongly and weakly interacting systems. In strongly interacting systems the interactions create correlations and pairing that give rise to superfluidity and other emergent phenomena. On the other hand, weak interactions cause unwanted frequency shifts in atomic clocks. I will discuss two experiments that we have conducted that look into interactions in these two regimes. For the strongly interacting case I will discuss our investigation into a narrow Feshbach resonance. I will show that the atom loss near this resonance and the interactions are both energy dependent. Due to this energy dependence the narrow Feshbach resonance must be described by a finite effective range.   Fermi gases with energy dependent interactions may yield novel forms of superfluidity and can be used to simulate the equation of state for neutron star matter.\n\nIdentical fermions do not interact at ultracold temperatures since only $s$-wave collisions are allowed.  Therefore, identical fermions in an atomic clock do not interact provided that each atom feels the same interrogation field. If an inhomogenous interrogation field is used, then different atoms feel different interrogation fields and the atoms are made distinguishable resulting in an s-wave collisional frequency shift.  Interestingly, to observe the shift, it is essential the clock field itself produce the distinguishability. No clock shifts are observed for distinguishable two-state fermions if they are interrogated by a homogeneous field.  We characterize the clock shift for an inhomogeneous field using Ramsey spectroscopy. We observe that the collisional shift has a weak dependence on the first Ramsey pulse area and depends sensitively on the duration of the second Ramsey pulse. We demonstrate linear scaling of the shift with the s-wave scattering length showing that it is indeed s-wave in nature. The results of these findings will help provide a blue print for how to eliminate uncertainties due to density dependent shifts in atomic clocks.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7938], "author_name_tesi": "Hazlett, Eric Lavern", "last_name_ssi": "Hazlett", "middle_name_ssi": "Lavern", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth O'hara", "Kenneth O'hara", "David Weiss", "Jainendra Jain", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth O'hara, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth O'hara, Committee Chair", "David Weiss, Committee Member", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Atomic Clocks", "Fermi Gases"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DISPARITIES IN THE RATES OF ADMISSION FOR AMBULATORY CARE SENSITIVE CONDITIONS AMONG CHILDREN LIVING IN PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\n", "id": "8280", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7", "abstract_tesi": "\nPurpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate race/ethnic and age group disparities in the rates of admission for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) among children living in Pennsylvania.

Logistic regression models are estimated to determine statistically significant differences in ACSC admission rates by race/ethnicity and age, and significant changes in these rate differences over time. \n\nPopulation Studied: African-American, Hispanic and white children aged 0 to 19 years living in Pennsylvania during 2001 and 2005.\n\nPrincipal Findings: African American children had higher rates of admission for most ACSC compared to Hispanics and whites in both 2001 and 2005. Hispanic children also had higher rates of admission for most ACSC compared to whites in both years, but the Hispanic-white disparities were not as pronounced as the African American-white disparities. Further, children who were younger tend to have higher rates of admission compared to older children.    Comparisons of trends from 2001 to 2005 in ACSC hospitalization rate disparities are mixed, with disparities for some ACSC conditions increasing and some decreasing in each childhood age group.  Many disparities in 2005, however, were not significantly changed from those observed in 2001. \n\nConclusions: There are race/ethnic disparities in the rates of admission for ACSC among children living in Pennsylvania, and these disparities are most pronounced between African Americans and whites. Age group disparities also exist, with younger children being more likely to be admitted for ACSC compared to older children. Overall, the race/ethnic disparities have not changed significantly in 2005 compared to 2001.\n\nPolicy Implications: Mechanisms underlying disparities in the rates of admission for ACSC among Pennsylvania children need to be investigated. Also, the fact that the disparities observed in 2001 were largely unchanged in 2005 implies that little progress was made between those years. Policy interventions that promote equitable, timely, and affordable access to quality care for all Pennsylvania children are needed.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7], "author_name_tesi": "Hazzan, Afeez Abiola", "last_name_ssi": "Hazzan", "middle_name_ssi": "Abiola", "first_name_ssi": "Afeez", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Population Health", "Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions", "Health Disparities", "Child Health"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Conformal mapping and variational methods for interfacial dynamics in fluids\n", "id": "12053", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "577", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis we will be considering three problems in fluid dynamics whose common features involve free surface dynamics. In a two-dimensional space, these problems can be conveniently formulated by conformal mapping methods. The history and status quo of application of conformal mapping methods to fluid dynamics are briefly discussed in Chapter 1.\n\nIn Chapter 2 we study theoretically and experimentally the deformation of a free surface between two fluids in a gravitational field, due to a jet in the lighter fluid impinging at right angles to the surface. A mathematical model is built using the method of conformal mapping. The strength of our method lies in its general applicability to analytically study the interface between two fluids in a gravitational field, one of which has an arbitrary potential velocity field, while the other is assumed to be motionless. An asymptotic solution is derived for the cavity shape with the density ratio of fluids as the small expansion parameter.\n\nWe present in Chapter 3 an unsteady nonlinear Darcy's equation which includes inertial effects for flows in a Hele-Shaw cell, and discuss the conditions under which it reduces to the classical Darcy\u2019s law. In the absence of surface tension we derive a generalized Polubarinova-Galin equation in a circular geometry, using the method of conformal mapping. The linear stability of the base-flow state is examined by perturbing the corresponding conformal map. We show that inertia always tends to stabilize the interface, regardless of whether a less viscous fluid is displacing a more viscous fluid or vice versa.\n\nIn Chapter 4 a mathematical model of reactive Hele-Shaw flows when two immiscible fluids meet, chemically react and form an elastic interface is considered. This reaction brings about significant changes in the interfacial tension, which is crucial in determining the stability of such a system. We model this by treating the interface as an elastic membrane whose bending stiffness depends on the local curvature. We derive from energy variation a dynamic boundary condition at the interface. An analysis of the roles that several parameters play in affecting the stability is performed. We are able to qualitatively account for the anomalous fingering instabilities that have been seen experimentally.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [574], "author_name_tesi": "He, Andong ", "last_name_ssi": "He", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Andong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Levi", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte", "Mark Levi", "Qiang Du", "Diane Marie Henderson", "Tong Qiu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Levi, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte, Committee Chair", "Mark Levi, Committee Chair", "Qiang Du, Committee Member", "Diane Marie Henderson, Committee Member", "Tong Qiu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["interfacial dynamics", "fluid dynamics", "conformal mapping"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "the influence of openness to world trade and policies for technology diffusion in Chinese state-owned enterprises", "id": "15337", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7350", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The previous literature shows the efforts of the Chinese government to decentralize property rights have the potential to influence the diffusion of continuous casting technology in China\u2019s steel industry. However, it is hard to fully explain the variations in the diffusion of continuous casting technology among Chinese steel firms based entirely on this institutional factor of decentralization. Instead, it is necessary to consider more recent policies, such as the China Western Region Development program and China\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), both of which occurred in the first decade of the 21st century. It is assumed that these factors are capable of motivating steel firms to overcome institutional and technical barriers to installing continuous casting equipment more rapidly than in the period before those two factors came into play. The current study explored the influence of certain market and institutional factors on state-owned enterprises\u2019 (firm level) diffusion speed of continuous casting technology in China during the period 1985\u20132009. We found that these influential factors matter in different ways based on different periods and regions in terms of continuous casting technology diffusion among Chinese steel firms. In particular, compared to the period before the 2000s, governmental supervision and intervention during the first decade of the 21st century accelerated the rate at which firms adopted new technology and increased firms\u2019 co-movement with market factors thereafter. The government\u2019s interventions such as the China\u2019s Western Region Development program benefit and motivate steel firms in the Western provinces to diffuse continuous casting technology appropriately; for example, Western firms are more willing than non-western firms to replace outdated ingot casting technology by continuous casting technology; Western firms are more motivated to produce sheets and slabs of steel via continuous casting methods than non-western firms are. Although the main point of the China\u2019s Western Region Development program was to help under-developed western areas to become more efficient and productive by establishing large firms, substantial disparities in terms of the adoption of continuous casting technology between large-scale western and non-western firms still exist. Our findings suggest that the government should focus on supporting the adoption of new technology rather than on encouraging firms to grow in terms of scale. Furthermore, even though China\u2019s Western Region Development policy constituted a great effort to expand the investment budget for Western firms, this growth in the investment budget of western firms did not motivate those firms to diffuse continuous casting technology more rapidly. China\u2019s accession to the WTO is also proving to be a factor capable of motivating steel firms, especially old steel firms and firms that produce sheets and slabs of steel, to meet the challenge of using technically sophisticated continuous casting technology. Overall, despite their close association with central government, former \u201ckey\u201d firms became more sensitive to the market after China\u2019s accession to the WTO and consequently adjusted their strategies more rapidly according to market conditions. In summary, China\u2019s accession to the WTO appears to be motivating the country\u2019s steel firms to overcome the institutional and technical barriers to installing continuous casting technology and to take action in this regard more rapidly than during the pre-WTO period. Without using a specific variable to measure the direct effects of WTO accession on the diffusion of continuous casting technology, all the conclusions were drawn based on testing whether other influential factors had different effects depending on whether the pre-WTO period or the post-WTO period is considered.

As infrastructure, there are stringent demands to minimize cost and maximize performance. These conflicting goals increasingly require methods of analysis and design that are more sophisticated than conventional linear system techniques and serial design of converter subsystems. For example, linear small signal models fail to predict sub-harmonic oscillations that arise under certain operating conditions.\n\nMost power converter systems can be modeled using a switched state space model that includes piecewise linear time invariant (LTI) state space models for each topology along with a set of switching surfaces. In addition, most converters operate in a periodic manner, so the Floquet method can be applied to assess stability. Previous work yielded a closed-form expression for the Floquet-theoretic monodromy matrix for a piecewise LTI system with piecewise constant inputs. It also provided a method for calculating the periodic steady state response of such a system. The work presented here extends the previous derivation and method to systems having multi-period behavior (sub-harmonics) and sinusoidal inputs. This permits calculation of frequency response characteristics that are more accurate than those that can be obtained from small signal models.\n\nTradeoffs are inevitable when one designs power converter systems. Decreasing the size of the energy storage elements - inductors and capacitors - reduces cost and volume but also reduces steady-state and transient power quality margins in ways that are difficult to determine using conventional models. To minimize cost and volume while ensuring that power quality specifications are satisfied, an automated design process based on Genetic Algorithms and extended Floquet method is presented.

In the first stage, the virus infects erythroid progenitor cells, resulting in the Epo-independent (Epoind) expansion of erythroid progenitor cells. In the late stage, integration of the virus into the Spi-1 locus leads to inappropriate expression of Pu.1 and subsequent inactivation of the p53 locus in erythroid cells, causing a block in their differentiation and eventually acute erythroleukemia.\nFriend virus induced erythroleukemia in susceptible mice is initiated by the interaction of the Friend virus encoded glycoprotein, gp55, with the erythropoietin receptor and the product of the host Fv2 gene, a naturally occurring truncated form of the Stk receptor tyrosine kinase (Sf-Stk). We have previously demonstrated that the activation of Sf-Stk and recruitment of a Grb2/Gab2/Stat3 signaling complex is required for the ability of Friend virus to induce Epo independent colony formation of erythroid progenitor cells. Here we demonstrate that gp55 interacts with Sf-Stk through the cysteine residues Cys306, Cys309, Cys337 and Cys338 in the ecotropic domain of gp55 and the cysteine residues Cys8, Cys19, Cys37 and Cys42 in the extracellular domain of Sf-Stk. This interaction does not promote the dimerization of Sf-Stk, but results in the enhanced phosphorylation of pre-formed Sf-Stk dimers. Point mutation of these cysteine residues or deletion of these domains abrogates the interaction between gp55 and Sf-Stk, resulting in the inability of these mutants to promote the Epo independent growth of erythroid progenitor cells. \nWe further demonstrate that cell surface localization of Sf-Stk is critical for receptor phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling. We show that the interaction between gp55 and Sf-Stk induces the cell surface translocation of Sf-Stk. We also show that mutation of the cysteines in the extracellular domain of Sf-Stk results in enhanced cell surface localization in the absence of gp55, but not enhanced phosphorylation of Sf-Stk. Alternatively, while a constitutively activating mutation in the kinase domain of Sf-Stk is not sufficient to induce receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling, mutation of the cysteines in the extracellular domain of Sf-Stk in this context restores full activity of Sf-Stk in the absence of gp55. These results indicate that both kinase activation and cell surface localization play an essential role in the activation of Sf-Stk signaling by gp55. Finally, we demonstrate that gp55 activation of Sf-Stk results in the recruitment and activation of Gab1 through the C terminal docking sites Tyr429 and Tyr436, and that Gab1 activation by Sf-Stk correlates with its ability to promote the phosphorylation of Erk and the activation of AP1. Further, we show that Src interacts with Sf-Stk in the presence of gp55 and that Src activity is essential for the phosphorylation of Gab1 and Gab2 and the ability of gp55 to promote Sf-Stk activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. We also demonstrate that Src kinase activity is essential for the Epo independent growth of primary erythroblasts in response to Friend virus infection.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5947], "author_name_tesi": "He, Shihan ", "last_name_ssi": "He", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shihan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Avery August", "Biao He", "Robert Paulson", "Zhi Chun Lai"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pamela Hankey Giblin, Dissertation Advisor", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Biao He, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["erythroid progenitor cell", "short form Stk receptor tyrosine kinase", "murine erythroleukemia", "Friend virus", "protein inteaction", "cell signaling"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "modeling photographic composition via triangles", "id": "24927", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10678", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Modeling photographic composition is important to many real-world applications such as digital photography, image retrieval, image understanding, and image aesthetics assessment.

After the detection, the system further provides on-site composition feedback to the photographers.  In the case of natural scene photography, we propose a new image segmentation algorithm for extracting triangles based on agglomerative clustering, utilizing both photographic and geometric cues. We further illustrate how these cues can be directly used to detect the dominant vanishing point in an image without extracting any line segments.  For portrait photography, we extract and assemble straight lines to form triangles via a modified RANSAC algorithm.

One of the remaining technical barriers for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) is achieving a damage-free cold-start, which is critical for automobile application in cold regions. PEFCs generate water. Upon freezing, ice lens formation in the thin film porous media in the fuel cell can occur, causing irreversible damage. With limited experimental and theoretical analysis available, the detailed mechanisms for the degradation are still unknown.\nTo better understand the phenomena involved and determine engineering approaches to control and mitigate the degradation, a 1-D transient freezing model based on theories of porous media flow and soil frost heave mechanisms has been formulated to describe the degradation process. The freezing process of a PEFC is a multi-phase porous media flow problem. The porous media can contain both unsaturated and saturated domains. Ice lenses will initialize and grow when the ice phase pressure overcomes the overburden pressure. This work presents an improvement of Harlan\u2019s hydraulic model by integrating the frost heave mechanism from Miller\u2019s rigid ice model. The model\u2019s main improvement and feature most relevant to PEFCs is that it can be applied to both saturated and unsaturated domains, which is critical for PEFC application.\nAdditionally, detailed discussion on the capillary pressure versus saturation characteristic curve and the unfrozen water versus temperature characteristic curve, and methods to derive these curves for PEFC components are given. The unfrozen water versus temperature curve for Nafion\u00ae can be derived from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data via an energy balance approach. For the diffusion media (DM) and catalyst layer (CL), this curve can be predicted through freezing temperature depression and pore size distribution through thermodynamic relations. Through the characteristic curves and formulated model, an ice lens can be predicted to occur only around the CL, either between the CL and the DM, or between the CL and the Nafion\u00ae membrane.\nThe numerical model was coded and solved using the Newton method. Simulation results show the processes controlling ice lens and pore ice accumulation include the drainage rate of the Nafion\u00ae and the porous materials, heat dissipation, hydrophobicity of catalyst layer, irreducible water saturation of catalyst layer, electrolyte thickness, and cooling rate. Cycling and inverted end cells effects are also found to be important. Two indices, the ice lens thickness ratio and the catalyst pore ice filling-up ratio, are proposed to characterize simulation results and estimate the possibility that a crack can initialize and grow, especially under cycling conditions. Strategies to control freeze/thaw damage are proposed based on methods that control crack initialization and that control crack development. Basically, any approach that can reduce the final ice saturation in the catalyst layer would help.\nAnother work presented here is the development of a MEMS-based micro sensor for real-time measurement of the electrolyte temperature. The micron-sized gold thermistor is embedded in parylene film, and fabricated using MEMS technologies. Experimental results show that the sensor has a very linear response, and is robust enough to withstand the severe electrolyte expansion forces that occur during water uptake. It is an improvement compared to the conventional micro-thermocouples, with respect to sensitivity and placement accuracy, and can be used to measure the internal temperature distribution in a PEFC.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5946], "author_name_tesi": "He, Suhao ", "last_name_ssi": "He", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suhao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew M Mench", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Patrick M Reed"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew M Mench, Committee Chair", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Patrick M Reed, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["degradation", "Stefan problem", "porous media flow", "polymer electrolyte fuel cells", "unfrozen water flow", "frost heave modeling", "MEMS", "sensor", "temperature measurement"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Cooperation and Information Theoretic Security in Wireless Networks", "id": "10888", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6671", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation studies the fundamental rate limits of wireless communication systems through which confidential messages can be transmitted without being intercepted by an adversary.  It is assumed that the adversary is subject to noise and interference, as are the legitimate nodes in the system. The security guarantees offered are\nirrespective of the computational power of the adversary. \n\nThree themes are developed in parallel throughout the dissertation. The first theme explores the relationship between cooperation and secrecy. In wireless networks, cooperation from intermediate relay nodes are essential for facilitating long range communications. This dissertation considers a series of network models where the information from a source to a destination needs to be kept\nconfidential from intermediate relays. Four different network models with untrusted relay nodes are considered: the three-node relay\nchannel, the two-hop link, the two-way relay channel and the multi-hop line network. These models are studied for relays that are honest but\ncurious. That is, the relay nodes are legitimate nodes with lower security clearance, that willingly carry out the designated relay\nschemes. Secrecy capacity lower and upper bounds for each channel model are found and cases where secrecy capacity can be found are identified. Next the two-hop link is studied where the relay turns malicious in that it can manipulate the signals being relayed and carry out a Byzantine attack. In this case, two requirements must be\nsatisfied simultaneously: The message must be kept confidential from the relay node, and, any modification carried out by the relay node\nmust be detected reliably by the legitimate parties. The dissertation shows that both requirements can be fulfilled for this model with\narbitrarily small overhead.\n\nThe next two themes developed in this  dissertation serve as the technical foundation for the first theme. One establishes the foundation for providing secrecy using structured\ncodes. Traditionally, the achievability proofs for information theoretic secrecy rely on Shannon's random codebook generation argument in which the codebook does not exhibit structure. In this dissertation, it is shown that by imposing structure requirements in random codebook generation, higher rates for secure communication can be achieved than known results obtained using the conventional approach. This dissertation develops the necessary tool and general methodology for computing the secrecy rate when a nested lattice structure is used in codebook generation. Two results are presented\nthat rely on this foundation.  First, it is proved that, for a class of Gaussian channel models with interference and secrecy constraints,\nstructured codes outperform Gaussian signaling at medium to high SNR. Second, this tool is used to develop a strong secrecy scheme for\nthe two-hop link with an untrusted relay, which in turn is the centerpiece of the Byzantine detection scheme developed in this\ndissertation.\n\nThe third theme is methods of proving strong secrecy.  Information theoretic secrecy results often rely on the weak secrecy constraint\nwhich provides only asymptotic guarantees with respect to the information rate leaked to the adversary. As this would likely be\ninsufficient in a practical system, a non-asymptotic, strong secrecy guarantee must be sought. More often than not, weak secrecy rates can be strengthened to strong secrecy rates in a straightforward manner, leading back to the justification of proving weak secrecy only. This\ndissertation challenges this conventional wisdom and identifies two cases where this approach does not follow. In both cases, direct strong secrecy proofs are established. These are: the two-hop link with a Byzantine relay, and models with arbitrarily varying eavesdropper channel considered in the last chapter of this\ndissertation.\n\nThe latter model is motivated by the need to bring the theory of providing unconditional secrecy guarantees closer to practice. In\nparticular, the dissertation addresses the case where the channel that the adversary (eavesdropper) experiences is completely unknown to the legitimate parties.

The secrecy rate obtained from this coding theorem is tight in terms of secure degree of freedom, which is a high SNR\ncharacterization of the secrecy capacity.

This concept can achieve many goals such as reducing the inventory-holding cost, decreasing the lead-time, and consolidating the shipments. For a cross-dock, a warehouse is needed because of the delay between the inbound and outbound trucks as well as helping to deal with the situation that the demand exceeds the supply. A lot of companies therefore choose a combination of cross-docking and emergency inventory to take advantage of both methods. In the combination of a cross-dock and warehouse, a job that is loading required packages onto outgoing trailers is divided into two tasks; loading packages from the cross-dock, and loading packages from the warehouse. There exists a synchronization of two tasks. In this scenario, synchronization means if one task is completed earlier than another task it needs to wait for that task to finish in order to complete one job. The trailer will leave the outbound door as soon as two tasks have finished. A queuing model, known as fork/join queuing, could be applied to analyze this combination of cross-dock and warehouse. In this thesis, the service rate of the cross-dock has been analyzed using MVA. The service rate of a warehouse depends on the service rate of the cross-dock in addition to the arriving rate of demands. After applying two service rates to the fork/join queuing model, the queue length of packages loaded from the cross-dock and warehouse as well as the mean sojourn time of one job have been analyzed and calculated under varied situations.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15938], "author_name_tesi": "He, Xiao ", "last_name_ssi": "He", "first_name_ssi": "Xiao", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vittaldas V Prabhu", "Pang Guodong", "Janis P.

This excess pressure provides a driving force for the vaporization to take place. As a result of vaporization for different elements, the composition in the weld pool may differ from that of base metal, which can result in changes in microstructure and degradation of mechanical properties of weldments. When the weld pool temperatures are very high, the escaping vapor exerts a large recoil force on the weld pool surface, and as a consequence, tiny liquid metal particles may be expelled from the weld pool. Vaporization of alloying elements and liquid metal expulsion are the two main mechanisms of material loss. Besides, for laser welds with small length scale, because of rapid changes of temperature and very short duration of the laser welding process, physical measurements of important parameters such as temperature and velocity fields, weld thermal cycles, solidification and cooling rates are very difficult. The objective of the research is to quantitatively understand the influences of various factors on the heat transfer, fluid flow, vaporization of alloying elements and liquid metal expulsion in Nd:YAG laser welding with small length scale of 304 stainless steel.\n\nIn this study, a comprehensive three dimensional heat transfer and fluid flow model based on the mass, momentum and energy conservation equations is relied upon to calculate temperature and velocity fields in the weld pool, weld thermal cycle, weld pool geometry and solidification parameters. Using the computed temperature fields, the mass loss and composition change due to vaporization of various alloying elements and vapor composition during laser spot welding were calculated. The computed vapor loss was found to be lower than the measured weight loss. Therefore, the liquid metal expulsion was examined by both calculations and experiments. The liquid metal expulsion can be predicted by balancing the vapor recoil force with the surface tension force at the periphery of the liquid pool. \n\nThe results in this thesis contribute to the growing quantitative knowledge base in laser welding with small length scale.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6666], "author_name_tesi": "He, Xiuli ", "last_name_ssi": "He", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiuli", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tarasankar Debroy", "Long Qing Chen", "Christopher Muhlstein", "Stephen M Copley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tarasankar Debroy, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Christopher Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Stephen M Copley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heat transfer and fluid flow", "stainless steel", "Laser welding"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Patient Flow Interventions and Prioritization in Emergency Department", "id": "18066", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8578", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Emergency Department overcrowding has been a major problem in the United States for almost two decades.

The hybrid system supplies the micro-grid system dynamic electrical and thermal demands, which is simulated by HOMER (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Electric Renewables).  In this study, solar energy is to meet the peak micro-grid system electrical demand. Considering the fluctuations of solar energy production, the gas-fired engine is used to supply unmet, micro-grid electrical demands. The engine is sized with part load operating characteristics to allow excess PV-engine-battery generation for sales back to macro-grid on high solar flux, high macro-grid demand days.  Because the hybrid system choices could change with key factors variations, this study takes into account some factors, like demand profile from two building types, initial component installment cost, and the energy price to make technical and economic analysis. For instance, commercial and industrial buildings with different electrical and thermal demand profile should be considered separately and decreasing PV system price and fuel price could be an opportunity for hybrid system.

This study approached parent-adolescent relationships from a \u201cperson-centered\u201d perspective in order to move away from the practice of studying relationship qualities in isolation. Specifically, this study made use of cluster analysis to profile parent-adolescent relationships along multiple affective and behavioral dimensions, relating those profiles to other characteristics of dyad members and families. In addition, initial relationship profiles were linked to change in relationship quality to see if differences in relationship quality led to differences in how these relationships changed as offspring moved through early and middle adolescence. Data came from 196 families living in central Pennsylvania participating in a longitudinal study; the present study focused on data from mothers, fathers, and secondborn offspring (M age = 12.5) collected during home and phone interviews about individual characteristics, family relationships, and time use. Two-stage cluster analyses, consisting of average linkage with cosine and k-means, were conducted separately for mother-offspring and father-offspring dyads, using eight relationship quality variables: parent and adolescent reports of parental acceptance, time together, conflict frequency, and conflict intensity. Analyses yielded four relationship profiles for both sets of dyads: Harmonious, Uninvolved, Conflictual-Child, and Conflictual-Parent. Harmonious dyads had high acceptance, spent much of their time together, and had infrequent, mild arguments. Uninvolved dyads spent little of their time together, and had infrequent and mild arguments. The two Conflictual clusters were characterized by more negative relationship quality, and differed from one another in who reported more conflict: offspring in Conflictual-Child relationships reported significantly more frequent and intense conflict than their parents, while parents in Conflictual-Parent relationships reported significantly more frequent and intense conflict than their offspring. Individual (e.g., gender, expressivity, depressive symptoms), relationship (e.g., autonomy, parental knowledge), and family (e.g., marital quality, quality of sibling relationships) characteristics were significantly related to relationship profiles in expected ways. The two Conflictual profiles were further distinguished from one another by their pattern of correlates; based on the profiles and pattern of correlates, it appeared that Conflictual-Parent mother-adolescent dyads, and Conflictual-Child father-adolescent dyads, had the most negative relationships. Finally, analyses were conducted testing whether initial relationship profiles moderated the association between adolescent developmental status and relationship change over a two-year period.

In addition to targeting GPCRs to manage\ncardiovascular and central nervous system associated disease conditions, a growing\nbody of literature suggests that many GPCRs are involved in cancer development,\nprogression and metastasis.\nNeurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) is a GPCR that has been recently identified as a\nmediator of tumorigenicity and metastasis. NTSR1, as well as its endogenous ligand,\nneurotensin (NTS), are coexpressed in several types of cancer including lung,\npancreas, prostate, colon, head and neck as well as breast cancer cell lines and breast\ncancer tumor samples. We have previously reported that ceramide mimetics could\ninhibit breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. The direct effect of C6 ceramide on\nGPCR-mediated cancer progression has not been characterized. Thus, understanding\nthe biochemical and biophysical regulation of NTSR1 by ceramide can help further\ndefine NTSR1 as a novel target in breast cancer. Our results show that nanoliposomal\nformulations of C6 ceramide inhibit NTSR1-mediated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer\nprogression (mitogenesis, migration, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity). In\naddition, liposomal C6 ceramide inhibited NTSR1-mediated, but not phorbol 12-\nmyristate 13-acetate\u2013mediated, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase\npathway. Mechanistically, nanoliposomal short-chain ceramide reduces NTSR1\ninteraction with G\u00e1q/11 subunits within structured membrane microdomains (SMDs),\niv\nconsistent with diminished NTS-induced translocation of NTSR1 into membrane\nmicrodomains.\nWe next hypothesized that agonist-induced receptor palmitoylation mediates\ndynamic receptor translocation and signaling within SMDs. We have identified that\nendogenously expressed NTSR-1 in MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinomas as well as\nexogenously expressed NTSR-1 in HEK293T cells that do not normally express NTSR-\n1 is palmitoylated at Cys 381 and Cys383. Inhibition of NTSR-1 palmitoylation in MDAMB-\n231 cells as well as NTSR-1 expressing HEK293T cells diminished NTS-mediated\nERK 1/2 phosphorylation. Additionally, NTSR1 mutated at Cys381 and/or Cys383 to\nserine showed diminished ERK1/2 stimulation and reduced ability to protect HEK293T\ncells against apoptosis induced by serum starvation. Mechanistically, C381,383SNTSR-\n1 showed reduced ability to interact with G\u00e1q/11 and diminished localization to\nSMDs, where G\u00e1q/11 preferentially resides.\nBased on these observations, we next hypothesized that ceramide effects on NTSR-\n1 localization and signaling could be in part mediated through interference with NTSR-1\npalmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle. Our results suggest that ceramide could either\ninhibit NTSR-1 palmitoylation through direct biochemical or biophysical mechanism(s) or\nthrough acceleration of NTSR-1 deplamitoylation.\nCollectively, our findings suggest that liposomal short-chain C6 ceramide can be\nutilized to inhibit NTS-dependent breast cancer cell growth.

This dissertation explores the final state\nfrom generic binary black hole\ncoalescence, considering a broad range of initial orbital configurations,\nfrom direct plunges to escape and recapture events to quasi-circular\ninspirals and to even more energetic orbits.\n\nGravitational recoil is caused by the anisotropic emission of gravitational\nradiation due to asymmetries in the initial binary black hole spacetime.\nFor quasi-circular inspirals, the beamed radiation tends to\naverage over the inspiral, with the main contribution coming from the\nplunge.

This dissertation in composed of three studies on youth migration in Haiti. The first study examines two characteristics of youth migration: youth\u2019s motives and parents\u2019 continued provision of financial support to migrants. Findings reveal that education motivates nearly a quarter of youth migration episodes. Labor motivated migration becomes increasingly common between the ages of 10 and 24, and family-tied migration becomes less common. Findings also reveal that nearly two-thirds of youth migrants receive financial support from their families. Though female youth are more likely to be migrants, they are less likely to receive financial support from their families. Youth migration is discussed in the context of the changing labor market, and as a whole, education migration should be considered part of a continued parental investment strategy.\nThe second study examines education migration following the completion of primary school from a within family perspective. Multilevel logistic regression models compare outcomes between siblings, and findings suggest that parental perceptions of how smart their children are and how well their children do in school are strongly associated with education migration following primary school. There was no evidence to support the hypotheses that having older, migrant siblings is positively associated with education migration or that having younger siblings, who can take on the responsibilities of household chores, eases the departure of older siblings. Findings also suggest that families have reduced the use of education migration as a strategy for investing in their children\u2019s education as a response to the 2010 Haitian earthquake. \nThe third study explores the context and timing of early sexual experiences among rural-to-urban migrant adolescents in Haiti by examining their early sexual behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes. I first examine the timing of sexual initiation as it relates to migration using three competing hypotheses\u2014adaptation, disruption, and selection. Findings reveal that a disruption hypothesis is that most plausible explanation among female migrant youth, who are less-likely to initiate sexual initiation near migration. Findings also reveal weak associations between migration and sexual initiation among boys. Furthermore, migrant adolescents accumulate less protective knowledge and endorse premarital sex similarly to non-migrants. This study finds evidence that is contrary to the overwhelming assumption that migrant youth risk deleterious sexual and reproductive health outcomes. The high aspirations of migrant youth provide a likely explanation for these findings.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8923], "author_name_tesi": "Heckert, Jessica Mae", "last_name_ssi": "Heckert", "middle_name_ssi": "Mae", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody", "Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody", "Susan Mc Hale", "D Wayne Osgood", "Kevin J Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody, Dissertation Advisor", "Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody, Committee Chair", "Susan Mc Hale, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "Kevin J Thomas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["youth migration", "sexual and reproductive health", "education migration", "Haiti", "less-developed countries"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Reassembling The Landscape: A Holistic Study Of\npolylepis Forest Cover Change In Colina, Tunari\nnational Park, Bolivia", "id": "18689", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8846", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis project is a mixed methods study of changes in Polylepis forest cover in the\ncommunity of Colina, Tunari National Park, Bolivia from 1991-2011. The project combines a\ntime-series analysis of Landsat 5TM images with semi-structured interviews and ethnographicstyle\nobservations to explore changes in Polylepis forest cover in a holistic, landscape framework\nthat places change in the context of multiple interacting processes. This approach to Polylepis forest research challenges dominant discourses in Andean biogeography that link the current distribution of Polylepis forest to simple cause-and-effect relationships with anthropogenic fire and grazing. Through a synthesis of multiple methods, this thesis argues that the deficiency of this dominant narrative is not scientific fallacy, but a spatial mismatch that results from a\nconstruction of these forest systems as discrete systems in the landscape. The thesis offers a new framing of the landscape that places Polylepis forests in an interconnected web of relations. This alternate framing highlights connections between social and ecological processes like changing\nclimate, grassland productivity, regional and local economy, and peasant livelihoods that offer new possibilities for understanding the complexities of change in humanized landscapes like the Andes. Through a multi-scalar landscape level approach, this study finds that blaming grazing and fire for observed decrease and thinning of Polylepis forest in Colina is an over simplification that has led to conservation efforts that will likely harm local residents and fail to stop forest loss in the long-term. Based on the findings of this case study and an engagement with current scholarship on Polylepis and related systems, this thesis offers the hypothesis that Polylepis cover change in Colina is the result of a combination of ecological change and a lack of economic opportunity that has led to heavier reliance on forest resources. The research also develops methods for the use of Landsat imagery in the study of Polylepis systems, and identifies key areas of focus for future research in these systems.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8692], "author_name_tesi": "Hedberg, Russell Carl", "last_name_ssi": "Hedberg", "middle_name_ssi": "Carl", "first_name_ssi": "Russell", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Stephen Zimmerer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Stephen Zimmerer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Land-Use Land-Cover Change", "Political Ecology", "Landscape Ecology", "Polylepis Forest", "Bolivia", "Andes", "Social-Ecological Systems"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF LASER FIRED CONTACTS, LASER DOPED EMITTERS, AND FIXED CHARGE PASSIVATION FOR IMPROVED SILICON SOLAR CELLS\n\n\n", "id": "11872", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "720", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the introduction of laser processing into silicon solar cell manufacturing, characterization and understanding of laser-material interactions and laser fired device performance is critical.  To assess laser doping of the front-side emitters and laser firing of the rear-side contacts of silicon solar cells, several experiments were carried out to create and characterize laser fired contacts (LFCs) and laser doped emitters (LDEs).  Additionally, an investigation of fixed charge layers for increased surface passivation performance was performed.  \nA cross-sectioning and selective plating method was developed to characterize the molten region of LFCs created with varying laser firing conditions.  Delineation of the geometry and penetration depth of an LFC, within the silicon, was possible with this method, and the once-molten, laser fired region was measured to depths of tens of microns in the silicon substrate.  Investigation of surface topography, diameter, and electrical performance of LFCs was carried out in previous work by Brennan DeCesar, and is briefly reviewed herein.  Simulations of LFCs were performed by modeling devices of different diameter and doping densities to replicate trends in experimental resistance data, and to identify the concentration of Al in the fired contact region.  Resistances simulated for LFCs modeled with doping densities above 1x1018/cm3 matched best with experimental data, and the resistance of the contacts is dominated by spreading resistance from the heavily doped region (formed through laser firing) into the rest of the wafer.\nLaser doped emitters were also fabricated and characterized through electrical characterization and cross-sectioning and junction delineation techniques.  Doping of the emitters using phosphorus-doped amorphous silicon films, incorporated in the passivation layers, was found to be promising.  Depths of LDEs within the silicon were much shallower than those of LFCs, due to the shorter pulse duration used in laser processing (\u00b5s rather than ms).\nPassivation of silicon through the introduction of negative fixed charge was investigated using alumina (Al2O3) and hafnia (HfO2) films deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD).  Layered structures with SiOx capping films deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) were also investigated.  Passivation quality was characterized by measuring effective carrier lifetime using microwave photoconductive decay.  The longest lifetimes achieved were over 1.5 ms, measured on a sample passivated with 10 nm Al2O3 and 100 nm SiOx after a 5 min 350\u00b0C anneal.  Fixed charge density was calculated through flat band voltage shifts in C-V measurements made using a mercury probe.  Both the Al2O3 and HfO2 samples exhibited negative fixed charge densities.  Samples passivated with thin Al2O3 layers were found to have the largest negative fixed charge densities, up to 1x1013/cm2.  Additionally, the creation of an inversion layer due to fixed charge in passivation films deposited on high resistivity silicon substrates was investigated using contactless conductivity measurements and changes in sheet resistance.  The presence of an inversion layer was detected by a decrease in sheet resistance and correlated to an increase in effective carrier lifetime for those samples annealed for 5 min at 450\u00b0C in a tube furnace, 450\u00b0C in a RTA, and 350\u00b0C on a hot plate.  \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [714], "author_name_tesi": "Hedrick, Brittany Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Hedrick", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Brittany", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney", "Joseph R Flemish", "Suzanne E Mohney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney, Thesis Advisor", "Joseph R Flemish, Thesis Advisor", "Suzanne E Mohney, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Laser Doped Emitter", "Silicon Solar Cells", "Fixed Charge Passivation", "Laser Fired Contacts"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Lipid Bilayer Membrane Organization\n\n", "id": "7840", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2733", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lipid membrane structure affects many biological processes; understanding the structure and organization of lipid bilayers is important to the development of new medical treatments and for understanding how cell membranes function.

A key property of LSCs, is the capacity for unlimited self-renewal. Leukemia cells are made up a heterogeneous mixture of cells, with varying potential to proliferate.  At the apex of this developmental hierarchy are leukemia stem cells.  These cells have ability to self-renew and can generate \u201cbulk\u201d leukemia cells that have lost their stem cell properties and have limited proliferative potential. Leukemia stem cells cause significant problems for conventional chemotherapy in that they are quiescent cells that can evade cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. They express P-Glycoprotein a multi drug resistance protein, which actively transports drug out of the cell. For example, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), is caused by a 9:22 translocation that generates the BCR-ABL fusion gene encoding a constitutive active tyrosine kinase. The routine care for CML  relies on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like either imatinib or nilotinib that inhibit BCR-ABL kinase activity. CML stem cells are resistant to killing by these drugs and following treatment, surviving LSC\u2019s lead to disease relapse. Inducing differentiation of LSC\u2019s is a potential means of treatment, but finding a potent differentiation inducer for each leukemia is difficult. Therefore in order to find new therapies that specifically target LSCs and cause no side effects it is important to understand the mechanism of LSC self renewal.   The focus of this proposal to determine the gene regulatory network that mediates self renewal in CML LSCs. The significance of this proposal is that further characterization of these self regulatory network in LSCs will identify specific targets which will aid in the development of a therapy that eradicate LSCs.\n                         Towards this approach, in the second chapter we included initial studies I have done concerning the isolation and characterization of LSCs in Friend virus erythroluekemia model. Friend virus induced eryhthroleukemia is a robust model for multistage leukemogenesis and abnormal erythropoiesis. During viral pathogenesis early erythriod progenitors are infected and rapidly expanded, a process which is dependent upon interaction between the viral envelope glycoprotein gp55 and the cellular receptors, Sf-STK and Erythropoietin receptor. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that Friend virus activates bone morphogenic protein (BMP4) dependent stress erythropoiesis pathway. This leads to rapid expansion of stress erythriod progenitors, which are the targets for Friend virus in the spleen. In this chapter we show that two stages of Friend virus induced disease is caused by infection of distinct stress erythriod progenitors in the spleen.  In the initial stage Friend virus target cells will form Epo-independent  BFU-Es and in the later stage target cells will develop as LSCs. These later target cells possess intrinsic self renewal ability which is exploited by LSCs. Although mutation of p53 is thought to be an important step in Friend erythro-leukemia progression, we showed that mutation of p53 is not required for disease progression but proviral insertion into Spi1/Pu.1 is necessary. In addition Hedgehog signaling plays very important role. We were able to show that two signals are required for the self-renewal for the self-renewal of Friend virus LSCs, proviral insertional activation of Spi1/PU.1 and Hedgehog-dependent signaling. These data in chapter 2 establish a new model for Friend virus induced erythroluekemia and demonstrate the utility of Friend virus as a model system to study LSC Self-renewal.  \nIn the third chapter I extended my study to investigate LSCs in CML. For the first part of this study I established a murine model of BCR-ABL induced leukemia in our lab. We isolated CML LSCs from the spleen by sorting them with cell surface markers. We showed that CML LSC\u2019s were Lin-, Kit+, Sca1+ and CD133+. CML LSC\u2019s were further characterized by cell division status using PKH26 a membrane dye. We were able to isolate LSC population as Lin-Kit+Sca+CD34+CD133+PKH26high cells that are relatively quiescent. Transplantation of these cells caused disease in irradiated recipients, whereas Lin-Kit+Sca+CD34+CD133-PKH26low cells are progenitors which did not cause disease when transplanted. In the second part of this chapter I have focused on investigating the mechanism of the leukemia stem cell self-renewal. Here we show that Yap1, Yes associated protein 1 a human ortholog of the Drosophila Yorkie, plays an important role in self-renewal of CML LSCs. Yap1/Yorkie is the terminal target of the Hippo signaling pathway. Hippo signaling pathway regulates organ size in Drosophila. Over expression of Yap1 can transform cells and Yap1 expression is required for ES cell self renewal. We observed LSC growth inhibition in Yap1shRNA knockdown studies whereas conditions leading to induced expression of Yap1 lead to increased LSC self renewal.  Based on the results we have developed a new model for LSC self-renewal, where HH signaling promotes self-renewal by inhibiting p53 activity. Down regulation of p53 results in expression of YAP1, this results in inhibition of genes that promote differentiation and induces self-renewal.  Furthermore we show that expression of BCR-ABL inYap1 knock down cells fails to induce CML in mice. Taken together our data suggest that Yap1 could be a potential target for new therapies to eradicate CML Leukemic stem cells. This discovery of the HH-p53-Yap1 gene regulatory network and its role in LSC self renewal will help to find new target for therapeutic invention to treat CML.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9444], "author_name_tesi": "Hegde, Shailaja N", "last_name_ssi": "Hegde", "middle_name_ssi": "N", "first_name_ssi": "Shailaja", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Paulson", "Robert Paulson", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Wendy Hanna Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Paulson, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Paulson, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CML", "Hedgehog", "p53", "Yap1", "BCR-ABL"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "RECONSTRUCTION OF THE COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS OF MIXED OAK\nFORESTS\n", "id": "10591", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1422", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Oaks are some of the most ecologically and economically important tree species\nin the eastern United States.

Numerous chemical and physical phenomena are influenced by heterogeneities such as contaminant transport, mineral dissolution, weathering, soil formation, nuclear waste disposal, hydrocarbon recovery, and migration of heavy metal. For example, precise modeling of transport is crucial for remediation scenario design in the event of a contaminant spill. Additionally, understanding mineral dissolution is of great importance since weathering is a common source of some elements crucial for the oceans and other ecosystems. Mineral distributions vary from random, homogenous patterns at one end of the spectrum to clustered zones and layers at the other end, which creates chemical heterogeneity. Even in a media purely made of a single mineral, physical properties such as permeability may differ spatially, resulting in physical heterogeneity. These heterogeneous distributions affect fluid flow, transport and reaction processes. Here we experimentally and numerically investigated the effect of chemical and physical heterogeneity on fluid flow, transport and reaction in porous media. We also proposed a new reactive transport model to simulate the soil formation process from Marcellus shale parent rock, which helped us in determining the key controlling parameters of the mineral dissolution and precipitation processes in natural settings.\n\tSpatial variations in subsurface physical properties have profound impacts on flow and solute transport. It is important to understand and quantify the role of heterogeneity structure in determining effective parameters at large scales in order to precisely model processes that are affected by fluid flow and transport such as mineral dissolution. There is a consensus that spatial patterns and heterogeneity structure play a critical role in determining solute transport. Various numerical studies have identified connectivity and correlation length as key parameters that determine solute breakthrough. Although connectivity and correlation length have been found to be critical in these modeling studies, they have not been systematically examined and confirmed experimentally. Existing experimental work on solute transport has mostly focused on single spatial patterns with one correlation length. The objective of the physical heterogeneity part of this work is to systematically understand and quantify the role of correlation length in determining effective permeability and solute transport using flow cell experiments and modeling approaches.\nIn order to determine how physical heterogeneity structure, in particular correlation length, controls flow and solute transport, we used non-reactive solute transport in two-dimensional (2D) sand boxes (21.9 cm by 20.6 cm) and four modeling approaches, including 2D Advection-Dispersion Equation (ADE) with explicit heterogeneity structure, 1D ADE with average properties, and non-local Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) and fractional ADE (fADE). The goal of the physical heterogeneity part of the work was to answer two questions: 1) How and to what extent does correlation length control effective permeability and breakthrough curves (BTC)? 2) Which model can best reproduce data under what conditions? Sand boxes were packed with the same 20% (v/v) fine and 80% (v/v) coarse sands in three patterns that differ in correlation length. The Mixed cases contained uniformly distributed fine and coarse grains. The Four-zone and One-zone cases had four and one square fine zones, respectively. A total of 7 experiments were carried out with permeability variance of 0.10 (LC), 0.22 (MC), and 0.43 (HC). Experimental data show that the BTC curves depend strongly on correlation length, especially in the HC cases. The HC One-zone (HCO) case shows distinct breakthrough steps arising from fast advection in the coarse zone, slow advection in the fine zone, and slow diffusion, while the LCO and MCO BTCs do not exhibit such behavior. With explicit representation of heterogeneity structure, 2D ADE reproduces BTCs well in all cases. CTRW reproduces temporal moments with smaller deviation from data than fADE in all cases except HCO, where fADE has the lowest deviation.\n\tWell-mixed batch reactor reaction rate studies result in high dissolution rates, which are usually up to five orders of magnitude greater than field-scale rates. In the natural subsurface, solid materials of different properties are distributed unevenly with various spatial patterns. Numerous factors have been examined to explain the discrepancies between well-mixed laboratory rates and those measured in fields. Parameters such as chemical and physical heterogeneities, velocity, and flow distribution are commonly ignored in the well-mixed batch reactor rate measurements. Some modeling studies have shown that spatial distribution of minerals in porous media affects large-scale mineral dissolution. Experimental studies on the effect of spatial pattern of distribution of chemical heterogeneity on mineral dissolution reaction rate are scarce except for a few studies on magnesite dissolution rates. Large-scale dissolution rates can be affected by both physical and chemical heterogeneities. \nIn the chemical heterogeneity part of the study we examined the effect of calcite spatial distribution on its dissolution rate under various flow velocities and permeability contrast conditions. Dissolution data of reactive fluid flow (pH=4) through two-dimensional (2D) flow cells (20.0 cm by 20.0 cm) was collected. The flow cells were packed with the same amount of calcite and sand with Mixed and One-zone patterns. The Mixed case contained uniformly distributed calcite and sand grains while the One-zone case had one square calcite zone in the middle of the flow cell. The experiments were carried out at three flow rates (1.435, 7.175, 14.35 m/d) and the dissolution process was simulated using reactive transport modeling. In addition to velocity, effect of parameters such as permeability ratio (calcite permeability/sand permeability), and transverse dispersivity on calcite dissolution were examined numerically. The goal of this part of the study was to answer the following questions: 1) What is the extent of the effect of physical and chemical heterogeneities on mineral dissolution? 2) What are the parameters that control significance of mineral spatial pattern on overall dissolution?\nIn general, dissolution rates were higher in cases with higher mass transfer in the reactive zone. Increase of advective mass transfer with higher velocity or higher permeability ratio increased the rates. Increase of dispersive mass transfer with increase of transverse dispersivity also increased the rate. Four orders of magnitude of change in large-scale dissolution rate (Flow cell scale) were observed in the studied cases. The effect of spatial pattern was studied through use of a parameter \u03b2Z/M, defined as the One-zone large-scale rate divided by rate of its corresponding Mixed case. The \u03b2Z/M values normally range between 0 and 1.  Larger values of \u03b2Z/M mean lesser effect of the spatial pattern and smaller, closer to 0 values indicate significant role of heterogeneity.  Changes of transverse dispersivity (1.4\u00d710-3cm\u2013 1.4\u00d710-1cm) resulted in a \u03b2Z/M range of 0.10 \u2013 0.37. A minimum \u03b2Z/M of 0.06 was observed numerically at high velocity with low permeability ratio. While changes of permeability ratio (9.4\u00d710-4 \u2013 3.7\u00d7101) induced a \u03b2Z/M change of 0.06 to 0.88, changes of velocity (1.435\u00d710-1m/d\u2013 1.435\u00d7102m/d) did not affect \u03b2Z/M as significantly (0.15 - 0.22). The insignificant role of velocity on rate ratio was attributed to high reactivity of calcite because the solution reaches equilibrium upon contact with the reactive material at all flow velocities. Percentage of grains that participated in the dissolution reaction effectively (saturation=IAP/Keq< 0.1) increased with increase of permeability ratio and transverse dispersivity. In most cases all the effective surface area was at the calcite-sand interface except at high velocity and high permeability ratio. Under these conditions higher percentage of the total surface area was reacting effectively because advection time scale was shorter than reaction time scale and acidic inlet penetrated deeper into the reactive zone. In addition, large-scale reaction rates were related to dimensionless Peclet (Pe) and Damkohler (Da) numbers. Higher Pe and lower Da values were correlated with higher dissolution rate. Our results quantify the significance of mineral spatial distribution on reaction rates and weathering. Our results point to potential control of underlying chemical and physical heterogeneities on mineral dissolution, which can regulate ecosystem functioning and water cycling. \nTo understand controls of geochemical reaction rates in natural systems, we modeled soil formation from Marcellus shale parent rock using reactive transport modeling with laboratory measured rate laws. Marcellus Shale is a black shale formation that is rich in organic matter and pyrite. The dissolution of Marcellus shale can lead to release of heavy metals and cause significant environment problems, especially with the extensive use of hydraulic fracturing during the production of natural gas.  Here, we use soil formation and aqueous geochemistry data as constraints to understand the processes and develop a reactive transport model during Marcellus shale weathering. The simulation was carried out from approximately 10,000 years ago when the formation was first exposed after the last glacier to the present time. Our results indicated two distinct stages during the weathering. At the first 500 ~ 1,000 years, pyrite dissolved fast and Fe(OH)3 was the main precipitate. After pyrite depletion, chlorite dissolved primarily with vermiculite being the major precipitate. Field data can only be reproduced when the specific surface areas of the reactive minerals were decreased by orders of magnitude from laboratory-measured values, indicating the significantly lesser available surface area under natural conditions. Our sensitivity analysis indicated the important role of specific surface area, flow rate, and reactive gases (CO2 and O2). It was found that CO2 accelerates the weathering process and impacts pH profile and elemental concentrations in both solid and aqueous phases. In the cases with limited source of oxygen, unreacted pyrite remained in the system even after 10,000 years and ultimately dropped pH. However, the effect of O2 on the solid phase (porosity) was less than the effect of CO2. In addition, increase of flow rate increased the extent of weathering, and vice versa. However, the effects of flow rate on both solid and aqueous phases were less significant than the effect induced by changes of surface area and reactive gases.\nChemical and physical heterogeneities lead to significant spatial variations in mineralogical, geochemical, and physical properties and have profound impacts on the flow, transport, and reaction processes. Understanding these processes are crucial in many applications, including contaminant fate and transport, chemical weathering, geological carbon sequestration, environmental remediation, and energy extraction. Most studies on the effect of physical heterogeneity on solute transport have focused on porous media with short correlation length. We observed significant non-Fickian transport with long correlation length even with relatively low permeability variance. Stratified low permeability layers and clay lenses with comparable length scale as the domain length are very common in natural subsurface. In addition, we found that mineral spatial distribution can affect reaction rates up to a factor of 20. This is increasingly important in several geochemical processes that occur over geologic time. For example, weathering and soil formation directly depend on mineral dissolution. Understanding weathering can help us predict a wide variety of processes from atmospheric CO2 levels to species concentrations in oceans and ecosystems.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10459], "author_name_tesi": "Heidari, Peyman ", "last_name_ssi": "Heidari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Peyman", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Li Li", "Turgay Ertekin", "Xiaofeng Liu", "Jamal Rostami"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Li Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Xiaofeng Liu, Committee Member", "Jamal Rostami, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mineral Dissolution", "Chemical Heterogeneity", "Fluid Flow in Porous Media", "Solute Transport", "Non-Fickian Transport"]}]
