We demonstrated that the peak shifts observed in surface overlayer attenuated total reflection (SO-ATR) were a result of the changing polarization in the z-axis of the experimental geometry. We leveraged the signal enhancement provided by SO-ATR and reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) to obtain high quality spectra of samples below 50nm thick. By combining this signal enhanced spectroscopy with transmission and ATR we were able to obtain chemical and structural information which we report in this thesis.\nSpin cast NAFION samples were prepared on silicon native oxide and gold substrates with film thicknesses ranging from 5 nm to 250 nm. The influence of NAFION film thickness on the infrared spectrum of the polymer was investigated in SO-ATR geometry at incident angles between 60\u00b0 and 65\u00b0. In the grazing angle SO-ATR geometry, the thickness of the film significantly affected the position and absorbance of characteristic peaks in the FTIR spectrum of NAFION. Two major peaks in the NAFION spectrum at 1220 cm-1 (predominantly vas(CF2) and vas (SO3-)) and 1150 cm-1 (predominantly vas(CF2)), appeared to systematically blueshift to 1256 cm-1 and 1170 cm-1, respectively, as the thickness of the film decreased from 250 nm to 5 nm. The changes in the NAFION thin film FTIR spectrum can be attributed to two factors; (1) ordering of NAFION at the interface during spin coating and film formation and (2) the increase in the p-polarization character of the infrared evanescent wave as the polymer film became thinner between the attenuated total reflection (ATR) crystal and the film substrate overlayer. The increase in p-polarization resulted in an increase in characteristic peak absorbance of dipoles aligned normal to the substrate due to the overlayer enhancement of the electric field with NAFION films on Si or Au film substrates. These results show that the specific thin film sampling geometry, especially in ATR experiments, must be considered to rationally quantify changes in NAFION thin film infrared spectra.\nHighly crosslinked aromatic polyamides are of significant importance due their use in water treatment membranes. We present an FTIR study of polyamide films prepared by interfacial polymerization and molecular layer by layer deposition that are used as reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. We assign the aromatic ring modes that occur in the fingerprint region and demonstrate that the peak at 1492 cm-1 is due solely to the B1 bending stretch mode of the meta bi functionalized ring that originates from the m-phenylenediamine (MPD) molecule. We assign the peak at 1243 cm-1 to the amide N-H vibration and demonstrate that it is a good alternative to the Amide II peak for swelling studies on polyamide films. The free acid peak in mLbL samples decreases in intensity as film thickness increases which is indicative of increasing crosslink density. The free acid content in mLbL films was found to be higher than that observed in interfacially polymerized films. The growth of the initial layers of mLbL polyamide film differs on gold and silicon substrates with MPD displacing the initial monomer on gold. At cycle numbers beyond 10 however film growth on the two substrates was found to be indistinguishable. The growth rate of mLbL films is also affected by the solvent selected to rinse excess polymer with thicker films consistently observed for isopropyl alcohol rinsed films.\nMolecular layer by layer assembled polyamide films were synthesized on smooth gold and silicon wafer with native oxide substrates. The orientation of the amide C=O and disubstituted aromatic rings were analyzed using surface overlayer attenuated total reflection (SO-ATR) and reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). It was determined that on both substrates there was strong ordering for films 10 cycles thick or lower with an average tilt angle of 16\u1d52 from the surface norrmal for the C=O group and 84\u1d52. This tilt angle translates to an orientation with the aromatic ring laying close to flat on the surface with an average angle of 6\u1d52.  FTIR and NEXAFS measurements further showed high anisotropy at low cycle numbers which completely disappeared at cycle numbers greater than 60. The acid concentration in mLbL films was characterized  by interpolating integrated absorbance values  of the free acid  band at 1718cm-1 into  a calibration curve line generated  from interfacially polymerized samples of known  acid content. The acid content in samples synthesized on silicon was found to be higher than that for samples generated on gold at low cycle numbers. The acid content ranged from 0.13 mmol.g-1 for 60 cycles to 0.56 mmol.g-1 for 5 cycles on silicon substrates. On gold however, the acid content ranged from 0.12 mmol/g at 5 cycles  to 0.35 mmol/g at 12 cycles. On both substrates the acid content decreased as the cycle number increased and as the cycle number increased and at higher cycle numbers there was very little difference between the acid content of samples synthesized on gold and silicon.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13255], "author_name_tesi": " Zimudzi, Tawanda James", "last_name_ssi": " Zimudzi", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Tawanda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "John B Asbury", "Miriam Arak Freedman", "Seong Han Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Chair", "John B Asbury, Committee Member", "Miriam Arak Freedman, Committee Member", "Seong Han Kim, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vibrational Spectroscopy", "Polymer thin fims", "Reverse Osmosis membranes", "Fuel cells", "Nafion", "Aromatic Polyamides", "Physical Chemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "NO SCHOOL COUNSELOR LEFT BEHIND: COUNSELORS USE OF DATA AND THEIR PERCEIVED OBSTACLES AND FACILITATORS", "id": "db78tc00b", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13131", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Legislation such as No Child Left Behind (NCLB) of 2001 created a situation where schools use data to track and monitor student success.

The primary research question for this study was, how do school counselors involved in RAMP Data Teams, Non-RAMP Data Teams, and those not involved in data teams (No Data Teams) differ on factors surrounding their use of data?  \nThe highest impeding obstacles reported were time, availability to data teams, and data use culture.  The highest facilitative ratings reported were data skills, importance of data and access to data.  The hypothesized results were partially confirmed.  These results demonstrated that both RAMP and Non-RAMP Data Team Counselors were significantly higher than No Data Team Counselors on Love\u2019s 4 Conditions of Data-based Decision Making and the Facilitator-Obstacle Index.  This suggests that being part of a data team might be as important or more important than RAMP itself on counselors\u2019 data usage.

Non-RAMP Data Team Counselors reported using data on a weekly basis compared to RAMP Data Team Counselors and No Data Team Counselors using data on a monthly basis.

A major problem of flow assurance in natural gas pipelines is solid deposition that result in partial/complete blockages. Blockages in natural gas pipelines are mostly due to hydrate formation and deposition. The industry has adopted a handful of hydrate formation prevention techniques however there is still no known means for the complete eradication of hydrates that is applicable under all pipeline blockage scenarios. The industry is now resorting to early blockage detection techniques in order to appropriately manage blockage scenarios for economic and safety reasons. Several studies have been conducted to determine the best approach for early blockage detection. Modeling and analyzing natural gas transients for blockage characterization is one of the promising early blockage detection techniques. It is the most economical and least intrusive simply because it requires no additional instrument other than a dynamic pressure gauge which is usually already part of most modern pipeline networks.\n\nHowever, the problem with this technique lies in the resulting mathematical model. Its formulation results in a system of non-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations which have no known generalized solution. Besides, numerical techniques for solving the resulting mathematical model are computationally involved and are subject to numerical stability issues. This study explores the possibility of the use of a simple numerical technique based on finite volume method for blockage characterization.\n\nIn previous studies, pressure waves were assumed to be propagating at the speed of sound. This assumption is incorporated into the mathematical formulation by the isentropic assumption where the the pressure term within the momentum conservations flux is substituted for a function of the speed of sound. A calculated estimate of the speed of sound is then assigned prior to conducting numerical experiments. This assumption idealizes the model and causes the resulting pressure waves to propagate at sonic speed. The idealized solution and thereby affects the blockage characterization capability of the model when applied to real pipeline blockages or lab flow loop experiments. In this study, we do not make this assumption and instead the pressure one of our unknown variables. Hence the compression wave is expected to travels at its true speed.\n\nAdditionally, previous studies did not include viscous effects in their mathematical model for blockage characterization (Ahmed, 1996; Eltohami, 1999; Adewumi et al., 2000 and 2003; Chen et al., 2007). This is another assumption of ideality which further makes the solution impractical and reduces the accuracy of blockage characterization analysis. This study evaluates the effect of neglecting viscous effects on blockage characterization and a preliminary alternative equation that accounts for the effect of friction on blockage severity estimation is proposed.\n\nFurthermore, previous studies (Adewumi et al., 2000 and 2003) utilized empirical formulations (Dranchuk and Abou-Kassem, 1974) for the estimation of the compressibility factor. In this study, the mathematical formulation is a quasi-compositional Eulerian gas flow model in which the compressibility factor is estimated using the Peng-Robinson equation of state. This provides a more realistic prediction of transport properties since the composition of the gas is put into direct consideration.\n\nThe numerical techniques implemented here are specialized the for finite volume method of discretization. A staggered three-point stencil upwind scheme and a second-order centered five-point Nessyahu and Tadmor TVD scheme with MUSCL reconstruction are solved implicitly using the Newton-Raphson iterative technique. The fully implicit approach offers model stability for relatively large time steps thereby reducing the overall computational time despite the use of an iterative solver.\n\nBlockage location prediction error was found to be reduced by one order of magnitude if the actual speed of the pressure wave that is determined from the inlet pressure profile is used. If viscous effects are considered, blockage severity analysis using the linear theory equation for determining wave reflection ratio that does not account for viscous effects results in large blockage severity prediction errors. However, blockage severity prediction is improved when the analysis is made in consideration of viscous effects.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4573], "author_name_tesi": "ADELEKE, NAJEEM A.", "last_name_ssi": "ADELEKE", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "NAJEEM", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Adebola Adewumi", "Michael Adebola Adewumi", "Mku Thaddeus Ityokumbul"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Adebola Adewumi, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Adebola Adewumi, Thesis Advisor", "Mku Thaddeus Ityokumbul, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Transient Model", "Blockage", "Transient analysis", "Numerical modelling", "Hydrate", "Pipelines", "Natural Gas", "FVM", "Finite Volume Method"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Pneumatic Transport Modeling of Air/Gas Drilling Hydraulics in Horizontal and Deviated Wellbores", "id": "26245", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9291", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Optimal design of any drilling program requires a strong knowledge of drilling hydraulics. Field drilling technicians and drilling engineers designing air/gas drilling projects both typically need to know (1) the time it takes to circulate out a pill of formation material at any given depth in order to reduce drilling time (thereby reducing the cost of drilling); and (2) the optimum rate at which to flow the circulation fluid to ensure the hole is maintained free of cuttings at the minimum capacity (and thereby cost) of surface equipments. While there have been substantial studies and some established techniques for wellbore hydraulics design/analysis for conventional mud drilling, this is not the case for air/gas drilling.\n\nTo this end, a transient numerical pneumatic transport model has been developed to study air/gas drilling hydraulics. This model is based on a mono-dispersed particulate two-fluid model (TFM). The mathematical representation of the problem involves the solution to coupled non-linear hyperbolic PDE\u2019s and therefore a detailed review of monotone and higher resolution schemes for hyperbolic systems is presented. Two hyperbolic model equations: (1) The benchmark Euler equation (2) The mono-dispersed particulate Two Fluid Model (TFM) equation, are presented along with analytical expressions for their decomposed characteristics. The Euler equation is used to demonstrate the efficacy of the numerical schemes discussed. The most efficient numerical scheme is then applied to solve the TFM equation. Numerical results compared to experimental data were satisfactory.\n\nThe experimental work of Temple was used to evaluate the model for annular vertical wellbore air drilling flow conditions. Flow characteristic curves (FCC) that cover both dilute and dense phase flow conditions were generated. Simulation results showed a good match with experiments. While matching the data points in the dilute phase flow region was less precise towards the extreme end of the larger particles, the optimum flow velocity was still accurately predicted at 9.1 %AAD.\n\nUnlike vertical flow, air drilling experiments for horizontal flow pneumatic transport are difficult to come by. This applies to industry field data as well as they are usually incomplete and typically labeled as confidential information. Therefore horizontal pneumatic transport studies for food processing applications were used to evaluate the performance of the current model for horizontal and highly-deviated well systems. The area ratio correlations were incorporated into the TFM to account for the lower-side deposition and re-entrainment phenomenon peculiar to horizontal wells. While we were able to show a match in the FCC plots in the dilute flow region, it was difficult to establish a match for the dense phase region of the FCC plot. Predicted pressure drops in dense flow region of the FCC plot for horizontal systems were significantly lower than experiment. This was due to the inability of the current model formulation to account for slug flow regime typical of horizontal pneumatic transport systems transitioning from dilute to dense flow conditions.\n\nOverall, it was observed that the model is capable of predicting volumetric rate requirements and circulation time for hole cleaning in vertical wells. The model is also capable of estimating cutting circulation time in horizontal and deviated well sections while in dilute flow conditions only. However, the model was unable to accurately simulate the inherent transient behaviors expected under dense horizontal pneumatic transport. More studies need to be conducted in the area of constitutive relations specific to horizontal pneumatic transport flow regimes and empirical relations for the prediction of critical velocities. These will provide the capability of upgrading the current model for the prediction of fluid volumetric rate requirements in horizontal/highly-deviated well sections particularly under dense flow conditions.\n\nThe transient model was also used to predict circulation time for dispersed slugs of cuttings from the bottom of a well with both vertical and horizontal sections. The model results can only be trusted to predict accurately when the flow in the horizontal section is maintained within the dilute flow region. In order to ensure that the flow in the horizontal section is maintained above flow condition, we developed correlations for optimum circulation velocity using three distinct data sets for both vertical and horizontal pneumatic transport systems in the literature.

Ferroelectric / ferromagnetic materials have been increasingly used for various radio frequency and microwave frequency applications including tunable phase shifter materials, high frequency capacitors and magnetic sensors.  High dielectric constants associated with high dielectric / magnetic losses in these materials narrows down the application range of these materials.  In order to use ferroelectric materials in their full range of potential, the high frequency properties must be well understood.  One way to exploit ferroelectric / ferromagnetic materials is to tailor the dielectric and magnetic properties with the addition of certain oxide materials.  The resultant composites prepared with the addition of ferrous and oxide materials have intermediate dielectric and magnetic properties, thereby making these materials more suitable for device implementation and expanding the application range.  The focus of this research has been the development of novel composite materials with (a) tunable dielectric and (b) of superior magneto-electric properties.\nIn this research work, ferroelectric components were ceramic materials (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 (x = 0.4, 0.5, 0.6) &#8594; BST and (Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3)1-x:(PbTiO3)x (x = 0.31) &#8594; PMN-PT.  The composites for tunable applications were prepared with MgO as non-ferroelectric phase, and for magneto-electric applications magnetic/ferrite materials CoFe2O4, NiMn0.1Fe1.9O4 and Mn0.1Zn0.9Fe2O4 were used.  The composites were prepared with the combination of both micron and nano size particles to investigate the grain size effect and distribution of grains on the dielectric and magneto-electric properties of the resultant composites.  The composite samples were processed with both conventional and microwave sintering techniques to study the grain growth and connectivity pattern during sintering process.  Characterization studies were performed to determine the grain size and phase distribution and electrical properties of composites.  Microwave dielectric properties were carried out using modified cavity perturbation technique at ~ 3 GHz to examine the dielectric loss studies in the composite materials.\nThe aim of the research was to develop composite materials for low temperature and room temperature applications in the high frequency areas.  For tunable dielectric materials, (Ba1-x,Srx)TiO3 (BST) with various weight ratios with cubic-tetragonal phase transition peak below or around room temperature were used.  Micron sized Ba0.4Sr0.6TiO3 and Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 and nano size Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 were used for ferroelectric phase and both micron and nano sized MgO was used as non-ferroelectric phase.  The magneto-electric composites were prepared with both micron sized Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 and PMN-PT as ferroelectric/piezoelectric phase and CoFe2O4 (nano), NiMn0.1Fe1.9O4 (micron) and Mn0.1Zn0.9Fe2O4 (nano) as magnetic components.\nThe ferroelectric composite materials were processed using multi mode microwave sintering technique.  The microwave sintering resulted in lower sintering time compared to the conventional sintering and also the higher density composites with good connectivity of grains.  The connectivity pattern of 0-3 was obtained in the resulted composites with good connectivity of ferroic grains and isolating the non-ferroelectric grains giving very low dielectric constant and appreciable tunability.  Using nano particle size of both BST and MgO, a maximum tunability of 48 % at 80 KV/cm was achieved with dielectric constant of 89 at 200 K at 100 KHz.  The microwave sintering resulted in very dense composites and low dielectric losses providing composites with high break down strength.  The maximum DC electric field applied to the samples was 80 KV/cm.  The addition of MgO resulted in the shift of maximum dielectric peak to lower phase transition temperature without shifting the ferroelectric nature of BST.  Additional experiments were carried out for pyroelectric measurements to confirm the phase transitions temperatures in the composites.  High frequency measurements were done at room temperature with modified cavity perturbation technique where a special cavity was designed to measure samples of very small sizes.  At 3 GHz, the dielectric loss observed in the BST:MgO composites were ~ 0.007.\nThe magneto-electric composites were processed using both conventional and single mode microwave heating technique.  In a single mode microwave system, the samples were sintered in either electric field (E-field) or magnetic field (H-field).  The respective sintering in E-field and H-field resulted in different magneto-electric properties as different connectivity patterns can be achieved with single mode microwave processing.  H-field processing resulted in lower sintering temperature by 125 0C than used in conventional sintering.  The magnetic component in magneto-electric composites couples faster in H-field thus lowering the sintering temperature and providing better sintered composite materials.  The composites processed with microwave sintering showed minimum or no chemical reactivity and lower PbO loss compared to conventional sintering process.  PMN-PT (31%):NiMn0.1Fe1.9O4 (60:40) composite showed the maximum magneto-electric coefficient of 520 mV/cm Oe for single mode H-field sintering compared to 430 mV/cm Oe for the composite sintered in conventional sintering.\nFinally, the microwave sintering process has been studied to examine the absorption rate of microwaves with different materials depending on their properties.  The different sintering profiles in E-field and H-field have been studied for composite materials and an attempt has been made in the thesis to describe the reasons of different sintering patterns of electronic composite materials with different constituent materials.\nThis research work clearly showed the potential of microwave sintering in the processing of ferroic composite materials with better properties.  Also, the initial grain size influences the connectivity pattern and the resulted dielectric/magneto-electric properties of ceramic composite materials, have been demonstrated.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5906], "author_name_tesi": "AGRAWAL, SHASHNK ", "last_name_ssi": "AGRAWAL", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "SHASHNK", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Amar S Bhalla", "Ruyan Guo", "Dinesh Kumar Agrawal", "Michael T Lanagan", "Jiping Cheng"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Amar S Bhalla, Committee Chair", "Ruyan Guo, Committee Chair", "Dinesh Kumar Agrawal, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Jiping Cheng, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["magneto-electric properties", "dielectric properties", "meta-materials", "electroceramics", "Composite materials", "micron/nano particles", "tunable materials", "microwave sintering"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE CHALLENGES AND PROMISES OF APPLYING INTENTIONAL CHILD OBSERVATION STRATEGIES: A MULTIPLE CASE STUDY OF SIX KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS IN SAUDI ARABIA\n\n", "id": "8940", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4787", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this qualitative method case study was to explore teachers\u2019 observational practices and beliefs about child narrative observation.

Teachers\u2019 classroom practices were seen via participant observations in the first phase. Qualitative structured individual and group interviews, field notes, and teachers' personal logs were used in this multiple case study to generate the data set and for narrative assessment analysis. In accordance with the literature on child-observation which asserts that systematic narrative observation facilitates the establishment of a quality relationship between the teacher and the child (Howes & Ritchie, 2002; Jablon, Dombro, & Dichtelmiller, 2007), the second phase included an intentional observation (IO) program designed by the author. The whole study lasted nine weeks, including both field observation and training in the IO program, which is a training program with distinct steps designed to foster observational skills, sensitivities, and behaviors in teachers.\nBefore the researcher provided IO training, the six teachers drew their own logos and sketches of the children, and wrote lines of poetry describing the children. These activities were included to encourage the teachers to talk about individual children who were participating in the study; they were also encouraged to speak about their perceptions of and beliefs about teaching in early childhood education (ECE). Each teacher was interviewed three times over the course of the study upon completing the Student-Teacher Relationship Scale (STRS) (Pianta, 2001) for the five children in her\niv\nclassroom chosen for the case study. The STRS was administered to generate some of the interview questions about assessing and working with individual children. The participant teachers\u2019 satisfaction with and perceived usefulness of the IO training program were estimated via interviews. Finally, more information was gained in a reflective group dialogue session upon the termination of the study. Estimates of satisfaction with the program and its potential were based mainly on teachers\u2019 self-reported changes in their perspectives, along with discernible change patterns that surfaced over time in their personal logs. The data were used to describe the teachers\u2019 beliefs and practices. Results showed that five teacher-participants believed they were improving their relationship with their students, as well as their self-conceptualization and confidence as teachers. The sixth teacher was an exception\u2014 she, occasionally, showed resistance to apply the techniques, citing job demands. This study suggests that IO may be a useful means of enhancing a teacher\u2019s feeling of self-worth. The program might help the teacher to establish a better relationship with children, as well as being useful in improving teachers\u2019 attitudes towards and practices relating to ECE and the teacher-child relationship in ECE settings. Many challenges exist in applying the IO program in Saudi Arabia. Educational administrations have high expectations and make demands of teachers, requiring them to perform in certain ways. Another major challenge is the resistance of some teachers to surrender their pre-existing perceptions of and values relating to the nature of child-teacher interaction.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4764], "author_name_tesi": "AL-RABIAH, NADA YOUSEF", "last_name_ssi": "AL-RABIAH", "middle_name_ssi": "YOUSEF", "first_name_ssi": "NADA", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr James Johnson", "James Ewald Johnson", "Gregory John Kelly", "Jolynn Carney", "Robert James Stevens"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr James Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "James Ewald Johnson, Committee Chair", "Gregory John Kelly, Committee Member", "Jolynn Carney, Committee Member", "Robert James Stevens, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CHILD OBSERVATION", "TEACHER-CHILD RELATIONSHIP", "TEACHER TRAINING"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "NEW STIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR ULTRA-TIGHT GAS SANDSTONES\n", "id": "11769", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3527", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tight gas reservoirs are expected to contribute significantly to the gas and energy supply all over the world. One of the needed improvements in reservoir stimulation technology is in the advancement of fracturing fluids and techniques that can help create long and highly conductive fractures and reduce phase trapping at the face of the fracture.

Unfortunately most fracture fluids currently deployed are aqueous based owing to their ease of preparation and low cost. This research study aims to design a fracture treatment one that achieves a balance of minimal fluid retention, optimal fracture geometry and low cost for ultra-tight gas reservoirs.\n\nIn this paper, a dataset of reservoir properties, petrophysical properties, and fracture treatment parameters has been developed based on a complete review of published geological and engineering data of ultra-tight gas reservoir. Then based on numerical parametric studies, the effect of pertinent design factors on hydraulic fracture propagation and geometry is quantified with a fracture simulator.

The trapped fluid affects the mobility of hydrocarbons during clean-up and production. Additionally, the fracturing fluid filtrate  near wellbore and fracture region is one of variable composition and can  induce alterations in rock-fluid and fluid-fluid interactions. The concomitant changes in multiphase permeability during fluid invasion and clean-up is one that is not fully understood.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the role fracturing fluid filtrate composition has on the evolution of multiphase permeability during imbibition and drainage of the aqueous phase. In this work, multiphase flow of fracturing fluid filtrate in low permeability sandstones was investigated by means of laboratory experiments for three commonly employed fracturing fluids. The multiphase flow experiments were conducted using brine, helium and filtrate from various fracturing fluids in sandstones cores of different permeabilities. The alteration of rock-fluid properties and changes in interfacial tension in the presence of gas was determined by evaluation of the obtained relative permeability curves to both gas and liquid/filtrate phase. Experimental results indicate that there was a reduction in end-point and liquid phase relative permeability following imbibition of slickwater into the core sample. The liquid phase relative permeability decreases with increasing concentration of friction reducer (Polyacrylamide solution) present in the fluid system. Adsorption flow experiments with slickwater confirm the adsorption of polyacrylamide molecules to the pore walls of the rock sample and results in increased wettability of the rock sample. This process was found to increase liquid trapping potential of the rock surface. For linear and crosslinked gels, filtrate composition does not have a significant effect on liquid relative permeability during fluid invasion due to limited polymer invasion into the core.\nThis study also investigated the effect of alcohol and surfactant used as remediation additives on multiphase permeability evolution with different fracturing fluid systems. Multiphase permeability flow tests were conducted to determine, understand and quantify the mechanisms that govern multiphase permeability evolution using alcohols and surfactants to remediate aqueous phase trapping. Methanol and two surfactant chemicals, Novec FC-4430 and Triton X-100 were used as remediation additives in this study.\nResults from multiphase permeability flow tests conducted with methanol indicated that the volume of liquid removed by displacement increases with methanol concentrations for all fracturing fluids. This is attributed to increased liquid mobility from addition of methanol during the displacement process. Interfacial tension does not contribute to multiphase permeability during the displacement phase. Additionally, friction reducer alters the flow properties of the trapped liquid as indicated by increased surface tension, lower volumes of liquid removed and lower gas endpoint permeability at the same methanol concentration for cores saturated with slickwater. Majority of the improvement in gas permeability from methanol addition is by evaporation of the trapped liquid phase and is caused by increased volatility of the fracturing fluid. Results from multiphase permeability flow tests conducted with surfactant indicated that multiphase permeability evolution is driven by wettability alteration of the rock surface.  Pretreatment of core sample with Novec FC-4430 before flooding with fracturing fluid results in best gas permeability improvement and liquid recovery. Triton X-100 did not improve gas permeability or liquid recovery during cleanup. Findings from this study can be used to optimize fracturing fluid and additive selection for field applications. Multiphase permeability data obtained is also useful for model assisted analysis of post fractured production performance in low permeability reservoirs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11629], "author_name_tesi": "Abaa, Kelvin Nder", "last_name_ssi": "Abaa", "middle_name_ssi": "Nder", "first_name_ssi": "Kelvin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mku Thaddeus Ityokumbul", "Yilin Wang", "Derek Elsworth", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mku Thaddeus Ityokumbul, Dissertation Advisor", "Yilin Wang, Committee Chair", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multiphase", "Filtrate", "Fracturing", "Permeability", "Sandstones"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Effect of Multi-phase Flow on Recovery of Fracture Fluid and Gas in Marcellus Shale Reservoirs", "id": "21276", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8683", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nHydraulic fracture treatment of shale gas wells does not always yield the expected folds of increase in gas production. Low production rates could be attributed to a number of factors like proppant crushing, proppant diagenesis, clay swelling and rock-fluid interactions based on previous work (Osholake, Wang, Ertekin, 2011; Yue, 2012). In this research work, we evaluated the effect of multi-phase flow, capillary pressure, length of shut-in time and proppant crushing on performances of hydraulically fractured Marcellus Shale wells. To accomplish this, a 2-dimensional, 2-phase water-gas model was developed using a commercial software. Three hydraulic fracture (HF1, HF2, HF3) with different network sizes were used to simulate the effect of the above factors on long-term gas production and fracture fluid recovery from hydraulically fractured Marcellus wells. Two types of proppants were used to evaluate the effect of conductivity on the impact of the factors being studied. \n With high conductivity 20/40 ceramics proppant in the hydraulic fractures, long term gas production was not affected by any of the factors studied. With 20/40 ceramics fracture fluid recovery on the other hand was affected by all the factors studied. Shut-in time had the greatest effect on fracture fluid recovery. Less than 1% of the fracture fluid used for treating the well was recovered after 1-year shut-in. \nWith the less conductive 100 mesh sand, long term gas production and fracture fluid recovery were affected by some of the factors studied. Multi-phase flow and proppant crushing were found to decrease cumulative gas production. Effect of proppant crushing on gas production was greater compared to multi-phase flow. In twenty years of production, multi-phase flow decreased gas production by 1.8%, 2.2% and 3.9% in HF1, HF2 and HF3 respectively while proppant crushing decreased gas production by 3.5%, 3.9% and 5.8% in HF1, HF2 and HF3 respectively. Capillary pressure had little or no effect on long-term gas production, but was observed to delay gas peak during initial production. Long term gas production was unaffected by shut-in time. Fracture fluid recovery was decreased by high capillary pressure, increased shut-in time and proppant crushing. After one year of shut-in, less than 1 % of fracture fluid was recovered. \nThe new understanding helps engineers design better treatment and flowback operation in Marcellus.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8557], "author_name_tesi": "Abah, Alphonsus Igoche", "last_name_ssi": "Abah", "middle_name_ssi": "Igoche", "first_name_ssi": "Alphonsus", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yilin Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yilin Wang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydraulic", "fracture", "fracturing", "marcellus", "proppant", "multi-phase flow", "shut-in", "capillary pressure"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Preliminary Testing of a 17.8-GHz Microwave Electrothermal Thruster for Small Spacecraft", "id": "26633", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11195", "abstract_tesi": "CubeSats are small satellites that conform to combinations of a standard 10\u00d710\u00d710 cm form factor.

As such, a great deal of research has examined ways to prevent or limit underage alcohol use and associated negative consequences.  An emerging body of literature has shown parenting characteristics to be predictive of decreased alcohol use across the transition to college.  The present study sought to expand upon this research through the use of a holistic, person-centered approach in order to accomplish three distinct research aims: (1) identify groups of college students with unique profiles of perceived parenting characteristics and compare these profiles on college alcohol use and experienced negative consequences; (2) identify groups of college students with unique profiles of alcohol-related correlates and compare these profiles on college alcohol use and experienced negative consequences; and (3) examine the extent to which profiles of perceived parenting characteristics are associated with profiles of college alcohol-related risk.  \nA sample of 1,153 first-year university students between 17 and 23 years-of-age were assessed on a host of perceived parenting and personal alcohol-related items.  Four profiles of perceived parenting characteristics were found using latent profile analysis (LPA):  (1) High Quality; Average Modeling and Approval, (2) Low Approval; Average Modeling and Quality, (3) Low Modeling, Approval, and Quality, and (4) High Modeling and Approval; Low Quality.  Follow-up analyses revealed that individuals in the High Modeling and Approval; Low Quality profile were inclined to experience significantly higher levels of alcohol use and associated negative consequences later in college, whereas individuals in the High Quality; Average Modeling and Approval profile appeared to be associated with the least risky alcohol-related outcomes across profiles.  Five profiles of student alcohol-related characteristics were also found using LPA: (1) Abstainers, (2) Past Drinkers, (3) Light Drinkers, (4) Moderate Drinkers, and (5) High Risk Drinkers.  Latent transition analysis illustrated that students who perceived their parents as High Modeling and Approval; Low Quality had much higher probabilities of belonging in the Moderate Drinker or High Risk Drinker profiles than students in all other perceived parenting profiles.  \nSeveral findings have important implications relevant for researchers, interested parents, and prevention scientists.  For example, results indicated that modeling parenting across the transition to college as a categorical latent variable may be an appropriate alternative to modeling it as a collection of continuous latent characteristics.  Parents may benefit from the finding that, in addition to alcohol-specific parenting characteristics, parent-teen relationship quality may also be integral in the prevention of college alcohol misuse. Finally, parents and teens in this study evidenced important complexity in observed patterns of parenting and alcohol behaviors, such that profiles could be interpreted as qualitatively distinct types of individuals. These unique profiles suggest that a targeted approach reflecting the profiles found in the current study might greatly enhance prevention program efficacy.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [943], "author_name_tesi": "Abar, Caitlin C", "last_name_ssi": "Abar", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Caitlin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Lianne Maggs", "Jennifer Lianne Maggs", "Robert James Turrisi", "Doug Coatsworth", "Edward A Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Lianne Maggs, Dissertation Advisor", "Jennifer Lianne Maggs, Committee Chair", "Robert James Turrisi, Committee Chair", "Doug Coatsworth, Committee Member", "Edward A Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["parenting influences", "college", "alcohol use"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Approach and avoidance sexual motives: Associations with risky sexual behavior in emerging adulthood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "9295", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6042", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to explore the associations between approach and avoidance sexual motives and risky sexual behavior among emerging adults. Sexuality exploration is a salient developmental task during emerging adulthood (Arnett, 1992; Lefkowitz & Gillen, 2005), as they become more aware of their sexual motives and are better able to report them (Cooper, Shapiro, & Powers, 1998). Emerging adults endorse a variety of motives for engaging in or avoiding risky sexual behaviors (Cooper et al.; Meston & Buss, 2007; Patrick, Maggs, Cooper, & Lee, 2008). The approach-avoidance framework (Elliot & Covington, 2001) may be useful in understanding sexual decision making during emerging adulthood. Approach motives (i.e., intimacy, enhancement, coping) lead individuals toward sexual behaviors, whereas avoidance motives (i.e., health, values, readiness) lead individuals away from sexual behaviors. Despite known gender differences in approach and avoidance sexual motives (Cooper et al.; Impett, Peplau, & Gable, 2000; Meston & Buss; Patrick, Maggs, & Abar, 2007), it remains unknown whether gender moderates the association between specific motives and risky sexual behavior. Concepts of gender socialization and internalization suggest gender moderates the association between motives and sexual behavior. Given that men and women are socialized in different ways regarding gender appropriate sexual behavior (Tolman, 2006), the internalization of traditional roles may differentially influence men\u2019s and women\u2019s sexual motives, risky sexual behavior, and their association. Hence, the current study built on the approach-avoidance motivation framework and gender socialization theory to explore associations between sexual motives and risky sexual behavior and test whether gender moderates these associations. Two hundred and thirty sexually active college students (ages 20 \u2013 23) answered questions about their approach and avoidance motives for risky sexual behavior. Results revealed that approach and avoidance motives were differentially associated with sexual behaviors and that gender moderated some of these associations. Among approach motives, men who endorsed enhancement motives more reported more casual partners than men who endorsed enhancement motives less and women. In addition, women who endorsed coping motives more reported more frequent condom use than women who endorsed coping motives less and men. However for avoidance motives, the pattern of associations was not as predicted. Although gender moderated the associations between value motives and more sexual partners and number of casual sexual partners, this association was in the opposite direction of the hypotheses. Men who endorsed value motives more reported more sexual partners and more casual sexual partners than men who endorsed value motives less and women. Gender also moderated the association between readiness motives and number of casual sexual partners, however the association was significant for men rather than women. None of the avoidance motives predicted frequency of birth control or condom use, nor did gender moderate this association. This study contributes to the understanding of sexual decision-making during emerging adulthood through the use of an approach-avoidance motivation framework. The results have implications for prevention programs that aim to reduce risk and increase safer sex behaviors.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6035], "author_name_tesi": "Abarca, Sandra Yanet", "last_name_ssi": "Abarca", "middle_name_ssi": "Yanet", "first_name_ssi": "Sandra", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["J Douglas Coatsworth", "Eva Sharon Lefkowitz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["J Douglas Coatsworth, Thesis Advisor", "Eva Sharon Lefkowitz, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["gender", "sexual motives", "emerging adults"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DETERMINATION OF CRICONDENTHERM, CRICONDENBAR AND CRITICAL POINTS USING ANN\n", "id": "9165", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6719", "abstract_tesi": "One of the major challenges of constructing a phase envelope is to be able to locate certain key points.

Herring along with Alonzo J. Aden, his former student and colleague at Howard University, opened the Barnett Aden Gallery within the modest home they shared in Washington, D.C. As founders of one of the first black-owned galleries in the nation, their mission was to provide an exhibition space for talented artists without regard to ethnicity or national origin. During the next twenty-five years, the Barnett Aden Gallery became a unique site for cross-cultural exchange\u2014where artists, writers, musicians, and politicians of all races met freely for social, professional, and aesthetic discourse\u2014one of few such places in severely segregated Washington, D.C.\n\n\tThe Barnett Aden performed the traditional gallery function of featuring talented emerging artists, but it provided a critical service for African American artists, who had few opportunities to show their work in parity with white artists or even to see evidence of their existence within established art institutions. By placing their work alongside that of honored black predecessors, such as Henry Ossawa Tanner, Edward Bannister, and Meta Warrick Fuller, the gallery validated their artistic identity and situated them within an art historical tradition. \n\n\tIn this dissertation I assert that the Barnett Aden Gallery carried out even broader psychological and ideological tasks for the artists, the patrons, the gallery owners, and the art community of Washington, D.C. By situating exhibitions within their home (rather than using the pristine white rooms favored by many galleries), Herring and Aden literally brought home the idea that artistic creativity was inherently part of the African American experience, and, at the same time, enhanced their own status as members of the black intellectual elite of the city. The domestic environment and the integrated atmosphere altered the viewing experience of the spectators and broadened their outlook toward art and its creators. Through their exhibition policies and their collaboration with established art institutions, the gallery owners created a unique cultural space and set the stage for development of a surprisingly integrated art community in an otherwise racially divided city. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2675], "author_name_tesi": "Abbott, Janet Gail", "last_name_ssi": "Abbott", "middle_name_ssi": "Gail", "first_name_ssi": "Janet", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joyce Henri Robinson", "Joyce Henri Robinson", "Sarah K Rich", "Joan Landes", "Charlotte Marie Houghton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joyce Henri Robinson, Dissertation Advisor", "Joyce Henri Robinson, Committee Chair", "Sarah K Rich, Committee Chair", "Joan Landes, Committee Member", "Charlotte Marie Houghton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["African American art galleries", "African American art", "art gallery"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Molecular Simulations of Nanoporous Glassy Materials", "id": "19576", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9150", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microporous materials have pores smaller than 2 nanometers in size, which show enhanced adsorption of small molecules (e.g., methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen) due to interactions with multiple pore walls. As such, these materials are of interest for gas storage and separations applications, including natural gas storage for on-board vehicular storage or the capture of carbon dioxide generated from burning fossil fuels. The performance of microporous materials is closely tied to nanoscale properties, such as pore sizes, accessible surface area, and total pore volume, but the current limitations in characterization techniques prohibit a clear understanding of their structures at this level. Molecular simulations can provide necessary insight into molecular-level structure and phenomena in this regard, complementary to experiments. Unfortunately, however, the generation of accurate molecular models of amorphous microporous materials is a non-trivial problem due to their complex structures.\n\nThis dissertation presents the development of computational methodologies for accurately simulating amorphous, microporous materials. In particular, a general algorithm for constructing models of amorphous polymers by a simulated polymerization approach is discussed. This algorithm, termed Polymatic, has been released as open-source code for the benefit of the community. The presented structure generation techniques are validated for a wide range of linear and network polymers through comparison of structural, thermal, and adsorptive properties with available experimental data. Moreover, utilizing these methodologies, the structure-property relationships for amorphous microporous materials are studied extensively. For instance, the porosity of network polymers is shown to increase significantly with larger degrees of crosslinking, but decrease when the crosslinking is performed at higher densities. The molecular-level detail is also exploited to provide interpretation and analysis of experimental data, including peak assignment of X-ray scattering patterns to specific structural elements. Lastly, a computational screening of an array of intrinsically microporous materials is utilized to reveal important design principles for increasing porosity in these types of materials, namely rigidity, bulky end groups, and three-dimensionality, allowing for a directed approach to designing new materials.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8971], "author_name_tesi": "Abbott, Lauren Jeanine", "last_name_ssi": "Abbott", "middle_name_ssi": "Jeanine", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Coray M Colina", "Ralph H Colby", "James Patrick Runt", "Scott Thomas Milner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Coray M Colina, Dissertation Advisor", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Scott Thomas Milner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["molecular simulations", "polymers", "microporous materials", "intrinsic microporosity", "gas adsorption", "polymatic"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Influence of Natural Sounds on Attention Restoration", "id": "26421", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11410", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The evolution of internet, smartphones and tablets allow us to constantly be connected with work, friends, family, etc. The distractions of these technologies, along with a longer work week and little time for rest and relaxation, can cause mental fatigue.

Our results showed that \u2018Arnold\u2019, \u2018Taurino\u2019, and \u2018Maxifort\u2019 had the highest survival rates. Most self-grafted plants had lower survival rates than the hetero-grafts. Genotypes with excellent survival rates were selected for salinity screening.\n\nIn the screening experiment, 21 wild and cultivated genotypes were treated with 0, 50, 100, 150 mM NaCl for 16 days. \u2018Ironman\u2019 was the most vigorous genotype. \u2018LA3120\u2019 was less vigorous than \u2018Ironman\u2019 under salinity but limited Na+ transport to the shoot, whereas \u2018LA1630\u2019 transported more Na+ to the shoot. Genotypes with high vigor and/or low shoot DW reduction under NaCl treatments were selected as potential rootstocks.\nIn the grafting experiment, grafted plants were treated with 0 or 75 mM NaCl for 25 days. Under salinity, percent reduction of shoot DW ranged from ~-4% in Moneymaker/Resistar to ~40% in Moneymaker/Ironman. \u2018Moneymaker\u2019 /\u2018AR\u2019 was the most vigorous combination. \u2018Moneymaker\u2019/\u2018LA1630\u2019 had the highest leaf Na+ concentration, whereas \u2018Moneymaker\u2019/\u2018LA3120\u2019 had the lowest leaf Na+ concentration. Rootstock had a key role in controlling the salt tolerance mechanism of the scion.\nIn the sap experiment, Na+ and K+ concentrations were measured in the stem sap below and above the graft union. Plants were grown for 10 days under 75 mM NaCl treatment. Most grafted plants had lower sap Na+ concentrations than in non-grafts. In hetero-grafts, sap Na+ concentration was higher in the below- graft segment than in the above-graft segment. Self-grafts, had similar Na+ concentrations in the two positions. In all graft combinations, K+: Na+ ratio was higher in the above-graft segment than in the below graft segment.\n\nThese studies show that the extent and mechanisms of salt tolerance vary among commercial tomato cultivars, and that grafting of compatible genotypes helps restrict Na+ movement to the shoot.

Automated devices have been developed, such as that developed by World Health Technologies (WHT) for a malaria parasite blood smear reader, but have not been thoroughly validated. The objective of this research was to evaluate the WHT automated device through comparison with microscopy. A crude assessment of the sensitivity and specificity was based on the presence or absence of malaria parasite using a set of blood smear slides standardized according to the World Health Organization (WHO), (n= 55), which consists of patient derived slides, 20 of which are positive for malaria, 20 are negative for malaria and 15 are plasmodium falciparum positive control slides. In addition 150 blood smear slides of unknown status were available from the Household Survey in Equatorial Guinea. Each slide was analyzed by the microscopy and for all positive slides, the particular species were determined. A square-root transformation of the counts was calculated prior to the comparison of methods. For the WHO slides, the WHT device resulted in 88.6% sensitivity (For the Household Survey slides, sensitivity was 100% (95% CI = 0.75-1.00) and specificity was 94% (95% CI = 0.90-0.99).  The findings showed different results regarding the sensitivity and specificity performance of the WHT device between the WHO slides and Household Survey slides, but they are comparable to the performance of humans.

The intersection of culture and contemporary architecture through textiles is most evident in museum settings. Developing display techniques and architectural venues for historical textiles in museums is to be achieved. Hence, an architecture that transpires in the present while participating in the rendition of the past is reconsidered. \n\nA study of the textiles that prospered throughout the Egyptian timeline belonging to the Pharaonic, Ptolemaic, Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic epochs, is conducted. Analysis and critique of three nineteenth century textile theories - by architects John Ruskin, Gottfried Semper, and Owen Jones - are carried out with the purpose of generating a more communicative, non-traditional approach to textile representation. Each of these theorists has a drastically different approach of relating textiles to architecture, to the very initiation of civilization, and to other forms of arts and ornamentations respectively. From the ideologies of the authors, one could assert that the specificities, techniques, and tales of the textiles are those which communicate their significance and meaning. Revealing textile semantics would enable new ways of refining and developing their displays. The haptic dimension is a factor if considered, many textile characteristics would be revealed. These tactile qualities are unfeasible to discern just through visuality. Consequently, the current role and the architecture of the museum are challenged. \n\nOnce textiles\u2019 subject-related matters are answered. The larger architectural milieu is then considered, which brings space syntax into discussion. The spatial discourse and adjacencies of textile exhibitions shape the experience of visitors.

As curation processes and museum management strategies may differ from one institution to the other, especially if from different cultural backgrounds: Western vs. Eastern, they are further explored through personal interviews with curators from each institution. The differences and similarities in the two case studies are then assessed through a comparative analysis. Moreover, a proposed series of textile exhibitions as an addition to the MET is used as a test design to further explore some of the discussed theories. \n\nBeyond the technical preservation and conservation measures, the concept of whether textile exhibitions should function as blank vessels of history or as living artifacts that reflect the contemporariness of existence through the translation of the subjected culture is debated.

However, the properties of this material must be modified in order to increase its energy conversion efficiency. For example, the wide bandgap of TiO2 (~ 3.0 eV for rutile and 3.2 eV for anatase) limits its absorption to UV radiation, which accounts for only &#8776; 5% of the solar spectrum energy. Also, despite many efforts, it remains a major challenge to successfully convert the amorphous walls of the as-fabricated TiO2 nanotubes to crystalline walls while simultaneously retaining the barrier layer at a minimal thickness. The barrier layer formed during high temperature crystallization acts to hinder electron transfer in applications such as water photoelectrolysis, which in turn leads to reduction in the overall water splitting efficiency. The oxide growth from the underlying Ti foil layer can percolate up and destroy the tube morphology with very high temperature anneals. These properties are believed to be among the critical factors limiting the efficient use of this material especially in photoelectrochemical applications. \n\n\nThe important question is; how can TiO2 be modified so as to achieve the requisite performance as a photoelectrode? The primary focus of this dissertation was to improve the properties of the anodically fabricated TiO2 nanotube arrays; notably its band gap and crystallinity while retaining its tubular structure unaffected. The underlying hypothesis was that controlling the crystallinity and band gap while retaining the tubular structure will result in an enormous enhancement of the photoconversion capability of the material. To this end, a direct one-step facile approach for the in-situ doping of TiO2 nanotube arrays during their electrochemical fabrication in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes has been investigated. The effect of doping on the morphology, optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the fabricated nanotube arrays is discussed. Upon the use of different cathode materials for the anodization of titanium, it was possible to dope TiO2 with various metal ions which were found to enhance the optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the material. The highest photoconversion efficiency of 6.9% under UV illumination (320-400 nm) was recorded for a ~2.5&#956;m-sample prepared using a Fe cathode. In another set of experiments, mixtures of H2O2 and HCl in ethylene glycol electrolytes were found to drive modest amounts of carbon within the resulting TiO2 structures which in turn led to an enhancement of the optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the resulted material as well. The highest Air Mass (AM) 1.5 spectrum efficiency of 0.42% was recorded for ~ 6 &#956;m-sample prepared in EG-containing electrolyte in the presence of 0.5M HCl and 0.4M H2O2. This is ~15% more efficient than that reported for 30 &#956;m long undoped TiO2 nanowires under AM 1.5 (5M KOH, 0.61VSCE) although our sample is 5 times shorter and tested in less concentrated KOH electrolyte. The incorporation of these ions into the TiO2 nanotube arrays during their synthesis gives rise to the possibility of in-situ bandgap engineering of the material during its fabrication without any structural collapse. These results showed the validity of the hypothesis that doping the material while retaining its tubular structure enhances its photoactivity. \n\n\nIn an effort to improve the crystallinity of the anodically fabricated TiO2 nanotube arrays while retaining the tubular morphology, novel processing routes have been investigated to fabricate crystalline TiO2 nanotube array electrodes. For the sake of comparison, the nanotubes were annealed at high temperature using the conventionally used procedure. The samples were found to be stable up to temperatures around 580 \u00b0C, however, higher temperatures resulted in crystallization of the titanium support which disturbed the nanotube architecture, causing it to partially and gradually collapse and densify. The maximum photoconversion efficiency for water splitting using 7 &#956;m-TiO2 nanotube arrays electrodes annealed at 580 \u00b0C was measured to be about 10% under UV illumination. \n\n\nCould we enhance the photoelectrochemical properties of the material via any subsequent treatment?  To this end, we investigated the effect of  subsequent low temperature crystallization step. Combining high temperature furnace annealing with a 140\u00b0C (&#8776; 50 psi) ethanol vapor treatment successfully enhanced the photoconversion efficiency by about 30% under UV illumination and 40% under full AM 1.5 illumination. Despite this improvement, the barrier layer thickness was still the same as that of the thermally annealed sample. Consequently, it was believed that finding a technique which could be used to crystallize the nanotubes either at short time intervals and/or low temperature would result in better crystallinity of the tube walls as well as in a minimal barrier layer thickness which in turn would result in an enhancement of the photoconversion efficiency. Consequently, the possibility of both avenues has been investigated, i.e. the possibility of crystallizing the nanotubes at low temperature and/or at short time. Rapid infrared (IR) annealing was found to be an efficient technique for crystallizing the nanotube array films within a few minutes.  The IR-annealed 7&#956;m-nanotube array films showed significant photoconversion efficiencies (&#61544;=13.13%) upon their use as photoanodes to photoelectrochemically split water under UV illumination. This was related, in part, to the reduction in the barrier layer thickness from 1100 nm for the thermally annealed sample down to 200 nm for the IR-annealed sample under same conditions. These results support the hypothesis that reducing the barrier layer thickness would result in better performance of the material.  Could the fabrication temperature and in turn the barrier layer thickness be reduced any more? With this in mind, the possibility of low temperature crystallization was investigated with the hypothesis that this route might result in even thinner barrier layer. \n\n\nRegarding the possibility of low temperature crystallization, this dissertation encompasses the first report on low-temperature synthesis of crystalline TiO2 nanotube arrays. Nanotube arrays of up to 1.4 &#956;m length using a two-step process have been demonstrated.  The two-step process consists of initial treatment of the Ti foil in an oxidizing agent (H2O2 or (NH4)2S2O8)-containing electrolytes, followed by potentiostatic anodization of the resulting foil in NH4F-containing electrolytes. The as-synthesized crystalline nanotube arrays were successfully tested as anode electrodes for water photoelectrolysis, with performances comparable to samples annealed at high temperatures, and for liquid junction dye (N 719 dye)-sensitized solar cells. The photoconversion efficiencies for the as-synthesized nanotube arrays, under 320 nm \u2013 400 nm illumination, were approximately 3% for the 800nm-H2O2-fabricated nanotubes and 4.4% for the 1.4 &#956;m-(NH4)2S2O8-fabricated nanotubes upon their use to split water photoelectrochemically. Although this method showed that low temperature crystallization drastically improved the photoelectrochemical properties of the material, the length of the resulted nanotube arrays was limited to 1.4 &#956;m, largely determined by the thickness of the oxide layer formed in the first step of fabrication. The obtained improvement in the photoconversion efficiency despite the limitation in the thickness of the fabricated nanotube arrays (&#951;=4.4% for a 1.4&#956;m nanotube sample) motivated me to investigate the possibility of achieving crystalline nanotubes directly from the anodization bath. This avenue would have the advantage of overcoming the limitation in tube length and controlling the barrier layer thickness since no high temperature would be employed.   \n\t\n\nWith the ultimate goal to achieve room or low temperature, crystalline TiO2 nanotube arrays, the effect of electrolyte composition on the possibility of inducing crystallinity in the vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube array films during their synthesis via potentiostatic anodization was investigated. Is there any electrolyte composition that might enable in-situ crystallization? With the use of 3M HCl electrolytes, partially crystalline, vertically oriented TiO2 nanotubes with thicknesses up to 300 nm were achieved between 10 V and 13 V. The addition of H2O2 to HCl-containing electrolytes was shown to extend the tube length up to 870 nm and to improve the crystallinity of the formed architectures. In regard to water splitting, the 870nm-partially crystalline as-anodized sample showed photoconversion efficiency of 0.025% under AM 1.5 illumination. Note that regularly fabricated TiO2 nanotube arrays in fluoride-containing electrolytes show almost zero photoconversion efficiency. However, annealing the partially crystalline samples at 5000C resulted in an improvement in the photoconversion efficiency (0.14%). This is the first report on the fabrication of partially crystalline TiO2 nanotubes and in fluoride-free HCl aqueous electrolytes.  With the motivation of finding an electrolyte composition that might yield better crystalline nanotubes than that obtained in the HCl-containing electrolytes, the effect of using some polyol electrolytes (diethylene, triethylene, tetraethylene and polyethylene glycols) on the crystallinity and morphology of the fabricated TiO2 nanotube arrays was investigated. The study showed that the use of these electrolytes helped to induce partial crystallinity in the formed nanotube arrays with the intensity of anatase (101) peak was found to increase with increasing the molecular weight of the polyol electrolyte. Water content in the electrolyte was found to be a critical factor in obtaining such partial crystallinity. The as-anodized nanotube arrays showed low photoconversion efficiency upon their use as photoanodes to split water photoelectrochemically indicating only partial crystallinity of the tubes. Annealing the tubes at only 3000C increased the photocoversion effciency to values comparable to those usually seen when nanotubes annealed at high temperature (above 5000C) were used.  There is a possibility that the pre-existing anatase crystallites acted as nucleation sites (seed layer) facilitating the nucleation and growth of more crystallites at 3000C resulting in comparable crystallization to that obtained for totally amorphous nanotubes annealed at higher temperature (above 5000C).\n\n\nBuilding upon my acquired expertise in synthesis of TiO2 nanotube arrays, I have investigated the possibility of formation of Ta2O5 nanotube arrays. Ta2O5 is the starting material to fabricate TaON which was shown to split water efficiently and to be highly responsive to excitation wavelengths up to about 600nm with IPCE values up to 34%. The underlying hypothesis was that fabricating this material in the nanotubular structure would enhance its efficiency to split water due to the high surface area and better charge transfer. This thesis reports, for the first time, synthesis of high-aspect-ratio tantalum oxide nanotube arrays via one-step anodization of Ta foil. The use of aqueous electrolytes containing HF:H2SO4 in the volumetric ratios 1:9 and 2:8 results in formation of ordered nanodimpled surfaces with 40-55 nm pore diameters over the potential range 10-20 V. The addition of 5-10% of either ethylene glycol (EG) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the HF and H2SO4 aqueous electrolytes resulted in the formation of Ta oxide nanotube arrays up to 19 \u00b5m thick, either securely anchored to the underlying Ta film or as robust free-standing membranes, as dependent upon the anodization time and applied voltage. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4638], "author_name_tesi": "Abdel-Motalib, Nageh Khalaf Allam ", "last_name_ssi": "Abdel-Motalib", "middle_name_ssi": "Khalaf Allam ", "first_name_ssi": "Nageh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Grimes", "Craig A Grimes", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Thomas E Mallouk", "James Bernhard Anderson", "Joan Marie Redwing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig Grimes, Dissertation Advisor", "Craig A Grimes, Committee Chair", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fluoride-free", "Photocurrent", "Nanorode", "Tantala Nanotubes", "Crystallinity", "Doping", "Hydrogen Production", "Solar Energy Conversion", "Titania nanotubes", "Anodization", "Solar Cells"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Pseudo-pressure Type-curve approach\nfor Permeability and Porosity estimation from Pressure-pulse Decay Data", "id": "29409", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12630", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work presents an improved pseudo-pressure type curve approach to interpret laboratory pulse decay data to estimate rock core permeability and porosity. The proposed method enables the analysis of pulse decay experimental data at low initial pressure and high pulse magnitude. The pseudo-pressure is a mathematical transform that is a function of pressure viscosity and gas deviation factor (Z) that can convert the compressible flow equation from its highly non-linear form to a quasi-linear partial differential equation that can be solved in a simple way without assuming small changes in the viscosity and compressibility. The pseudo-pressure approach resolves calculation problems incurred due to changes in gas viscosity and compressibility during the course of the pulse decay experiment. The type curve analysis proposed in this work allows for comparison of experimental data with theoretical curves generated from analytical models. \n\nFive pulse decay experiments were performed at pore pressures ranging from 130 psi to 700 psi in a tri-axial cell to estimate permeability and porosity of ultra-tight shale cores. The experiments were made in an increasing order of equilibration pressure starting from 130 psi until 700 psi, the pressure-pulse was of a relatively large magnitude that is equal to 200 psi and vertical and radial stresses were kept constant at 1500 psi.   Permeability estimates from the proposed pseudo-pressure approach, which is based on the compressible flow equation, was compared with the Jones method that is based on the slightly compressible flow model. This comparison demonstrates that the proposed method is able to detect the changes of permeability as a function of stress conditions in more accurate way. There are two main reasons for the inability of the Jones method to detect those changes in permeability. First, the changes in the product of viscosity and compressibility were significant during the pulse decay experiments done in this work and the slightly compressible flow equations assume it to be constant. Second, the Jones method equations had some approximations that can work for a certain range of experimental designs in terms of upstream and downstream volumes sizes relative to each other and to the pore volume. However, the proposed method can accommodate the changes in viscosity and compressibility because the pseudo pressure approach is based on the compressible flow equation. In addition, the proposed method does not have any approximations as it deals with the generalized solution; therefore, the range of experimental designs that it can analyze in terms of upstream, downstream and sample volumes is much wider.\n\nPulse decay experiments at low pressures as demonstrated in this work are useful to describe shale gas reservoirs during its depletion period, and this work demonstrates the pseudo-pressure approach to be suitable for analyzing the pulse decay experiments at low pressures with high pulse magnitude.

In spite of great efforts made to incorporate L2 teaching in classrooms, there are still fundamental questions of how the L2 is processed throughout learning, and what factors may affect this. The Competition and Proficiency-based Models describe how adult second language (L2) learning occurs. The Competition Model emphasizes the role of transfer of knowledge from the first language (L1) to L2 where grammatical structures are similar between languages, and competition between L1 and L2 in cases where grammatical structures are dissimilar. The Proficiency-based Model argues that as proficiency in the L2 changes, neurocognitive patterns of L2 processing will change, and learners will show increased sensitivity to L2 morphosyntax with increased proficiency.\nNeurocognitive and psycholinguistic studies on L2 learning have largely focused on highly proficient adult learners. Child L2 learners may differ fundamentally from adult L2 learners as children and adults are at different developmental stages, in terms of L1 development, as well as cognitively (e.g., smaller working memory span in children). In the present study, critical questions in second language acquisition were explored through electrophysiological and behavioral methods: 1) How is L2 learning influenced by the (dis)similarity between L1 and L2 structures, in children and adults? 2) How do individual differences in cognitive and affective variables associate with morphosyntactic processing, in children and in adults?\nTwo groups of native English speaking participants at intermediate levels of proficiency in L2 Spanish completed a grammaticality judgment task to assess learned knowledge of Spanish morphosyntax. Adult learners were 18 years and older (late learners) and child learners were ages 9-11 years old (early learners). L2 learners were presented with Spanish sentences that have\niii\nsimilar morphosyntactic structures in L1 and L2, have dissimilar morphosyntactic structures in L1 and L2, or have a unique morphosyntactic structure in the L2 that is not present in the L1. Building on the syntactic violation paradigm that is often used in ERP research, sentences were grammatically correct or incorrect. Participants read the sentences while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded, and made a grammaticality judgment after having read the sentence. The manipulation of grammatically similar, dissimilar, or unique structures tested the predictions of the Competition Model; proficiency was held constant, and results were compared to ERP predictions across the L2-learning proficiency span (Steinhauer, White and Drury, 2009). In addition to the sentence reading experiment in the L2, sentence processing in the L1 was measured, and tasks were administered that measured working memory, executive functions, L1 proficiency, and attitude and motivation to learn an L2. Using correlations, I explored how variability in performance on these factors may be associated with sentence processing, in child and adult L2 learners.\nAdult learners demonstrated sensitivity to grammaticality through a P600 in the L2, but in only the dissimilar condition, suggesting both the Competition Model and Proficiency-based Model may not best represent L2 learning. In the L1 they demonstrated sensitivity as an AN+P600 in all three conditions. Measures of response dominance showed large variability in processing of both L1 and L2, within the learner group. This suggests that grand mean waveforms of traditional ERP can be misleading for actual processing patterns. In correlations of individual difference factors and language processing measures, only motivation and second language proficiency correlated, with increased proficiency with increased motivation. Child learners demonstrated no sensitivity to grammaticality in the L1. In the L2 there were no significant sensitivities, but emerging P600 patterns were present in processing sentences of\niv\nstructures similar between the L1-L2, and unique to the L2, though differential in topography from adult P600 processing. Within group variability was observed in response dominance, in both the L1 and L2. In correlations of individual difference factors and language processing measures, no factors correlated.\nUltimately we conclude that 1) L2 learning is differentially influenced by (dis)similarity between L1-L2 in children (though only preliminary findings due to small sample), and adults. While children show emerging sensitivity based on (dis)similarity, adults did not show this effect. Again, due to large within group variation, we cannot conclude that these findings are not due to small child sample size. 2) Individual variation in working memory, cognitive control, L1 and L2 proficiency, and attitude/motivation to learn an L2 largely did not associate with language processing measures. Only motivation and L2 proficiency were found to have a positive association for adult L2 learners.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11886], "author_name_tesi": "Abdollahi, Fatemeh A", "last_name_ssi": "Abdollahi", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Fatemeh", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adriana Van Hell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adriana Van Hell, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Second Language Learning; Bilingualism; Language Development; Co"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A Correlational Study of Principals\u2019 Leadership Styles on Teachers\u2019 Job Satisfaction in Girls\u2019 Private Elementary schools in Saudi Arabia\n", "id": "28595", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12361", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this quantitative, correlational study is to explore the relationship between principals\u2019 leadership styles and teachers\u2019 job satisfaction in private elementary schools for girls in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Potentiodynamic experiments show that the alloy has an active/passive transition in a saturated sodium chloride solution at elevated temperatures (90 and 70 oC). Also, a steep electrode potential gradient, E(x), within the crevice has been measured using a microprobe connected to a SCE and controlled by a 3-D manipulator, and the observed locations of corrosion on the crevice wall are similar to the locations seen previously for systems in which it was clear that the shift of E(x) into the active peak region of the polarization curve on the crevice wall stabilized the crevice corrosion process. The same active peak \nE(x) relationship was observed for the Al 6111-like alloy in 0.1 M nitric acid solutions at room temperature.\n\n     In chapter 3, focuses on the corrosion of a peak aged aluminum 6111-like alloy of 1.47% copper using the artificial pit configuration (pencil electrode) with relatively larger specimens in the form of plates rather than wires. The sample which was flush with the surface of the epoxy resin mount was anodically polarized in neutral NaCl solutions of different concentrations and pH 6.9. The alloy dissolved uniformly at a certain rate to form a local cell with epoxy resin walls and the alloy surface as its bottom. Intergranular corrosion (IGC) also occurred and was recorded every 900 seconds using a stereo-microscope (through the transparent epoxy) connected to a PC uploaded with time-lapse software. IGC rate was in the order of 0.5 mm/day. The potential drop profile within the cavity was recorded on a daily basis. It showed that the total potential drop is in the order of 50 mV. The pH in the local cell was measured using a commercial mono pH microelectrode coupled with a homemade Pyrex (glassy) microprobe connected to a SCE and controlled by a 3-D manipulator. pH measurements showed the medium within the cavity is alkaline with a pH ranges from 9-12. Also, the chloride ion concentration within the local cell was measured using a mono Ag/AgCl microelectrode coupled with the same glassy microprobe, which is connected to a SCE. It showed that the chloride concentration within the cavity is at least one order of magnitude higher than that in the bulk solution. The study of the effect of the chloride ion concentration on the IGC rate showed that the increase in the chloride ion concentration increases only the initial rate of the IGC but the overall rate remained almost the same. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [250], "author_name_tesi": "Abdullah, Aboubakr Moustafa", "last_name_ssi": "Abdullah", "middle_name_ssi": "Moustafa", "first_name_ssi": "Aboubakr", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Howard W Pickering", "Barbara Shaw", "Zi Kui Liu", "Elzbieta Sikora", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Howard W Pickering, Committee Chair", "Barbara Shaw, Committee Chair", "Zi Kui Liu, Committee Member", "Elzbieta Sikora, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Corrosion", "Crevice", "Intergranular", "mechanism", "microelectrode", "aluminum", "aluminum alloys", "potential drop", "IR", "chloride", "nitric acid", "pH"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Investigation of Needle-tissue Friction Force and Geometric\nmodeling of Hypodermic Needle", "id": "17632", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8558", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis investigates how surface roughness and insertion speed affects the\nfrictional force at the needle-tissue interface and forms an analytical model for defining\nthe tip geometry of a three bevel hypodermic needle.\n\nHigh frictional forces between the needle surface and tissue create high insertion\nforces that reduce needle positioning accuracy in procedures such as brachytherapy\nradiation treatment and needle biopsy.

Heidegger, Foucault and Deleuze, under Nietzsche's influence, determine that finitude and the concept of critique must be reoriented such that it no longer takes traditional ethical and anthropological assumptions as its starting point. Indeed, this necessary reorientation is both Foucault and Deleuze's interpretation of the well-known Nietzschean catch phrase \u201cwe must overcome man\u201d. In this dissertation, I contend that Heidegger, Foucault, and Deleuze\u2019s respective ontologies develop or harbor a concept of finitude purposed to furnish a path to a new type of critique, a type of thinking that leaves behind the anthropocentrism of our paradigm. For Heidegger, we must follow the central root of the faculties to their origin in the transcendental faculty of the imagination. It is here that we see the auto-affective emergence of the subject and its temporal horizons. For Foucault, we must maintain the separation between the transcendental and empirical realm and perform a critique of the subject such that it is no longer human, but a historically emerging a priori category. It is after we have let go of the traditional subject that we can finally say we have left the \u2018Age of Anthropology\u2019 thereby escaping the \u2018Analytic of Finitude\u2019. For Deleuze, whose ontology harbors rather than explicitly develops a concept of finitude, we must realign thought and being. It is after thought and being have been realigned that immanent critique can occur. Ideally such a critique, while occurring from within, is not a critique that reaffirms the self, but reaches what is deformed from the perspective of rational thought and brings what is without assumptions to the fore. Perhaps, then, Deleuze\u2019s ontology \u2013 transcendental empiricism \u2013 holds potential to escape the \u2018Analytic of Finitude\u2019 described by Foucault and deeply related to Heidegger\u2019s own philosophical fears.\nImportantly, various relevant socio-political consequences stem from such an interpretation. These philosophers are not merely concerned with taking up a vague Nietzschean project of overcoming man. What is at stake with moving past anthropology is all that accompanies the overcoming of anthropocentrism. Thus we can say that the overcoming of anthropocentrism is also about identifying the root of racism, sexism, homophobia and other abuses of power. To what kind of finitude has our paradigm been committed? Perhaps thinking finitude faithfully, such that we reach the origin and throw ethical, anthropological, social, and political assumptions aside, leads away from the abuse of power and toward genuinely new thought. While these social and political issues cannot be conflated - their differences obscured - the final merit of the project I will be working on will be to unify what Heidegger, Foucault, and Deleuze\u2019s concept of critique may bring to discourses on these social political problems. In particular, this dissertation is meant to contribute to the newly developing area of Critical Philosophy of Race. It seems to me that the needs of Critical Philosophy of Race fundamentally stems from problems with traditional ethics and, therefore, call for ethical, anthropological, and socio-political reevaluations. My dissertation will tackle exactly how these philosophers mean to perform such reevaluations. Thus, while my dissertation is on the appropriation of the concept of critique in a \u201ctraditional\u201d philosophical context, I intend to extend this research beyond the theoretical context to use my own work in building the methods of critique used to understand, discuss, and challenge race, racism and the effects of these concepts. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11447], "author_name_tesi": "Abdullah, Ayesha Mahasin", "last_name_ssi": "Abdullah", "middle_name_ssi": "Mahasin", "first_name_ssi": "Ayesha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonard Richard Lawlor", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi", "Sarah Clark Miller", "Claire Mary Colebrook"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonard Richard Lawlor, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi, Committee Member", "Sarah Clark Miller, Committee Member", "Claire Mary Colebrook, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Time", "Critique", "Heidegger", "Deleuze", "Foucault", "finitude"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EVOLUTION AND ACTIVITY OF AN ERYTHROID CIS-REGULATORY MODULE IN MULTIPLE MAMMALIAN LINEAGES \n", "id": "9197", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1388", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Evidence of evolutionary constraint in noncoding regions can be derived from alignments of multiple genomes, and this is a reliable guide to a small but important subset of Cis Regulatory Modules (CRMs). This thesis reports results from several tests conducted in one example of an erythroid CRM (present in human and absent in mice) called GATA1-HS+14. It contains four motifs that match the consensus GATA-1 binding site but none of these are conserved in mouse. Two of these motifs are also present in the reconstructed boreoeutherian ancestor. Our result indicates that HS+14 is an active enhancer in human but a neutral fragment in mouse. It is also an enhancer in the ancestor. In addition, motif C (the only motif conserved in multiple mammals) plays a positive role in enhancement while motifs A and B may play negative role in transcription. Although the level of enhancement varies among species, all tested mammalian DNA fragments that are homologous to HS+14, and having the conserved WGATAR motif, increased transcriptional activity in our enhancement assay. We have also statistical analyzed the region of interest in search of other binding site motifs that are associated with level of enhancement.

It contributes to the existing literature in three specific ways.  First, it tests the transition to parenthood, including pregnancy, parenthood without pregnancy, and additional pregnancies as a parent.  The ability to capture behavioral changes at each distinct stage in the transition to parenthood is an improvement over studies which often rely on a binary measure of whether the individual is a parent or not.  Second, it explores the context of residency and how parenthood, paired with residency or nonresidency, affects behavior.  Third, it tests a theoretically important mechanism of desistance \u2013 parental orientation.  Despite the centrality of this mechanism in theories of desistance, measures of attachment to parenthood are noticeably absent in empirical tests of parenthood, criminal offending, and substance use.  This study finds that a binary measure of parenthood is often insufficient for exploring the effects of parenthood.  Rather, the contextual nature of parenthood, particularly being a parent who resides with a child, is negatively related to one\u2019s offending and substance use.  Further, for women, substance use significantly declines during pregnancy, and often continues to decline as a woman becomes further embedded in motherhood.

Although longitudinal associations between early social-emotional functioning and later behavioral and academic adjustment have been documented, how school-entry social-emotional functioning alters children\u2019s developmental trajectories across the early school years is not well understood. It may be that initially higher-functioning children continue to develop at a faster rate than their peers across the school years, in line with the skill-begets-skill or cumulative advantage hypothesis (Heckman, 2008). Alternatively, initially lower-functioning children may show greater growth over time, as would be predicted by the catch-up hypothesis (Barnett, 2011). Moreover, these patterns of development may differ depending on the child\u2019s context, with initially higher-functioning children showing greater growth under certain conditions and/or initially lower-functioning children showing greater growth under other conditions.\n\tThis dissertation examined the contributions of children\u2019s early social-emotional functioning and the school context to their trajectories of behavior and achievement during elementary school. Using a rich longitudinal dataset from the Family Life Project, which followed children and families in rural and small town U.S. communities, this dissertation examined: (1) how school-entry inattention, prosocial behavior, and conduct problems predicted behavior and achievement in Grade 3 and rates of change from kindergarten to Grade 3; (2) how distal factors and proximal processes in the elementary school context predicted behavior and achievement during this time period, both concurrently and cumulatively; and (3) how aspects of the school context might moderate the effect of school-entry social-emotional functioning on children\u2019s developmental trajectories.\n\tResults of multilevel growth models indicated that school-entry social-emotional functioning had lasting effects on behavior and achievement through Grade 3, but initially lower-functioning children narrowed the gap with their higher-functioning peers over time on some outcomes (i.e., trajectories of children with high and low initial social-emotional functioning converged over time). Experiences within the school context also contributed to children\u2019s outcomes: High-quality teacher-student interactions and teachers\u2019 own social-emotional competence predicted higher concurrent behavior and achievement, and there was some evidence that cumulative exposure to high-quality experiences uniquely contributed to outcomes. Finally, features of the school context generally did not moderate the effects of school-entry social-emotional functioning, suggesting that variation in the school context had a surprisingly minimal impact on rates of convergence or divergence in developmental trajectories of children who differed in school-entry social-emotional functioning. \n\tThis dissertation adds to a growing body of work out of the Family Life Project investigating families, schools, and child development in high-poverty rural regions (e.g., Blair et al., 2016; Broekhuizen et al., 2016; Garrett-Peters et al., 2016; Sandilos et al., 2014; Vernon-Feagans et al., 2016).

Health is also critically linked to migration because overall health influences the propensity to move. As a result, a multilevel framework aids in disentangling whether individual-level effects or other household- or community-level characteristics impact migration and variability in migrant health outcomes. The dataset used for this research was the Indonesia Family Life Survey. Indonesia serves as an appropriate case study to investigate the relationship among these factors because the country faces pressing socioeconomic and demographic trends that are found globally. Several multilevel analyses were conducted to predict migration incidence as well as variability in six health outcomes (i.e., health status, acute illness, mental health, problems with ADLs, hypertension, and anemia) among migrants. Migration resulted from differences in household and community composition. Select demographic and socioeconomic characteristics significantly predicted migration decision and these determinants were consistent with previous literature. Findings suggest that inadequate distribution of health resources may serve as a push factor in motivating individuals living in communities without medical access to migrate. Multilevel effects were detected across all the health outcomes indicating significant clustering of health characteristics across households and communities. Two themes emerged from the findings: 1) stark gender differences in health, and 2) positive health selection among younger migrants compared to older migrants who were negatively selected on health. Although health did not play a major role as a determinant of migration, this research found significant multilevel effects for predicting migration and variability in health among migrants.

More specifically, the dissertation seeks to redress the current lack of diagnostic assessment in language instruction and the development of listening proficiency. \n\tThe dissertation extends traditional understanding of listening assessment in foreign language contexts and applies dynamic assessment (DA) to the development of learners\u2019 listening ability. DA is grounded in the Vygotskyan concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) and prescribes mediated teacher-learner dialog during the assessment procedure. Theoretically developed and experimentally tested worldwide since the 1950s, DA has proven to be a valuable diagnostic tool primarily in psychological research and, as a later development, in educational research focused on teaching/learning different school subjects (e.g. mathematics, physics). However, language educators have only recently begun to examine the pedagogical applications of DA (e.g. Lantolf & Poehner 2004, Poehner 2005; Ant\u00f3n, 2003, 2009; Ableeva, 2008). This initial L2 research argues that assessment-with-mediation brings assessment and instruction together into an organic unity whereby learning is the result of mediation, which is then internalized and becomes accessible to be deployed later in other contexts. \nThe dissertation investigates the effects of dynamic assessment on improving listening comprehension of intermediate university students learning French as a foreign language and compares the results to a traditional test of listening comprehension. The study conducted as part of this disseration demonstrates that DA, due to its reliance on mediated dialogue, illuminates the sources of poor performance that are usually hidden during traditional assessments, which are non-dynamic in nature. DA is able to inform the instructional process regarding specific areas where learners need improvement and in so doing allows for appropriate intervention to help learners overcome these problems. The results of the study indicate that, through interactions in the ZPD, DA permits to establish not only the actual level of learners\u2019 listening ability but also to diagnose/assess the potential level of their listening development, while at the same time promoting this development.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5374], "author_name_tesi": "Ableeva, Rumia ", "last_name_ssi": "Ableeva", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rumia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Lantolf", "Celeste S Kinginger", "James Lantolf", "Thomas Albert Hale", "Gabriela Appel Lantolf", "Meredith Christine Doran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Lantolf, Dissertation Advisor", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Chair", "James Lantolf, Committee Chair", "Thomas Albert Hale, Committee Member", "Gabriela Appel Lantolf, Committee Member", "Meredith Christine Doran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Listening Comprehension", "Language Assessment", "Sociocultural Theory", "Dynamic Assessment"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "META-COORDINATION ACTIVITIES: EXPLORING ARTICULATION WORK IN HOSPITALS\n", "id": "10722", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3046", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Coordination of distributed activities is central to organizational work. The effective functioning of organizations hinges on their ability to manage interdependencies both within (intra-) and between (inter-) various departments. However, more than just the management of these individual dependencies is required for smooth coordination in organizations. Organizations must also manage the interactions between intra- and inter-departmental coordination activities. In this thesis, I investigate a certain set of interactions which I refer to as negative cross-level interactions. These interactions often result in poor performance, increased errors and higher coordination costs. Consequently, in order to achieve organizational goals, workers must perform a certain type of articulation work - meta-coordination activities - to manage and mitigate the effects of these negative cross-level interactions. \nTo examine negative cross-level interactions and how they are dealt with in an organizational setting, I conducted a year-long qualitative research study of the patient transfer process at a large academic hospital in the Northeastern United States. Patient transfers are particularly appropriate to study because they require both intra- and inter-departmental coordination activities to be successful. I focused on the patient transfer activities between two clinical departments (emergency department and neurosciences department) and the role of a non-clinical department (inpatient access department) in facilitating the patient transfer process. I utilized standard qualitative methods including observations, shadowing and interviews. Through this study, I provide a detailed understanding of patient transfer process, with a particular emphasis on (a) the challenges that lead to negative cross-level interactions and its effect on both inter-departmental coordination and on overall hospital workflow, and (b) the meta-coordination activities that are performed to mitigate the effects of these negative cross-level interactions, and (c) the relationship between meta-coordination activities and articulation work. \nThe findings from this study will make contributions to research in the fields of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Medical Informatics (MI). The main contributions to the CSCW field include (a) examining a unique set of coordination challenges - negative cross-level interactions that occur at the intersection of intra- and inter-departmental coordination activities; (b) uncovering a particular type of work activities - meta-coordination activities - that are performed to mitigate the effects of negative cross-level interactions; (c) developing a conceptual and empirical understanding of meta-coordination activities; (d) identifying meta-coordination activities as a type of articulation work focused on fixing breakdowns that occur when intra- and inter-departmental coordination activities affect each other; (e) providing deeper insights on organizational articulation work across multiple levels; (f) developing a framework of inter-departmental coordination work that highlights the relationship between the concepts of negative cross-level interactions and meta-coordination activities. \nThe main contributions to the MI field include (a) drawing attention to the role of non-clinical staff during patient transfers; (b) providing detailed understanding about an inter-departmental workflow (e.g. patient transfer) that depends on the coordination between clinical and non-clinical departments; and (c) informing the design of systems that can support inter-departmental workflows.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3036], "author_name_tesi": "Abraham, Joanna  ", "last_name_ssi": "Abraham", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Joanna ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Madhu Reddy", "Madhu Reddy", "Michael Mc Neese", "Mary Beth Rosson", "Michelle E Day"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Madhu Reddy, Dissertation Advisor", "Madhu Reddy, Committee Chair", "Michael Mc Neese, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Rosson, Committee Member", "Michelle E Day, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Articulation Work", "Patient Transfers", "Coordination"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ENGINEERING OHMIC CONTACTS TO III-V, III-N AND 2D DICHALCOGENIDES: THE IMPACT OF ANNEALING AND SURFACE PREPARATION ON CONTACT RESISTANCE", "id": "13720mza5117", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13720", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new era of smart interconnected systems of electronic devices has begun, with cloud computing (big data) and artificial intelligence amplifying the capacity and impact of these systems on human society. Behind this technological revolution lie Si-based complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS) logic devices as well as high-power and high-frequency radio-frequency (RF) electronics, which are key enablers of the current progress. However, as we look into the future, the trend set by Moore\u2019s law for ever smaller, higher-performance, and more power-efficient devices is reaching its limit, and soon Si may no longer serve as the material of choice in some aggressively scaled transistors. For example, InGaAs is being considered as channel materials to replace Si. Similar efforts are also underway to replace Si with GaN in RF applications. Moreover, transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2 are interesting for flexible electronics applications. As these new materials take hold, key processes such as contact metallization must be investigated and optimized in order to improve the performance of next-generation devices. This dissertation discusses studies of Ohmic contacts to GaN, InGaAs, and MoS2, focusing on how surface preparation and annealing affect contact resistance. \nDuring the first phase of this dissertation, we investigated Ti/Al contacts to N-polar GaN/AlGaN heterostructures. The resistance of Ti/Al-based contacts was found to depend sensitively on their interfacial composition. Limiting the thickness of the first layer deposited (either Al or Ti) to a few nanometers produced low contact resistances after annealing for 60 s at 500 \u00b0C. The lowest contact resistance of 0.10 \u2126\u00b7mm (specific contact resistance, \u03c1_c, of 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 \u2126\u00b7cm2) was achieved with 3 nm of Al as the first deposited layer. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies revealed a thin Ti\u2013Al-Ga\u2013N layer adjacent to the GaN in this annealed Al/Ti/Al contact, while the contact resistance was higher when the interfacial layer contained only Ti, Ga, and N. The simultaneous presence of Al and Ti next to GaN at the onset of reaction was found to be critical for achieving the lowest contact resistance.\nDrawing from lessons learned about surface preparation and alloyed contacts to GaN, in the second phase of this dissertation, we investigated Ni-based alloyed contacts to InP-capped and uncapped n+\u00ac-In0.53Ga0.47As (ND = 3\u00d71019 cm\u22123). Contacts with specific contact resistances of 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22128 \u00b1 7 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u2126\u00b7cm2 and 4.6 \u00d7 10\u22128 \u00b1 9 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u2126\u00b7cm2 were achieved for the capped and uncapped samples, respectively, after annealing at 350 \u00b0C for 60 s. By using a pre-metallization surface treatment of ammonium sulfide, \u03c1_c decreased further to 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22128 \u00b1 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u2126\u00b7cm2 and 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22128 \u00b1 1 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u2126\u00b7cm2 on epilayers with and without 10-nm InP caps, respectively. Cross-sectional TEM micrographs revealed that the ammonium sulfide surface treatment more completely eliminated the semiconductor\u2019s native oxide at the contact interface, which we believe caused the reduced contact resistance both before and after annealing. \nIn the third and final phase of this dissertation, alloyed Ag contacts to few-layer (FL)-MoS2 were investigated. Similar to the two contacts investigated earlier in this dissertation, annealing was critical for achieving low contact resistance. The contact resistances of the as-deposited samples were 0.8\u20133.5 \u2126\u00b7mm, while the annealed contacts exhibited lower contact resistances of 0.2\u20130.5 \u2126\u00b7mm for MoS2 from 5 to 14 layers or ~3 to 9 nm thick. TEM micrographs of the annealed contacts revealed that the Ag was epitaxial on MoS2. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectra collected near the Ag/MoS2 contacts showed limited interdiffusion at the metal/semiconductor interface as well as the presence of Ag in the underlying MoS2. Furthermore, thanks to the effective pre- and post-metallization surface preparation, no gross interfacial contaminants (oxygen and resist residue) appeared, indicating the formation of an intimate contact between the Ag and MoS2. \nOverall, this dissertation shows the importance of surface preparation and annealing in producing low-resistance Ohmic contacts to GaN, InGaAs, and MoS2. Therefore, the contact metallization processes developed here may eventually aid in the development of next-generation electronics based on these semiconductors.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14318], "author_name_tesi": "Abraham, Michael ", "last_name_ssi": "Abraham", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suzanne E.

Buildings consume a significant amount of energy during the operations phase. An acceptable indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is important for building occupants since poor conditions can impact their perceived health and productivity. People spend about 90% of their time indoors and sometimes take actions to improve their comfort such as adjusting the building systems (i.e., heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems), using personal devices, or adjusting their layers of clothing. Building systems do not adequately take the occupant preferences into account during the operations phase and the indoor environmental controls do not always accommodate those preferences. Occupant values (such as thermal comfort and visual comfort) can be better addressed in buildings through improved integration with building controls. Bridging the gap between occupant IEQ needs and the actual indoor conditions can be beneficial to improving building performance and occupant comfort.  \nThis study focused on the development of an approach to integrating occupant values and preferences with building systems to enhance comfort while reducing energy consumption. The objectives of this study were to establish occupant values and the relationships between the values, satisfaction, and behavior. A literature review was conducted to identify research gaps, the potential benefits of improved integration, and the applicability of agent-based modeling (ABM) for modeling occupant behavior and occupant values. Following this, an exploratory study using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires was conducted with professionals in the aerospace, shipbuilding, and automobile industry to assess how end-user values and preferences are accounted for and to identify lessons that can be learned for buildings. Empirical studies were completed using three case study buildings, two office spaces and one residential building in two different climates to understand the building operation and occupant values and behavior in those spaces. Surveys to establish occupant values, preferences, and satisfaction were also conducted in these buildings. Drawing on the findings in the industry case studies and empirical studies, an approach was proposed for improved integration between occupant values and building systems. An evaluation of the proposed approach by key industry professionals and experts demonstrated the need for improved communication between occupants and building operators, highlighted the importance of occupant education, and emphasized the energy savings that can be realized by eliminating some of the wasteful behaviors related to occupant discomfort with indoor conditions.\nRecommendations for an integrative occupant-sensitive building operation were proposed following the exploration of other industries and the empirical studies.

While PHCSS materials are available in austenitic and semi-austenitic forms, the martensitic PHCSS are most widely used due to a combination of high strength, good toughness, and corrosion resistance.  If higher strength levels can be achieved in these alloys, these materials can be used as a lower-cost alternative to titanium for high specific strength applications where corrosion resistance is a factor.  Although wrought precipitation hardened materials have been in use and specified for more than half a century, the specification and use of PHCSS has only been recent.  The effects of composition and processing on performance have received little attention in the cast steel literature.\n\nThe work presented in these investigations is concerned with the experimental study and modeling of microstructural development in cast martensitic precipitation hardened steels at high strength levels.  Particular attention is focused on improving the performance of the high strength CB7Cu alloy by control of detrimental secondary phases, notably delta ferrite and retained austenite, which is detrimental to strength, but potentially beneficial in terms of fracture and impact toughness. The relationship between age processing and mechanical properties is also investigated, and a new age hardening model based on simultaneous precipitation hardening and tempering has been modified for use with these steels. Because the CB7Cu system has limited strength even with improved processing, a higher strength prototype Fe-Ni-Cr-Mo-Ti system has been designed and adapted for use in casting.  This prototype is expected to develop high strengths matching or exceed that of cast Ti-6Al-4V alloys.\nTraditional multicomponent constitution phase diagrams widely used for phase estimation in conventional stainless steels, give poor estimates of secondary phases in PHCSS.  No measureable retained austenite was observed in any of the CB7Cu-1 steels studied, in spite of the fact that austenite is predicted by the constitution diagrams.  A designed experiment using computationally derived phase equilibrium diagrams and actual experimental tests on CB7Cu of different compositions suggests that the ferrite phase is less stable than the constitution diagrams for austenitic stainless steels suggest. \n\nDelta ferrite was also more stable in slower-cooled sand cast material as compared to thin, fast-cooled investment cast material. High temperature solutionizing treatments were effective in dissolving delta ferrite at temperatures above 1900\u00b0F (~1040\u00b0C). Delta ferrite dissolution was found to proceed at high rates during initial dissolution, and then was found to slow after 1 hour. Diffusion during the later stages is well-predicted by classical diffusion models.  Repeated solution treatments were found to modestly increase both ductility and strength, likely due to subgrain refinement through austenite regrowth. Multistaged aging provided superior strength and toughness increases over similarly peak-aged and near peak-aged material aged at a single temperature.  Peak-aged material fractography suggested that low energy quasi-cleavage fracture was likely due to age precipitate embrittlement along with some nucleation of MnS particulates at prior austenite grain boundaries. \n\nYield strengths approaching 190 ksi (1310MPa) can be achieved in CB7Cu-1 if appropriate best-practices \"+\" processing techniques are used. This includes hot isostatic processing to reduce solidification segregation and heal microporosity, high temperature homogenization for effective age hardening and ferrite reduction, double-cycle solutionizing for structure refinement, and multistaged age strengthening for finer precipitate control.\nThe experimental prototype 11-11PH (Fe-Ni-Cr-Ti-Mo) casting alloys was cast and was found to be delta-ferrite free in the as-cast condition. In this material, proper quench processing to eliminate excessive retained austenite was found to be most influential in terms of high strengths.  It was also found that cooling below 0\u00b0C provided the best combination of strength and toughness, with the specific strength of the material exceeding that of cast Ti-6Al-4V material. Fractography studies suggest that titanium carbonitride and titanium carbon-nitride-sulfide inclusions limit the toughness of cast materials due to long exposures to ideal growth conditions during initial cooling.  OIM studies also suggest that the retained austenite in properly processed 11-11PH alloy takes on an interlath structure, which likely contributes to toughness of the alloy, even at high-strength, peak aged conditions. Yield strengths approaching 235 ksi (1620 MPa) were achieved during initial heat treatment trials. It is expected that further improvements in properties can be achieved with continued improvement of processing for this new cast alloy system.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5061], "author_name_tesi": "Abrahams, Rachel Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Abrahams", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt", "Robert Carl Voigt", "Richard Allen Wysk", "Edward Demeter", "Dr Chantal Binet"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Carl Voigt, Committee Chair", "Richard Allen Wysk, Committee Member", "Edward Demeter, Committee Member", "Dr Chantal Binet, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Martensitic Cast Steels", "Precipitaion Hardening Cast Steels", "CB7Cu-1", "Stainless Maraging Steels"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Effects of Catalyst Properties on Hydrodesulfurization on of Fluid Catalytic Cracking Decant Oils as Feedstock for Needle Coke ", "id": "25652", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11196", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis investigates hydrodesulfurization of fluid catalytic cracking decant oils and its impact on carbonaceous mesophase development during carbonization. Delayed Coking of decant oils leads to the development of carbonaceous mesophase, a liquid crystalline phase, that is responsible for the structural anisotropy of needle coke. Because of its anisotropic microstructure, needle coke is used as the filler along with a coal tar pitch binder for manufacturing graphite electrodes for electric-arc furnaces. When sulfur content of the filler needle coke is high (>0.8 wt. %) an irreversible volume expansion (puffing) takes place when extruded electrodes are subjected to graphitization heat treatment. Puffing in needle coke results primarily from the evolution of sulfur in the form of CS2 and H2S. Puffing causes the formation of mico-cracks reducing the quality of electrodes. Most practical and efficient process to control the sulfur levels in needle cokes is catalytic hydrodesulfurization of the feedstock decant oil prior to coking.  The overall objectives of this thesis study were to investigate the effects of catalyst properties on hydrodesulfurization activity, hydrogenation activity, and to investigate the effect of hydrogenation on the subsequent mesophase development from the hydrotreated decant oil. \n\tTwo decant oils with relatively low and high sulfur concentrations were used as feedstocks. Decant oils were fractionated by vacuum distillation into three cuts representing the light fraction, middle fraction, and vacuum bottoms. The hydrodesulfurization of the middle fraction and parent oils were performed in a bench-scale fixed bed flow reactor. Reaction variables of interest include temperature, hydrogen pressure, and catalyst properties. Overall, increasing reaction temperature suppressed the hydrogenation of the constituent polyaromatic hydrocarbons, but promoted sulfur reduction. Increase in hydrogen pressure, on the other hand, did not appear to have much impact on desulfurization, but significantly increased the extent of hydrogenation. \nFour catalysts (with varying average pore sizes, promoter atoms, and supports) were prepared with sequential incipient wetness impregnation to evaluate their activities for hydrodesulfurization and hydrogenation of decant oils. The desirable outcome of decant oil hydrodesulfurization is to achieve the required sulfur removal particularly from large polyaromatic ring systems with minimum hydrogen consumption. Removing sulfur from larger ring systems in decant oils is the most effective way of reducing the needle coke sulfur content because large aromatics end up in the coke product obtained from Delayed Coking.  Hydrodesulfurization experiments showed that the catalysts with large pores in the support (14 nm average diameter) had a higher activity for removing sulfur from large polycyclic aromatic rings compared to the catalyst with smaller pores (7 nm average diameter) in the support. Catalysts with larger pores also showed a lower overall activity for hydrogenation, thus, achieving both objectives of the hydrodesulfurization process. A reduction in hydrogenation activity is desired because it lowers hydrogen consumption during hydrodesulfurization and preserves the hydrogen aromaticity of decant oil which is important for mesophase development. \n Molybdenum (Mo) based hydrodesulfurization catalyst are typically promoted by either Co or Ni. Using Co as promoter in the prepared catalysts showed higher overall hydrodesulfurization activity than those with Ni promoter. Using a TiO2 support for a CoMo catalyst instead of Al2O3 with essentially the same pore size distribution increased the hydrodesulfurization activity, while decreasing the hydrogenation activity. Therefore, using TiO2 as a catalyst support could also prove to be useful for the objectives of decant oil hydrodesulfurization.\nTo observe the effects of hydrotreatment on mesophase development, untreated and treated parent oils, distillate fractions, and treated middle fractions blended with vacuum bottoms were carbonized. The extent of mesophase development in the resulting semi-cokes was gleaned from an optical texture analysis using polarized-light microscopy. A qualitative measure of semi-coke texture by Optical Texture Index showed that hydrotreatment of the feedstocks to reduce sulfur content did not have a significant effect on mesophase development upon subsequent carbonization.  \nIt is concluded, therefore, that hydrodesulfurization of decant oil can effectively reduce the sulfur content in decant oils, and therefore, it could achieve the desirable sulfur level in the needle cokes to be produced from the hydrotreated decant oils.  This can be done without compromising the anisotropy of the resulting needle coke microstructure. Using catalysts with larger pore sizes can remove sulfur selectively from large aromatic ring systems for most effective use of hydrogen in decant oil hydrodesulfurization.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10742], "author_name_tesi": "Abrahamson, Joseph Peter", "last_name_ssi": "Abrahamson", "middle_name_ssi": "Peter", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Semih Eser"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Semih Eser, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Decant Oil", "Hydrodesulfurization of Decant Oil", "Needle Coke"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Pulsed Laser Annealing of Carbon ", "id": "14150jpa162", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14150", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates laser heating of carbon materials. The carbon industry has been annealing carbon via traditional furnace heating since at least 1800, when Sir Humphry Davy produced an electric arc with carbon electrodes made from carbonized wood. Much knowledge has been accumulated about carbon since then and carbon materials have become instrumental both scientifically and technologically. However, to this day the kinetics of annealing are not known due to the slow heating and cooling rates of furnaces. Additionally, consensus has yet to be reached on the cause of non-graphitizability.\n\nAnnealing trajectories with respect to time at temperature are observed from a commercial carbon black (R250), model graphitizable carbon (anthracene coke) and a model non-graphitizable carbon (sucrose char) via rapid laser heating. Materials were heated with 1064 nm and 10.6 \u00b5m laser radiation from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser and a continuous wave CO2 laser, respectively. A pulse generator was used reduce the CO2 laser pulse width and provide high temporal control. Time-temperature-histories with nanosecond temporal resolution and temperature reproducibility within tens of degrees Celsius were determined by spectrally resolving the laser induced incandescence signal and applying multi-wavelength pyrometry. The Nd:YAG laser fluences include: 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 550 mJ/cm2. The maximum observed temperature ranged from 2,400 \u00b0C to the C2 sublimation temperature of 4,180 \u00b0C. The CO2 laser was used to collect a series of isothermal (1,200 and 2,600 \u00b0C) heat treatments versus time (100 milliseconds to 30 seconds). Laser heated samples are compared to furnace annealing at 1,200 and 2,600 \u00b0C for 1 hour. The material transformation trajectory of Nd:YAG laser heated carbon is different than traditional furnace heating. The traditional furnace annealing pathway is followed for CO2 laser heating as based upon equivalent end structures. The nanostructure of sucrose char after 5 seconds of isothermal annealing at 2,600 \u00b0C is comprised almost entirely of quasi-spherical closed shell particles that are free of sp3 and oxygen content. With additional time at temperature the particles unravel and propagative particle opening occurs throughout the material. The irregular pore structure found in the end product is a result of particle unraveling. The structures found in heat treated sucrose char believed to contain odd membered rings are not manufactured during the annealing process due to impinging growth of stacks. Thus, odd membered rings are likely present in the starting non-graphitizable char. \n\nFurnace annealing of cokes and chars produced from: oxygen containing compounds (polyfurfuryl alcohol and anthanthrone), from a five membered ring containing poly-aromatic hydrocarbon (fluorene), and from sulfur containing decant oil and a blend of anthracene-dibenzothiophene were compared to furnace annealed anthracene coke and sucrose char.  The majority of initial oxygen content evolved out during low temperature carbonization. The intermediate species formed after oxygen evolution dictated the resulting carbon skeleton and thus the graphitizability. Carbonization of anthanthrone resulted in a graphitizable coke. It is proposed that carbon monoxide loss from anthanthrone results in the formation of perylene. An obvious resemblance was observed in structure between heat treated sucrose and polyfurfuryl alcohol char as compared to heated treated char embedded with 5 membered rings via carbonization of fluorene. Thus, providing evidence that 5 membered rings are present in the virgin chars and are the cause of non-graphitizability. \n\nThe heteroatom sulfur effects carbon structure in a different way as compared to oxygen. Sulfur is thermally stable in carbon up to ~ 1,000 \u00b0C and thus plays little role in the initial low temperature (500 \u00b0C) carbonization. As such it imparts a relatively unobservable impact on nanostructure, but rather acts to cause micro-cracks upon rapid evolution in the form of H2S and CS2, upon subsequent heat treatment. Laboratory generated synthetic soot from benzene and benzene-thiophene were Nd:YAG laser and furnace annealed. Furnace annealing of sulfur doped synthetic soot results in cracks and rupturing due to the high pressures caused by explosive sulfur evolution at elevated temperature. Whereas Nd:YAG laser heating of the sulfur doped sample acted to induce curvature. The observed curvature is owed to annealing occurring simultaneously with sulfur evolution. The unset lamellae are strongly influenced by the defect formed upon sulfur evolution.\n\nCoke and char samples were prepared via carbonization in sealed tubing reactors. The extent of mesophase development was assessed by measuring the materials optical anisotropy with a polarized light microscope. Physical and chemical transformations from annealing were measured with electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, selected area electron diffraction, and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Virgin samples and traditional furnace annealed samples available in bulk were analyzed with X-ray diffraction. \n\nThe potential technological importance of laser annealing carbon is demonstrated as annealing can be performed continuously and rapidly. Examples of material processing and synthesis not possible via traditional furnace annealing are provided. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15205], "author_name_tesi": "Abrahamson, Joseph Peter", "last_name_ssi": "Abrahamson", "middle_name_ssi": "Peter", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Randy Lee Vander Wal", "Randy Lee Vander Wal", "Semih Eser", "Jonathan P Mathews", "Adri van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Randy Lee Vander Wal, Dissertation Advisor", "Randy Lee Vander Wal, Committee Chair", "Semih Eser, Committee Member", "Jonathan P Mathews, Committee Member", "Adri van Duin, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["carbon", "carbonization", "graphitization", "graphitizable", "graphitizability", "odd membered carbon rings", "laser annealing", "microscopy", "electron microscopy", "carbon annealing", "kinetics of graphitization", "carbon black", "coke", "char", "mesophase"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Crack Propagation and Fracture in Engineered Stress Profile Glass\n", "id": "6285", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4004", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ion exchange procedures have been developed for soda lime silicate and soda alumina silicate glasses that produce a maximum compressive stress below the surface of the material.

An experimental stress measurement method utilizing iterated optical retardation and progressive etching was developed to determine the stress profile in the glass surfaces.

As low-cost cells continue to develop, the dye sensitized solar cell has generated considerable interest as an efficient alternative.

Solar conversion efficiencies have been studied by modifying optical pathways through these dye-sensitized solar cells, or Gr\u00e4tzel cells.  Monochromatic incident-to-photon current efficiency (IPCE) data reveals that an inverse opal photonic crystal or other disordered layer coupled to a nanocrystalline TiO<sub>2</sub> layer enhances photocurrent efficiency by illumination from the counter electrode direction.  Modifying the cell architecture to allow for illumination through the working electrode yields similar increased enhancements by proper selection of the photonic bandgap.  Direct growth of TiO<sub>2</sub> inverse opals on a nanocrystalline slab was accomplished by polymer infiltration of the slab, followed by crystal growth and liquid phase deposition.  Results demonstrate that the bilayer architecture contributes to the enhanced light harvesting rather than the inverse opal layer and is due, in part, to strong light localization, Bragg diffraction and enhanced scattering.  These effects occur solely at the bilayer interface and largely contribute to the photocurrent enhancements in the 540 \u2013 750 nm region where the sensitizer dye is a poor absorber.

The Round Goby, Neogobius melanostomus, a benthic, Eurasian fish native to the Ponto-Caspian region of the Black and Caspian seas, was first reported in North America in the St. Claire River of Michigan in 1990 and made its way to the eastern basin of Lake Erie by the mid-1990s. The present-day distribution of Round Goby includes all five Great Lakes and many of their tributaries. The tributary invasion success of Round Goby raises the question whether these fish are exhibiting site fidelity for these systems solely for spawning purposes or spending their entire life cycle within the same stream. If the latter is true, Round Goby may be exhibiting evolutionary adaptability to localized environments and functioning as discrete populations. Studying patterns of genetic variability of Round Goby may aid in predicting future invasion success. Identifying post-invasion dispersal of Round Goby can prove to be an important management tool for predicting range expansion capabilities; moreover knowing their population genetic structure, thus promoting a better understanding of evolutionary change and mechanisms of species adaptation. The purpose of this study was to determine if lake and tributary collections of Round Gobies are distinct by comparing tissue and whole specimen samples genetically and morphologically, respectively. Using tissue samples collected from 335 individual Round Gobies obtained from 12 interspersed sample locations (tributaries [n=3], Presque Isle Bay [n=3], offshore trawls [n=4], and tributary embayments [n=3]), an initial suite of 21 novel microsatellites were developed to enable detailed population genetic analyses. Moreover, these microsatellite markers complement the limited suite of existing microsatellites and will aid in determining source locations (founder effect) for future collections of Round Goby from new invasions and/or introduction. Here I report on variation at 12 microsatellite DNA markers for 314 Round Gobies (originally 335 specimens; 21 were later removed due to extraction error and various constraints). Levels of genetic diversity were low in all collections (with 2 to 10 alleles per locus), and heterozygosity ranged from He=0.628 to He=0.703. Overall tributary collections were no more diverse than Lake Erie and Presque Isle Bay populations, genetically. Tests of population differentiation among all collections (overall FST=0.036) suggest a low level of genetic differentiation and an overall panmictic population. This result was supported by Bayesian clustering analyses in STRUCTURE, which suggested K = 1 cluster or populations.  \nIn addition, morphometric and meristic analysis were conducted on a subsample of Round Gobies (n=90) collected for genetic assays. Principle component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed in order to determine whether unique morphotypes exist according to habitat occupancy. While ANOVA results suggest statistically significant phenotypic differentiation (p<0.05), these data are functions of phenotypic plasticity seen through habitat occupancy and available food source. These results implicitly support genetic analysis results as to the presence of one large panmictic, interbreeding population of Round Goby in and around the Presque Isle, Pennsylvania portion of Lake Erie and tributaries.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11117], "author_name_tesi": "Abramson, Sidney Caleb", "last_name_ssi": "Abramson", "middle_name_ssi": "Caleb", "first_name_ssi": "Sidney", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stauffer", "Timothy Lee King", "Jeanette Lane Schnars"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stauffer, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy Lee King, Thesis Advisor", "Jeanette Lane Schnars, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["round goby", "neogobius melanostomus", "Erie", "Pennsylvania", "morphometrics and meristic characters"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic regulation by Unstable factor for orange1 in maize.", "id": "18226", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8658", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype that are attributable to mechanisms other than changes in DNA sequence. In plants, epigenetic regulation plays a key role in various biological processes such as paramutation, genomic imprinting, and gene silencing. Although numerous studies have been done to elucidate the underlying mechanism behind epigenetic regulation, many questions are yet to be answered. In this study, the maize pericarp color1 (p1) gene is used as a reporter to study the nature of epigenetic inheritance of stable tissue-specific gene expression. An allele of p1, P1-wr was used as a phenotypic marker to investigate the transgenerational inheritance of Unstable factor for orange1 (Ufo1-1)-induced changes in maize.  Ufo1-1 activates p1 expression and thus phlobaphenes are ectopically accumulated throughout the plant body indicating loss of tissue-specificity of p1 expression. Previous study has shown that Ufo1-1-induced pigmentation phenotypes are only observed in a subset of P1-wr; Ufo1-1 plants. Interestingly, within this subset, pigmentation level is highly variable. Also, it has been shown that this increased pigmentation is associated with changes of DNA methylation pattern in the P1-wr distal enhancer and intron sequences. Moreover, the increased pigmentation phenotypes in the backcross population are accompanied by progressive loss of P1-wr methylation from one generation to the next. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the inheritance of Ufo1-1 through genotyping using linked markers. This information was then compared to the Ufo1-1-induced phenotypes to verify the epigenetic regulation of P1-wr by Ufo1-1.

A theoretical model for studying multilevel predictors of patient assessments of care was developed, based on Donabedian\u2019s structure-process-outcomes model and resource dependency theory, to guide this study.  Overall, the sample included 24,887 medical/surgical patients from 173 hospitals, nested in 46 counties in CA; the data were derived from the 2002 NRC Picker Patients\u2019 Evaluation of Performance in California (PEP-C) survey, the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey, and the Area Resource File (ARF).  The study employed three-level hierarchical linear models, where patient, organizational (hospital), and market predictors were introduced in a sequential model-building approach to explain variations across data levels in process quality and overall satisfaction with care.  Six of the ten hypotheses were either completely or partially supported by the results, providing support for the theoretical model.  This study found that variations in all domains of patient assessments of care abound.  Strikingly, however, most of the overall variations (95% - 99%) were within-hospitals, rather than between-hospitals or between-markets.  Patient characteristics accounted for up to 13% of variations at the within-hospital level.  Interestingly, despite the relatively small between-hospital and between-market variations, net of patient characteristics, organizational- and market- level characteristics predicted a sizable amount of the true variations in process quality and overall satisfaction with care domains.  The findings of this study suggest that most of the variations in patient assessments exist within the patient-health-care-provider relationship.  Overall, this study supports the robustness of patient assessments of care in elucidating and explaining sources of variations across data levels.  Other implications are discussed. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [251], "author_name_tesi": "AbuDagg, Azza ", "last_name_ssi": "AbuDagg", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Azza", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rhonda Belue", "Robert Weech Maldonado", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier", "Joseph Vasey", "Nilam Ram"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rhonda Belue, Committee Chair", "Robert Weech Maldonado, Committee Member", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Member", "Joseph Vasey, Committee Member", "Nilam Ram, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["quality of care", "hospital performance", "Patient experience", "organizational factors", "market factors"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "UNDERSTANDING OBSTACLES TO EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT: PERSPECTIVES OF POOR, URBAN GIRLS FROM NAIROBI, KENYA\n", "id": "10873", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "601", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study was guided by two questions: What are the in-school and out-of-school experiences of adolescent girls that are obstacles to their secondary schooling? And why do some urban Kenyan girls persist in school despite the serious challenges, while others do not? Data for this study was obtained by interviewing adolescent girls attending Kamu and Lafama Schools in Nairobi Province, those who had dropped out, and a sample of teachers teaching in the two schools.\nThis study established that the social construction of girls affected their educational attainment. This construction affected the perceptions of others about girls, and how girls viewed themselves. The negative views of girls permeated into the families and influenced the way the parents treated their daughters. The social construction and negative attitudes provided a fertile ground for sexual harassment that plagued the girls in and out of school. In addition, girls worked in the households and outside the households. However, girls\u2019 individual attributes added to their risks of not performing well in school. \nFor those who persisted, one environment compensated for the risks that were present in another environment. For instance, the school cushioned girls from negative events in the households for a sample of girls from Lafama School.

Despite the large evidence linking SES and health from birth and infancy throughout all adulthood, there are contrasting results on whether the health advantages associated with higher SES persist at older ages. In other words, it is not clear whether at older ages, socioeconomic factors keep exerting a protective effect on health, whether such effect gradually fades away, or whether such effect keeps increasing. Three hypotheses have been proposed to describe how social inequalities in health can evolve with age: (1) The persistent inequality hypothesis; (2) The age-as-leveler hypothesis; and (3) The cumulative advantage hypothesis. \n\tThe current study provides new evidence relevant to this debate. The overarching question is whether socioeconomic status continues to exert a protective effect on health at older ages. This theme is developed throughout three chapters. In each chapter I examine the relationship between socioeconomic status and health in middle and late life from a different angle. Chapter 1 focuses on the measurement of SES for elderly individuals. The rationale is that inconsistent findings relative to the SES-based health gap among the elderly may derive from the use of SES indicators that are not particularly suited for this population. In particular, I hypothesize that wealth is a more appropriate indicator of SES at older ages than the more commonly used measures of SES, such as income and education. I test this hypothesis by examining the age pattern of social inequalities in prevalence of conditions, by using simultaneously wealth, income, and education. Chapter 2 analyzes individuals\u2019 trajectories of chronic conditions and self-rated health. The research question I address is whether at the individual level aging is associated with a diminution of the protective effect of SES on health. Chapter 3 focuses on the problem of attrition (or sample selection). While no longitudinal studies is immune to this problem, studies that focus on health, especially at older ages, must pay particular attention because the process of sample selection due to health deterioration is closely linked to the outcome under investigation. In this chapter I describe four different methods that can be used to adjust for sample selection: Propensity score; Heckman\u2019s model; Inverse probability weighting; and Multiple imputations. Then I apply each method to the study of incidence of new chronic conditions between two points in time and compare how they perform. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13178], "author_name_tesi": "Acciai, Francesco ", "last_name_ssi": "Acciai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Francesco", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Hardy", "Melissa Hardy", "Glenn A Firebaugh", "Steven Andrew Haas", "Leif Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Hardy, Dissertation Advisor", "Melissa Hardy, Committee Chair", "Glenn A Firebaugh, Committee Member", "Steven Andrew Haas, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Social inequalities in health", "Health disparities", "Socioeconomic status", "SES", "Chronic conditions", "Chronic diseases", "Elderly", "Late life", "SHARE", "Europe", "Aging", "Health trajectories", "Longitudinal analysis", "Attrition", "Sample selection"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "THE WEAR AND TEAR OF FEEDING: INDUCED PLANT DEFENSES BY FALL  ARMYWORM HERBIVORY AND COUNTER INSECT ADAPTATION MECHANISMS", "id": "13111fea5007", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13111", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Feeding by insect herbivores induces defense responses in plants. Numerous studies have shown that plants recognize the mechanical damage as well as a variety of herbivore-derived cues present in insect oral secretions, saliva and frass to activate the production of specific defenses responses. Plant defenses negatively affect herbivore fitness; therefore to be able to feed on plants, insects need to develop specific adaptations to overcome defenses of their hosts. This can be challenging for herbivores that feed on a wide range of plants with diverse structural and biochemical defenses. In this dissertation, I studied defense responses induced by a polyphagous herbivore in some of its host plants as well as some of its adaptation mechanisms to counter the effect of these defenses. I used the lepidopteran fall armyworm (FAW) Spodoptera frugiperda, and its host plants maize, Bermuda grass, rice and tomato as a model system. The FAW comprises two host strains that are associated with different host plants in field conditions; the corn strain is mainly associated with maize, while the rice strain is mostly associated with forage grasses and rice. I specifically tested the presence of intraspecific differences in plant defense induction by the FAW strains and the composition of their caterpillar saliva. I also investigated the effect of caterpillar-associated gut bacteria on the modulation of defense responses in different hosts. In addition, I documented morphological and developmental adaptations of the FAW larvae to cope with their host structural defenses. The results of this study show that feeding by the FAW strains induced different defense responses in maize and Bermuda grass; this plant defense induction was associated with differences in the caterpillar saliva. The saliva of the FAW strains also has divergent protein profiles and differing expression of several salivary proteins. In addition, the saliva of the FAW contains non-protein compounds that actively regulate defenses in different hosts; these include several phytohormones and other presumptive small molecules. During feeding, the FAW larvae also secrete small amounts of regurgitant, I identified two bacteria isolates in the caterpillar oral secretions that modulated defense responses in tomato and maize plants. In addition, feeding by this insect induced the production of glandular trichomes in tomato and the deposition of silica in maize and rice plants. As adaptive strategies to feed on Bermuda grass and rice, the FAW larvae increased their head size to house larger mandibular muscles and potentially increase the biting force needed to feed on tough leaves. I conclude that FAW feeding modulates the induction of plant biochemical and physical defenses, which in turn induced plastic physiological and morphological changes in this insect species. The results of this dissertation highlight the importance of insect physiological and morphological plastic adaptations as means to feed on different host plants.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13089], "author_name_tesi": "Acevedo, Flor Edith", "last_name_ssi": "Acevedo", "middle_name_ssi": "Edith", "first_name_ssi": "Flor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Felton", "Gary Felton", "Dawn S Luthe", "John Frazier Tooker", "James Harold Marden", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Felton, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary Felton, Committee Chair", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member", "John Frazier Tooker, Committee Member", "James Harold Marden, Outside Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plant defenses", "fall armyworm", "insect saliva", "insect salivary proteome", "herbivore-induced defenses", "maize defenses", "induced plant resistance", "silicon", "insect mandibles", "trichomes"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Investigation of protein-RNA interactions of the TAR-RNA-binding protein (TRBP)", "id": "28614", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12281", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is dependent on multiple RNA silencing pathways, termed generally as RNA interference (RNAi). Silencing occurs through use of single-stranded RNAs, produced as double-stranded precursors, in two main modes: microRNA (miRNA) in multicellular organisms and small interfering RNA (siRNA) primarily in unicellular organisms. In order to prevent the degradation of these important RNAs, double-stranded RNA binding proteins (dsRBP) play a pivotal role in the high fidelity trafficking of RNA in the cell. Here we focus on the human immunodeficiency virus trans-activating protein response RNA binding protein (TRBP), a cofactor of the RNase III enzyme Dicer. We hypothesize that the intramolecular interactions between the dsRBDs in TRBP lead to high affinity double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding and ultimately, to higher specificity for the subset of dsRNA that are targeted for Dicer processing. \nTRBP contains 3 double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs). Here, we focus on the first two dsRBDs, which have been shown to bind dsRNA. By monitoring the binding affinity of the first two dsRBDs of TRBP individually (TRBP-dsRBD1 and TRBP-dsRBD2) and in tandem (referred to as TRBP-\u0394C) with respects to various lengths of Watson-Crick duplex (W-C) RNA, we saw that TRBP-\u0394C bound 10-fold tighter than the individual dsRBDs at every given length. This led us to hypothesize that the observed binding affinity in TRBP-\u0394C was due to the flexible linker region between TRBP-dsRBD1 and TRBP-dsRBD2. A subsequent linker length deletion studies showed that the linker length between dsRBDs correlates with binding affinity of the tandem complex. This result was bolstered by our circular dichroism results that showed there was no difference in total number of dsRBDs binding to a given length of RNA between the individual dsRBDs and that of TRBP-\u0394C. The combined results suggest that multi-dsRBD proteins, like TRBP, benefit from some form of intra-chain interactions. \nFurther inspection of TRBP-\u0394C\u2019s binding thermodynamics using isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that changing the linker length between dsRBDs modulates TRBP-\u0394C binding affinity. Jacobson-Stockmayer analysis of the linker length data suggested that TRBP-\u0394C may exhibit negative intra-chain cooperativity (i.e., between dsRBDs within the same molecule of TRBP-\u0394C) as the linker region contributes unfavorably to the Gibbs free energy of binding. This result was corroborated independently through a re-examination of the EMSA data, where application of a biophysically relevant model also suggested a negative intra-chain cooperativity of TRBP-\u0394C binding. However, this same model demonstrated that the negative intra-chain cooperativity is overwhelmed by the positive inter-molecular cooperativity (i.e., between different molecules of TRBP-\u0394C binding to the same RNA). More importantly, cross-analysis between the W-C RNA binding study and that of RNAs which contain helical imperfections demonstrated that TRBP-\u0394C is able to distinguish between RNAs with helical imperfections, such as miRNAs, from those without imperfections, such as siRNAs. These results highlight how TRBP can selectively bind to precursor miRNA, over other cellular RNAs, and deliver it to Dicer for downstream processing.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11662], "author_name_tesi": "Acevedo, Roderico ", "last_name_ssi": "Acevedo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Roderico", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott A Showalter", "Philip C.

It would seem that in order to best adapt, it is first necessary to make an accurate assessment of one\u2019s state.  Yet, phenomena such as the placebo effect continue to suggest that there is some benefit to self-deception when it comes in the form of optimistic belief.\n\nIn previous work, Byrne and Kurland demonstrated that self-deception could be fitness enhancing if it enables one to better deceive an opponent into not competing for a resource.  However, their model did not consider any effect of self-deception on one\u2019s actual performance if the opponent competes.  This thesis is a natural extension of Byrne and Kurland\u2019s work.  In this work, the relationship between beliefs and performance in fitness competition is examined.\n\nThe present work first assumes that belief in victory enhances one\u2019s performance and subsequently one\u2019s probability of victory.  It further assumes that one\u2019s capacity to believe in victory can be limited by past experiences of defeat.  Based on these assumptions, an evolutionary game model is used to analyze the relationship between a player\u2019s belief in victory and the final outcome of a competitive encounter.  Simulation is employed to provide a bridge between Byrne & Kurland\u2019s prior work based on probability distributions and future studies in which discrete player histories must be tracked.\n\nThe first step is to study a model where belief in victory enhances performance.  Next, the trends of a model where belief does not affect performance are examined.  The evolutionarily stable strategies resulting from the simulation runs are presented and interpreted.  Comparing the two models, conclusions are made about the relationship between beliefs and performance. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1278], "author_name_tesi": "Achampong, Christina ", "last_name_ssi": "Achampong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Christina", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eli Christopher C Byrne", "Soundar Kumara", "Dr Christopher C Byrne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eli Christopher C Byrne, Thesis Advisor", "Soundar Kumara, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Christopher C Byrne, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["collaboration", "competition", "hawk-dove", "evolutionary dynamics", "game theory", "self-deception"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A GENETIC SCREEN FOR SECOND CHROMOSOME MODIFIERS OF A TEMPERATURE-SENSITIVE PRESYNAPTIC CALCIUM CHANNEL MUTANT\nOF DROSOPHILA", "id": "8316", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5798", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Synaptic release of chemical neurotransmitters is triggered by calcium influx through presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels.

The cacTS2 mutant has also served as a starting point for further genetic analysis. To broaden our understanding of the functions and interactions of cac-encoded calcium channels, we conducted a screen for second chromosome genetic modifiers of the cacTS2 paralytic phenotype. Two\nmutations have been recovered as enhancers of cacTS2. Electrophysiological analysis indicates these mutations affect synaptic transmission. Both the mutations are alleles of the same gene.

Amongst the various factors that contribute to pausing, chromatin architecture in the promoter proximal region is thought to be one of them. In vitro experiments have shown that nucleosomes can impede elongation of RNA Pol II. Genome wide maps of Pol II and nucleosomes in Drosophila indicate a dynamic interplay between the two. Currently, there are two prevalent models regarding the relationship between paused Pol II and nucleosome positioning. The first model indicates that a positioned nucleosome could contribute to pausing of RNA Pol II. The second model suggests that it is the paused Pol II that contributes to determining nucleosome organization in the promoter proximal region of a gene. In this study, I asked the question, what is the effect on nucleosome position when the position of paused Pol II is changed? To answer this, I determined the position of paused Pol II in embryos from wild type flies and flies with a mutant form of RNA Pol II. Permanganate footprinting experiments showed that the mutant RNA Pol II is paused closer to the transcription start site than in wild type. I mapped the nucleosomes in wild type and mutant to see if the shift in the paused Pol II affected the nucleosome position. The results indicate that the position of +1 nucleosome does not change when the position of paused RNA Pol II is shifted.   \nPausing is widely recognized as an important step in regulation of gene expression and the mechanism of pausing and the factors involved are under investigation. The Drosophila hsp70 gene has long been regarded as a model gene to study promoter proximal pausing. Transcription of the hsp70 gene involves distinct steps, which include establishment of a paused Pol II, activation and release of the paused Pol II into productive elongation. Various factors are implicated in regulating these distinct steps. I have investigated the effects of depleting some of these factors on transcription of hsp70.  Using a beta-galactosidase reporter assay as an initial screen, I chose several factors that when depleted, showed reduced hsp70 transcription. Some of the factors are known to be important in transcription of hsp70, such as the activator HSF and the Pol II CTD kinase, PTEF-b. One surprising result was the effect of depletion of HDAC3.

Moreover, to translate scientific discoveries from the laboratory to commercial products, it is imperative to address some of the fundamental scientific barriers to nanomanufacturing, in addition to the ongoing research in the field of nanotechnology.\n\nThis thesis suggests that some of the above challenges can be addressed using experimental designs tailored to specific concerns. An instance of such a scenario is considered that involves a series of gas-phase nano-scale lubrication experiments for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Due to the physical unavailability of some of the C-6 alcohol molecules in the experiments, the experimenter is forced to deal with a design having one or more missing observations.\n\nIn this study, new Bayesian algorithms are proposed that combine information from the traditional Bayesian screening algorithm used for identifying active factors and three existing algorithms for missing observations. The criterion used for estimating the missing observations is predictive ability in addition to minimization of residual sum of squares (RSS). These new algorithms are applied to simulated data sets that resemble the setup of the nano-scale lubrication experiment assuming one and two missing observations.\n \nThe performance of the Bayesian algorithms are compared to the three existing algorithms that have minimal RSS as the only criterion with an appropriate performance measure, PRESSDiff. A comparison of the algorithms over the different positions of the missing observations reveals that in all the cases, the Bayesian algorithms perform significantly better than the non-Bayesian algorithms. In the study the robustness of the proposed algorithms to the initial model specified by the Bayesian screening method, various mismatches of active factors were considered. In all the mismatches considered for one and two missing observations, the results indicate that the Bayesian algorithms still outperform the respective non-Bayesian ones. Finally, judging from the studies performed, the Bayesian Complete RSS minimization algorithm seems to yield the closest estimates of the missing observations, while yielding the maximum predictive ability.\n\nIn some nanomanufacturing situations, due to the physical constraints in the process, it is impracticable to execute a full or fractional factorial experiment. In such cases, restriction on randomization is imposed and the experimenter is forced to resort to a split-plot design or some of its variants. Many processes in nanomanufacturing are conducted over a series of stages. Additionally, some of the process variables in some of the stages might be difficult or hard to change in terms of time, limited resources, or \u2013 in many cases \u2013 money. \n\nSpecifically, a polymerization process for the fabrication of nano-films is investigated, where the fabrication is carried out over three stages. To execute efficient experimentation and fully understand the intricacies at the nano-scale, split-plot designs that can be applied effectively over multiple stages are proposed with the aim of reducing the cost of experimentation, and their characteristics examined. General expressions for some of the properties of these designs and analysis are developed. As common design ranking criteria such as resolution and minimum aberration do not provide the \u201cbest\u201d designs in all cases, two new design optimality criteria are proposed. Catalogs of split-plot designs for three and four stages are created and ranked according to the proposed criteria.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4662], "author_name_tesi": "Acharya, Navin N", "last_name_ssi": "Acharya", "middle_name_ssi": "N", "first_name_ssi": "Navin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin", "Timothy William Simpson", "Seong H Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard, Committee Chair", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Committee Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "Seong H Kim, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["missing observations", "multistage designs", "restrictions on randomization", "nanomanufacturing challenges", "split-plot"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "House fly (Musca domestica L.) management in poultry production using fungal biopesticides", "id": "25655", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11379", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "House flies, Musca domestica L., are economically and medically important insect pests in poultry production facilities. Standard, chemical pesticide-based control options for flies are becoming increasingly difficult due to insecticide resistance and regulatory constraints. Biopesticides based on naturally occurring fungal pathogens could provide an alternative tool for integrated pest management (IPM) in poultry production. Here we addressed several issues related to field application, persistence and performance of fungal biopesticides against flies. We demonstrated that residual spray treatments of fungal biopesticides, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae could sustainably suppress fly populations through lethal and sub-lethal impacts on reproductive output. The study developed a cost-effective field delivery system whereby teneral adult flies are targeted via the application of oil-formulated spores to the lower portions of basement walls where flies momentarily rest to harden themselves following emergence. We also evaluated inexpensive, non-toxic contractor-grade plastic sheets as potential wall covering materials to support long-term spore viability. The infectivity of oil-formulated B. bassiana against flies on typical structural substrates of the poultry houses including plastic sheets declined rapidly within one or two weeks following repeated fly exposures. In further laboratory bioassays, conidia viability and enumeration tests demonstrated that flies reduced fungal persistence and infectivity through deactivation and physical removal of conidia, with higher fly densities and greater cumulative exposure hastening the decline. Nonetheless, flies\u2019 detrimental effects were substantially reduced at realistic (lower) densities and overall fungal efficacy was only marginally affected since very low densities of viable conidia were still able to cause rapid mortality, suggesting the potential for relatively long re-treatment intervals to achieve fly control. Fungal spray treatments remained viable for up to 13 weeks under laboratory conditions and periodic exposure of flies to the spray residue showed high levels mortality, with very little decline in mortality rate over time. Equivalent treatments placed in a commercial poultry house showed much more rapid decline. One trial at the end of summer showed conidia to remain viable up to seven weeks. However, repeats during the winter months revealed spore decay in one to two weeks, with fly mortality rates influenced accordingly. The exact reasons for the more rapid decay remain unclear but could be linked to high concentrations of ammonia in the basement areas, especially during winter when ventilation is minimal. While the rapid spore decay poses a challenge for operational use, our laboratory and field experimental results suggest the potential for adaptive treatment regimes with weekly spray intervals in conditions with very high fly populations and/or high ammonia levels, and potentially monthly spray intervals when fly populations and ammonia levels are reduced. Nevertheless, careful monitoring and adjustments of current housing and manure management to improve indoor air quality and create thermally stable environments would be necessary to increase the persistence and long term efficacy of biopesticide treatments. Overall, the study contributes to wider adoption of mycopesticide products as well as promotes commercial development of other potential fungal species/isolates and contributes to the reduction of pesticide consumption in the poultry industry.

The mathematical model for the physical processes in the mortar systems consists of a system of non-linear coupled partial differential equations, which also contain non-homogeneity in form of the source terms. This work includes the development of a three-dimensional mortar interior ballistic (3D-MIB) code for a 120mm mortar system and its stage-wise validation with multiple sets of experimental data. The 120mm mortar system consists of a flash tube contained within an ignition cartridge, tail-boom, fin region, charge increments containing granular propellants, and a projectile payload. The ignition cartridge discharges hot gas-phase products and unburned granular propellants into the mortar tube through vent-holes on its surface. In view of the complexity of interior ballistic processes in the mortar propulsion system, the overall problem was solved in a modular fashion, i.e., simulating each physical component of the mortar propulsion system separately. These modules were coupled together with appropriate initial and boundary conditions. \nThe ignition cartridge and mortar tube contain nitrocellulose-based ball propellants. Therefore, the gas dynamical processes in the 120mm mortar system are two-phase, which were simulated by considering both phases as an interpenetrating continuum. Mass and energy fluxes from the flash tube into the granular bed of ignition cartridge were determined from a semi-empirical technique. For the tail-boom section, a transient one-dimensional two-phase compressible flow solver based on method of characteristics was developed. The mathematical model for the interior ballistic processes in the mortar tube posed an initial value problem with discontinuous initial conditions with the characteristics of the Riemann problem due to the discontinuity of the initial conditions. Therefore, the mortar tube model was solved by using a high-resolution Godunov-type shock-capturing approach was used where the discretization is done directly on the integral formulation of the conservation laws. A linearized approximate Riemann Solver was modified in this work for the two-phase flows to compute fully non-linear wave interactions and to directly provide upwinding properties in the scheme. An entropy fix based on Harten-Heyman method was used with van Leer flux limiter for total variation diminishing. The three dimensional effects were simulated by incorporating an unsplit multi-dimensional wave propagation method, which accounted for discontinuities traveling in both normal and oblique coordinate directions.\nFor each component, the predicted pressure-time traces showed significant pressure wave phenomena, which closely simulated the measured pressure-time traces obtained at PSU. The pressure-time traces at the breech-end of the mortar tube were obtained at Aberdeen Test Center with 0, 2, and 4 charge increments. The 3D-MIB code was also used to simulate the effect of flash tube vent-hole pattern on the pressure-wave phenomenon in the ignition cartridge. A comparison of the pressure difference between primer-end and projectile-end locations of the original and modified ignition cartridges with each other showed that the early-phase pressure-wave phenomenon can be significantly reduced with the modified pattern. The flow property distributions predicted by the 3D-MIB for 0, 2, and 4 charge increment cases as well the projectile dynamics predictions provided adequate validation of theory by experiments.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5428], "author_name_tesi": "Acharya, Ragini ", "last_name_ssi": "Acharya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ragini", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth K Kuo", "Kenneth K Kuo", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "John Harlan Mahaffy", "Richard A Yetter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth K Kuo, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth K Kuo, Committee Chair", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "John Harlan Mahaffy, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Granular bed combustion", "Two-phase flows", "Riemann solvers", "Modeling", "Numerical simulation", "Interior ballistics", "Compressible flows"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Employers' Perception of Graduates with Entry-level Technical Skills from the Construction Industry Programs in Ghana and Nigeria", "id": "16922", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8713", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\tThe purpose of this comparative study was to identify the technical skills and abilities needed by prospective employees of construction industries in Ghana and Nigeria. Potential employees were defined here as recent graduates of construction industry programs with entry-level technical skills. The continuous growth in and expansion of these two countries\u2019 construction industries have led to exponential growth in positions that require certain technical skills\u2014finding workers with the requisite skills remains a major challenge for employers in Ghana and Nigeria. Employers have expressed concerns about the lack of adequately trained graduates and feel that educational institutions are not producing graduates with skills that match these industries\u2019 needs.\n\tThree research questions were developed based on employers\u2019 statements about needs, expectations and experiences. This information was utilized in examining employers\u2019 perceptions of recent applicants for positions in the construction industries in Ghana and Nigeria. The methodological design for this study was quantitative in nature and based on a survey instrument developed and used to collect data; a literature review provided secondary information. The target population included human resource and related administrators at construction industries, and professionals in construction industry programs. The sites for this study included Ghana and Nigeria. The survey was administered to 112 participants, 58 of whom were from Ghana and 54 from Nigeria.\n\tFindings revealed differences with broad implications for skills training. Most companies were located in urban areas; fewer were in rural communities. More construction companies had been established before 2000 compared to companies established in later years. With regard to employers\u2019 needs (to address research question one), employers were asked to cite the desired technical skills and abilities considered necessary for employment of recent graduates. Most respondents indicated a need for all technical occupations listed in the study, although the needs varied between employers in Ghana and Nigeria (carpentry, plumbing, masonry, electrical, drafting, welding, and HVAC systems). When participants were asked to describe their perceptions of the skills shortage, most indicated that a lack of appropriate technical skills was contributing to the skills shortage. \n\tWith regard to opinions on skills shortages and the belief that employers\u2019 elevated requirements are contributing to these shortages, most participants indicated that high requirements were not contributing to skills shortages although few respondents disagreed with the statement. With respect to demands of the global market, most indicated that these demands were also not contributing to skills shortages\u2014few respondents disagreed. Looking next at technical skills, most participants indicated that technical skills have contributed to skills shortages. While most respondents indicated that production methods were not causing skills shortage, there were significant differences in opinion on this topic between Ghana and Nigeria. An ANOVA analysis of the importance attached to various employee attributes pointed to the importance of being able to work under stressful conditions with a p-value (<.001), and to maintain a positive work attitude with a p-value of .029. Variables found to be insignificant included: the ability to work independently; ability to respond to constructive criticism; ability to collaborate in teams; additional skills and responsibilities; and ability to supervise others. These variables were greater than (>.05), so there were no statistically significant differences between Ghana and Nigeria with respect to the indicated variables.  \n\tWith regard to policy on technical skills training, industry involvement in curricular planning was significant and very different between Ghana and Nigeria. There were no significant differences in curricular responsiveness to national needs, and a strong relationship between education and the industry and other domains. Most participants indicated keeping records of graduates\u2019 technical skills in order to better match them with potential employers. Looking at hiring trends, most respondents from Ghana and Nigeria indicated that the rate of hiring was increasing\u2014few indicated that the hiring trend had remained the same or was decreasing. With regard to criteria used to evaluate graduates, there was a significant difference between Ghana and Nigeria with respect to amount of time spent to accomplish a task. The remaining domains\u2014types of work performed by entry-level graduates and productivity and quality of work\u2014were not significant.\n\tLooking next at employers\u2019 perceptions of graduates\u2019 work experiences, most respondents agreed that graduates did not have business and industry knowledge. The majority of respondents also agreed that graduates do not have the appropriate technical skills. With regard to workplace values, intelligence, and mindset, most agreed that graduates do not have the requisite degrees of each. There were no differences between Ghana and Nigeria concerning graduate internship experiences, cooperative experiences and work experiences. \n\tStudy findings have broad implications for practice, research, and training. Further research should be conducted in areas of significant difference identified in this qualitative study. Where no such differences exist, a support structure\u2014including, e.g., training programs that can sustain the industry\u2019s workforce\u2014is essential.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8579], "author_name_tesi": "Acheampong, Philip ", "last_name_ssi": "Acheampong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Philip", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ladislaus M Semali", "Edgar I Farmer Sr.", "Michael Adebola Adewumi", "Richard Allen Walter", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ladislaus M Semali, Dissertation Advisor", "Edgar I Farmer Sr., Committee Chair", "Michael Adebola Adewumi, Committee Chair", "Richard Allen Walter, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Building construction industry programs", "Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)", "Employers' perception of graduates with entry-level technical sk", "Skills", "Skills gap", "Technical skills"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "SECURITY IN SOFTWARE DEFINED NETWORKING - AN ANALYSIS OF NEW ATTACK AND DEFENSE VECTORS", "id": "15014sxa307", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15014", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a novel concept in computer networks that enables a central controlling platform to dynamically program the data-plane of a network with the usage of flow rules. This separation of the control- and data-plane provides a framework for the implementation of novel network applications.\nThis dissertation investigates the potential of Software Defined Networking in the security domain of computer networks. By considering two aspects, \"Security through SDN\" and \"Security of SDN\", we demonstrate the ability to implement novel defense systems on the basis of SDN as well as discuss how advanced adversaries are able to attack the core parts of an SDN. This analysis motivates the development of a novel security framework which is able to generate network configurations for SDNs that meet defined security properties.\nIn particular, we investigate network reconnaissance which is performed by malicious insiders and is a pre-phase of advanced targeted cyber attacks. Network virtualization techniques, such as SDN, provide the ability to deploy novel defense mechanisms which hide crucial system information from attackers, while maintaining a high quality of system performance for legitimate users. We discuss the development and implementation process of such a system in this dissertation.\nAttacks such as denial of service, that are launched on SDN-enabled networks may affect current flows traversing the network and disrupt the provided services. For a quick and successful reconfiguration of an SDN-enabled network to reestablish the network services after a cyber attack a deep analysis of the process to deploy a flow rule based network configuration on the data-plane is necessary. We analyze the dominating factors of the network configuration time in SDN and propose optimization models and algorithms to minimize the required time to compute and deploy flow rule based network configurations. We demonstrate that our approach is able to minimize the time required to recover after a cyber attack causing certain network resources to suddenly become unavailable.\nWhile SDN provides a platform for the development of novel defense approaches, weaknesses arise if attackers apply advanced techniques, such as network forensics, to exploit the configuration details of SDN-based applications.\nTo demonstrate that network virtualization, with the use of SDN, extends the attack surface of traditional networks, we show that adversaries are able to reconstruct the details of SDN flow rules on the data-plane and exploit the collected information to launch targeted cyber attacks.\nAdversaries performing advanced network forensics as well as numerous other attack strategies on SDN, pursue different goals but are all based on a small set of attack techniques. \nOnce untrusted nodes are in the perimeter of a network, actions such as probing and transmission of spoofed packets can be performed, which often lead to severe security issues. While novel network architectures such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) are sensitive to attacks involving lateral movement and spoofed traffic they also provide a framework to enforce flow isolation between and across network devices with a fine granularity. To ensure secure information flow between entities a framework that guarantees flow isolation has to implement a proven security policy such as multilevel security (MLS). To achieve secure information flow in a network we introduce a framework, MLSNet, that will find a network configuration given a security lattice, a network topology and a labeling of nodes that guarantees an assignment of flows in the network compliant with an MLS policy. To automatically generate such a configuration we provide two optimization models to compute a network configuration that meets the defined security constraints.\nWe further identify a set of principles for the construction of secure SDN flow rules to deploy a policy compliant configuration on the data-plane.\nThe security issues pointed out in this work motivate the requirement for agile and advanced defense approaches which are able to dynamically react to cyber attacks not addressed by traditional defense mechanisms. The analysis of attack and defense techniques presented in this dissertation are going beyond traditional mechanisms, and additionally consider the impact, in terms of performance, on the provided services and virtualized resources.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16483], "author_name_tesi": "Achleitner, Stefan ", "last_name_ssi": "Achleitner", "first_name_ssi": "Stefan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas F Laporta", "Thomas F Laporta", "Patrick Drew Mcdaniel", "Trent Ray Jaeger", "Soundar Kumara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas F Laporta, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Chair", "Patrick Drew Mcdaniel, Committee Member", "Trent Ray Jaeger, Committee Member", "Soundar Kumara, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Network Security", "Software Defined Networking", "Cyber Security", "Computer Networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Diversification of intertidal onchidiid slugs in the Indo-West Pacific: Systematics, Evolutionary History, and Biogeography", "id": "14784tcg153", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14784", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Onchidiidae are one of the most poorly known groups of mangrove gastropods and the taxonomy of the onchidiids has long remained in confusion.

Ostensibly, the similarity suggests that friends mutually influence one another through the reinforcement of pro-delinquent values, the modeling of skills necessary to commit criminal offenses, and/or the normative conformity to behavioral expectations. An alternative interpretation, however, is that the behavioral similarity reflects the reality that adolescents prefer friendships with like-minded peers. In other words, adolescents self-select friends who already behave as they do. \nMeasurement artifact is another explanation of the similarity, which occurs because researchers have often obtained information about an adolescent\u2019s friends from survey respondents themselves rather than from the friends directly. Survey respondents, however, often fail to report their friends\u2019 behaviors accurately. \nThis project also examines the relative degree to which males and females conform to their peers, a long-standing issue in social psychology. The social psychological evidence often suggests that females are more conforming than males are; however, evidence also exists that group differences and other aspects of conformity are behavior specific. Therefore, research suggesting that females conform more to group opinion about light movement or innocuous behaviors may not generalize to delinquent outcomes.\nIn order to more fully examine these issues, this thesis uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health, a recently available data set based upon a large, nationally representative sample of high school students. Using these data, this project examines how closely changes in adolescent delinquency correspond to changes in the behavior of their friends. It also examines the role that delinquency plays in friendship selection and termination. \nThe major findings include: (a) correspondence between changes in male respondent delinquency and changes in male friend delinquency, (b) little to no evidence for the importance of delinquency for friendship termination decisions, (c) evidence of same-gender rather than opposite-gender short-term effects, and (d) a modest delinquent similarity among adolescent friends measured prior to the formation of the friendship that may be explained by similarity in characteristics associated with delinquency.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2827], "author_name_tesi": "Ackerman, Jeffrey M.", "last_name_ssi": "Ackerman", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard B Felson", "D Wayne Osgood", "Michael Paul Johnson", "Joseph Francis Schafer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard B Felson, Committee Chair", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "Michael Paul Johnson, Committee Member", "Joseph Francis Schafer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["interpersonal-influence", "peers", "delinquency", "friends", "adolescents", "gender"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "NOVEL APPROACHES TO MODULATE ORNITHINE DECARBOXYLASE ACTIVITY AND TO DETERMINE A ROLE FOR ORNITHINE DECARBOXYLASE IN CELL TRANSFORMATION", "id": "6533", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2832", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-12-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is known to have an important role in cell transformation, but that role is not well understood.  The scientific and clinical value of reducing the activity of ODC, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines, is well appreciated. Polyamines are necessary components for cell growth and manipulation of polyamine homeostasis may be an effective strategy for the treatment of a number of disorders, including neoplastic diseases.  Indeed, &#61537;-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor of ODC is currently in clinical trials as a potential chemopreventative/therapeutic agent and is clinically used for other disorders.  However, the effectiveness of DFMO is limited by the drug's pharmacokinetic profile and the unique regulation of ODC.  \nTargeting ODC mRNA may be an effective method to reduce ODC activity due to the enzyme's extensive regulation at the translational and protein levels.  The half-life of ODC is among the shortest of any known protein.  Due to the rapid turnover of ODC protein, cells are reliant on translation of new protein to maintain or elevate ODC activity.  A number of reports have indicated that little to no change in ODC mRNA content is often detected upon substantial increases or decreases in ODC protein content and activity.  Reversible inhibitors of ODC protein have a disadvantage because they can stabilize ODC from degradation.  The initial inhibition of ODC leads to increased ODC transcription and active ODC can accumulate in the cells.  Conversely, the efficacy of irreversible inhibitors may be limited by the short half-life of ODC.  Therefore targeting ODC mRNA, rather than protein, may be a better strategy.  \nAn approach to develop an effective 10-23 DNAzyme and hammerhead ribozyme against ODC is described in these studies.  DNAzymes and ribozymes bind to a cognate RNA substrate via Watson-Crick base pairing hybridization arms and subsequently catalyze cleavage of a phosphodiester bond of the RNA.  The major difference between the two is the base composition; DNAzymes are composed of DNA, ribozymes of RNA. DNAzymes capable of cleaving the target ODC RNA were identified in vitro and further characterized by the effect each had on ODC protein and activity levels using in vitro translated ODC RNA. ODC protein levels and activity correlated well with the RNA cleavage activity of the DNAzyme. A DNAzymes that exhibited good activity was optimized for use in cell culture studies. The length of the DNAzyme hybridization arms was altered and kinetics were performed to identify the most catalytically efficient configuration. One DNAzyme, DZ IV, with equal length arms of nine nucleotides proved to be the most catalytically efficient. In HEK 293 cells, DZ IV was able to reduce the amount of translated ODC protein resulting in ~80% reduction in ODC activity\u2014a statistically significant enhancement over the antisense effect of a catalytically inactive DNAzyme. \nThe effectiveness of DZ IV was evaluated an in vivo model with clinical significance.  DFMO is currently undergoing clinical trials for chemoprevention in skin cancer and topical application of DFMO is FDA-approved for the treatment of unwanted facial hair.  ODC activity is induced in the skin in response to tumor promoters, including 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA).  Topical DZ IV reduced TPA-induced ODC activity by ~50 % over vehicle control in the dermis of mice.  The result is more impressive considering that TPA treatment induces ODC activity ~1000-fold over basal levels.  \nHammerhead ribozymes targeted against ODC were designed to sites identified by a ribozyme site selection screen.  Two of the identified sites cleaved ODC mRNA within 5 nucleotides from the DZ IV cleavage site indicating that this is an accessible site within the mRNA.  Four of the ribozymes that most effectively cleaved in vitro transcribed RNA were cloned into a novel expression vector.  The ribozymes were evaluated in cell culture, however an accurate assessment could not be made due to non-specific silencing from the expression vector.  The ribozymes may be active but must be evaluated with a different expression system.\nODC is known to have an important role in cell transformation, but that role is not well understood.  A better understanding of the role of ODC in transformation may identify effectors downstream of ODC that are better drug targets.  NIH/3T3 cells transfected with an activated Ras mutant (3T3+HRas(61L) cells) display a transformed phenotype, but the transformed phenotype can be reversed by co-expression of a dominant-negative ODC (3T3+HRas(61L)+ODC-dn cells).  Microarray analysis was performed on the 3T3, 3T3+HRas (61L) and 3T3+HRas(61L)+ODC-dn cells and genes potentially downstream of ODC that are essential for Ras transformation in 3T3 cells were identified.  \nIn conclusion, these results indicate that targeting ODC at the mRNA level is an effective way to modulate ODC activity.  An effective DNAzyme has been demonstrated to be active in vitro and in vivo and can be used as a tool to study the function and translational regulation of ODC and the potential of DNAzymes for therapeutic uses.  Identification of effectors downstream of ODC that cooperate in transformation may provide better chemopreventative/therapeutic drug targets than ODC.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2828], "author_name_tesi": "Ackermann, Joseph Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Ackermann", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony Edward Pegg", "Melvin Lee Billingsley", "Mark Kester", "Lisa M Shantz", "Charles D Smith", "Kent Eugene Vrana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony Edward Pegg, Committee Chair", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member", "Mark Kester, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member", "Charles D Smith, Committee Member", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polyamines", "ornithine decarboxylase", "gene silencing", "DNazyme", "ribozyme", "antisense oligodeoxynucleotides", "difluoromethylornithine", "DFMO", "resonance energy transfer", "RET", "FRET", "catalytic nuleic acids"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Leadership in Green Schools: School Principals as Agents of Social Responsibility\n\n\n", "id": "9368", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1118", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-01-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines the leadership practices of school principals who are promoting a social responsibility agenda; specifically through their work in a \u201cgreen school.\u201d The study specifically investigated how social responsibility agendas like green schools are promoted and advanced on a daily basis by school based advocates in administrative roles. The role of the green school principal was specifically examined throughout this study to gain an understanding as to how principals lead and function on a daily basis. \nThe central questions that guided this research were grounded in three separate bodies of literature that were all necessary to gaining an understanding of the principal\u2019s role. These research questions are: (1) Green Schools: What is the genesis of the Green Movement and its integration as a component of educational processes? Are there roles and responsibilities associated with leadership within a green school? If so, what are they? Is there a relationship between the Green Movement and the leadership styles adopted by school leaders working in green schools? If so, what is it? (2) School leadership practices associated with green schools: Do individuals come to the school leadership role as a priori advocates of green schools or do they become advocates as an outcome of their appointment? What educational leadership styles, models, and frameworks, documented by research and literature, are most representative of the practices of school leaders in green schools? How is school leadership in a green school similar or different from that in other schools? What are the challenges faced by school principals who are involved in a green school? (3) Social justice, responsibility, agency and the school principal: What are the attitudes, values and actions of school leader advocates of social justice, responsibility and agency? What do school leaders describe as their motivations for becoming involved in the Green School Movement? \n A case study methodology was adopted to conduct the study with five green school principals whose schools were located in Maryland, Washington D.C., Arizona and the two remaining schools were in Pennsylvania. The researcher implemented a three phase methodology that included examination of a document related to the principal\u2019s work as a leader of a green school, an observation in the principal\u2019s school and two separate interviews that focused on both the principals\u2019 day to day work and also their values, beliefs, motivations and challenges. The document analysis shed light on the principals\u2019 early experiences with ecological issues and in the greening process.  The in-school observation period allowed the researcher to see how the green school was currently functioning and the actual degree to which the principal was implementing green school agendas in their school. The two rounds of interviews with the participants allowed the researcher to gain insight into beliefs and practices that could not be properly observed in the first two steps. In particular, the interviews revealed information about the principals\u2019 previous experiences, influences, and what they believe about the Green School Movement. \nThe participants of this study provided a detailed view of the green school principal\u2019s role. The study shows that a green school leader plays six distinct roles. The roles are: inspirational/motivational/role model, supporter, collaborator, student, instructional leader and manager/planner. \nThe study also revealed that the principals demonstrate actions related to instructional, participative, transformational and environmental leadership. Additionally it was discovered that while some of the participants came to the Green School Movement as a prior advocate for environmental issues, other principals became advocates of environmental education after the greening of the school began. \nIn looking at what green school principals\u2019 value, five key values were identified. Green school principals are student-centered, they have a profound respect for teaching and collaboration, they feel it is important to include families and communities into the school, and then also promote ownership and stewardship of environmental action in the school.  Finally the principals each communicated their own personal commitment to the environment and were able to discuss at length why it is important to them.  These values motivated characteristic actions on the part of the principals.  The key actions that the principals manifested were self-educating, shaping the curriculum around environmental issues, and then promoting powerful professional development experiences for the staff so that they too can be motivated to promote ecological issues in their practice. \nThe study also found that green school principals are motivated by an internal need to feel challenged and the opportunity to task risks for what they feel are worthwhile causes. The principals discussed being externally motivated by environmental issues which in turn motivates them to become dedicated advocates. Finally, the researcher found that there were characteristic challenges associated with being a green school leader. The challenges were the construction and building process that takes place, the need for additional funding for green building and the hiring of teachers who are both highly qualified as educators as well as having knowledge of how to incorporate the environment into the subject matter. \nThe findings from this study contribute to the literature available for researchers interested in green schools, school leadership, environmental leadership, and leadership for social responsibility. While this study provides for a theoretical model for green school leadership it also provides for practical information for practitioners who are in the greening process. Finally, a number of future projects are suggested for study including comparing principals in leadership roles in a number of socially responsible school settings, and also further research that could provide for a more comprehensive look into how the greening process internally influences school leaders toward a position of environmental advocacy. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1107], "author_name_tesi": "Ackley, Carly R.", "last_name_ssi": "Ackley", "middle_name_ssi": "R.", "first_name_ssi": "Carly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Paul T Begley", "Dr Paul T Begley", "Roger C Shouse", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Paul T Begley, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Paul T Begley, Committee Chair", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Member", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ecological Literacy", "Environmental Education", "Educational Leadership", "Sustainability", "Green Schools"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "IN SITU STRESS MEASUREMENTS DURING MOCVD GROWTH OF ALUMINUM GALLIUM NITRIDE ON SILICON CARBIDE", "id": "7830", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2604", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Al(x)Ga(1-x)N is a wide band gap compound semiconductor material with the desirable properties of high chemical and thermal stability, as well as a direct band gap.  This makes Al(x)Ga(1-x)N particularly suitable for fabrication of deep-ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronic devices.  However, there are currently no readily available bulk group III-nitride substrates, hence growth must be carried out on foreign substrates, such as sapphire or silicon carbide.  This leads to epitaxial misfit between the film and substrate, as well as strain due to mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) during a temperature change.  Cracking is often attributed to these differences between film and substrate, and also between Al(x)Ga(1-x)N layers of different compositions.  The important role of growth-related stress is less obvious and not as well understood in this process.  Due to the dynamic nature of these stresses, it is often difficult to understand their behavior from post-growth measurements.  Hence it is valuable to study these stresses using an in situ measurement technique.  \n\nTo fabricate devices that are active at various UV wavelengths, a range of Al(x)Ga(1-x)N compositions must be deposited, often within the same device structure.  Empirical observations have shown that Al(x)Ga(1-x)N layers deposited on such substrates have a tendency to crack that increases with the aluminum content of the alloy and with the silicon doping level needed to make n-type conducting material.  Therefore the primary goals of this study were twofold: to develop a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms contributing to stress evolution during deposition of Al(x)Ga(1-x)N thin films by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on SiC substrates, and to understand the dependence of cracking on the Al-content of Al(x)Ga(1-x)N.  In situ substrate curvature measurements performed with a Multibeam Optical Stress Sensor (MOSS) were used throughout this study to further this goal.  It is noteworthy that no prior literature reports exist studying MOCVD of Al(x)Ga(1-x)N on SiC using in situ techniques.\n\nThe first portion of this study investigated the changes in the stress evolution as the Al-fraction of the Al(x)Ga(1-x)N thin films was varied.  Gallium-rich alloys were observed to follow the pattern reported previously in the literature determined by post-growth techniques.  GaN deposited on AlN buffer layer initiated growth in compression due to epitaxial misfit that was partially relaxed by formation of misfit dislocations near the interface.  The growth stress relaxed with increasing GaN thickness until the surface became largely stress-free at growth temperature after growth of approximately 3 \u00b5m.  As a consequence of this direct measurement, it was determined that cracking in thick GaN layers is due solely to the CTE stress, and not due to any growth stress.  In contrast, the growth stress in Al-rich Al(x)Ga(1-x)N deposited on AlN was strongly determined primarily by the stress and defect structure of the AlN buffer layer, in combination with a small epitaxial misfit.  For sufficiently high Al-fraction, the AlxGa1-xN growth stress was tensile from the start of growth.  For compositions in between these two extremes, the stress evolution contained elements of both behaviors.  This was termed \u201cAl(x)Ga(1-x)N\u201d type behavior.  As with Ga-rich films, the initial growth stress was compressive.  However, the stress evolved into tension toward the end of growth.  The mechanisms from the two previously discussed regimes were determined to be active, in addition to a mechanism described in the literature as \u201cdislocation effective climb\u201d.  This mechanism is active when pre-existing threading dislocations with an edge component propagate into the Al(x)Ga(1-x)N epilayer, becoming inclined as they do so leading to reduction in the initial compressive stress and eventually generation of tensile stress.  This regime is also sensitive to the stress and structure of the AlN buffer layer.  \n\nIn the remainder of the study attempts were made to understand and modify the effect of the buffer layer.  It was determined that high (>10,000) NH3 / Al-precursor ratio produced AlN buffer layers with improved quality, relative to lower ratios.  This translated into reduced dislocation density and decreased tensile growth stress in subsequently grown Al(x)Ga(1-x)N epilayers.  Compositionally graded buffer layers were investigated to attempt to increase the mean compressive stress at the end of epilayer growth.  This technique was successful for GaN epilayers, with the thickest graded buffer layers producing the greatest effect.  However, as the Al-fraction of the epilayer increased, the effectiveness of the graded buffer layer decreased. This was attributed to the rapidly decreasing strain energy available.  One preliminary experiment demonstrated that dislocations become inclined when SiH4 was introduced during growth of Al(0.28)Ga(0.72)N, leading to increased tensile growth stress.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2597], "author_name_tesi": "Acord, Jeremy Daniel", "last_name_ssi": "Acord", "middle_name_ssi": "Daniel", "first_name_ssi": "Jeremy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Christopher L Muhlstein", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Christopher L Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["METAL ORGANIC CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION", "III-V NITRIDES", "STRESS MEASUREMENT", "EPITAXY"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Compassion at Work: Are in-role compassion displays beneficial or costly to the provider?", "id": "15104jad440", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15104", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Compassion is a prosocial reaction to observed distress involving feeling empathy and a desire to help.  When shown at work, compassion clearly benefits the recipient by alleviating distress (Dutton, Workman, & Hardin, 2014; Lilius et al., 2008) but its effects on the provider are less clear.  From one perspective, prosocial acts, such as displaying compassion, are beneficial to well-being because they promote positive social identity (Grant, 2007; Grant, Dutton, & Rosso, 2008) and generate personal resources (Lin, Ilies, Pluut, & Pan, 2017; Uy, Lin, & Ilies, 2015).  From another perspective, showing compassion as part of one\u2019s work role depletes resources and causes psychological distress, resulting in \u201ccompassion fatigue,\u201d a condition similar to burnout (Figley, 1995).  The purpose of this research is to contribute to knowledge and theory of compassion by shedding light on the conditions under which compassion displays can lead to enhanced versus diminished well-being.  It was hypothesized, based on Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), that three moderators \u2013 prosocial motives, emotional self-efficacy and display rule explicitness \u2013 would change the direction of the relationship between compassion displays and well-being outcomes (i.e., energy and physical health symptoms) as well as discretionary effort.  It was predicted the relationships would be positive for individuals who scored high on the moderator variables and that the relationship would be negative for individuals who scored low.  It was further hypothesized that these interaction effects would be explained by, or mediated by, psychological need satisfaction.\nHypotheses were tested with data from a daily diary study with a sample of auto and property insurance claims contact center workers who have compassion display rules as part of their role.  The three moderators were measured in a baseline survey.  Participants then tracked their compassion displays, need satisfaction, well-being and discretionary effort for nine days.  Results showed that, for employees with higher prosocial motives, compassion displays towards customers during a work shift were positively related to energy at the end of the shift and discretionary effort during the shift, but there were no relationships with these outcomes for employees with lower prosocial motives.  Further, for employees with higher emotional self-efficacy, compassion displays during a work shift were associated with physical health benefits later that evening; this relationship was not found for employees with lower emotional self-efficacy.  Need satisfaction did not explain the relationships between compassion displays and physical health.  Need satisfaction did mediate the effects of compassion displays on energy and discretionary effort, though not in the hypothesized direction.  \nOverall, the evidence supports the prosocial motivation view of compassion (Grant, 2008) over the fatigue view (Figley, 1995).  Unlike studies of caring occupation work settings in which compassion was associated with burnout or lowered well-being (Figley, 1995, 2002; Halifax, 2011), in a call center context with required compassion, compassion displays were not found to be exhausting.  Even in cases where employees felt controlled (i.e., low display or job autonomy) or when they were a poor fit with the job (i.e., low prosocial motives or low emotional self-efficacy), compassion displays did not directly result in diminished well-being or discretionary effort.  The relational and temporal contexts may explain the difference in findings.  Specifically, compassion displays may have positive motivational effects in short-term encounters whereas the depleting effects of compassion occur in longer, more intense interactions or relationships due to greater opportunity for the provider to develop more attachment to, and deep empathy for, the sufferer (Figley, 1995).

Control of the disease depends largely on the diabetic\u2019s adoption of self-care and health management strategies designed to control serum glucose levels. Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) is one process recommended to facilitate health behavior change and usually an expectation for the person who is recently diagnosed. However, outcomes of the formalized DSME programs are inconsistent and the overall process of actual self-care learning in the context of a recent diagnosis of diabetes is poorly understood. \n   The purpose of this phenomenological study was to enhance the understanding of the initial lived experience of becoming a diabetic. The focus was on the individual\u2019s engagement with learning new self-care activities and initiating changes in self-care commonly recommended in order to control serum glucose and generally manage the disease progression. The focus was not on how learning occurs or is accomplished as a process but rather on uncovering the key elements and the context of the actual experience itself to gain information not previously explored. \n   Using an interpretive phenomenological method of inquiry (van Manen, 1990), this study investigated the lived experience of becoming a diabetic in 10 adults recently diagnosed with type 2 (often referred to as \u2018adult onset\u2019) diabetes.

Although these themes framed the experience for all of the participants, they were not in a fixed order. Improved understanding of the experience of becoming a diabetic and responses to the disease, as revealed in this study, provides new insight into how to best support patients in similar situations.

However, in sub-Saharan Africa, the potential of sweet potato to contribute towards improvements in household food security in rural areas is hampered by the current low and sub-optimal productivity levels. The failure by local farmers to use clean planting materials, fertilizers, and pesticides is the leading factor associated with low sweet potato yields. This dissertation investigates the role of local knowledge and gender in farmers\u2019 practices of production, management, and storage of sweet potato planting material in the smallholder farming systems within the Lake Victoria Zone Region of Tanzania. The data used in this research was collected from a survey conducted by the International Potato Center involving 621 households, and from my own in-depth interviews and focus groups in the Mwanza and Mara regions. The study found that sweet potato is a subsistence crop mainly grown for household consumption and only the surplus is sold. The findings show that women are involved in all the aspects of crop production from vine acquisition and management to harvesting and selling. The men and children may act as enablers for growing the crop, performing the arduous tasks of clearing the land and weeding. Occasionally men support women in sourcing planting material far from their community of residence. \nThe majority of farmers recycle their planting materials from one planting season to the next. Farmers\u2019 knowledge of diseases and quality of planting material was found to be \u201cholistic\u201d;  farmers rarely distinguish between plant diseases, even though  they are able to tell when the plant is unhealthy or not. In terms of the seed supply, acquisition, and conservation, the studied communities can be classified into four typologies of villages along a seed surplus-deficit continuum: \u201cseed oasis,\u201d \u201cseed independent,\u201d \u201cpseudo-seed independent,\u201d and \u201cseed desert\u201d villages respectively. The \u201cseed oasis\u201d village represented by the Bugando village was found to be critical in maintaining the informal seed supply structure in the study area because it is where the majority of the traditional vine sellers are found, operating mainly around the wetlands and lakeshore areas. The mode of transaction of the planting material was found to be dependent on the type of relationship that exists between the vine provider and the vine receiver; relatives of the vine providers and farmers from the same community received vines for free, while vine receivers not related to the provider or from outside communities are charged for the vines. The traditional vine sellers were found to have negligible contacts with agricultural research agencies, hence they have limited access to sweet potato vine propagation technologies. There are several implications arising from the findings of this study. First, interventions in the study area (and elsewhere in rural Africa) that seek to improve sweet potato productivity must include and place women at the forefront given the evidence of sweet potato being a \u201cmamas\u2019 crop.\u201d Secondly, the findings imply a need and urgency to link traditional vine suppliers to scientists and extension agents to enable these vine suppliers to access improved vine production technologies. There is a need for policy attention towards providing support for the availability and access to irrigation infrastructure, and capital to enable the acquisition of inputs, including improved vines, fertilizers, and pesticides.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9716], "author_name_tesi": "Adam, Rahma Isaack", "last_name_ssi": "Adam", "middle_name_ssi": "Isaack", "first_name_ssi": "Rahma", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leland Luther Glenna", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "Ann Rachel Tickamyer", "Dr Clare Hinrichs", "Karl Stephen Zimmerer", "Jill Leslie Findeis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leland Luther Glenna, Dissertation Advisor", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Dissertation Advisor", "Ann Rachel Tickamyer, Committee Member", "Dr Clare Hinrichs, Committee Member", "Karl Stephen Zimmerer, Committee Member", "Jill Leslie Findeis, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Afica", "sweet potato", "farmers' local knowledge", "seed conservation", "acquisition of vine", "social embeddedness", "vines"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Religious Contexts and Adolescents' Risky Behaviors\n", "id": "6647", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "203", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sociologists have long been interested in how individuals are affected by the people with whom they interact and the environments where they live. Despite a plethora of research on contextual influences, little research has been conducted on religious contexts. Examining the association between teens\u2019 risky behaviors and three religious contexts, this project addresses this omission in past research.  \n\nTo begin I assess the extent to which friends\u2019 religiosity, religious schools and living in the Bible Belt are independently associated with first sex and delinquency. Because so few sociologists have examined multiple or overlapping religious contexts, we do not know which behavior is associated with which context.  Additionally, we know little about the extent to which more inclusive contexts, such as the Bible Belt are mediated by more immediate ones like friendship groups. I find that the more immediate and intimate contexts mediate Bible Belt influences: schoolmates religiosity is associated with first sex and friends\u2019 religiosity is related to delinquency and first sex.  \n\nThis project also examines the extent to which religious contexts are associated with attitude-behavior consistency.  Specifically, in which contexts are teenagers\u2019 own religious attitudes most likely associated with delinquency and first sex?  I address this issue by examining whether friends, school, or regional religiosity moderates the relation between individual religiosity and risky behaviors. I find that friends\u2019 religiosity moderates the link between individual religiosity and delinquency, but not first sex.   \n\nAdditionally, I look at the separate influence of romantic partner and friends\u2019 religiosity.  After establishing a direct relation between sex and friends\u2019 religiosity, I examine whether sex attitudes explain the association and find that guilt about sex, in part, mediates it.  \n\nFinally, I use longitudinal data to boost confidence about the causal direction by estimating the effect of friends\u2019 religiosity on sex. I also show that first sex is associated with subsequent friendship choices. \n\nMy analysis relies on two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Unlike previous studies, which use respondents\u2019 perceptions of their friends\u2019 behaviors, the data on friends and romantic partners for this study are taken directly from their reports. Likewise, my analysis improves on previous studies by using longitudinal data to establish causal ordering for friend influences, and multilevel models to correctly estimate associations between teens\u2019 risky behaviors and friends, school, and regional religiosity.\n \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [202], "author_name_tesi": "Adamczyk, Amy ", "last_name_ssi": "Adamczyk", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger Kent Finke", "Eric Silver", "Eva Sharon Lefkowitz", "Richard B Felson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger Kent Finke, Committee Chair", "Eric Silver, Committee Member", "Eva Sharon Lefkowitz, Committee Member", "Richard B Felson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["context", "delinquency", "sex", "religion", "friends", "schools"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Quantitative Radiographic Investigation of Mechanical Fasteners in Wood Connections\n", "id": "9575", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "343", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project deals with the use of digital x-ray imaging and image processing to quantitatively determine information about the strain behavior of dowels in wood connections.

In the Zagros Mountains of southwestern Iran, source mechanisms for six moderate-sized earthquakes are investigated using a combination of moment tensor inversion and depth phase analysis.  The six earthquakes that are studied were reported in global earthquake catalogs as having lower crustal or upper mantle source depths, but upon further study, it was found that all six nucleated within the upper crust.  This finding contributes to a growing number of studies indicating that seismicity in the Zagros Mountains is limited to the upper crust.\n     In both southern and eastern Africa, upper mantle structure was investigated to evaluate the thermal state of the upper mantle and implications for the source of uplift in each area. Rayleigh wave phase velocities were measured for these regions using a two plane wave approximation method and were then inverted for a quasi-three dimensional shear wave velocity model. In southern Africa, it was found that the lithospheric lid structure and the sublithospheric velocity reduction for the Kaapvaal Craton is comparable to the upper mantle structure beneath other Archean Cratons. Thus, little seismic evidence was found of an upper mantle thermal anomaly sufficient to support high elevations in that area. In East Africa, evidence was found for a broad thermal anomaly across the study region that extends from the base of the lithosphere into the transition zone. This anomaly is larger than previous studies have indicated and its presence and size imply a possible connection to the African Superplume.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [305], "author_name_tesi": "Adams, Aubreya Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Adams", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Aubreya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "Charles James Ammon", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Committee Chair", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Zagros Mountains", "tomography", "surface waves", "plume", "African Superplume", "Africa", "seismology", "southern Africa", "East Africa"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Secrets and Silences: Rhetorics of Unwed Pregnancy Since 1960", "id": "15292", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "7744", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Between 1945 and 1973, an estimated 1.5 million unwed pregnant women \u201cwent away\u201d until after they delivered their babies. Given the limited historical recovery of these women\u2019s stories, this project includes ethnographic interviews (with such women) and examines how the custom of \u201cgoing away\u201d during an era of hiding and surrender was maintained through practices of secrecy, shaming, and silence. The project also traces how the stigma of unwed pregnancy shaped public discussion as well as the spatial and bodily practices that determined where unwed, pregnant bodies were permitted to be and be seen during the 1960s and 1970s. \n\nThrough this investigation, I overturn a central myth: that by the 1970s, unwed mothers no longer needed to hide their bodies, given a cultural climate of new sexual permissiveness, the development of the birth-control pill, and the decriminalization of abortion (with the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling). I contend that the \u201clong 1970s\u201d represents a decade that is critical to understanding how unwed pregnancy shifted from being a private, silenced, hidden problem to being a problem of public concern, garnering significant attention in popular discourse, public policy, and governmental legislation. Despite shifts in terminology (\u201cunwed pregnancy\u201d became \u201cteen pregnancy\u201d when the latter was deemed an \u201cepidemic\u201d in 1976), and despite the fact that unwed, pregnant bodies slowly became more visible, practices of shaming, silence and erasure continued through the 1970s. This project suggests that the history of unwed pregnancy since the 1960s is one that is ever constructed as a problem\u2014whether a private, familial problem or one of greater public concern\u2014but always a problem that lacks a sound solution. \n\nThe legacy of such rhetorical constructions lingers today, as unwed and teen pregnancy discourses circulate widely (via television programming and film) and as political debate related to women\u2019s knowledge of and control over their own sexuality and reproductive health has been revived, suggesting the relevance of the historiographic work this project undertakes. In sum, I use rhetorical and feminist historiographic lenses to examine when and how pregnant, unwed women (girls, most often) have historically been spoken for and/or silenced, and I position this project as an attempt to revisit history and speak with such women about how that history can most fully and ethically be remembered and understood. \n\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7677], "author_name_tesi": "Adams, Heather Brook", "last_name_ssi": "Adams", "middle_name_ssi": "Brook", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheryl Jean Glenn", "John L Selzer", "Hester Maureen Blum", "James Hogan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheryl Jean Glenn, Dissertation Advisor", "John L Selzer, Committee Member", "Hester Maureen Blum, Committee Member", "James Hogan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["unwed pregnancy", "rhetoric", "Roe v Wade"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Higher education in the United States:  a historical, descriptive, and spatial analysis\n", "id": "22707", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8534", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThis dissertation represents the first historical, descriptive, and spatial analysis of higher education in the United States.

The secondary contribution of the dissertation is identifying a series of factors that influenced the spatial patterns of IHE.  Educational, federal, state, and demographic factors have shaped the geography of IHE and enrollment in the U.S.\n\tLiterature reviews trace the history of U.S. higher education from the founding of Harvard in 1636 through to the twenty-first century.  Maps of the historical spread of IHE set the review of literatures within a spatial context.  Periods of structural change in U.S. higher education between 1939 and 2007 are identified.  Traditional and spatial statistical analyses for IHE and their enrollments were conducted using the dissertation database.  Results are presented across multiple spatial scales, including the nation, state, and ZIP Code\u2122 levels.  A notable finding of the dissertation is that the spatial core of \u201ctraditional\u201d IHE has remained in the Northeast.  Western and southern states could not \u201ccatch up\u201d with the Northeast in terms of the concentration of either four-year or private, non-profit IHE relative to the college-aged population.

The use of pheochromocytoma (PC12) and lipidic, artificial soybean liposome cell model systems are presented as means to examine the physical properties and structures influencing exocytotic release, specifically fusion pore size and stability, lipid membrane mechanics and composition, and pharmacological manipulation with a neuromodulator.  First in Chapter 2, the effects of elevated osmolarity on neurotransmitter secretion from PC12 cells are presented.  The number of pre-spike \u201cfeet\u201d and the amount of transmitter released during these feet measured by carbon fiber amperometry were notably increased compared to control, a finding strongly suggesting that membrane mechanics play a modulatory role in presynaptic release by prolonging the lifetime of the fusion pore.  Next in Chapter 3, the fabrication and characterization of a seven-barrel carbon fiber microelectrode array are presented.  The tightly packed, individually addressed microelectrodes can be used to monitor exocytotic release from PC12 cells and events have been resolved at the sub-cellular level.  In Chapter 4, the inhibitory effect of estrogen on depolarization-induced release of dopamine from PC12 cells is discussed. This effect is dose-dependent and involves N-type voltage-gated calcium channels, both results that have not been reported previously for this neuromodulator.  Two concentrations of estrogen (10 nM and 50 \u00b5M) elicit release; however, intracellular calcium imaging reveals that calcium influx is significantly decreased for 10 nM E2, whereas it is unaffected for 50 \u00b5M E2.  This suggests two probable mechanisms for estrogen: one involving voltage-gated calcium channels at low, physiological estrogen concentrations and another altering cell function at higher pharmacological estrogen concentrations.  Such dissimilarity is important to consider when postulating a neuroprotective mechanism for estrogen.  The thesis moves to the direct measurement of the dimensions of a lipid nanotube present in an artificial cell model for exocytosis in Chapters 5 and 6.  A difference is shown to exist between situations when a micropipette is attached to the lipid nanotube which is then attached to a liposome (the tube-only case) versus when there is a vesicle is at the end of the micropipette (the two-vesicle configuration case). A method to electrochemically measure the inner diameter of the lipid nanotube is presented in Chapter 5 and these measurements as well as the differences between the tube-only and two-vesicle cases is with a theoretical model considering the different elastic free energy components of the entire system.  Membrane composition and the effect of increased lipid concentration in the membrane are further explored in Chapter 6. Lipid composition has a direct effect on the measured size of the lipid nanotube, therefore implicating a more active role for phospholipids in influencing sizes of nanostructures in nature.  Lastly in Chapter 7, a summary of this thesis as well as suggested future research directions aimed at furthering the understanding of neurotransmitter release are presented.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3446], "author_name_tesi": "Adams, Kelly ", "last_name_ssi": "Adams", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kelly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr, Andrew G Ewing", "Andrew Ewing", "Anne M Andrews", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Peter J Butler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr, Andrew G Ewing, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Ewing, Committee Chair", "Anne M Andrews, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lipid nanotube", "fusion pore", "liposome artificial cell model", "carbon fiber amperometry", "exocytosis", "microelectrode array"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Comparison of Accuracy of Simulations of Stepped-Diameter Yagi Antennas\n", "id": "16321", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7859", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Stepped-diameter Yagi antennas are used in multiple applications and are often designed with computer simulations.

This sequence, excavated between 1999 and 2005, has provided the longest stratified sequence from these periods in all of Egypt.  \nStratigraphic probes around the site indicate that further excavation of the sequence will go as far back as the 5th millennium BCE.  This thesis presents the stratigraphic and ceramic data from this excavation and places the sequence within the historical and cultural developmental framework of the 3rd millennium.\n\nThe interpretive aspect of this sequence is viewed through the lens of Robert J. Wenke\u2019s \u201cFirst Dynastic Cycle\u201d.  The adoption of an agricultural subsistence strategy, around 4000 BCE, is the first spark of a trajectory toward the great nation-state of the Old Kingdom which achieved its apex of power and stability the 5th Dynasty and collapsed suddenly at the end of the 6th Dynasty around 2200 BCE.  This \u201csingle epoch of transformation\u201d is a broad approach to the normally narrow focus of studying the rise and collapse of the state in Egypt.  The entire development from nascent agricultural society to the collapse of the first state in the late Old Kingdom is an evolutionary process which must be assessed holistically. Thus \u2018state formation\u2019 is perhaps best seen, not merely in the final centuries of the 4th millennium, but as a lengthy process, spanning some two millennia, during which the first iteration of the Egyptian state is actualized.\n\nBecause of the stratified sequence presented in this project, Mendes provides a unique opportunity to excavate in one place the entire First Dynastic Cycle: the rise of agriculture and complex society, prehistoric period of Egypt, the formation of the state, the first 400 years of experimentation in statehood, the apex of the first successful nation state in the world, and the last hurrah before its sad decline.  This archaeological sequence, therefore, will be the first to stratigraphically, and consequently ceramicly, unify prehistoric Egypt to its successor, the great state of the Old Kingdom.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4126], "author_name_tesi": "Adams, Matthew J.", "last_name_ssi": "Adams", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald B Redford", "Baruch Halpern", "Ann Eloise Killebrew", "Paul B Harvey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald B Redford, Committee Chair", "Baruch Halpern, Committee Member", "Ann Eloise Killebrew, Committee Member", "Paul B Harvey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ceramics", "mendes", "early dynastic", "old kingdom", "archaeology", "egypt", "delta", "pottery"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Dialog About Psychosocial Issues in Problem-Based Learning Sessions in Medical Education", "id": "13439nea11", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13439", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this qualitative case study was two-fold: to investigate the dialog about psychosocial aspects of health care in problem based learning (PBL) groups in a single medical school; and to describe the factors that learners and PBL facilitators identify as influencing dialog about these issues in PBL groups. Medical education is a specific form of adult education practice and this study is grounded in the fact that medical students must learn not only about the scientific and clinical aspects of health care but about psychosocial aspects as well. PBL is a widely used modality in medical schools where small groups of learners discuss open-ended, case-based scenarios, identify their own knowledge gaps and then gather information and engage in group dialog to meet their learning objectives.  The study aimed to examine how students discussed psychosocial issues in PBL sessions. The theoretical frameworks informing this study was cultural historical activity theory (CHAT) and the PBL literature. \nData were collected through the observation and recording of dialog in the selected PBL groups, and through individual interviews with selected learners and facilitators about the factors they saw influencing dialog about psychosocial issues.  Findings in regard to PBL group dialog about psychosocial issues indicate that in general, episodes of psychosocial dialog were observed to occur much less frequently, and were of much shorter duration, than dialog about scientific and clinical aspects of the case. Patient behaviors were the most frequently discussed psychosocial domain. Learners most often framed sociocultural issues as direct determinants of health care outcomes rather than asking critical questions about how these social and cultural factors, such as race and ethnicity, were linked to underlying differences in access to health care.  There was also a lack of reference to external information resources about psychosocial topics; further, learners often reacted to initiation of psychosocial dialog with laughter that indicated dismissive attitudes towards psychosocial topics. Findings in regard to participants\u2019 views on factors that influence psychosocial dialog focused on the need for  \u201chigh yield\u201d topics for PBL dialog that would relate to national high stakes exams; concerns for vulnerability and trust in groups around psychosocial issues that are sometimes perceived as controversial; the role of the facilitator, and learners\u2019 prior life and clinical experiences.

As such, researchers have long tried to understand the skillsets required to be successful in entrepreneurship in order to develop effective teaching strategies to produce more entrepreneurs and spawn economic development. Of particular interest has been developing entrepreneurship skillsets during engineering education because technology innovations and ventures represent high growth potential. While the United States has invested much effort into understanding and developing these skillsets in engineering education, many developing regions have yet to develop an understanding of motivations/ barriers for pursuing entrepreneurship, educational curriculum or programs that supports entrepreneurship skill development or provide a network to connect businesses, entrepreneurs and students together. These types of activities provide a means to effectively develop entrepreneurs and thus jumpstart economies, which is vital in regions like Morocco that suffer from soaring unemployment rates \u2013 25% or higher among recent college graduates \u2013 which has led to civil tensions. As such, it is important to study ways to teach and encourage engineering entrepreneurship in Morocco and other developing regions.\n\nTherefore, the objectives of this thesis were to: 1. Investigate the effectiveness of a two-day day engineering entrepreneurship workshop in Morocco for igniting interest in entrepreneurship, 2. Examine the motivations and perceived barriers of Moroccan engineering students (male and female) for becoming entrepreneurs, 3. Explore strategies to encourage women to continue into engineering and science careers (both traditional and entrepreneurial), and 4. Promote engineering entrepreneurship in Morocco, and North Africa more broadly.  A mixed methodology approach was used to answer these questions including qualitative analysis of focus groups and individual interviews, as well as quantitative analysis of survey data collected from a series of two-day engineering entrepreneurship stimulation workshops, held in two major Moroccan cities in 2013. In all, fifty-five Moroccan engineering students participated in this thesis research. \n\nThe results of this thesis provide valuable insights into Moroccan engineering entrepreneurship, offering: 1. A model of short-term engineering entrepreneurship education that effectively increases self-efficacy and interest, and that provides an alternative to traditional university courses, 2. Understanding of motivation and perceived challenges of Moroccan engineers who intend to pursue entrepreneurship, which can be used to generate targeted training in the future, and, 3. A theoretical understanding of the challenges that Moroccan women face in science and engineering, both in education and in their career paths.  This knowledge is used to generate recommendations and response strategies for increasing engineering entrepreneurship interest and involvement in Morocco that can be generalized with caution to elite engineering students in other North African countries.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8891], "author_name_tesi": "Adams, Samantha Pearl", "last_name_ssi": "Adams", "middle_name_ssi": "Pearl", "first_name_ssi": "Samantha", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scarlett Rae Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scarlett Rae Miller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["engineering entrepreneurship", "Morocco", "motivation", "self-efficacy", "gender", "women"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The controls and constraints of fine-root lifespan", "id": "22433", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10197", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite fine roots accounting for up to 50% of global terrestrial net primary productivity and 60% of soil respiration, surprisingly little is known about their ecology.  Much of our ignorance involving fine-root ecology stems from the difficulty in observing roots in situ without disturbing the environment they inhabit.  As a result, the ecological study of roots is still in its infancy.  Through the use of minirhizotrons and isotopic techniques, we are beginning to gain a better understanding of how long roots live.  However based on the different methodological approaches employed, the answer to this seemingly basic question can differ by as much as five fold.  Beyond these methodological discrepancies, a basic understanding of the controlling factors that govern root lifespan remains elusive.  Marshall and Waring put forward one of the early hypotheses regarding the controls of fine-root lifespan.  They hypothesized that fine roots are initially constructed with a static carbohydrate reserve and the use of this finite reserve to fuel the metabolic demands of the root dictates the root\u2019s longevity.  In Chapter 2, we examine this hypothesis in greater depth by labeling Sassafras albidum trees with 99% 13CO2 and tracking the fate of the label in fine roots that were at least two weeks old at the time of labeling.   If a root\u2019s carbohydrate reserves truly are determined at initiation, than no 13C labeled photosynthate should appear in the carbohydrate pools of existing, non-elongating roots.  We found that both root non-structural and structural carbon pools incorporate carbon from current photosynthate and as a result we found no support for the underlying assumptions of hypothesis put forward by Marshall and Waring. In Chapter 3, we investigate another hypothesis concerning the control of fine-root lifespan, namely that root lifespan is dictated by some metric of the costs of building and maintaining the root compared to the benefits the root supplies in terms of nutrient or water acquisition.  Here we used a combination of minirhizotron tubes and in-growth cores fertilized with nitrogen to see if roots supplying greater levels of a limiting nutrient do indeed have extended lifespans.  We found that for species with fine-root morphology, root lifespan was significantly extended by localized nitrogen fertilization, but this trend was not observed in species with coarse-root morphology.  Finally, in Chapter 4 we investigated the role herbivory plays in fine-root lifespan.  We know that herbivores and pathogens can significantly reduce root longevity, but how well roots are defended against such attacks remains unanswered.  We therefore investigated the relationship between levels of fine-root soluble phenolics, a putative measure of chemical defenses against root herbivory, and specific factors that have been shown to be related to fine-root lifespan.  Although we found significant correlations between fine-root phenolic concentrations and both root order and localized nitrogen availability, we were unable to find general utility in relating phenolic concentrations with factors that have been shown to extend fine-root lifespan.  Combined, the research described in the following chapters represents a significant scientific contribution in furthering our understanding of the controls and constraints of fine-root lifespan.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9884], "author_name_tesi": "Adams, Thomas ", "last_name_ssi": "Adams", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Eissenstat", "David Eissenstat", "Roger Tai Koide", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "Consuelo M De Moraes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Eissenstat, Dissertation Advisor", "David Eissenstat, Committee Chair", "Roger Tai Koide, Committee Member", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Member", "Consuelo M De Moraes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["root lifespan", "minirhizotron", "phenolics", "herbivory", "13C"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The lived experience of girl-to-girl aggression", "id": "7380", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4886", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nIn the last decade, much literature has focused on the indirect aggression occurring within adolescent girls\u2019 relationships, sometimes referred to as female bullying or relational aggression.

The experiences of girl-to-girl aggression in diverse groups of girls who are out of the mainstream because of poor relationship skills and aggression are notably absent, yet this group may be the most at risk for escalating and/or persistent aggression. Using a phenomenological strategy of inquiry, this study describes the lived experience of girl-to-girl aggression in six adolescent girls from a marginalized group, attending an alternative school. The girls were interviewed using an unstructured interview, and were asked to respond to selected readings from popular literature on girl-to-girl aggression and relationships. Themes and core meaning structures of girl-to-girl aggression in this population of girls were identified using Van Manen\u2019s methodology. The meaning structures are: attachment amidst risk, fighting as approach to friendship, protective response, and having friends and forming identity. The findings have implications for guiding nursing practice and research. This is the first study to identify girl-to-girl aggression as a path toward attachment and friendship. Nursing care needs to recognize the identity of girls in this population as fighters, and aggression as their way of protecting and holding on to relationships. Strategies include primary prevention to identify high-risk girls, mentoring programs using culturally congruent mentors, and emphasis on protective factors, friendship, and attachment through girls\u2019 support groups.\n \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4863], "author_name_tesi": "Adamshick, Pamela Zenz", "last_name_ssi": "Adamshick", "middle_name_ssi": "Zenz", "first_name_ssi": "Pamela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith E Hupcey", "Cheryl A Dellasega", "Glen Alan Mazis", "Janice Lee Penrod"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith E Hupcey, Committee Chair", "Cheryl A Dellasega, Committee Member", "Glen Alan Mazis, Committee Member", "Janice Lee Penrod, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["relational aggression", "female bullying", "adolescents", "marginalized girls"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Computational pipeline for the empirical detection of cleaved targets of small silencing RNAs using degradome sequencing data", "id": "10006", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "903", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Small silencing RNAs are short oligonucleotide sequences, usually 20-30 nucleotides long, and include microRNAs (miRNAs), short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), transacting siRNAs and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These small silencing RNAs play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression in the genomes of eukaryotes, by guiding gene silencing complexes to the appropriate target-gene transcripts. Confident identification of genes targeted by miRNAs is crucial to unraveling their biological relevance. In plants, miRNAs tend to have a high similarity to their target genes. Computer programs that search transcriptome-wide for sequence similarity to mature miRNA sequences have widely been used to predict miRNA target genes. Currently available programs have varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity and hence predicted target genes require experimental confirmation. Confirmation is time-consuming and can only be carried out on a one-at-a-time basis. In plants, the results of miRNA-guided, Argonaute-catalyzed cleavage of target genes are uncapped and polyadenylated fragments that are stable in vivo. Degradome sequencing is a transcriptome-wide method for capturing the 5' ends of these stable, diagnostic fragments of cleaved messenger RNA transcripts. Data from degradome sequencing provides empirical evidence for detecting cleaved miRNA targets and eliminates the requirement for experimental confirmation. I implemented an efficient and generalizable computational pipeline for transcriptome-wide empirical detection of cleaved targets of miRNAs. Using the computational pipeline, I was able to detect previously known targets of plant miRNAs and transacting siRNAs and also confirm previously predicted targets as well as detect novel targets.

The selection of appropriate suppliers plays an important role in improving companies\u2019 purchasing performance. Many researchers and firms have studied the supplier selection problem without taking into account the price-sensitive nature of the demand for certain products. A product\u2019s selling price has a significant impact not only on a company\u2019s ability to attract consumers, but also on its strategic decisions on matters such as supplier selection that are taken at the upstream stages of the supply chain. \nIn this dissertation, we start with the development of a new mathematical model for the supplier selection problem that refines and generalizes some of the existing models in the literature. We propose a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to find the optimal inventory replenishment policy for a particular type of raw material in a supply chain defined by a single manufacturer and multiple suppliers. Each supplier offers an all-unit quantity discount as an incentive mechanism. Multiple orders can be submitted to the selected suppliers within a repeating order cycle. We initially assume the demand rate to be constant. The model provides the optimal number of orders and corresponding order quantities for the selected suppliers such that the replenishment and inventory cost per time unit is minimized under suppliers\u2019 capacity and quality constraints. Then, we extend the model to simultaneously find the optimal selling price and replenishment policy for a particular type of product in a supply chain defined by a single retailer and multiple potential suppliers. Hence, we replace the manufacturer with a retailer subject to a demand rate considered to be dependent on the selling price. We propose an MINLP model to find the optimal order frequency and corresponding order quantity allocated to each selected supplier, and the optimal demand rate and selling price such that the profit per time unit is maximized taking into consideration  suppliers\u2019 limitation on capacity and quality. In addition, we provide sufficient conditions under which there exists an optimal solution where the retailer only orders from one supplier. We also apply the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions to investigate the impact of the supplier\u2019s capacity on the optimal sourcing strategy. The results show that there may exist a range of capacity values for the dominating supplier, where the retailer\u2019s optimal sourcing strategy is to order from multiple suppliers without fully utilizing the dominating supplier\u2019s capacity.\nNext, we study the integrated pricing and supplier selection problem in a two-stage supply chain that comprises a manufacturer stage followed by a retailer stage, both controlled by a single decision-maker. The manufacturer can procure the required raw material from a list of potential suppliers, each of which has constraints in regard to capacity and quality. In this model, the manufacturer periodically replenishes the retailer\u2019s inventory, the demand for which is proving to be price-sensitive. We propose an MINLP model designed to determine the optimal replenishment policy for the raw material, the optimal amount of inventory replenished at each stage, and the optimal final product\u2019s selling price at which the profit per time unit is maximized. Additionally, we provide upper and lower bounds for the optimal selling price and for the manufacturer\u2019s lot size multiplicative factor, which result in a tight feasible search space.\nNext, we propose an MINLP model to extend the prior model by considering a serial supply chain controlled by a decision-maker responsible for maximizing the profit per time unit by determining the following: the optimal amount of raw material to order from the selected suppliers, the optimal amount of product to transfer between consecutive stages in order to avoid any inventory shortage, and the optimal final product\u2019s selling price. Coordinating all these decisions simultaneously is a topic that has been neglected in literature. In addition, our model requires the order quantity received from each selected supplier to be an integer multiple of the order quantity delivered to the following stage, which means that a different multiplicative factor can be assigned to each supplier. This coordination mechanism shows an improvement in the objective function compared to those of existing models that assign the same multiplicative factor to each selected supplier. Moreover, we develop a heuristic algorithm that generates near-optimal solutions. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed model and the heuristic algorithm. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12620], "author_name_tesi": "Adeinat, Hamza ", "last_name_ssi": "Adeinat", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hamza", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dissertation"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dissertation, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Price Sensitive Demand", "Supplier Selection", "Serial Inventory System", "Heuristic Algorithm."]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "People of the land without land: A Socio-demographic study of Mapuche Poverty", "id": "18996", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7758", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent decades the international community has become more interested in the plight of the world\u2019s indigenous peoples. Defined simply in the Latin American context as people who are descendent from those who lived in the Americas prior to colonization, past research shows disproportionately high levels of poverty within indigenous communities. Latin America is home to scores of different indigenous groups, and prevailing research confirms high poverty levels, and their origin in limited access to education and employment, discrimination, and legacies of spatial segregation and marginalization. This research provides an in-depth exploration of poverty among the Mapuche people in Chile. The Mapuche are the largest indigenous group in Chile, numbering some 1.5 million, and yet the literature lacks a full appraisal of poverty among them. Historically, they have been relatively isolated in agricultural communities and reservations, and evince a high prevalence of economic deprivation. This becomes problematic for a nation state known for an impressive pace of economic development. Indeed, Chile has experienced significant economic growth in the past few decades since the introduction of neoliberal economic policies.  The claim is that poverty has been decreasing over that period for everyone including indigenous people.  The continuing existence of Mapuche poverty calls into question the prevailing economic policy. It also suggests some groups may require special support to benefit from economic growth.  However, some politicians in Chile deny the existence of indigenous people, suggesting a homogenous Chilean population, and discount the need for special attention to indigenous poverty.\nThis dissertation seeks to shed light on the problem of Mapuche poverty within the larger context of indigenous inequality. It uses a mixed-method approach. First, descriptive and multivariate statistical techniques are used to analyze nationally representative household survey data from the 2006 National Survey of Socioeconomic Characteristics, in order to provide a comparative understanding of the prevalence and etiology of poverty. Second, over fifty qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with Mapuche individuals as well as key informants who work for national agencies mandated to address indigenous problems, so as to probe more deeply into the nature of poverty and changes in indigenous identity.  The quantitative results confirm higher poverty prevalence among the Mapuche when compared to Chileans who do not identify as indigenous, a disadvantage that holds regardless of whether poverty is measured in absolute or relative terms. Multivariate analysis suggests this disadvantage is accounted for in part by human capital deficits, greater levels of employment hardship, rural residence and other factors. When poverty is defined in relative terms, the detrimental impact of being Mapuche obtains even with all covariates controlled.  The quantitative results offer a generalizable portrait of poverty among the Mapuche, but necessarily relies on pre-determined conceptualizations and operationalizations of concepts as basic as \u201cpoverty\u201d and \u201cindigeneity.\u201d In-depth interviewing was used to interrogate these ideas more deeply, to assess their relevance for the Mapuche people, and to hold the quantitative results up against their lived realities in both rural and urban areas. The qualitative results show that people understand poverty both in absolute and relative terms. Poverty is conceptualized by respondents as a lack of income and ability to participate in the consumer-based culture. Although lifestyles vary between urban and rural areas, respondents also associate poverty with not being able to afford the lifestyle they feel they should have relative to those around them. Discussions of poverty led to broader discussions of values and well-being showing an increasing worry among Mapuche respondents about economic growth and the loss of community and Mapuche lifeways.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7691], "author_name_tesi": "Ader, David Russell", "last_name_ssi": "Ader", "middle_name_ssi": "Russell", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leif Jensen", "Leland Luther Glenna", "Anouk Patel", "Stephen Matthews"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leif Jensen, Dissertation Advisor", "Leland Luther Glenna, Committee Member", "Anouk Patel, Committee Member", "Stephen Matthews, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mapuche", "Indigenous Poverty", "Indigeneity", "Chile", "Ethnic Identity"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Implications of Control in Routine Skilled Performance\n\n\n\n", "id": "9643", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3692", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes a series of experiments that were conducted to examine the influence of certain types of external actions and certain forms of goal criteria on routine skilled performance.

As the world is beginning to march towards the Internet of Things, surging interest has been focused on low-cost functional electronics. However, the industry of electronics is inundated with traditional inorganic semiconductors. Silicon and germanium based inorganic semiconductors are rigid and fragile, requiring expensive processing. On the other hand, organic semiconductors based electronic devices, namely field effect transistors (FETs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), offer a feasible alternative to their inorganic counterparts. Not only are organic semiconductors soft and flexible, but they also possess advantages such as solution processability and chemical modifications. Despite the lucrative advantages, the performance of organic semiconductor-based devices is significantly lower. For instance, the highest hole mobility in one of the best performing organic FETs is two orders of magnitude lower than in inorganic transistors. Moreover, the behavior of organic semiconductors is very complex and is readily susceptible to their surroundings. Due to such complex nature of organic semiconductors, an unambiguous road map to high-performing organic FETs (OFETs) is still missing.\nThe focus of this dissertation is on elucidating and tuning different factors that govern the performance of OFETs. An OFET is a complex structure comprised of three metal electrodes, an active layer (semiconducting layer) and a gate insulator (dielectric layer). One of the key parameters that determine the performance of OFETs is charge carrier mobility. The charge mobility of an OFET is affected by various factors\u2014mainly the chemical structure of an active layer material, the morphology of an active layer and the interactions at the semiconductor-dielectric interface. \nTo understand the role of chemical structure on the performance of organic semiconductor, octyl side-chains are added to [1]benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene (BTBT) core. BTBT is a liquid crystalline material with poor solubility and weak semiconducting properties.  The addition of alkyl side-chains is expected to increase the solubility of the core. However, the average FET hole mobility in the single crystalline BTBT with two octyl side-chains (C8BTBT) (\u03bc = 6.0\u00b11.0 cm2/V-1s-1) is three orders of magnitude higher than in the single crystalline BTBT core itself. The use of a single crystalline layer rules out any morphological effect on the performances. Moreover, the intrinsic charge transport parameters of single crystals predicted using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations remain essentially the same. Since both morphology and crystal structure seem to have virtually no effect on the measured charge mobilities of BTBT derivatives, what else could have affected the charge mobilities? It is hypothesized that inter-molecular dynamics may be an unaccounted factor. To probe the collective inter-molecular motions\u2014also known as phonon\u2014inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is performed. The results from INS show that lattice vibrations are significant in the BTBT core. In contrast, the vibration modes are completely diminished in C8BTBT, suggesting that the addition of octyl side-chains suppresses lattice vibrations in the BTBT core. The alkyl side-chain assisted reduced electron-phonon coupling may have led to the enhanced hole mobility in C8BTBT.\nIn addition, the morphology of C8BTBT thin films is also optimized to improve an average hole mobility in FETs. It has been found that by melting and quenching spun-cast C8BTBT films, the average hole mobility of FETs is improved by a factor of five. Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAS) results show that the melting and quenching enhanced crystal texturing and led to stronger orientation order in the C8BTBT films.  The melting and quenching process is believed to be vital in obviating the processing history and in controlling the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization.\n  The effect of a gate insulator on the performance of FETs is also investigated using a novel, photopatternable, high-k fluoropolymer, poly(vinylidene fluoride-bromotrifluoroethylene) P(VDF-BTFE), where the BTFE moieties enable cross-linking through thermal- or photo-curing of dielectric materials with relative permittivities between 8 and 11. Organic single crystal field effect transistors based on rubrene active layers and crosslinked P(VDF-BTFE) gate dielectrics have shown hole mobilities as high as 12 cm2V-1s-1, three times higher than the average hole mobilities for devices comprising PVDF-based fluoropolymers or SiO2 as the dielectric layer. FETs comprising cross-linked P(VDF-BTFE) dielectric layers show the smallest interfacial trap density among all other fluorinated PVDF-based polymers, leading us to  believe that cross-linking P(VDF-BTFE) films reduces energetic disorder at the dielectric-semiconductor interface. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results suggest that crosslinking enhances the population of trans conformations with respect to the neat polymer, demonstrating that cross-linking minimizes interfacial charge traps and hence enhances hole mobility by tuning chain conformations.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11811], "author_name_tesi": "Adhikari, Jwala Mani", "last_name_ssi": "Adhikari", "middle_name_ssi": "Mani", "first_name_ssi": "Jwala", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Enrique Daniel Gomez", "Enrique Daniel Gomez", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Michael John Janik", "Qing Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Enrique Daniel Gomez, Dissertation Advisor", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Committee Chair", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Qing Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["organic semiconductors", "organic single crystals", "thin film disorder", "polymer gate dielectric", "rubrene", "C8BTBT"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Effects of primordial non-Gaussianity in the CMB and the large-scale structure", "id": "j9602060k", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12305", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We study the imprints and effects of non-Gaussian primordial perturbations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. \n\nPrimordial non-Gaussianity, if detected, has the potential to discriminate between different classes of inflationary models. For example, inflationary models with just a single degree of freedom can be ruled out if long wavelength modes are found to be correlated with shorter wavelength modes.\n\nThe effects of primordial non-Gaussianity can be seen in the CMB and the LSS---the two important observational probes of the primordial statistics and therefore the early universe. This thesis consists of studies in both of these observational probes. First, in the CMB front, we study the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity on the statistical anisotropy of the CMB temperature fluctuations. This is motivated by recent CMB results that indicate such statistical anisotropies at large CMB scales. We show that the probability of such observations increase in the case that primordial fluctuations are non-Gaussian. For this, we derive and use a general framework to describe statistical anisotropies in the power spectrum in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity. We expect the formalism to be of use beyond the specific application that we have done. \n\nSecond, in the large-scale structure front, we study the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity generated from two fields on the mass function of massive cluster of galaxies, scale-dependent halo bias, and large-scale stochasticity. We derive physically motivated analytic expressions for these observables and calibrate the derived expressions on dedicated N-body simulation results. Thus, the final outputs of the investigation are simulation calibrated semi-analytic formulas that can be used to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity beyond the simple single-field local-type that has been mostly studied up until this point.

In this thesis, we give an ant-based algorithm for finding communities in complex networks. We employ artificial ants to traverse the network based on a set of rules in order to discover a ``good set'' of edges that are likely to connect nodes within a community. Using these edges we construct the communities after which local optimization methods are used to further improve the solution quality. Experimental results on a total of 136 problem instances that include various synthetic and real world complex networks show that the algorithm is very competitive against current state-of-the-art techniques for community detection.

Yet, the reasons as to why some children are more susceptible to overeating are poorly understood. Deficits in decision-making abilities, such as how the brain responds to rewards in regions implicated in reward processing and inhibitory control, have been linked to obesity in children. This suggests that fundamental differences in decision-making abilities may be a risk factor for overeating, and potentially, a target for prevention. However, it is currently unknown if deficits in key decision-making regions relate to objectively measured food intake. This dissertation adds to the literature by investigating how brain determinants of decision making for food and money relate to food intake and weight status in a cohort of children 7-11-years-old. Neural correlates of decision-making were assessed by having children undergo a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan while completing a modified card-guessing task that assessed anticipating and winning food and monetary rewards. Behavioral correlates of decision-making were assessed with a Go/Nogo (reactive inhibitory control) task with and without food and monetary reward incentives. Objectively measured food intake was assessed using three different laboratory test meals aimed at measuring different aspects of eating behavior.  Results from all three papers identified potential decision-making mechanisms that were associated with obesity risk development. For the first time, we showed that how the brain responds to rewards might play a crucial role in identifying behaviors that can lead to future weight gain. Brain response to food vs. money rewards in regions associated with emotion, reward processing, and inhibitory control predicted food-approach behaviors and laboratory measures of overeating independently of how much a child weighed. In addition, weight status negatively correlated with reactive inhibitory control performance during a reward incentivized Go/Nogo task. Reactive inhibitory control was not related to food intake under controlled settings, however, since weight status was related to reactive inhibitory control this might provide insight into how these decision-making processes relate to overeating outside of the laboratory. Altogether, findings from this dissertation identified some of the neural mechanisms contributing to maladaptive eating behavior. This dissertation provides the groundwork for understanding how cognitive mechanisms contribute to eating behavior in children, providing insight into why some children are more susceptible to overeating than others. Understanding how reward processing and inhibitory control relates to food intake in children may be the key to increased success of intervention and prevention programs.
