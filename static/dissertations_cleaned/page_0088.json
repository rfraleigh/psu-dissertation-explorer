I show how nature and culture function as a problematic dualism that Merleau-Ponty is unable to collapse until his third course on Nature given at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. I demonstrate that throughout Merleau-Ponty\u2019s works, the human-animal relation serves to both trouble, yet reiterate this distinction. It is only when Merleau-Ponty begins to understand culture as institution, and to theorize the expressivity inherent in nature via institution, that he finds the means of positing the animal and the human, and later, the natural and the cultural, within a new model of difference that does not suggest an ontological divide between them. This model is what Merleau-Ponty calls the \u201cflesh.\u201d Second, I show how understanding the evolution of these concepts provides us with new ways to use Merleau-Ponty to theorize sexual difference and a multiplicity of gendered identities. I argue that situating nature and culture in the flesh allows us to advance beyond Luce Irigaray\u2019s critique that the flesh does not provide for genuine difference. Following the model of the human-animal Ineinander, I offer a new reading of the flesh as an origin that resists any one gendered signification. Understanding the concept of the flesh in its historical place and the significance of the nature/culture divide in its development within Merleau-Ponty\u2019s corpus opens up new possibilities for feminist appropriations of this ontology. This project thus serves to contribute another dimension to the small, but growing literature that seeks to employ Merleau-Pontyan philosophy in order to account for sexual difference beyond the binary.

Secondary flames known as \u201cpilot flames\u201d are a common passive control strategy for eliminating combustion instabilities in industrial gas turbines, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for the pilot flame\u2019s stabilizing effect are not well understood. This dissertation presents an experimental study of a pilot flame in a single-nozzle, swirl-stabilized, variable length atmospheric combustion test facility and the effect of the pilot on combustion instabilities. \nA variable length combustor tuned the acoustics of the system to excite instabilities over a range of operating conditions without a pilot flame. The inlet velocity was varied from 25 \u2013 50 m/s and the equivalence ratio was varied from 0.525 \u2013 0.65. This range of operating conditions was determined by the operating range of the combustion test facility. Stability at each operating condition and combustor length was characterized by measurements of pressure oscillations in the combustor. The effect of the pilot flame on the magnitude and frequency of combustor stability was then investigated. \nThe mechanisms responsible for the pilot flame effect were studied using chemiluminescence flame images of both stable and unstable flames. Stable flame structure was investigated using stable flame images of CH* chemiluminescence emission. The effect of the pilot on stable flame metrics such as flame length, flame angle, and flame width was investigated. In addition, a new flame metric, flame base distance, was defined to characterize the effect of the pilot flame on stable flame anchoring of the flame base to the centerbody. The effect of the pilot flame on flame base anchoring was investigated because the improved stability with a pilot flame is usually attributed to improved flame anchoring through the recirculation of hot products from the pilot to the main flame base.\nChemiluminescence images of unstable flames were used to identify several instability mechanisms and infer how these mechanisms are affected by the pilot flame. Flame images of cases in which the pilot flame did not eliminate the instability were investigated to understand why the pilot flame is not effective in certain cases. The phase of unstable pilot flame oscillations was investigated to determine how the phase of pilot flame oscillations may affect its ability to interfere with instability mechanisms in the main flame. \nA forced flame response study was conducted to determine the effect of inlet velocity oscillation amplitude on the pilot flame. The flame response was characterized by measurements of velocity oscillations in the injector and chemiluminescence intensity oscillations determined from flame images. As the forcing amplitude increases, the pilot flame\u2019s effect on the flame transfer function magnitude becomes weaker. Flame images show that as the forcing amplitude increases, the pilot flame oscillations increase, leading to an ineffective pilot. The results of the flame response portion of this study highlight the effect of instability amplitude on the ability of a pilot flame to eliminate a combustion instability. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11475], "author_name_tesi": "O'meara, Bridget C", "last_name_ssi": "O'meara", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Bridget", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Jacqueline Antonia O'connor", "Richard A Yetter", "Michael Matthew Micci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca, Dissertation Advisor", "Domenic Adam Santavicca, Committee Chair", "Domenic Adam Santavicca, Committee Member", "Jacqueline Antonia O'connor, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Michael Matthew Micci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Combustion", "combustion dynamics", "pilot flame", "technically pre-mixed", "self-excited instabilities"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Biological control of Ailanthus altissima: Transmission, formulation, and risk assessment of Verticillium nonalfalfae\n", "id": "22413", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10144", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima), first introduced to the United States into Philadelphia in 1784, is a very aggressive and invasive weed in both forest and urban environments, especially within the Mid-Atlantic region. In 2002 to 2003, in south-central Pennsylvania, Verticillium nonalfalfae, a soilborne, vascular wilt pathogen, was found naturally killing thousands of Ailanthus trees. To date, V. nonalfalfae has been isolated from dying Ailanthus in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio. Verticillium nonalfalfae causes typical Verticillium wilt symptoms on Ailanthus, including wilt, yellow vascular discoloration, defoliation, and mortality. The fungus naturally spreads rapidly through Ailanthus stands from diseased to healthy Ailanthus trees. Due to its efficacy and relatively small host range, V. nonalfalfae isolate VnAa140 has been proposed as a biological control for the invasive Ailanthus in Pennsylvania. In this thesis there were two main objectives. The first objective was to determine if intraspecific root grafts and clonal root systems in Ailanthus stands play roles in rapid local V. nonalfalfae transmission. The phenomenon of root grafting has been reported in >100 tree species and can aid in the transmission of pathogens from diseased to healthy trees, for example, those causing oak wilt and Dutch elm disease. Ailanthus altissima has not been reported to form root grafts, nor has it been reported that Verticillium spp. can be transmitted by root grafts in trees. Understanding the transmission of this potential biological control is important for optimized deployment and assessing risk. Also, investigating root grafting in Ailanthus altissima will allow for greater understanding of its invasion strategy and biology. The second objective of this thesis was to develop a simple formulation and delivery system for V. nonalfalfae isolate VnAa140 and explore the use of natural V. nonalfalfae inoculum sources, while further investigating this potential biocontrol agent\u2019s safety. The level of control achieved by V. nonalfalfae surpasses herbicide treatments currently in use; however it is not formulated for anticipated expanded use by land managers. The development of an optimized formulation and delivery system for V. nonalfalfae will allow for more effective and efficient control of Ailanthus than conventional herbicide control treatments. In addition, developing simple inoculation methods utilizing natural inoculum sources will allow land managers to use V. nonalfalfae without complete dependence on laboratory-prepared inoculum. Lastly, the non-target plant species composition and health was reassessed within the Verticillium wilt epicenter where V. nonalfalfae isolate VnAa140 was originally isolated. In this area of Tuscarora State Forest, V. nonalfalfae has persisted and killed mature canopy Ailanthus trees for over a decade. This assessment will help to further investigate this biological control agent\u2019s risk, efficacy, and host-adaptedness to Ailanthus.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9835], "author_name_tesi": "O'neal, Eric Scott", "last_name_ssi": "O'neal", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Durwood Davis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Durwood Davis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tree-of-heaven", "Ailanthus", "root grafts", "Verticillium wilt", "Verticillium nonalfalfae", "biological control", "formulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DISTRIBUTED ENERGY-BALANCED ROUTING IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS", "id": "8520", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1183", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are large-scale, dynamic, and limited in power.

To achieve this objective, a routing algorithm for WSNs should consider the following requirements. First, it should pursue energy-efficiency in order to prolong the lifetime of sensor networks. Second, the algorithm should have a distributed decision-making scheme which is applicable for large-scale networks. Third, it needs to be robust for dynamics in network topology and event generation patterns. To satisfy the requirements, the research conducted observes that energy balance induces maximum lifetime and robustness of WSNs. This thesis investigates decentralized routing algorithms to attain energy balance of sensor networks and, consequently, realize sensor networks with maximum lifetime and robustness to network dynamics.

Tasks that would be simple in a calm environment become a unique challenge when wind gusts begin changing the behavior of the rotorcraft.  The requirements of constantly correcting the attitude of the aircraft can increase the pilot workload to unacceptable levels.  Recently research has been focused on using automated control designs to compensate for wind disturbances, relieving some of the workload from the pilot.  Control designs using swashplate actuation have run into trade-off issues between stability margin constraints and disturbance rejection considerations.  The topic of this thesis is the modeling and design of an alternative control mechanism, on-blade control devices called trailing edge flaps, to improve handling qualities and disturbance rejection capabilities over those of the swashplate.  \nA primary objective of this thesis is to establish an accurate model of the aerodynamic effects and dynamics of trailing edge flaps.  A study of the dynamics of the rotor shows that a flap on the UH-60 would behave as a moment flap, working to twist the blade to change the distributed lift as opposed to creating only a local lift increment.  The Genhel-PSU model is modified with a torsion degree of freedom to accurately model the effects of a flap on a UH-60 helicopter.  \nTo verify the accuracy of this implementation, the Genhel-PSU model is configured for the SH-2G Helicopter, since significant flight data and identified model is available for this aircraft.  The identified model from previous research is compared with a linear model produced by the converted Genhel-PSU model.  Significant differences are noticed in roll-flap and pitch-flap modes causing changes in the frequency responses.  Model structure analysis reveals that the rotor time constant is significantly different from the value in the identified model.  The identified value was substituted into the linear model, which corrected the discrepancies.  Flap damping was added to the non-linear model, and the resulting linear model had a much closer frequency response match, as well the rotor time constant value matched the identified model much more closely.  The rotor Lock number was varied in an attempt increase the predicted flap damping.  A significant decrease in flapping inertia (~40%) created a model with a rotor time constant that matched the identified model, however the response for the modified model did not match the identified model.  The cause of this discrepancy could not be identified.\nActuation methods are an important consideration when using on-blade trailing edge flaps.  Piezo-electric tube actuators are experimental designs that are both extremely fast, compact, and can be made to achieve the desired deflection.  These actuators are still experimental and are just being used as a theoretical design.  A model of a Piezo-electric actuator implementation for trailing edge flaps is developed.  This model is then simplified and converted to work with the Genhel-PSU linear model.  \nDifferent control architectures that make use of on-blade trailing edge flaps are explored to see if any advantage can be gained by utilizing them.  Control designs are built in the control design software CONDUIT\u00ae, combining the proven performance benchmark ADOCS control architecture with a trailing edge flap compensator.  Initial optimization attempts are unsuccessful, and upon analysis, the trailing edge flaps are found to be too similar to swashplate inputs to provide any advantages for direct gust rejection.  Alternative control designs are attempted and it is shown that the flaps are effective when combined with rotor state feedback, achieving a 14% increase in the maximum disturbance rejection bandwidth, and may provide an advantage for implementation.  A control design to reduce the cross-coupling effects achieves an incremental improvement in cross-coupling specifications, however the small improvements suggest the same advantages could be achieved using the swashplate.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1822], "author_name_tesi": "ONeill, Eric Paul", "last_name_ssi": "ONeill", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Francis Horn", "Joseph Francis Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Francis Horn, Thesis Advisor", "Joseph Francis Horn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["SH-2G", "UH-60", "Trailing Edge Flaps", "Handling Qualities"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Intercollegiate Football and Educational Radio: Three Case Studies of the Commercialization of Sports Broadcasting in the 1920s and 1930s\n\n", "id": "11141", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3651", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "From the late 1920s to the mid-1930s, broadcasting of intercollegiate sports at many state institutions migrated from educational radio stations to commercial networks. Amid the economic pressures of the Great Depression, the sale of sports broadcasting rights provided universities with a steady revenue stream, while the publicity from the broadcasts raised their profile among citizens and legislators whose support was crucial to state institutions. Yet, commercialization bolstered critics\u2019 claims that intercollegiate athletics had become a business rather than an extracurricular activity. Drawing upon the scholarship of critical political economy, this dissertation examined the process by which commercial radio became the venue for big-time intercollegiate athletics\u2014even at institutions that had their own radio stations\u2014at a time when reformers insisted that only an amateur status and educational purpose for sports could justify the presence of big-time athletics on campus. In case studies of three land-grant institutions\u2014Penn State, Ohio State, and the University of Wisconsin\u2014this dissertation found that the decision to sell broadcast privileges was resisted by directors of educational radio stations on campus, supported by athletic and conference directors, and largely ignored by administrative pragmatists who were distracted by the daunting task of keeping their institutions solvent throughout the Depression. This study concluded that the decline of educational radio as a purveyor of college sports mirrored the overall decline of non-commercial broadcasting in the 1930s. It also reflected the wider debate on the role of the state as the representative of the collective interest in a free enterprise system. The partnership between big-time football schools and commercial broadcasters, forged in the Depression Era, created the climate of collaboration in which television broadcasting of intercollegiate athletics would flourish in subsequent decades. Ohio State and Wisconsin were exceptions in that they continued to carry intercollegiate sports on their own university stations. In doing so, each demonstrated the feasibility of an economic model for sports broadcasting that was grounded in the public service outreach and extension missions of the land-grant institution rather than the competitive, profit-seeking model of commercial radio. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3631], "author_name_tesi": "OToole, Kathleen Mary", "last_name_ssi": "OToole", "middle_name_ssi": "Mary", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Spicer Nichols", "John Spicer Nichols", "Matthew Paul Mcallister", "Patrick Robert Parsons", "Stephen F Ross", "Ronald Austin Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Spicer Nichols, Dissertation Advisor", "John Spicer Nichols, Committee Chair", "Matthew Paul Mcallister, Committee Member", "Patrick Robert Parsons, Committee Member", "Stephen F Ross, Committee Member", "Ronald Austin Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["intercollegiate athletics history", "educational radio history", "John L.

Nonvolatile memories are attractive due to the ability to hold information without requiring an external field; i.e., a back-up battery. One of the critical features of nonvolatile memory devices is typically destructive reading, requiring the ferroelectric to endure large number of electrical cycles during operation. However, decrease of switching charge due to repeated polarization reversal, known as fatigue, is a common problem in bulk and thin film ferroelectrics. Fundamental studies of ferroelectric materials are essential in understanding the origin of fatigue mechanisms. There have been a number of advances to overcome fatigue in ferroelectric films, such as the utilization of oxide electrodes, or using layered type ferroelectrics that exhibit fatigue-free behavior. There still exist certain issues which need to be solved when employing these strategies. \n   In this study, fatigue anisotropy was discovered in rhombohedral Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3\u2013PbTiO3 (PZN-PT) single crystals. When the electric field is applied along [001]C or [110]C orientations, single crystals do not fatigue, while normal fatigue occurs along [111]C orientations. Further studies focused on the study of the origin of fatigue anisotropy in PZN-PT and other ferroelectric systems. Experiments consistently showed that if a ferroelectric to ferroelectric phase transition occurs (i.e, rhombohedral--->tetragonal) through composition, temperature, and field strength, fatigue reappears in otherwise \u201cfatigue-free\u201d orientations.  These results indicated that the fatigue rates depend on both the ferroelectric phase and crystallographic orientation. Fatigue anisotropy was investigated also in several other ferroelectric systems including both relaxor based and normal ferroelectrics. Normal ferroelectric BaTiO3 and its solid solutions with BaZrO3 did not exhibit fatigue anisotropy in the rhombohedral phase in [001]C orientations. From these studies it seems a combination of engineered domain states (orientation) and relaxor nature is required for fatigue free orientations.\n   Given the relaxor ferroelectric nature of PZN-PT single crystals, the field and frequency dependence of switching and relaxation of sub-coercive field dc field excited polarization were studied as a function of fatigue history. A power law fit gives less field and frequency dependence for [001]C. The behavior remains constant throughout cycling. However, strong field and frequency dependence was noted in [111]C as a function of fatigue. Polarization relaxation data was analyzed by a stretched exponential function. Fitting parameters indicate a broader time constant distribution for relaxation along [001]C, meaning more diverse contribution to the switching process. These parameters also remained constant with cycling along [001]C. On the other hand, a narrower time constant distribution with a higher stretched exponent was determined along [111]C direction. With fatigue evolution, changes occur along [111]C. These observations are consistent with the progressive loss of the slower elements from the switched polarization signal, demonstrated in conventional P-E loops.\n   Finally, optical microscopy was performed in PZN-4.5PT single crystals along [001]C and [111]C orientations as a function of fatigue (cycling) history. With fatigue evolution, domains became more fractal (discontinuous) along [111]C, whereas the presence of finer domains with a wide size range was noted along [001]C. If these observations can be confirmed by a high magnification microscopy, the microscopic domain pictures are consistent with the macroscopic electrical characterization findings. This would suggest that the presence of domain structure at a very fine scale in [001]C rhombohedral crystals may make it extremely difficult to effectively pin the polarization out on cycling. The result is considerable fatigue resistance.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4496], "author_name_tesi": "OZGUL, METIN ", "last_name_ssi": "OZGUL", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "METIN", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clive A Randall", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Leslie Eric Cross", "Darrell G Schlom", "Venkatraman Gopalan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clive A Randall, Committee Chair", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Chair", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member", "Darrell G Schlom, Committee Member", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FERROELECTRIC", "PIEZOELECTRIC", "POLARIZATION", "SWITCHING", "DOMAIN WALLS", "NONVOLATILE RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES", "POLARIZATION FATIGUE", "ELECTRICAL FATIGUE", "BIPOLAR DRIVE", "SINGLE CRYSTAL", "RELAXOR", "STRAIN", "POLARIZATION RELAXATION", "FATIGUE ANISOTROPY", "CURRENT"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Towards understanding the impact of ocean acidification on the shell condition of thecosome pteropods", "id": "14155rlo130", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14155", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Anthropogenic activities are altering the composition of the atmosphere at unprecedented rates. Carbon dioxide levels reached 400 ppm for the first time since the Pliocene in 2016, and are predicted to be as high as 1000 ppm by the end of the century. These increases alter global temperatures and precipitation patterns, but also impact ocean chemistry, in a process known as ocean acidification. \n\nPteropods are a group of planktonic molluscs at high risk from ocean acidification. They form their shells from aragonite, the more soluble form of calcium carbonate, and reach high abundances in polar and sub-polar latitudes where the effects of ocean acidification are predicted to be the most pronounced. Pteropods play a key role in the marine food chain and carbon cycle, especially at high latitudes, and therefore it is essential that we understand how they will be impacted by ocean acidification. \n\nPteropods are visibly affected by dissolution changing from glassy and transparent when pristine to white and opaque when dissolved. Shell condition has traditionally been assessed qualitatively using light and scanning electron microscopy. Here I develop a quantitative method to assess shell condition using micro-CT scanning (Chapter 1). This technique is applied to assess the inter- and intra-specific variation in pteropod shell properties from five locations. Although the greatest variability in shell thickness occurs between pteropods of different species, within one species, Limacina retroversa, differences in thickness vary with local seawater density, likely a biological response to control buoyancy. This new method is also applied in Chapters 2 and 3, but further work needs to be conducted to expand the number of specimens, locations, and species scanned to establish a robust baseline to which future changes can be compared.\n\nUnderstanding how pteropods will be affected by ocean acidification is inherently difficult as these organisms are very difficult to culture. Incubation experiments are therefore used to test how pteropods respond to predicted future conditions over short periods of time. I analysed the shell condition of pteropods with damaged periostraca incubated under a range of pCO2 settings (Chapter 2). I found that the aragonitic shell only undergoes dissolution when both the periostracum is damaged, and the shell is exposed to undersaturated seawater. This suggests pteropods are more resilient to ocean acidification than previously predicted. \n\nThe dissolution of pteropod shells in the water column is thought to be controlled by seawater chemistry. However, sediment trap studies have found that there is a significant dissolution occurring above the saturation horizon where water is supersaturated with respect to aragonite. I test the effect of the decomposition of the pteropod body on the condition of the pteropod shell using decay and incubation experiments (Chapter 3). I find that internal shell dissolution, linked to the decomposition of the organic soft tissue, is greater than external dissolution associated with the chemistry of the surrounding seawater. This suggests that there is likely more carbonate dissolution above the lysocline than previously thought, and has implications for the interpretation pteropod shells from sediment traps and the fossil record. \nPteropods collected at sea are preserved, and brought back to the lab to study. I test how six different methods of preservation alter pteropod shell condition over a period of 15 months between sample collection and analysis (Chapter 4). I find that most preservation techniques cause some alteration, with the least amount of change occurring when samples are air dried, or preserved in buffered ethanol; the greatest amount of alteration is observed when samples are preserved in formalin. This study enables preservation-related bias to be evaluated in studies of modern and historical pteropod records, therefore opening up a wider range of records for accurate interpretation. \n\nIn summary, this dissertation has worked to develop the methods needed to assess the response of pteropods to past, and predicted future changes in ocean chemistry. By combining a range of techniques focused at different scale, we can build a more holistic understanding of how and why pteropods are impacted by ocean acidification.

The North Canterbury fold and thrust belt provides a location where actively growing basement-involved fault-propagation folds can be studied, where uplifted marine terraces provide critical information on fold growth rates, and where the results of kinematic models can inform understanding of deformation in a seismically active and tectonically complex region. We begin by developing methods to fit trishear kinematic models to data and to estimate model uncertainty using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We then use amino acid racemization, infrared stimulated luminescence, and radiocarbon dating to provide new age dates for marine terraces uplifted by folding and faulting in North Canterbury, where ages were poorly known before. Using the new ages, we calculate uplift rates for the marine terraces, which reveal significant temporal and spatial variations. We use two anticlines along the North Canterbury coast as examples to show that marine terraces can be used to constrain fault-propagation fold kinematic models, both by serving as originally horizontal surfaces to be restored and by facilitating comparison of uplift rates at different structural positions. These approaches allow us to distinguish between trishear and kink-band kinematic models and to constrain the values of trishear parameters, eliminating models that are consistent with the geologic evidence but not the terrace uplift. By incorporating terrace uplift into MCMC simulations, we are also able to provide estimates of fault slip rate and age of folding. Ages are consistent with previous estimates, while fault slip rates are likely somewhat higher than previously thought.  Finally, we test models for fault-propagation folding in North Canterbury that incorporate listric faults, we consider the implications of recent earthquake sequences and of the reactivation of inherited normal faults for understanding fault geometry at depth, and we construct a regional cross section to estimate shortening across the North Canterbury fold and thrust belt. We find that models of rigid basement block rotation on listric faults, although often used to explain basement-involved folding, are not consistent with the style of faulting and folding seen in North Canterbury. Instead, we develop a model combining trishear with simple shear on steep listric faults, which serves to explain the regional characteristics of faulting and folding in North Canterbury. We also compare this model to the simpler fault geometries tested previously and consider the possibility that not all faults in North Canterbury fit the same model. Depth to detachment is poorly constrained by our kinematic models, but a mid-crustal detachment as proposed by previous authors is consistent with our results. Total shortening estimated from our regional cross section is consistent with the low end of estimates from the geodetic shortening rate across the fold belt and the expected age at which folding began.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13856], "author_name_tesi": "Oakley, David Owen Smith", "last_name_ssi": "Oakley", "middle_name_ssi": "Owen Smith", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Fisher", "Donald Fisher", "Kevin Furlong", "Roman DiBiase", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Fisher, Dissertation Advisor", "Donald Fisher, Committee Chair", "Kevin Furlong, Committee Member", "Roman DiBiase, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fault-propagation folding", "trishear", "marine terraces", "North Canterbury", "New Zealand"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "SUSTAINED EMOTIONAL PROCESSING IN INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC WORRY SYMPTOMS", "id": "7176", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1436", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous findings indicate that worriers avoid particularly upsetting thoughts by worrying and that they have difficulties understanding their own emotions and those of others.

Worriers also report that they express negative emotion readily even though they fear both depressive and anxious experiences.  The present study used a variety of emotional stimuli including personally generated relevant materials, normative stimuli from published lists of emotional material, both images and words, and four emotional categories of stimuli (positive, negative, neutral, and threat) to thoroughly examine emotional processing in chronic worriers.

Pupil diameter was assessed as a measure of processing load/arousal.  Worriers had larger anticipatory pupil diameters before emotional information was presented to them but had smaller pupils for personally relevant negative information and smaller sustained diameters following emotional material compared to non-worriers.

Conversely, those that have championed greater public involvement in the political process have argued that the public\u2019s voice is an essential check on elitist, technocratic government bodies whose closed-door perspectives are a threat to societal justice. In light of the rising popularity of more inclusionary models of democracy that seemingly echo the sentiments of the latter, this study questions the extent of public involvement in the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s 2006-2008 review of its media ownership rules. The sequence of events highlighted by an assessment of the FCC\u2019s public hearing and online comment submission processes, quantitative content analyses of the public\u2019s comments, and a review of the FCC\u2019s Report and Order revealed that the Commission repeatedly subordinated the public\u2019s voice to the views of experts and stakeholders. An additional analysis of two interviews conducted with grassroots organizers also revealed that the FCC\u2019s lackluster public mobilization techniques were supplemented by the efforts of various grassroots organizations.

The art museum has changed shape.  Its bricks have been flattened on paper, celluloid and plastic and diffused into virtual spaces.  The relationship between flesh and environment has been irrevocably changed as people no longer have to attend the built structure of the art museum to know the art museum.  It recurs infinitely in our daily lives \u2013 on television, movie and computer screens, in books and magazines, and on urban artifacts from matchbook covers to billboards.  These representations may not be real art museums per se but they provide the basis upon which most people now partake of the museum\u2019s sacred rituals.  \nI confront the dilemma of defining the cultural and material parameters of the art museum by analyzing it in terms of four frames.  A frame is characterized here as something that imposes a fixed border.  I use the frame metaphor in multiple ways to deconstruct the museum\u2019s closed system and to set the stage for its reconstruction.  \nTwo of the frames are structured by academic discourses: an art historical frame and the frame created by New Museology.  These frames have been dominant in determining how we perceive of art museums.  The third frame, however, marginalizes the academic voice and shifts the focus to the art museum as cultural artifact in the wider realms of popular culture.  Through this frame, I explore how the art museum has been represented in five Hollywood movies: She-Devil, Batman, Born Yesterday, L.A. Story and Absolute Power.  Significantly, in these films the art museum becomes a site of sexual encounter and violence.  The fourth frame is not so much a content-based frame but a process of renegotiation between the frames. \nThe four frames are then rescripted in pedagogical terms inciting art educators to start a new sense-making venture with new tools and objects.  The challenge is to embrace a diversity of perspectives rather than to circumscribe our experience of the art museum within strictly controlled frames.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5996], "author_name_tesi": "Oberhardt, Suzanne ", "last_name_ssi": "Oberhardt", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suzanne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joe L Kincheloe", "Majorie Wilson", "Paul E Bolin", "Charles Richard Garoian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joe L Kincheloe, Committee Member", "Majorie Wilson, Committee Member", "Paul E Bolin, Committee Member", "Charles Richard Garoian, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["art museum", "popular culture"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The effect of cloud shading on squall lines: a numerical simulation study\n\n", "id": "11930", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "173", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Frame and Markowski (2010) have demonstrated the feasibility of using the tilted independent pixel approximation (TIPA) to account for three-dimensionality of cloud shading effects in idealized numerical simulations of supercells in which radiative transfer effects were included (in addition to surface fluxes, which couple the surface temperature forcing to an atmospheric response).

A more complex challenge arises when the threat needs to be detected in a densely populated urban setting with heavy traffic and limited access. Commercial equipment has been designed and made available to local, state, and special law enforcement agencies to aid in the detection and identification of nuclear material; however, due to the diversity of these systems and complexity of the task, an analysis of the capabilities and limitations of such systems is required. \nThis thesis presents an analysis of the most popular mobile commercial equipment for detection, surveillance and identification of special nuclear material and radiological sources and focuses on the their application to crowded urban settings with limited access (e.g., New Year\u2019s Eve in Times Square in New York City). The systems that were analyzed include vehicular search systems, backpack detection systems and handheld systems (e.g., inorganic scintillators and semiconductor detectors). This analysis is completed through a comparison of the feasibility of deployment and a study of the applications of commercial systems in real-time environment conditions. These conditions include the intentional concealment of radioactive sources inside a building at an undisclosed location along a given route. Preliminary results include the significant limitation faced by vehicular systems due to the lack of complete access and entrance into specific sites and buildings of interest. This requires the support of a backpack system to overcome access limitations and help pinpoint the location and source of interest. Backpack systems are limited by the resolution, identification algorithms and radioisotope libraries which require a more capable detector. Handheld systems are able to provide a solution with their different types of detectors from the most versatile to the highest resolution possible. \nThe results of the analysis performed consist of the successful detection and pinpointing of sources of interest by all the commercial detectors used in the real-time assessment. Overall the combination of the three stage systems presented acceptable data using the proper reference neutron and gamma radiation and evaluation distances throughout the real-time environment conditions. Furthermore, the results confirm the necessity for all the commercial mobile systems to work together and be deployed systematically in order to locate and identify the potential threat as efficiently as possible. High-purity germanium detectors offer the best resolution and detection confidence due to their complete spectroscopy system. However, inorganic scintillator detectors are still the primary tool for detection and deployment in the field due to their size and weight.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10797], "author_name_tesi": "Ocampo Giraldo, Luis Alfonso", "last_name_ssi": "Ocampo Giraldo", "middle_name_ssi": "Alfonso", "first_name_ssi": "Luis", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nuclear security", "special nuclear material detection", "radiological sources detection"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION OF A METHOD FOR POSITION RESOLUTION IN CdZnTe DETECTORS", "id": "15072lio5000", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15072", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) is one of the most developed wide band gap semiconductor materials being used for making radiation detectors due to its high density and atomic number, excellent spectral resolution, physical stability and room-temperature operation. However, the availability of large-volume CZT detectors for many applications is limited due to the low production yield and high cost of CZT crystals. Crystal defects, which are present even in the highest quality CZT material available today, are the major problem causing response non-uniformity across the detector. To address this challenge, high-resolution position-sensitive (high granularity) detectors have been proposed to correct response non-uniformities by virtually or physically subdividing the detectors area into small voxels and equalizing the responses measured. There are several detector designs that practically implement this approach.\nThis dissertation work focuses on the enhancement of position resolution for two types of CZT detectors, pixelated and virtual Frisch-grid (VFG) using time correlated digital signals. This is done through the development and testing of algorithms for processing digitized charge signals resulting in the creation of the time-correlated samples technique. This technique is evaluated using pixelated detectors and a focused laser beam developed to measure the position interactions of single charge and charge sharing events. This novel approach resulted in a position resolution of 200 \u00b5m for an estimated equivalent gamma energy of 260 keV and < 50 \u00b5m at an estimated gamma energy of 2 MeV with a contribution of the electronic noise (FWHM) of 4-5 keV. Further analysis regarding commercially available pixel sizes (0.8 mm to 2.85 mm) was conducted with the pulsed laser system and concluded that a smaller pixel size yields a higher position resolution.\nThe design, fabrication, characterization and testing of the several VFG array prototypes is detailed along with various results that illustrate the optimization of position and energy resolution using time-correlated data.  The first arrays were able to achieve an energy resolution of ~0.9% FWHM at 662 keV, using 137Cs, after corrections. These corrections are performed using a correction matrix, which was discovered to be independent of temperature. These results demonstrated the feasibility of position-sensitive VFG CZT detectors and arrays of such detectors for high resolution gamma-ray spectroscopic measurements. At the same time, the 3-D correction technique ensures high spectral resolution of the arrays in a wide dynamic range: <2% (4 keV) at 200 keV and <1% (6.6 keV) at 662 keV at <25\u00b0C.\nTo further study the optimization of position resolution for VFG detector arrays using time-correlated digital signals, a linear array of six position-sensitive VFG detectors optimized for usage in compact handheld instruments was investigated. This evaluation was carried out using real environment conditions and concluded with a field test to measure uranium hexafluoride cylinders. After applying corrections, the energy resolution was found to be 1.9% (3.5 keV) FWHM at 186 keV. At a higher energy, the resolution can be as good as 0.8% (5.3 keV) at 662 keV. Ultimately, these resolution improvements can significantly enhance the performance of compact handheld instruments compared to the current commercially available standard CZT detector devices.\nThe optimization techniques discussed in this dissertation allow for using standard-grade materials to reduce the device cost without compromising their performance. This improvement of energy resolution significantly enhances the capabilities of the current CZT detectors. Furthermore, the implementation of the time-correlated samples technique coupled with 1-D and 3-D corrections to VFG arrays has the potential to create large detectors which can be deployed on the field under room temperature conditions. This is of particular benefit for safeguards purposes as well as national security among many others. The cost reduction of the devices will allow for the spread of this technology and further product development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16797], "author_name_tesi": "Ocampo Giraldo, Luis Alfonso", "last_name_ssi": "Ocampo Giraldo", "middle_name_ssi": "Alfonso", "first_name_ssi": "Luis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu", "Kenan Unlu", "Jack Brenizer", "Marek Flaska", "Julio Urbina", "Aleksey Bolotnikov"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenan Unlu, Committee Chair", "Jack Brenizer, Committee Member", "Marek Flaska, Committee Member", "Julio Urbina, Outside Member", "Aleksey Bolotnikov, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CdZnTe", "semiconductor detectors", "pixelated detectors", "virtual frisch-grid", "VFG detectors", "CZT", "cadmium zinc telluride"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Racial Disparities in Children's Use of Special Education and Mental Health Services\n", "id": "7718", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5857", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation uses event history and multivariate logistic regression analyses to examine the risk of children\u2019s use and level of placement in special education and mental health services in the US.  Three separate but thematically related studies are presented. The first study examines the dynamics of black and white children\u2019s use of special education services. The second study examines factors that explain racial/ethnic disparities in children\u2019s use of special education and mental health services. The third study examines factors that explain racial/ethnic disparities in restrictive placement of children in special education and mental health services. The data used in the three studies were collected as part of the Fast Track Project, a longitudinal study of children at risk for emotional and/or behavioral problems conducted in four locations: Durham, North Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; rural Pennsylvania; and Seattle, Washington.\n\tThe first study investigates whether the hazards of children\u2019s use of special education services vary by race/ethnicity, gender and location. The findings show that racial/ethnic, and gender differences characterize students\u2019 use of, and exit from special education services among the high-risk sample used in this investigation.  In addition, the shape of the hazards of students\u2019 entry and exit from services by race/ethnicity, gender and location is nonlinear, displaying periods of increasing or decreasing risk. The findings highlight the need to develop special education programs and service delivery systems that are cognizant of racial/ethnic and gender differences.  The findings also call for a more tailored special education system that takes into account the timing when children are most likely to need services.  \n\tThe second study has two objectives: 1) to evaluate the factors that explain children\u2019s use of special education and mental health services, and 2) to examine whether the factors that explain special education and mental health services use differ by race/ethnicity. Cox regression models are estimated to test the study hypotheses.  Results of race-only predictor models show statistically significant racial disparities in special education in two sites (Durham and Washington). Similarly, racial differences in mental health services use were found in Nashville and Pennsylvania.  Controlling for several predisposing, enabling and need covariates diminished the observed racial disparities in special education and mental health services use. A policy implication of these findings is that a one-size-fits-all social policy is not likely to achieve the federal government\u2019s goal of eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in children\u2019s use of social and health services in the US. Partial support was found for the hypothesis that predictors of children\u2019s use of special education and mental health services are different amongst the two racial groups analyzed. Variables that predict black children\u2019s use of both types of services are generally different from those of whites.  The two exceptions are teachers\u2019 report of children\u2019s behavioral problems and a measure of academic performance, which are the same for each group. \n\tThe objectives of the third study are also twofold: 1) to evaluate factors that predict children\u2019s placement in restrictive settings of special education and mental health services; and 2) to examine whether restrictive placement predictors in special education and mental health services differ by race/ethnicity. Multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to test the study\u2019s hypotheses.  Gender disparities in restrictive placement of children in both special education and mental health services persist after \u201cfully\u201d adjusting the models with predisposing, enabling and need factors.  Racial/ethnic disparity persists in the full model in the context of restrictive special education placement but is statistically insignificant in the context of inpatient mental health service placement.  This suggests that other variables not fully captured in the present study underlie the observed differences in black and white children\u2019s level of placement in special education.\t \nIn sum, racial/ethnic disparities are found in children\u2019s use of special education and mental health services and in restrictiveness of placement.

Adventitious roots play an important role in phosphorus acquisition, as they are localized near the soil surface where phosphorus is relatively abundant. A population of recombinant inbred lines of Phaseolus vulgaris (G2333/G19839) was screened under high and low phosphorus conditions in the greenhouse and field. We observed phenotypic variation and transgressive segregation for adventitious root traits in both environments. Allometric analysis revealed that although the taproot and basal roots are closely linked to shoot growth, RILs differ substantially in biomass allocation for adventitious roots. A linkage map with 149 genetic markers and a total cumulative map length of 1175 cM was used to identify a total of 19 QTL across 8 of the 11 linkage groups. Together these QTL accounted for 19 to 61% of the total phenotypic variation for adventitious root traits in the field and 18 to 39% under greenhouse conditions. Two major QTL for adventitious rooting under low phosphorus conditions in the field were observed on linkage groups B2 and B9 that together accounted for 61% of the observed phenotypic variation. We conclude that adventitious rooting under low phosphorus is a feasible target for bean breeding.\n\nAdventitious rooting in common bean is a genetically regulated process that may vary depending on the genotype and environmental signals such as soil phosphorus availability. Plant hormones are frequently involved in the transduction of those environmental signals into growth and development responses. The two hormones most likely to be involved in adventitious root development are auxin and ethylene. We conducted a series of experiments to elucidate the role of these two hormones in the regulation of adventitious rooting in common bean. Two bean landraces (G2333 and G19839) contrasting for adventitious root formation were evaluated under nutrient solution conditions in the greenhouse. Both genotypes formed adventitious roots on submerged hypocotyls with no plastic response to phosphorus availability. Exogenous applications of &#61537;-NAA increased adventitious rooting in both genotypes, but G2333, which developed more adventitious roots even in the absence of auxin, was also more responsive to added auxin than G19839. Exogenous ethylene (1 \u00b5L L-1) did not change the response to exogenous auxin or phosphorus availability. However, when ethylene action was blocked by AVG, auxin-induced adventitious rooting formation was significantly reduced, suggesting that endogenous ethylene is required for adventitious root development, particularly under phosphorus stress. The increases in adventitious root formation in response to exogenous applications of NAA was accompanied by a compensatory decrease in basal root biomass and, to a lesser extent, shoot biomass, indicating that exogenous auxin changes biomass allocation in favor of adventitious roots.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2418], "author_name_tesi": "Ochoa, Ivan Erick", "last_name_ssi": "Ochoa", "middle_name_ssi": "Erick", "first_name_ssi": "Ivan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "Richard Craig", "David Robert Huff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Chair", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Member", "Richard Craig, Committee Member", "David Robert Huff, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adventitious rooting", "mapping", "QTL analysis", "auxin", "ethylene", "root respiration", "phosphorus acquisition", "carbon budget"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Topics in the Standard Model of Particle Physics Extension and Fourth-Order Gravity\n\n", "id": "12250", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2982", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis I present two possible signatures of quantum gravitational phenomenology. The first part of this thesis relates to a Lorentz symmetry violating extension of the standard model of particle physics. Here I show that a Chern-Simons type extension of the quantum electrodynamic (QED) sector of the standard model (SM) leads to the generation of circular polarization for photons. The polarization of scattered photons are analyzed using quantum field theoretic techniques and through the application of a generalized Boltzmann transport equation. In addition to the previously studied optical activity or birefringence effects induced by the particular interaction studied here, the Lorentz invariance violating interaction in question also leads to the generation of circular polarization. The possibility for observation of the effects in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is discussed, although the circular polarization effects are shown to be at a level which is always sub-dominate to the birefringence effects. \n\nThe second part of this thesis relates to a fourth-order modification to the general theory of relativity (GR) which has appeared as quantum corrections in the effective spectral action of noncommutative geometry (NCG). A term which is proportional to the square of the Weyl curvature is added to the Einstein-Hilbert action of GR and the the gravitational wave solutions of this modified theory are derived.

Over the past several decades, there have been several advancements in the field of equine nutrition. However, one area of equine nutrition that is still lacking research is the recommended dietary level and characteristics of dietary fiber, including physically effective fiber (peNDF), and its effects on the health of the horse. The role of peNDF has been well studied in dairy nutrition, and cows fed diets with greater proportions of small to large particle size have been shown to develop laminitis and ruminal acidosis. The limited research that has been published on the role of particle size on the health of the horse shows that diets containing greater proportions of small to large particle size can negatively affect the health of the horse in a similar fashion. The epithelial layer of the gastrointestinal tract has the difficult task of both selectively absorbing nutrients that are essential to the horse while at the same time preventing the absorption of luminal pathogens that could result in disease. When the integrity of the intestinal epithelium is compromised, the intercellular tight junctions become leaky, allowing for normally excluded luminal antigens to permeate the intestinal barrier and induce a systemic inflammatory response. This trial evaluated the effect of diets of varying dietary particle size and dietary starch content on systemic inflammation. It was hypothesized that a diet with a greater proportion of small to large particle size and greater starch content would result in an increase of systemic markers of inflammation. Eight light breed type Quarter Horse geldings (528 \u00b1 54 kg BW) ranging from 3-15 yr were used in a Latin Square design. Dietary treatments were fed at 2% BW and included a hay only (HA), 40% hay and 55% whole oats (HO), 40% hay and 55% pellets (HP), and 40% hay, 27.5% whole oats, and 27.5% pellets (HOP). The pellets were formulated to have similar nutrient makeup to whole oats. To meet nutrient requirements, the HO, HP, and HOP diets had a balancer pellet added at 5%. Differences in dietary particle size are clarified by the % feed particles < 1.18 mm in the HA, HO, HOP, and HP diets (1, 5, 33, and 60 %; respectively). Treatments were divided into four 14 d periods, each preceded by a 14 d washout of hay only. Following treatment period 4, horses were subjected to an additional 14 d washout followed by a 7 d feed deprivation ulcer induction and a 3 wk ulcer recovery period. Jugular blood samples were obtained on days 4, 7, and 12 of every 14 d treatment or washout period, and daily for the 7 d ulcer induction. Plasma samples were analyzed for fibrinogen and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), whole blood samples were used for a complete blood count with differentials, and serum samples were analyzed for TNF\u03b1 and IL-6. Data were analyzed using mixed ANOVA with repeated measures and differences were defined at p<0.05 and an unpaired, t-test with unequal variances was used to compare ulcer induction to values from each dietary treatment. The concentration of IL-6 was significantly lower for the HP diet in comparison to all other treatments. The ulcer induction had greater TNF\u03b1 concentrations than washout 5, suggesting that there was some degree of inflammation occurring during the ulcer induction. These results suggest that the diets fed in this study did not elicit an inflammatory response, or that the local, low grade, chronic inflammatory response that was hypothesized to occur was not severe enough to cause a change in the selected markers of inflammation. The overall results of this trial indicate that further research is needed in order to understand inflammatory response to diets of varying particle size and starch content to determine which hematological variables are most appropriate for characterizing this response.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14173], "author_name_tesi": "Ochonski, Patricia ", "last_name_ssi": "Ochonski", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Patricia", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["W.

A decrease in circulating adiponectin levels, as occurs in obesity in humans, has been associated with the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and tumor development.  The main objectives of the current studies are: (1) To characterize the expression of adiponectin and its receptors in the chicken ovary and testis and (2) To explore their potential role in chicken ovarian tumorigenesis.  RT-PCR analyses of RNA isolated from chicken follicular granulosa cells (GC) revealed the presence of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA, while adiponectin mRNA was not detected; however, all three transcripts were found in homogenates of whole ovary.  Using immunohistochemistry adiponectin-immunoreactive (ir) cells were localized to follicular theca cells (TC) but not the GC, while both AdipoR1-ir and AdipoR2-ir cells were present in TC and GC.  Treatment of sexually immature chicken hens with progesterone (P4) decreased ovarian adiponectin mRNA concentration, while estradiol (E2) or P4/E2 treatment increased adiponectin mRNA expression.  Estradiol treatment increased ovarian AdipoR1 mRNA quantity, while AdipoR2 mRNA quantity was not affected by any treatment.  Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed T-cadherin, a putative receptor for high molecular weight adiponectin, and AdipoR1 mRNA were down-regulated in chicken ovarian tumors, while neither ovarian adiponectin nor T-cadherin protein quantities were altered by the presence of ovarian tumors, according to Western blot analysis.  Using qPCR, testicular AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA abundance were 8.3- and 9-fold higher in adult chickens compared to prepubertal chickens, respectively.  Adiponectin-ir and AdipoR1-ir cells were detected in testicular peritubular and Leydig cells, while AdipoR2-ir cells were localized in the seminiferous tubule adluminal and luminal compartments and interstitial cells.  In particular, Sertoli cell syncytia, round and elongating spermatids, spermatozoa and Leydig cells exhibited strong AdipoR2-immunoreactivity.  Collectively, these findings demonstrate that adiponectin and its receptors are present and regulated in cell-specific manner and maybe involved in chicken reproduction.  Future studies should focus on altering adiponectin signaling for improving reproductive efficiency in chickens as well as gaining a better understanding of the role adiponectin and its receptors have in reproductive functions. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4793], "author_name_tesi": "Ocon-Grove, Olga M.", "last_name_ssi": "Ocon-Grove", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Olga", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ramesh Ramachandran", "Ramesh Ramachandran", "Daniel R Hagen", "Gary Joseph Killian", "Troy Ott", "Robert Glenn Elkin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ramesh Ramachandran, Dissertation Advisor", "Ramesh Ramachandran, Committee Chair", "Daniel R Hagen, Committee Member", "Gary Joseph Killian, Committee Member", "Troy Ott, Committee Member", "Robert Glenn Elkin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ovary", "Adiponectin", "Testis"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Automated Certification of Android Applications\n", "id": "10668", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1606", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Smart phone applications are often incompletely vetted, poorly isolated,\n and installed by users without restraint.

Security decisions are delegated to the end user, who often has insufficient information to make informed choices. In particular, users have no visibility over inter-application communication, which forces them to blindly trust the applications they use not to misbehave.\nIn this work, we review our first steps in analyzing Inter-Component Communication (ICC) in mobile applications. Our method consists in first converting applications to a well-known representation to enable subsequent analysis. The result of that effort is a retargeting tool called Dare that can perform this conversion with very high accuracy and performance. The second part of our work consists in a formal model of ICC. We reduce the study of ICC to an instance of an Interprocedural Distributive Environment problem. After doing so, we are able to find a solution to the ICC problem using well-studied algorithms. We subsequently revise this ICC model by generalizing the inference of ICC specifications to a novel type of constant propagation for complex objects. Such constant propagation problems are specified using a propagation language. Using this approach, we are able to model all of ICC in the Android platform.

Moving from a single-objective problem formulation to one with multi-objective trade-offs dramatically expands the decision space, and highlights the need for compromise solutions to address stakeholder preferences.

Male undergraduate students were classified as adaptive perfectionists, maladaptive perfections, and nonperfectionists based on cut off scores suggested by Rice and Ashby (2007). In addition, self-disclosure in close same-sex male friendships was examined as a mediator variable in the relationship between relational interdependent self-construal and restrictive emotionality. Two hundred and thirty one  undergraduate male students from a large public university ( Mean Age = 20.2 years; SD = 2.70 years) with close friends responded to the following instruments: Demographic Information Questionnaire, the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised  (APS-R; Slaney, Mobley, Trippi, Ashby, & Johnson, 1996), the Self- Disclosure Index Scale (SDI; Miller, Berg,  Archer, 1983), the Gender Role Conflict Scale-I ( GRCS-I, O\u2019Neil, Helms, Gable, David, & Wrightsman, 1986) , and the Relational Interdependent Self-Construal Scale (RISC; Cross, Bacon, & Morris, 2000). These instruments were available via a secure web-based file supported by an online research service. The sample included 67 adaptive perfectionists, 65 maladaptive perfectionists, and 99 nonperfectionists. On the SDI, adaptive perfectionists scored significantly higher than maladaptive perfectionists and nonperfectionists who were not significantly different from each other. On the Success, Power, and Competition subscale of the GRCS-I, adaptive perfectionists and maladaptive perfectionists scored significantly higher than nonperfectionists, but their scores did not differ from each other. On the Restrictive Emotionality and Conflict Between Work and Family Relations subscales of the GRCS-I, maladaptive perfectionists scored significantly higher than adaptive perfectionists and nonperfectionists who did not differ from each other. On the Restrictive Affectionate Behavior Between Men of the GRCS-I and the Relational Interdependent Self-Construal Scales, no significant difference was found between adaptive perfectionists, maladaptive perfectionists, and nonperfectionists. In addition, self-disclosure was a partial mediator in the relationship between RISC and RE.

However, these models have two major drawbacks.  First, the BPMs, mostly are in a non-machine-readable format, which makes them inaccessible to machine learning and intelligent queries.  Secondly, semantic heterogeneity, by which we mean the inconsistency in vocabulary and other language usage across organizational personnel, leads to inconsistency in interpretation of models.  Past approaches to eliminate semantic heterogeneity include the enforcement an official \u201cstandardized\u201d vocabulary and even defining entire modeling languages, but history has shown enterprise-wide vocabulary enforcement is expensive at best and often infeasible.  \u2018Semantic Business Process Modeling\u2019 (SBPM) purports to resolve semantic heterogeneity without relying on language standardization, by instead relying on users\u2019 a priori knowledge of the business processes to support  correct, consistent interpretation of models.  This strong assumption imposes severe limitations on the applicability of these models.    \nThis thesis demonstrates any business process can be modeled using a thesaurus that is machine-readable to support software applications and mitigates semantic heterogeneity by explicitly mapping it.\nWith this approach, we posit that specialized technical skills will not be needed to interpret the process model, allowing organizations to implement the models minimal user training. The interactive query capability provided by the thesaurus structure, and supported by numerous commercial software packages for thesaurus maintenance and creation, eliminates or reduces the need for any assumptions on a priori user knowledge. The Thesaurus Business Process Model (TBPM) we propose in this work is compliant with the ISO 9001(Quality Management Systems) standard, which is used as a benchmark in most organizations in improving the management of information flow. Thesauri have been written about in context of linguistic and database design search engines, where semantic heterogeneity is a natural phenomenon, but never in the process modeling literature, which also requires mitigation of semantic heterogeneity.  \nTo validate the claims, this thesis includes TBPM of the United States Marine Corps\u2019 (USMC) human resource development process (HRDP).  The USMC HRDP model is interactive to improve collaboration among specialized sub units. In addition, it also provides necessary information to fully integrate the HRDP management with agencies external to the management process.

This means that the counties in turn have placed the responsibility of waste management in the hands of the municipalities. \nSolid waste management is, therefore, an essential part of managing environmental pollution problems.  If not properly handled, solid waste can be a nuisance to our environment and may cause health issues.  Waste collection is one of the first steps of a solid waste management system, and its proper planning and implementation can serve as a foundation for a sound waste management system (Pitchel, 2005).  \nSolid waste management is one of the services provided by the City of Harrisburg to its residents, in addition to water and wastewater services.  The City of Harrisburg collects residential and some commercial municipal solid waste (MSW) and recyclables.  Annual average tons of MSW generated in the City over a five-year period (2002-06) is approximately 31,500 tons for residential wastes and an estimated 20,000 tons for commercial wastes.  Factors that affect MSW generation in the City include, but are not limited to, an increase/decrease in population, increase/decrease in businesses, the number and scope of special events (i.e. Farm Show events, Department of Parks and Recreation events, etc.), and the extent of recycling.\nThis paper examines the role of communities and the effectiveness of waste collection in the City of Harrisburg and ways to improve waste collection in the South Allison Hill (SAH) neighborhood of the City.  Observation of this section of the City reveals perpetual trash littering on most of the streets and uncollected bulky items.  Concerns over the aesthetic, environmental, and health-related issues caused by this situation have been raised by residents in the neighborhood, but little or nothing has been done to improve the situation.  In a survey carried out by the Community Action Commission (CAC) of SAH in the fall of 2007, the leading concern expressed by residents, apart from crime or other safety issues, is the problem of trash littering in the neighborhood.  This project will seek to discover the cause of this problem and possible ways to curb and improve the situation in this section of the City.  For the purpose of this study, a five-year trend (2002-06) will be analyzed.\nWaste collection in the Shipoke Section of the City is also examined and a comparative study of how waste is handled in the Shipoke and the SAH neighborhoods of the City is also addressed.  The findings and recommendations from this study are also aimed at providing guidance to neighborhoods experiencing similar problems in other parts of the state and the country in general. \n Public participation in decision making through the use of deliberative processes is now widely promoted as the means of enhancing institutional legitimacy, citizen influence and social responsibility, and learning.\nTo effectively evaluate the problem associated with this study, data collected by the Shipoke Neighborhood Association (SNA) and CAC/Elm Street Program were analyzed.  Data was also provided by the Neighborhood Plan Coordinator/Elm Street Manager of the CAC and by the Deputy Director of Public Works in the City.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1745], "author_name_tesi": "Odubo, E.

During and immediately following the creation of a fracture, high injection pressures cause fracturing fluid to leak off into the adjacent matrix. Such an occurrence can have ramifications which counter the function of a fracture. This work focuses on the effect of leak off in low permeability sandstones while quantifying subsequent impact on gas flow. In particular, the effects of leakoff volume and the length of the shut-in period following fracturing activities are investigated. Gas flow hindrance is then explored in terms of permeability changes. \nSandstone outcrops were obtained and cored to 1.5-inch diameter and 7-inch length cylindrical samples. Leak off was simulated by injecting distilled water into one face of a sample designated as the \u2018fracture face.\u2019 Leakoff volumes were categorized into high and low leakoff while shut-in times ranged between 24 hours and 312 hours. A series of base and regained permeability tests were conducted prior to and after the simulation of a leak off to monitor any improvements. X-ray computed tomography (CT) was used to visualize the speed and extent of the imbibing front at various time intervals. Saturation profiles were developed from the resulting images.\nGas flow hindrance caused by the leak off of water-based fracturing fluid is mitigated by shut-in time in that it favors spontaneous redistribution of the fluid deeper into the formation. Experimentally, it was observed that an increase in leakoff volume reduces effective permeability to gas while an increase in shut-in time increases effective permeability to gas. Regained permeability results suggest that the dominant of these competing forces is the leakoff volume. A greater leak off is more damaging than a reduced shut-in time. This imbalance highlights the key determining factor behind gas flow hindrance due to fracturing fluid leak off \u2013 fluid saturation in the neighborhood of the fracture. The saturation in question is a direct result of the fluid left behind following spontaneous imbibition of fracturing fluid during the well's shut-in period, and subsequent flowback procedures. Saturation in this context is a function of shut-in time and leakoff volume. A decrease in saturation within the invaded zone is generally favorable as it increases effective permeability to gas. Furthermore, lower formation permeability slows improvements to gas flow due to lower mobility of the invading fluid despite expected higher capillarity.\nIt was found that the properties of the formation play a significant role in determining regained permeability. An increased shut-in period is typically advantageous but it does not always favor regained permeability in formations with depressed relative permeability curves. In these types of formations, shut-in time also allows spreading of the invading fluid which improves effective permeability to gas in the invaded region. However, the improvement in permeability is attenuated due to the depressed nature of the formation\u2019s relative permeability curve. As the invaded zone expands with time, the improvement in permeability within it becomes inconsequential when compared to the extent of invasion. Hence, there is a point after which further imbibition becomes detrimental.\nLeakoff volume and shut-in time are variables that work differently to dictate saturation distribution in the neighborhood of the fracture. Saturation within the invaded zone and characteristics of the formation\u2019s relative permeability curve may be the key determinants of gas flow hindrance following hydraulic fracturing activities. Conditions of saturation distribution and petrophysical properties vary between formations. This may explain the lack of correlation between volume of flowback water and gas production in the field.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8454], "author_name_tesi": "Odumabo, Sijuola M", "last_name_ssi": "Odumabo", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Sijuola", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn", "Luis F Ayala H", "Yilin Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn, Thesis Advisor", "Luis F Ayala H, Thesis Advisor", "Yilin Wang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydraulic fracturing", "low permeability formation", "saturation", "leak off"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Performance of History and Memory in 17th-century Spanish Theater, Then and Now", "id": "21247", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "9803", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines early modern Spanish history plays, the ways in which they dramatize the past, and the resulting dialogue with history, memory, and theater. Specifically, this project focuses on dramatic representations of Charles V, Isabel the Catholic Queen, and Spain\u2019s military victories in the Netherlands to argue that historical drama enhances historiographical thought during the early modern period and that productions of one history play in particular, Fuente Ovejuna, continue to have a profound social, political, and aesthetic effect in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The playwrights whose work I analyze, Lope de Vega, Tirso de Molina, Mira de Amescua, V\u00e9lez de Guevara, and Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, were among the most popular and commercially successful writers during the early seventeenth century. Generally, the comedia has been classified by historians and literary scholars either as an extension of monarchical self-promotion, supportive of its policies and engaged in buttressing early modern Spain\u2019s rigid social hierarchies, or as a space for debate, adopting a more critical view of the crown and society. Accordingly, plays that fit within these rubrics have been privileged by scholars, yet these polarizing viewpoints often obscure the rich discursive texture of historical drama. Rather than viewing these history plays as engaged in a struggle for defining power structures, I suggest that they both support and criticize, encouraging their audiences to remember past greatness and also compelling them to reflect on the nature of historical representation. To that end, I investigate how these plays perform history and how they reflect on and contribute to historiographical thought. By supplementing chronicles and popular, collective recollections of the past with dramatic conventions like fictional characters, stage effects, and stage properties, the plays examined here transcend their sources to produce a broader, more enhanced vision of history. In the representations of Charles V and Isabel the Catholic Queen, I find that the plays demythify and humanize the royal figures and royal historiography, providing an enhanced view of history, its actors, and its possibilities. In my chapter on plays that dramatize Spanish military victories in the Netherlands, I argue that the plays make history, effectively construing the events dramatized as conditioned by and part of Spain\u2019s larger historical narrative. In my final chapter, I analyze the ways in which two early twentieth-century performances of Fuente Ovejuna function as sites of memory that have a profound importance in the changing historiographical, political, cultural, and aesthetic landscapes of the turbulent years surrounding the Spanish Civil War. In the end, I have found that these plays praise the king and country during the seventeenth century and serve as useful propagandistic tools in the early twentieth century, but they also offer different views of the past and of its representations through the lens of drama that can both create and debate history. Finally, my focus on the performance of history and memory will help bring us a step closer to articulating a vision of Spanish historical drama that transcends the two poles of propaganda or criticism and emphasizes the ways in which the history play enhances recollections of the past and reflects on the nature of historical representation.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9548], "author_name_tesi": "Oechler, Christopher Carl", "last_name_ssi": "Oechler", "middle_name_ssi": "Carl", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Robert Blue", "William Robert Blue", "Matthew J Marr", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt", "Guadalupe Mart\u00ed Pe\u00f1a", "Garrett Sullivan Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Robert Blue, Dissertation Advisor", "William Robert Blue, Committee Chair", "Matthew J Marr, Committee Member", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt, Committee Member", "Guadalupe Mart\u00ed Pe\u00f1a, Committee Member", "Garrett Sullivan Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["history play", "early modern Spain", "Lope de Vega", "Fuente Ovejuna", "Tirso", "V\u00e9lez", "Mira", "Calder\u00f3n", "performance of history"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "ENGAGEMENT WITH NEWS CONTENT IN ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS", "id": "12094", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "431", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reports indicate that as the Internet is displacing traditional news sources, younger users continue to be disconnected from the news. Fortunately, the Internet provides new ways of sharing and discussing news stories with others through social networking sites such as Facebook, which may be important for engaging users in the news they read online. This paper explores the potential benefits of sharing news content, and seeing shared news content, on a social networking site, in terms of engagement in that news content. It was predicted that sharing a news story on Facebook would cause participants to feel more involved in the story. Receiving comments and recommendations on these posts should also enhance their sense of influence. It was also predicted that those who post comments and leave recommendations and even those who are exposed to others\u2019 comments and recommendations on the story would feel more involved in the story and more informed by it as a result of taking an active role. Finally, the specific level at which they broadcast the story on Facebook is explored for its effects on news story involvement, perceptions, and sense of influence.\n\nThis study used an experimental design to test the hypotheses. 333 participants, ranging in age 18-63 years and 67% female were in one of 13 news sharing conditions which varied in where they posted the story (news feed, friend\u2019s wall, or direct message), what comment they made (opinion, question, or no comment) and whether they tagged friends; three receiving conditions where they found a story on Facebook and read it, commented on it, or indicated that they \u201cliked\u201d it; or the control condition where they read the story on the original news website. All participants filled out an online questionnaire immediately following the study and again one week later. \n\nResults show that while sharing the story on Facebook as a Messenger compared to only reading it on the news website did not significantly affect their initial involvement in the story, those who shared the story were significantly more involved in the story one week later. Those who asked a question about the news story when posting it felt a significantly higher sense of involvement in the story than those who posted the story with an opinion. Also, those who tagged friends felt a greater sense of community. Including a comment with the news story and tagging friends also led to a greater number of comments on the post from Facebook friends, which led to a greater sense of influence and greater sense of community. The number of \u201clikes\u201d received led to greater interest, involvement, and feeling informed about the topic. Broadcast level had many interactions with the other independent variables that highlighted the importance of posting on a friend\u2019s wall, asking a question, and tagging friends. Posting the story publicly also led to more positive psychological outcomes, by way of receiving comments that were perceived to be favorable. For those who found a news story posted by a friend on Facebook, commenting on the story did not have a significant effect on their involvement in the story, and seeing others\u2019 comments did not have a significant effect on involvement in the story.

Pretreatment is therefore required to decompose the sulfides and liberate gold before cyanidation, and to deactivate CM and prevent it from adsorbing gold during cyanidation. In this research, the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, has been used to effectively reduce the gold adsorption ability of CM on one hand, and decompose metal sulfides on the other, to ultimately enhance gold extraction. \n\nDifferent ranks of coal (lignite, subbituminous, bituminous and anthracite) were used as surrogates to investigate the capability of the fungus to reduce the gold adsorption ability of CM. The extent of biotransformation was assessed primarily by the difference in the ability of CM to adsorb gold before and after the treatment. It was realized that relative to the other coals, anthracite possessed about 10 fold gold adsorption power in the as-received state, and after biotransformation, reduction in gold adsorption was more pronounced in anthracite. P. chrysosporium reduced the ability of anthracite to adsorb gold cyanide complex by over 90% in different growth media including glucose, millet and wheat bran, and within a wide range of processing periods (up to 21 days), pulp densities (15-75 %), temperatures (25 oC and 37 oC), pH (4 and 6.5), and level of agitation (0 and 150 rpm). A processing time of 5-7 days in a mixture of millet and wheat bran (MWB) medium  at 37 oC and pH 4 constituted the best conditions for optimum biotransformation. The best pulp densities for stationary and shake culturing respectively were 60 % and 25 %. Using the non-cyanide gold complexes; thiourea and thiosulfate, biotransformation by P. chrysosporium in MWB medium led to reduction of 50-92 % in gold adsorption by the carbonaceous surrogates and carbon-containing gold concentrates.\n\nAnalysis of as-received and processed anthracite using Raman, FTIR and XANES spectroscopies indicated that fungal-treatment led to a reduction in carbon and a boost of oxygen-containing groups such as carboxyls and carbonyls. In addition, surface area and pore volume reduced by about 75 % and 80 % respectively, whereas average pore diameter increased by 65 %. The results suggest that P. chrysosporium biotransforms anthracite by surface oxidation, which leads to a decrease in C/O ratio and disruption of the continuous nature of graphitic planes, thus decreasing the active sites necessary for adsorption. Another factor is reduction in surface area via plugging of pores possibly by fungal hyphae and spores, and biofilms formed through fungal interaction with the substrate, and hence decreasing accessibility of gold to the adsorption sites. Fungal action also led to pore enlargement, thus rendering the pores relatively unsuitable for adsorption of aurocyanide ions, which are generally known to adsorb preferentially into micropores.\n\nP. chrysosporium, was also assessed for its ability to decompose sulfides in DRGO. Using surrogate pyrite and arsenopyrite, and sulfide-containing gold concentrate, biotransformation led to high concentrations of iron, sulfur and arsenic in incubation solutions, and reduction in sulfide sulfur in the residual solids. Overall, decomposition of sulfide sulfur in the samples was 15 wt%, 35 wt% and 57 wt% respectively for pyrite, arsenopyrite and the gold concentrate after 21 days of treatment. Changes in sulfide sulfur concentration and formation of oxide phases during fungal treatment were confirmed using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. Oxide phases formed included hematite and ferric arsenate. \n\nFungal treatment of flotation concentrate (FC) of DRGO and bacteria-oxidized FC (BFC) resulted in enhancement of cyanidation gold recovery. An increase of 38 % and 13 % for FC and BFC respectively over the as-received samples was realized. The single stage fungal treatment of FC recorded 78 % in gold recovery which compares very well with the 81 % obtained from the commercial biooxidation treatment of FC.  Preliminary investigations on the use of cell-free extracts from P. chrysosporium to effect biotransformation of sulfides and CM in DRGO led to 26 % increase in gold recovery during cyanidation over the as-received, after a 3-day bioprocessing period.\n\nThe results suggest that P. chrysosporium is a promising microorganism for oxidative decomposition of metal sulfides associated with refractory gold ores and for deactivation of CM.  In addition, it demonstrates an innovative and a potentially alternative pretreatment process for DRGO using either whole cells (in vivo) or cell-free extracts (in vitro) of P. chrysosporium to simultaneously biotransform sulfides and CM, and consequently enhance gold extraction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1999], "author_name_tesi": "Ofori-Sarpong, Grace ", "last_name_ssi": "Ofori-Sarpong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Grace", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kwadwo Osseo Asare", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare", "Yaw Yeboah", "Ming Tien", "Harold Harris Schobert", "Jennifer Macalady"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Dissertation Advisor", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Committee Chair", "Yaw Yeboah, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Chair", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Member", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mycohydrometallurgy", "Biotransformation", "sulfides", "carbonaceous matter", "double refractory gold ores", "Phanerochaete chrysosporium."]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Education Abroad and the Making of Global Citizens: Assessing Learning Outcomes of Course-Embedded, Faculty-Led International Programming", "id": "10524", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "51", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study builds on education abroad, global citizenship and academic development literatures by assessing the extent to which embedding brief international travel experiences into residentially-taught courses enhances academic development and promotes global citizenship.

Grounded in Transformative Learning Theory, the study addressed two primary research questions: 1.) to what extent does participation in embedded education abroad programming mediate changes in students\u2019 global citizenship, and thereby, social responsibility, global competence and global civic engagement; and, 2.) to what extent does participation in embedded education abroad programming enhance academic development, specifically with regard to academic self-concept and academic self-efficacy? A quasi-experimental study utilizing a nonequivalent control group design was employed to address these questions. Statistically reliable and valid scales were developed to measure academic development and global citizenship. The results show that the embedded and match courses varied with regard to their overall mean scores for global citizenship and academic development and in the pattern with which they change over time. Students in the embedded courses had significantly higher pre-test and post-test mean scores for both global citizenship and academic development. Both samples showed positive increases in global citizenship over time, but only the students in the match courses showed significant change. Neither sample showed overall positive change toward academic development, but students in the embedded courses did show increases in academic self-efficacy.\n\nAdditionally, the study scrutinized widely-held assumptions of the traditional education abroad student profile by more accurately accounting for previously underrepresented or unacknowledged populations. In particular, the study focused on the extent to which financial need, first-generation status, and heritage impact education abroad choice and in what ways these and others populations participate in education abroad programming. To do so, a comprehensive, four-year enrollment analysis of all degree-seeking Pennsylvania State University students who studied abroad in academic years 2005/06, 2006/07, 2007/08, and 2008/09 was conducted.  The findings show that education abroad program type does in fact appeal differently to particular student populations.

Our analysis includes all the possible gaugings\nof all N = 2 Maxwell-Einstein supergravity theories whose scalar manifolds are symmetric\nspaces. In general, the scalar potential gets contributions from R-symmetry gauging, tensor\ncouplings and hyper-couplings. We show that the coupling of a hypermultiplet into a theory\nwhose potential has a non-zero value at its critical point, and gauging a compact subgroup\nof the hyperscalar isometry group will only rescale the value of the potential at the critical\npoint by a positive factor, and therefore will not change the nature of an existing critical\npoint. However this is not the case for non-compact SO(1, 1) gaugings. An SO(1, 1) gauging\nof the hyper isometry will generally lead to de Sitter vacua, which is analogous to the ground\nstates found by simultaneously gauging SO(1, 1) symmetry of the real scalar manifold of\nthe five dimensional vector multiplets with U(1)R in earlier literature. SO(m, 1) gaugings\nwith m > 1, which give contributions to the scalar potential only in the Magical Jordan\nfamily theories, on the other hand, do not lead to de Sitter vacua. Anti-de Sitter vacua\nare generically obtained when the U(1)R symmetry is gauged. We also show that it is\npossible to embed certain generic Jordan family theories into the Magical Jordan family\nwhile preserving the nature of the ground states. However the Magical Jordan family\ntheories admit additional vacua which are not found in the generic Jordan family theories.\nThe five dimensional stable de Sitter ground states obtained by gauging SO(1, 1) symmetry\nof the real symmetric scalar manifold (in particular a generic Jordan family manifold of\nthe vector multiplets) simultaneously with a subgroup Rs of the R-symmetry group descend\nto four dimensional de Sitter ground states under certain conditions. First, the holomorphic\nsection has to be chosen carefully by using the symplectic freedom in four dimensions; and\nsecond, a group contraction supported by a rotation of the gauge group generators that\ncarries them into a particular basis is necessary to bring the potential into a desired form.\nUnder this construction, stable de Sitter vacua can be obtained in dimensionally reduced\ntheories (from 5D to 4D) if there is enough freedom to gauge a semi-direct product of\nSO(1, 1) with R(1,1) together with a simultaneous Rs. We review the stable de Sitter vacua in four dimensions found in earlier literature for N = 2 Yang-Mills Einstein supergravity\nwith SO(2, 1)\u00d7Rs gauge group in a symplectic basis that comes naturally after dimensional\nreduction.

A structural change from tetragonal to pseudocubic was observed at about x = 0.05 - 0.075 at room temperature.  The solubility was investigated through the systematic trends in the dielectric data, lattice parameter, and microstructure.\n\tDielectric measurements revealed a gradual change from normal ferroelectric behavior in pure BaTiO3 to a highly diffusive and dispersive relaxor behavior from 10 to 40 mol% BiScO3.  Several of the compositions showed high permittivities (approximately 1000) with low temperature coefficients of capacitance over a wide range of temperature.  This result confirmed the result from the earlier work in thin films that the broad, frequency-dependent-permittivity maximum is an intrinsic material property, neither a consequence of defects or stresses associated with the thin film preparation, nor a space charge contribution.  It was found that the temperature for the maximum dielectric constant, Tmax, increases with increasing BiScO3 concentration.  The Vogel-Fulcher model gave an activation energy of 0.2-0.3 eV for the relaxor behavior range, which was high compared with other relaxors.  The attempt frequency was on the order of 1013 Hz and the freezing temperature, Tf, ranged from -177 to -93 oC (96 to 160 K) as a function of composition.\n\tThe dielectric constant is high and stable from 0 \u0081E300 oC for the 0.7 BaTiO3 - 0.3 BiScO3 ceramics, making this composition attractive for high energy density capacitor applications.  A single dielectric layer capacitor was prepared to confirm the feasibility of BaTiO3 - BiScO3 as a capacitor material.  The 0.7 BaTiO3 - 0.3 BiScO3 capacitors exhibited an energy density of about 6.1 J/cm3 at a field of 73 kV/mm at room temperature, which is superior to some commercial X7R capacitors.  Moreover, this system may be very useful at high temperatures, as the permittivity of commercial BaTiO3 \u0081Ebased capacitors drops rapidly above the transition temperature (around 130 oC).  In this study, relatively high, temperature-stable energy density values were confirmed from room temperature to 300 oC.\n\tAnother application possibility is as a base composition for lead-free piezoelectrics.  Undoped BaTiO3 - BiScO3 ceramics are electrostrictors at room temperature over a wide composition range, but the highly polarizable material may be useful as a piezoelectric matrix if a normal ferroelectric phase could be developed.  Possible off-center ions, Li and Na were doped into the system in an attempt to stabilize a normal ferroelectric phase.  LiNbO3 could not achieve a solid solution.  For the case of Na, solid solution was confirmed up to 15 mol% NaNbO3, but there was no indication of the stabilization of a normal ferroelectric.  Instead, it was found that Tmax and Tf decrease with increasing NaNbO3 concentration.  This result suggests that NaNbO3 doping breaks up the polar ordering developed in the BaTiO3 - BiScO3 system.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2343], "author_name_tesi": "Ogihara, Hideki ", "last_name_ssi": "Ogihara", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hideki", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clive A Randall", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clive A Randall, Thesis Advisor", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["non-lead materials", "tolerance factor", "perovskite structure", "relaxors", "dielectrics", "ferroelectrics", "bismuth", "scandium", "barium titanate", "permittivity", "high energy density capacitor materials", "dielectric relaxation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Investigating the Relationships between Emotional Intelligence and Preservice Teachers' Views of Teacher Effectiveness", "id": "8781", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "813", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this study the researcher examined the relationship between emotional intelligence and teacher effectiveness beliefs of Elementary and Kindergarten Education preservice teachers.

The premise of this thesis is that the performance of multiuser wireless systems can be significantly improved by efficient resource allocation.\n \nThis thesis investigates scheduling and power allocation problems for several types of wireless communication systems each employing CDMA as the multiple access mechanism. Scheduling refers to the process of selecting the subset of users to transmit using the available resources. The resources considered are sectored antennas, orthogonal codes, and time slots. This thesis investigates three distinct scheduling paradigms. The first one is appropriate for real-time CDMA services with constant QoS requirement, whereas the last two are appropriate for delay tolerant CDMA services.  \n\nThis thesis first considers spatial scheduling and power allocation for a CDMA system employing directional antennas. Spatial scheduling, in this context, refers to scheduling users to sectors served by the directional antennas.  The joint optimization problem of cell sectorization, transmit power control, and receiver filter design is studied for both uplink and downlink. Specifically, we determine the  optimum sector beam width, such that the total transmit power is minimized, while each user satisfies the minimum signal to interference ratio (SIR) at receivers capable of employing linear multiuser detection.  Near optimum solutions with reduced complexity are also sought.\n\nThis thesis next investigates the multiuser scheduling and power allocation problem for interference limited multiuser systems. Scheduling, in this context, refers to scheduling a subset of users to allocate the downlink bandwidth so as to maximize the throughput. The aim is to characterize the optimum base station transmission strategy and to find the corresponding power allocation. We model the interference level by the aid of the orthogonality factor, and find the optimum policy for a range of the orthogonality factor values.\n\nLastly, this thesis considers the temporal scheduling and power allocation problem for delay constrained CDMA services, i.e., scheduling users to time slots. The motivation is to design an power-efficient transmission strategy, while each user satisfies the short term throughput fairness. We provide the optimum scheduling policy which minimizes the total transmit power.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1252], "author_name_tesi": "Oh, Changyoon ", "last_name_ssi": "Oh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Changyoon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aylin Yener", "John F Doherty", "John Metzner", "Thomas F Laporta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aylin Yener, Committee Chair", "John F Doherty, Committee Member", "John Metzner, Committee Member", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Power Allocation", "Scheduling", "Multiuser", "Resource Allocation", "Throughput", "CDMA"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Synthesis and Characterization of Ionomers as Polymer Electrolytes for Energy Conversion Devices", "id": "27401", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12010", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Single-ion conducting electrolytes present a unique alternative to traditional binary salt conductors used in lithium-ion batteries. Secondary lithium batteries are considered as one of the leading candidates to replace the combustible engines in automotive technology, however several roadblocks are present which prevent their widespread commercialization. Power density, energy density and safety properties must be improved in order to enable the current secondary lithium battery technology to compete with existing energy technologies. It has been shown theoretically that single-ion electrolytes can eliminate the salt concentration gradient and polarization loss in the cell that develops in a binary salt system, resulting in substantial improvements in materials utilization for high power and energy densities. While attempts to utilize single-ion conducting electrolytes in lithium-ion battery systems have been made, the low ionic conductivities prevented the successful operation of the battery cells in ambient conditions. This work focuses on designing single-ion conducting electrolytes with high ionic conductivities and electrochemical and mechanical stability which enables the stable charge-discharge performance of battery cells.\nPerfluorosulfonate ionomers are known to possess exceptionally high ionic conductivities due to the electron-withdrawing effect caused by the C-F bonds which stabilizes the negative charge of the anion, leading to a large number of free mobile cations. The effect of perfluorinated sulfonic acid side chains on transport properties of proton exchange membrane polymers was examinated via a comparison of three ionomers, having different side chain structures and a similar polymer backbone. The three different side chain structures were aryl-, pefluoro alkyl-, and alkyl-sulfonic acid groups, respectively. All ionomers were synthesized and characterized by 1H and 19F NMR. A novel ionomer synthesized with a pendant perfluorinated sulfonic acid group and a poly(ether ether ketone) backbone showed the highest proton conductivity and proton diffusion coefficient among the three ionomers, demonstrating the effect of the perfluorinated side chains. The proton conductivity of the novel ionomer was comparable to that of Nafion over a wide humidity range and temperature.\nA lithium perfluorosulfonate ionomer based on aromatic poly(arylene ether)s with pendant lithium perfluoroethyl sulfonates was prepared by ion exchange of the perlfuorosulfonic acid ionomer, and subsequently incoroporated into a lithium-ion battery cell as a single-ion conducting electrolyte. The microporous polymer film saturated with organic carbonates exhibited a nearly unity Li+ transfer number, high ionic conductivity (e.g. > 10-3 S m-1 at room temperature) over a wide range of temperatures, high electrochemical stability, and excellent mechanical properties. Excellent cyclability with almost identical charge and discharge capacities have been demonstrated at ambient temperature in the batteries assembled from the prepared single-ion conductors. The mechanical stability of the polymer film was attributed to the rigid polymer backbone which was largely unaffected by the presence of plasticizing organic solvents, while the porous channels with high concentration of the perfluorinated side chains resulted in high ionic conductivity. The expected high charge-rate performance was not achieved, however, due to the high interfacial impedance present between the polymer electrolyte and the electrodes. Several procedural modifications were employed in order to decrease the interfacial impedance of the battery cell.\nThe poly(arylene ether) based ionomer was saturated with an ionic liquid mixture, in order to explore the possibility of its application as a safe, inflammable electrolyte. A low-viscosity ionic liquid with high ionic conductivity, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate which has never been successfully utilized as an electrolyte for lithium-ion batteries was incorporated into a battery cell as a solvent mixture with propylene carbonate and lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide impregnated in a free-standing hybrid electrolyte film. Outstanding ionic conductivity was achieved and the lithium half cell comprising a LTO cathode and a lithium metal anode separated by the solid polymer electrolyte showed good cyclability at room temperature and even at 0oC. The presence of a sufficient amount of propylene carbonate, which resulted in flammability of the polymer electrolyte, was discovered to be critical in the electrochemical stability of the polymer electrolyte.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11443], "author_name_tesi": "Oh, Hyukkeun ", "last_name_ssi": "Oh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyukkeun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qing Wang", "Qing Wang", "James Patrick Runt", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Donghai Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qing Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qing Wang, Committee Chair", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fuel Cells", "Lithium Batteries", "Polymer Electrolytes", "Ionomers"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INSIGHT INTO POLIOVIRUS GENOME REPLICATION AND ENCAPSIDATION\nREVEALED FROM MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF 3B-3C\nCLEAVAGE SITE MUTANTS\n", "id": "10294", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2407", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The picornavirus family consists of nine genera.  Many members are important pathogens of human and other animals.  Efficient vaccines for many picornaviruses have not been developed.  Poliovirus (PV) is one of the extensively studied viruses in this family.  Although PV vaccine is available, it is clear that improvements are needed to increase efficiency and safety.  In addition, effective antiviral drugs for picornaviruses have not been developed.  Therefore, understanding the detailed mechanism of virus multiplication is critical to facilitate rational antiviral drug design and development of more efficient vaccines.  \nPV replication is primed by the 22 amino acid protein, VPg.  The PV RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase, 3Dpol, uridylylates VPg.  Recently, the VPg-containing precursor, 3BC, was reported as a more efficient primer in vitro than VPg.  However, it has not been determined if 3BC can be used for complete PV RNA synthesis. \nPoliovirus contains a single positive-strand RNA encoding all structural and non-structural proteins.  The entire polyprotein is translated and then processed by virally encoded proteases.  This processing is required to produce intermediates and fully-processed viral proteins.  Both intermediate and fully-processed proteins are required to facilitate virus reproduction.  However, studying functions of individual proteins in the context of the virus life cycle is difficult.  Mutagenesis of the cleavage site affects the kinetics of a site\u2019s processing, which results in altered accumulation of specific proteins.  Phenotypes induced by cleavage site mutations provide insight into functions of viral proteins. \nIn this thesis, two 3B-3C cleavage site mutants were used to understand functions of proteins in various steps in the PV life cycle.  In chapter 3, it is demonstrated that 3BC can be used as a primer for PV RNA synthesis in vivo.  This study was performed using the 3B-3C cleavage mutant (Gln-Gly to Gly-Gly: GG) to prevent processing.  GG PV replicates in cells.  The presence of 3BC-linked full length RNA was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Northern blotting.  This result allowed us to propose a more feasible mechanism for the transition of RNA initiation to elongation during PV replication.  \nThe GG mutant is lethal for virus production.  Attempting infectious GG PV production gave rise to another mutant virus, EG PV.  EG PV is also a 3B-3C cleavage site mutant, but it is viable.  In chapter 4, EG PV was characterized.  Replication and virus production of EG PV are slower than WT.  EG PV alters the kinetics of 3B-3C processing, resulting in a reduced amount of 3CD accumulation.  Ectopic expression of 3CD restores the kinetics of replication without improving the kinetics of virus production.  Based on this result, a 3CD-trans-complementable step in the PV life cycle is revealed.  \nA virus is a parasite.  Viruses have evolved to modify the cellular environment to optimize their reproduction.  PV induces vesicles for formation of its replication complexes.  Interaction networks between virus and host factors are critical for the vesicle formation.  Recently, it was shown that 3A and 3CD can induce relocalization of Arf1 to membranes.  In chapter 5, connections between PV replication and cellular modification are revealed.  3CD participation in PV-induced vesicle formation was demonstrated by comparing WT- and EG-PV induced vesicular phenotypes.  An Arf1 and 3CD connection to PV-induced vesicle formation was confirmed.  Based on these data, a model for 3CD involvement in PV-induced vesicle formation is proposed. \nOverall, this study provides evidence for a novel function for 3CD in polyprotein processing, RNA replication and encapsidation.  Previously proposed but unidentified steps in the PV life cycle are revealed.  The relationship between virus and host factors is reinforced.  Finally, data presented in this thesis will provide insight into detailed mechanisms of RNA replication and encapsidation in other picornaviruses as well.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2391], "author_name_tesi": "Oh, Hyung Suk  ", "last_name_ssi": "Oh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyung Suk ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Eugene Cameron", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "Kenneth Charles Keiler", "B Tracy Nixon", "Joseph C.

Capsicum oleoresin (CO), an ethanolic extract from the fruit of Capsicum plants, has been reported to modify rumen fermentation in ruminants. This is attributed to an antibacterial effect of capsaicinoids, the active compounds of Capsicum. In addition, capsaicinoids reportedly alter host responses in rats and humans. Studies have also shown that capsaicinoids had immunoregulatory effects, stimulate digestive enzymes, regulated appetite-related hormones, and alter blood metabolites. In a series of experiments, the effects of CO were investigated on the host responses as well as rumen fermentation in lactating dairy cows.\nThe objective of the first experiment was to investigate the effect of CO supplied postruminally on nutrient utilization, gut microbial ecology, immune response, and productivity of lactating dairy cows. Treatments were control (no CO) and daily doses of 2 g/cow of either CO for 9d. Milk yield was decreased by CO treatment compared with the control. The treatments did not affect nutrient utilization and gut microbial ecology. The relative proportion of lymphocytes was increased by the CO treatment compared with the control. The CO treatment increased the proportion of total CD4+ cells and total CD4+ cells that co-expressed the activation status signal CD25 in blood. Collectively, the CO used in the first trial appeared to have an immune-stimulatory effect by activating and inducing the expansion of CD4 cells in dairy cows. Although CO treatment decreased milk yield, this should be interpreted with caution because of the short duration of treatment. The objective of the second experiment was to investigate the effect of Capsicum oleoresin in granular form (CAP) on feed intake, immune responses, oxidative stress markers, rumen fermentation, and productivity of lactating dairy cows. Treatments included control (no CAP) and daily supplementation of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg CAP/cow. Dry matter intake was not affected by CAP, but milk yield tended to quadratically increase with CAP supplementation. The CAP treatments quadratically increased energy-corrected milk yield. The CAP treatment did not affect oxidative stress markers, rumen fermentation. Blood serum \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate was quadratically increased by CAP, whereas the concentration of nonesterified fatty acids was similar among treatments. Mean fluorescence intensity for phagocytic activity of neutrophils tended to be quadratically increased by CAP. Numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils and the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes in peripheral blood linearly increased with increasing CAP. Overall, in the conditions of the trial, energy-corrected milk yield was quadratically increased by CAP, possibly as a result of enhanced mobilization of body fat reserves with CAP supplementation. In addition, CAP increased neutrophil activity and immune cells related to acute phase immune response. The objective of the third experiment was to investigate the effects of rumen-protected Capsicum oleoresin (RPC) supplementation on feed intake, digestibility, milk production, and responses to an intravenous glucose challenge and an immune challenge in lactating dairy cows. Treatments were 0 (control), 100, and 200 mg RPC/cow/d. Dry matter intake and milk yield tended to quadratically increase with RPC. Feed efficiency linearly increased with RPC supplementation. Apparent total tract digestibility of DM, OM, and CP and fecal N proportions of N intake were linearly increased by RPC supplementation.

Traditionally, safety risk has been assessed at the corridor level, with corridors being evaluated in terms of accident rates, as in accidents per million vehicle miles.  This measure allowed safety planners and engineers to look for correlations at the aggregate level using economic and sociodemographic data from counties and cities.  As roadway geometric data became more widely available, both in terms of general access to public agencies and in terms of measurement detail, statistical models for safety were developed incorporating correlations between safety outcomes at the roadway segment level and roadway geometrics.  This approach avoids the problem of ecological correlation that is likely to occur in modeling using county or city level independent variables.  The problem of ecological correlation occurs when correlations between safety outcomes in corridors are evaluated using mean accident rates and county or city level means for independent variables.  This approach assumes corridor and regional means reflect segment means accurately, an assumption that is not tenable, especially when segmental heterogeneity is significant, as has been shown to be, in the safety context.  Heterogeneity refers to the deviations in patterns of accident occurrences at individual roadway segments, and how these deviations are referred to an \u201caverage site.\u201d  This average site can be a virtual site represented by the group mean.  Heterogeneity results in overdispersion of accidents, meaning that the variance of the accident distribution exceeds the mean.  This is due to the fact that the probability of accident occurrence is not uniformly distributed in space and time.  Therefore, one can expect accidents to cluster at various locations on the transportation network, such as at intersections, interchanges, lane drops or lane additions, horizontal or vertical curves, or at locations where decisions have to be made by drivers regarding lane changing, braking, speed reduction or acceleration, or route change.  \n\nGiven this background, the problem of evaluating safety interventions is compounded by the challenge of modeling the effect of heterogeneity simultaneously alongside the modeling of the marginal effect of an intervention.  There are two primary contributors to this challenge.  The first contributor is selection bias, which arises when locations for safety interventions are not randomly chosen.  The second contributor is the scale of measurement of this bias.  It may be that selection bias at aggregate scales (for example, in instances where corridor length treatments are applied) is influenced by heterogeneity in a different manner compared to bias at smaller scales (for example, spot interventions).  The impact of this variation is that the assessment of safety interventions can be varied depending on the scale at which the evaluation is conducted.  Hence, the methodological problem of simultaneously addressing heterogeneity and selection bias is the objective of this dissertation.  This dissertation attempts to provide some perspective to this problem via multiple scales, by proposing a joint model of heterogeneity and selection bias using a discrete-count approach, and using this framework to address the following research questions:\n\na) What is the impact of selection bias on safety intervention due to scale?  In other words, if safety interventions are applied at locations where accident patterns are severe and frequent, how does one account for the lack of intervention at less problematic locations?  And how does a statistical methodology derived for selection bias provide inference across scales, as segments are scaled up from very small lengths to lengths of the order of corridors?\n\nb) How does one represent insights into the policy implications of selection bias in a manner that integrates context (i.e., roadway location and characteristics) and scale? \n\nI use freeway roadway lighting as an example safety intervention to make these evaluations in this dissertation.  Roadway lighting is installed in order to improve traffic flow, thereby also contributing to improved roadway safety.  Roadway lighting is installed in various forms \u2013 as in median-side lighting, versus right-side lighting, versus tunnel lighting, versus ramp-mainline merge points, versus, installations on both sides of the traveled way.  This dissertation involved data collection on all 1,528 centerline miles of interstate freeway in Washington State and analyzed the correlation of accident frequencies with roadway lighting installation, after accounting for roadway geometrics and traffic flow levels.  It was determined that certain installations are more effective than others, when selection bias is taken into account.  For example, right-side lighting installation is found to be effective in reducing accident frequencies compared to other types of lighting installation, indicating a 30% reduction in accident frequencies compared to segments where there is no roadway lighting at the lighting segmentation scale.  Such a result appears to justify the installation of right-side lighting at critical locations such as ramp merge points or departure points.  The key phrase is \u201cappears to justify\u201d.  This dissertation explores the extent to which scale affects inferences such as the above.  With different scales of segmentation, such as interchange and non-interchange segments, one mile uniform length segments, or accident-cluster length segments, right-side installation has a smaller reduction of accident frequencies compared to accident reduction at the lighting segmentation scale.  In the case of accident-cluster level segmentation, right-side lighting installation is associated with an increase in accident frequency.  This example result demonstrates that the scale of data plays a very important role in safety inferences, especially when heterogeneity and selectivity bias are accounted for.\n\nWhile roadway lighting is used as an example for application of this dissertation\u2019s analytical framework, it is expected that the full-purpose self-contained computational framework for analyzing safety outcomes will be of substantial interest to the safety community at large.  One can use this framework for the analysis of any safety intervention at any scale.  The framework incorporates the typical geometric design decisions used in practice, and therefore, analysts can use this framework to address selectivity bias arising from roadway improvement projects involving all geometric types.  In particular, the framework developed in this dissertation can also aid decision makers to conduct scenario testing.  One example of scenario testing would be to examine the impact of energy-conservation efforts on traffic safety patterns on urban and rural freeways.  Another would be to explore the design contexts associated with high levels of unobserved heterogeneity, where the discussion on the measurement of factors that do not currently exist in highway databases can be motivated.  Example factors relating to heterogeneity could involve measures of segment-level kinematics such as speed, speed dispersion, and headway following distances.  Or, they could involve microclimatic measurements such as pavement temperatures, determination of icing likelihoods, wind gust speeds and sun angles.\nThis dissertation proposes a methodology to address a long-standing question in traffic safety relating to the evaluation of safety risk and the benefits associated with safety interventions.

On the one hand, responsive architecture is often regarded as an area of research and practice that incorporates computational power into buildings in order to modify environments to obtain better conditions for a particular human purpose. On the other hand, it is often deemed a performative art that evaporates the distinction between human and environment.\nThe study uses a cybernetic frame to emphasize the evolutional relation between subject and object in a system. If an action is generated by an actor, it triggers change in its environment. This change is then reflected to the original actor, which generates change in the internal logic of the original actor.\nWithin a cybernetic frame, current typologies of responsive architecture are analyzed into three categories: reactive, social, and conversational. Reactive refers to projects that aim to manipulate the environment for humans through an input and output mechanism. Conversational refers to projects that attempt to construct a \u201cshared environment\u201d between the human and environment through feedback.

Cellular migration is a well-coordinated process that requires altered cell shape and polarity. Recent studies showed that these processes involve small GTPases of the ADP-ribosylation Factor (ARF) family. In particular, ARF6 regulates endocytosis and recycling of junction proteins, as well as an actin cytoskeleton assembly during cell migration. A large number of GEFs, which likely regulate ARFs at different locations and during different processes, activate ARF6. However, not all of these GEFs\u2019 functions are defined. This study investigates the roles of cytohesin ARF-GEFs in cell adhesion and migration. First, the study shows that cytohesin 2/ARNO and cytohesin 3/GRP1 have distinct functions for cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. Cytohesin 2/ ARNO expression enhances cell adhesion, spreading, and migration while cytohesin 3/GRP1 expression reduces cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. Second, the study also shows that cytohesin 2/ARNO is required for beta1 integrin recycling while cytohesin 3/GRP1 is dispensable for this process. Third, the study finds that cytohesin 2/ARNO and cytohesin 3/GRP1 have differential localizations in spreading cells. Cytohesin 2/ARNO localizes at both the periphery and interior regions, while cytohesin 3/GRP1 exclusively locates at the plasma membrane. Since the findings indicate that the closely related cytohesin 2/ARNO and cytohesin 3/GRP1 have differential functions and localizations, the investigation also considers the sequence differences of cytohesin 2/ARNO and cytohesin 3/GRP1 that produce the differential effects. Finally, this research demonstrates that the number of glycine residues (2G or 3G) in the Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain of cytohesins is the critical difference underlying opposing effects of cytohesin 2/ARNO and cytohesin 3/GRP1 on cell adhesion, spreading and migration. The glycine residues in the PH domain are a known site for PIP2 and PIP3 bindings, and the PH domain of cytohesin 2/ARNO and cytohesin 3/GRP1 have different binding affinity to PIP2 and PIP3. Based on all data, this study proposes that ARNO and GRP1 recruitment to different membrane domains by their different selectivities for PIP2 and PIP3 is responsible for their differential effects on cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. This is the first demonstration of the unique roles of cytohesin 2/ARNO and cytohesin 3/GRP1.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5855], "author_name_tesi": "Oh, Seung Ja ", "last_name_ssi": "Oh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seung Ja", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lorraine C Santy", "Lorraine C Santy", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Melissa Rolls", "Okhee Han", "Graham Hugh Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lorraine C Santy, Dissertation Advisor", "Lorraine C Santy, Committee Chair", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member", "Okhee Han, Committee Member", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["GRP1", "ARNO", "Cytohesin", "ARF6", "Cell Migration"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "structural estimation on demand with brand choice and quantity adjustment: from non-organic to organic food", "id": "15591", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7837", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I estimate product demand in the vertically differentiated goods market, where consumers choose brand and quantity. I develop a two-stage decision model where consumer chooses both discrete brand and continuous quantity. Using Nielsen Homescan data, I estimate consumer demand in the markets of organic and nonorganic bagged carrots.\n\nI modify Dixit-Stiglitz preferences by adding linear combination of brands and preference weights of each brand in order to capture quality-quantity trade-off.\nIn my model, the quantity decision is brand-dependent and it is derived from underlying optimization. As Hanemann (1984) points out, optimal discrete choice depends on optimal continuous choice and vice versa. While Hanemann (1984) does not focus on quality-quantity trade-off, my model sheds light on vertically differentiated goods market. I estimate individual demand using maximum likelihood method and conduct counterfactual experiments of price and income changes.\n\nThe policy experiments are conducted for two scenarios with plausible values of price elasticity of demand. For a 10% drop in prices of organic carrots, for instance, producers of organic carrots can expect 42.9% rise in quantity demanded and 7.8% increase in supplier revenue in organic carrots market. As consumers switch from non-organic to organic carrots in response to price fall for the latter, they could make a downward adjustment in overall quantity demanded of carrots; the total\nconsumption in the carrot markets (organic and non-organic) would fall by 1.8%, with the fall in the supplier revenue by 2.5%.\n\nConsumption of carrots depends also on income elasticity of demand. With a 10% increase in household income, our experiments show, consumption of organic carrots would increase 19.7% while that of non-organic carrots would fall 3.1%. With increase in income, the quantity demanded overall in the carrot markets would fall by 1.7% and the supplier revenue by 2.8%. Given our data and the underlying pattern of carrot consumption, a downward quantity adjustment in total carrot consumption (organic and non-organic) could well be expected. That segment of the consumers who switch from non-organic to organic carrots will see their\ncarrot consumption fall (given their budget constraints).

Eisenhower implicated the country's socialist economy as its cause.  Sweden's suicide rate was high at the time, particularly for men; about 20 persons committed suicide per 100,000 inhabitants (the rate was 31 for men and 9 for women).  The suicide rate of older males, however, began declining during the 1950s and the rates for younger adult males and all females older than 25 have been declining since the 1970s.  In 2000, only 13 Swedes per 100,000 committed suicide (rates of 18 for men and 7 for women).  Other European countries experienced similar declines, but they occurred at least a decade following Sweden's descent.  \n     This study attempts to uncover the causes for the decline of suicide in Sweden.  My central hypothesis, based on a combination of Max Weber's and Emile Durkheim's sociological theories, is that a change in Swedes' collective identity played a major role.  I argue that Sweden's previous high suicide rate was associated with its citizens' collective identity as the hard-working Protestant individuals who Weber described in his classic monograph, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.  I trace the decline in suicide to a change in that identity to one that is more inclusive and based on solidarity.  I describe these social forces as a change in Durkheimian social regulation, or as a change in the external constraints placed on Swedes by their society.\n     Interviews I conducted with researchers and professionals in Sweden helped form additional hypotheses evaluated in this dissertation.  The quantitative, government data I use were compiled from various Swedish agencies and include statistics on population, mortality, antidepressant use, immigration patterns, alcohol consumption, economic indicators, and various population health indicators for the period 1950-2000.  The national data are supplemented with individual-level analyses from the Swedish National Election Studies (covering 1956-2002) and the World Value Surveys (1982-1999) to examine the roles of attitude change and cohort differences in the decline.  Cohort analyses and decomposition of work ethic and solidarity measures were used to ascertain differences between cohorts born before and after World War II.\n     The results of my analyses support the central hypothesis.  A rise in solidarity is associated with a decline in the work ethic, a decline in religiosity and the decline in suicide.  Earlier-born males and females have a stronger work ethic on an extensive array of measures; males born before 1945 have the strongest measured work ethic.  Factors suggested by my interviewees also appear to have played some role.  The decline in suicide in Sweden is associated with rising antidepressant use, changing immigration patterns, and changing alcohol consumption away from hard liquor and toward a more continental style of drinking.  The importance of the findings is discussed, and future research is suggested.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2753], "author_name_tesi": "Ohlander, Julianne ", "last_name_ssi": "Ohlander", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Julianne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gordon De Jong", "Gordon De Jong", "Robert Schoen", "Duane Francis Alwin", "Emily Kate Greenman", "Mark R Leach"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gordon De Jong, Dissertation Advisor", "Gordon De Jong, Committee Chair", "Robert Schoen, Committee Chair", "Duane Francis Alwin, Committee Member", "Emily Kate Greenman, Committee Member", "Mark R Leach, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["antidepressants", "religion", "identity", "Protestant work ethic", "social regulation", "Weber", "Durkheim", "solidarity", "Sweden", "suicide", "social integration", "family", "individualism-collectivism"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "SELF-REGULATED HELP-SEEKING AT THE UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY: A CASE STUDY", "id": "7235", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1016", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explored self-regulated help-seeking at the United States Military Academy (USMA). This context offers a unique setting in which to study the development of self-regulation because USMA has highly competitive admissions and prepares graduates for service to the nation as Army officers who must lead soldiers in challenging and dangerous environments. This profession elicits images of toughness and resiliency frequently associated with rugged individualism, yet USMA advocates teamwork and seeking help, and does so within a system designed to develop self-regulated leaders who understand themselves and others, and can solve complex ill-defined problems under extreme circumstances. The Student Success Course (SSC) is one method USMA employs to develop this self-regulation and it is around this course that the study has been designed.\nProblem-solving, self-regulated-learning, and the special self-regulation practice of help-seeking provide the initial concepts for this qualitative case study, and social cognitive theory provides the theoretical framework. The research questions driving this inquiry are: (a) What kinds of circumstances prompt cadets to seek academic help? (b) What processes do cadets employ in seeking academic help? (c) What meanings do cadets attach to such practices? (d) What influences (if any) do the Student Success Course (SSC) and/or other environmental resources have on developing a form of self-regulation that promotes help-seeking?\nA pilot study exploring these same research questions preceded this study. In this pilot, cadets who took and did not take the SSC were interviewed in order to understand cadet help-seeking processes and meanings, and to see if the SSC plays any influential role in these perspectives. Pilot results informed the main study by suggesting adjustments to questions and participant selection.\nData collection in the main study consisted of document analyses, classroom observations, and interviews. USMA Academic Program and SSC guiding documents were analyzed. SSC classroom observations took place over a five-day period, with nine different instructors and their respective cadets being observed. Interviews were then conducted using snowball sampling with SSC advocates and opponents from the pilot and from early interviews recommending other participants. A total of 46 individuals participated in the main study, 36 of whom were cadets who viewed the SSC positively or negatively, six of whom were instructors from different departments, and four of whom teach the SSC. Participant invitation continued until theoretical saturation was achieved.\nGrounded theory techniques were used to code and analyze data and then build a substantive model of self-regulated help-seeking at USMA. Open coding identified relevant categories that helped explain help-seeking practices in the USMA context. Axial coding provided a way to relate these categories to each other and to existing theories. Selective coding afforded a method for explaining the resultant substantive theory of self-regulated help-seeking\u2019s influence on professional Army identity development.\nFindings indicated that circumstances prompting help-seeking include experiencing poor academic performance, being told to get help, being confused, and desiring to learn more. The processes cadets employ involve asking peers or instructors for help, the prevalence of instrumental help-seeking, and using that help during further individual and collective studying. Influences on cadet help-seeking include other cadets, coaches, instructors, and the SSC. Finally, cadets seem to evolve from recognizing help-seeking as a strength in the abstract, to practicing this behavior in order to survive, and then later doing so as a responsible behavior that eventually transforms into a professional behavior.\nThe resultant iterative model begins with circumstances and influences working together to prompt help-seeking. These influences, and the related behaviors, lead to evolving meanings regarding help-seeking. Cadets then reflect on their help-seeking experiences and use this reflection to affect future requests for assistance. In the model presented in this study, professional behavior emerges as the central phenomenon and affects professional Army identity development. In effect, help-seeking as a behavior that conventionally may not be associated with military life presents itself as a vital and highly valued practice that is essential to becoming an Army professional.

Development of fungicide resistant and more aggressive P. infestans clonal lineages has emphasized the importance of discovering and incorporating new genetic resistance in tomato cultivars. Although the cultivated tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L., contains limited genetic diversity, several related wild species of tomato are suitable for identification of new desirable traits. Previously, 67 S. pimpinellifolium accessions were screened for LB resistance in field, greenhouse and detached leaflet trials and 12 accessions with strong resistance to LB were identified. In this dissertation, two resistant accessions, PI 163245 and PI 224710, were selected for further genetic characterization. PI 163245 and PI 224710 were each hybridized with a LB susceptible tomato breeding line, Fla. 8059, and F1 progeny were self-fertilized to develop F2 populations. Large F2 populations were grown and screened for LB resistance under greenhouse conditions, and the most resistant and most susceptible individuals in each F2 population were retained for conducting heritability studies as well as identifying and mapping of resistance loci.\nTo characterize the genetic basis of resistance in the two accessions, estimates of heritability (h2) were obtained based on F2:F3 parent-offspring (P:O) correlation analyses. An additional estimate of h2 was obtained based on F3:F4 generations when using the accession PI 163245. Estimates of h2 were moderately-high for both PI 163245 (h2F2:F3 = 0.78, h2F3:F4 = 0.94) and PI 224710 (h2F2:F3 = 0.87). The heritable nature of the resistance suggested that PI 163245 and PI 224710 were potentially viable for breeding LB resistance in tomato, and that mapping of LB resistance loci was warranted. \nTo discover SNP markers for genetic mapping studies, reduced representation libraries (RRLs) for each of PI 163245, PI 224710 and Fla. 8059 were constructed and sequenced. Comparisons of accessions PI 163245 and PI 224710 with breeding line Fla. 8059 resulted in the identification of 33,385 and 20,894 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), respectively. The most resistant (n = 39) and susceptible (n = 35) F2 individuals in the PI 163245 mapping population were genotyped with 233 SNP markers, which were distributed throughout the genome. This selective genotyping approach identified four genomic intervals (quantitative trait loci, QTLs) on chromosomes 2, 3, 10, and 11 associated with LB resistance. Similarly, the most resistant (n = 40) and susceptible (n = 40) F2 individuals in the PI 224710 mapping population were genotyped with 144 SNPs, and LB resistance QTLs were identified on chromosomes 1, 2, 10, and 12. Resistance QTLs on chromosomes 2 and 10 co-localized with two previously identified LB resistance genes, qPh2.1 and Ph-2 respectively, however fine mapping and cloning is necessary to determine how these QTLs correspond to previously identified LB resistance genes. The remaining resistance QTLs did not appear to correspond to known LB resistance genes or QTLs in tomato, and thus are likely unique to this study. Efforts to fine map these resistance QTLs and incorporate them into elite tomato breeding lines are currently in progress.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11439], "author_name_tesi": "Ohlson, Erik William", "last_name_ssi": "Ohlson", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Erik", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Majid R Foolad", "David Robert Huff", "Yinong Yang", "Beth Krueger Gugino", "Surinder Chopra", "Timothy W Mcnellis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Majid R Foolad, Dissertation Advisor", "David Robert Huff, Committee Chair", "Yinong Yang, Committee Member", "Beth Krueger Gugino, Committee Member", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["late blight resistance", "QTL mapping", "tomato breeding", "plant pathology", "parent-offspring correlation", "heritability"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Glimpsing Liminality and the Poetics of Faith: \nEthics and the Fantastic Spirit\n", "id": "9744", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "50", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract \nThis study expands the concept of reframing memory through reconciliation and revision by tracing the genealogy of a liminal supernatural entity (what I term the fantastic spirit and hereafter denote as FS) through works including Ovid\u2019s Narcissus \nand Echo (AD 8), Dante Alighieri\u2019s Vita Nuova (1292-1300), Yokomitsu Riichi\u2019s Haru wa Basha ni notte (1915), Miyazawa Kenji\u2019s Ginga tetsudo no yoru (1934), and James \nJoyce\u2019s The Dead (1914). This comparative analysis differentiates, synthesizes, and advances upon conventional conceptions of the fantastic spirit narrative. What emerges \nis an understanding of how fantastic spirit narratives have developed and how their changes reflect conceptions of identity, alterity, and spirituality. Whether the afterlife is imagined as spatial relocation, transformation of consciousness, transformation of body, or hallucination, the role of the fantastic spirit is delineated by the degree to which it elicits a more profound relationship between the Self and Other. This increased participation is often precipitated by a creative renewal of faith derived from belief in FSs. Depending upon the culture-specific trope, the influence of the FS is markedly \ndifferent. Ghost, apparition, spectre, and obake are conventionally interchangeable concepts, yet they each articulate a unique reality. The ghost is a disembodied spirit, the \napparition is a transformed spirit with a transformed body, the spectre is related to the perception of the protagonist (e.g., a possible hallucination), and the obake is a changed \nobject. From the original Freudian idea of the uncanny, I argue that the FS narrative\u2019s bracketing of culture-specific issues of alterity and identity has diversified from an enclosed gothic paradigm to a dialogic encounter, influenced by modernity, that is structurally versus historically based. The authors studied here incorporate and innovate traditional spiritual structures in their personal narratives. The result is a new role for the cultural imaginary. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [50, 51], "author_name_tesi": "Ohmoto-Frederick, Ayumi Clara", "last_name_ssi": "Ohmoto-Frederick", "middle_name_ssi": "Clara", "first_name_ssi": "Ayumi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Reiko Tachibana", "Monique Yvonne Yaari", "Veronique Marion Foti"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Chair", "Reiko Tachibana, Committee Member", "Monique Yvonne Yaari, Committee Member", "Veronique Marion Foti, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Japanese", "apparition", "ghost", "obake", "spirit", "modern", "European", "liminality"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Design, Synthesis and Redox Properties of Metallated Artificial Oligopeptides\n\n", "id": "7638", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3477", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work details investigations of ligand-substituted artificial oligopeptides that form well-ordered supramolecular structures upon metal complexation.

Larger metallated oligopeptides yield irreversibly adsorbed electroactive films during cyclic voltammetry which are chemically reversible but kinetically quasi-reversible.\nChapter four presents the synthesis of metal-crosslinked oligopeptide duplexes containing Co(II) and Fe(II), functionalized with cysteine and adsorbed to Au electrode surfaces.  Cyclic voltammetry of mixed monolayers containing metallated oligopeptide and propanethiol reveals facile electron transport in Fe(III/II) and Co(II/I), but a decrease in conductivity of the Co(III/II) reaction, as the length of the oligopeptide increases, suggesting that these structures behave as molecular wires.\nChapter five presents electrochemical investigations of the rates of electron transfer in the SAMs described in chapter four.  Rates are measured by Laviron analysis of cyclic voltammograms and AC impedance spectroscopy and in all cases are larger than 104 s-1.

The social relationships that are pertinent to the decision situation and significant in the lives of older adults can serve to support or further complicate their decision-making.  As health care decisions have far reaching effects for the well-being and survival of older adults (Park, 1999) and the decision-making process is fundamentally a communicative activity (Street, 2007), understanding the communicative influences on the health care decision-making processes for older adults is essential.  Guided by the Theory of Motivated Information Management (TMIM) (Afifi & Weiner, 2004) and an ecological perspective (Street, 2007), this study examined the personal decision-making networks of older adults faced with a major health care decision.  \n\nInterview and survey methods were utilized to gather information about older adults\u2019 information-seeking behavior during the decision-making process as well as regarding the influence of numerous communication contexts on the process and outcome of the decision-making.  Personal decision-making networks (n=62) were developed from the data gathered that illustrated communication properties of interest, such as frequency of decision contact, relational quality, and influence on the decision process and outcome.  The ties between and influence of the members (targets) in each participant\u2019s decision-making network (n=279) were also analyzed according to participants\u2019 perception of frequency of decision contact, relational quality, and direction of influence between the members of the network.  \n\nPersonal social network analysis of the decision-making networks revealed that networks fall along a continuum of influence ranging from dominance of organizational influence on the process and outcome of decision-making to dominance of interpersonal influence.  The type of health care decision mediates the influence of organizational and interpersonal contexts in networks.  Analyses of the interactions reported by participants among network members demonstrated that older adults who reported reciprocal interactions with their adult children over the course of their decision-making experienced a decrease in their anxiety with the process of decision-making, where older adults who reported that their adult children attempted to influence their decision-making reported an increase in anxiety.  Further, a decision-maker\u2019s propensity for involvement in their health care decision predicted use of media sources for information during the decision-making process.  Additionally, older-adult decision-makers\u2019 communication efficacy predicted their information-seeking behavior during the decision-making process, demonstrating partial support for the TMIM.  The implications of the findings for medical professionals involved in the health care decisions of older adults and families who seek to support older adults facing a major health care decision are discussed, as well as considerations for advancing information-seeking theory.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2641], "author_name_tesi": "Ohs, Jennifer E.", "last_name_ssi": "Ohs", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jon F Nussbaum", "Jon F Nussbaum", "Dennis Stephen Gouran", "Roxanne Louise Parrott", "Rachel Annette Smith", "Roger Kent Finke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jon F Nussbaum, Dissertation Advisor", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Chair", "Dennis Stephen Gouran, Committee Member", "Roxanne Louise Parrott, Committee Member", "Rachel Annette Smith, Committee Member", "Roger Kent Finke, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["uncertainty management", "decision making", "health-care decisions", "older adults"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Three Papers on Health, Aging, and Employment in the United States", "id": "13449kuo125", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13449", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A life course process represents a seminal concept in life-course research.

This framework expands our understanding of the income-participation gap in two ways. First, it uses more precise measures of economic status-- informed by recent debates among poverty researchers-- and adds a dynamic element by examining how economic history affect participation over the life course. Second, it draws on cognate fields such as sociology, psychology, and public health to examine how the downstream consequences of poverty hinder participation.

Pharmaceutical capacity planning is challenging because of the several conflicting factors involved: (1) long lead time for constructing capacity but high uncertainty in product launch due to clinical trial and FDA approval, and (2) high demand uncertainty but high service level requirement right after product is approved.\n\nMotivated by the growing practice of outsourcing in the pharmaceutical industry to deal with the above challenges, Chapter 2 studies the dual capacity sourcing problem where a manufacturer uses two capacity sources to meet demand: in-house capacity with a longer construction lead time, but once built, can be used throughout the planning horizon, and short-term outsourcing with a shorter reservation lead time but can only be used for one reservation period. Current practices treat such problems as one-time decisions, ignoring the fact that the finite planning horizon defined by the drug patent periods has important implications on the dynamics in such decisions.  Our analysis shows that indeed, the optimal decisions are dynamically changing in the planning horizon. Specifically, the optimal total (in-house plus outsourcing) capacity is characterized by state dependent base-capacity levels. Given the complexity of the problem, the optimal in-house capacity policy is analyzed using two well-behaved heuristic approaches and an extensive numerical analysis. Based on the analysis, we obtain the following guiding principles for effective dual capacity sourcing policies: (1) postpone most of the long-term in-house capacity investment until after product launch and rely primarily on short-term outsourcing to meet demand right after products are approved; (2) quickly expand to a moderate level of excess in-house capacity right after product launch and rely primarily on in-house capacity to meet demand in the middle of the planning horizon; and (3) use both the already built in-house capacity and outsourcing to meet demand in the late years.\n\nChapter 3 extends the dual capacity sourcing model to multiple drugs since many manufacturers with multiple drugs in their pipelines consider building flexible capacity for multiple drugs for risk pooling, in addition to using outsourcing to reduce risks as analyzed in Chapter 2. Specifically, we investigate whether outsourcing and flexible capacity can be used as substitution or complements and how the optimal decisions change along the planning horizon. Given the many dimensions involved in the manufacturers decisions, based on the results from Chapter 2, we devote our analysis to a two-stage capacity planning problem where in-house flexible capacity is only built during the first three periods (referred to as the capacity expansion stage). Demand in the expansion stage can be met by either in-house flexible capacity or outsourcing. In the rest of the periods (referred to as the capacity allocation stage), demand can be met by allocation of the flexible capacity between the two drugs (capacity switching) as well as outsourcing. We find that outsourcing and flexible capacity are complementary as long as both drugs have uncertain demands. The optimal policy in the expansion stage is to prioritize in-house capacity investment on one of the drugs (betting one) in period 1 even if both drugs have similar risks and use capacity switching to meet the demand of the other if needed after product launching risks for both drugs have resolved. During the allocation periods, excess capacity is switched if strong demand is expected for one drug and relatively stable demand for the other in order to minimize capacity idleness costs and capacity switching costs. Any capacity requirement that cannot be met from switching of the in-house flexible capacity will be fulfilled by outsourcing. \n \nWhile Chapters 2 and 3 are motivated more specifically by the pharmaceutical industry, in Chapter 4, we turn our attention to outsourcing contract design in a general setting. Reflecting on the growing bargaining power of some of the contract manufacturers, we examine the outsourcing contract selection problem with a price-setting vendor (contract manufacturer) under cost uncertainties. Applying a real options approach, we develop profit ratio functions for the vendor and client (OEM) under fixed price (FP) and cost-plus (CP) contracts to analyze their contract selection decisions. Supply chain coordination is also investigated. Our analysis shows that when the vendor has a big cost advantage, contract selection becomes independent of operating costs. In addition, contracts selected by the vendor and client always conflict with each other, with no supply chain coordination available. When the vendor has no or a small cost advantage, however, contract selections may or may not conflict. In addition, even if there is no conflict, a coordinated contract can generate higher profits for both players. Also, since the client has a timing flexibility to exercise a contract, the vendor cannot always induce a positive profit even if he controls outsourcing prices.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9098], "author_name_tesi": "Okajima, Hiroko ", "last_name_ssi": "Okajima", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hiroko", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan H Xu", "Susan H Xu", "Hui Zhao", "Douglas J Thomas", "Saurabh Bansal", "Tao Yao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan H Xu, Committee Chair", "Susan H Xu, Dissertation Advisor", "Hui Zhao, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas J Thomas, Committee Member", "Saurabh Bansal, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pharmaceutical manufacturing", "capacity planning", "outsourcing", "contract selection", "dual sourcing"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Completing the Uncompleted Argument: An Existentialist Response to Appiah's Reading of Du Bois", "id": "27428", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12065", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Almost 30 years have passed since Kwame Anthony Appiah began writing a series of responses to W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019s definition of race in \u201cThe Conservation of Races\u201d (1897).  In his famous first essay, \u201cThe Uncompleted Argument: W.E.B. Du Bois and the Illusion of Race,\u201d Appiah judges Du Bois\u2019s conception of race in \"The Conservations of Races\" to be circular and, thus, incoherent.  But in 2012 at the Henry Louis Gates, Jr. lecture series Appiah renounces his earlier statements on Du Bois and publishes a new book on Du Bois, Lines of Descent: W.E.B. Du Bois and the Emergence of Identity (2014).  This publication, one year shy of the 30th anniversary of \u201cThe Uncompleted Argument\u201d, begs the question of why, after a tense history and an even more contentious debate, Appiah returns to Du Bois and, more importantly, what does he find in the emergence of (a racial) identity that he did not 30 years ago.  The central work of this project is to deploy existential critical philosophy of race to explore what might remain of Du Bois\u2019s sociohistorical definition of race on the way to developing a new conceptual framework from which to understand racial identity. Using the resources of existential philosophy, broadly conceived, and without succumbing to the allure of Appiah\u2019s interventions, I show that Appiah\u2019s shift from racial eliminativism to cosmopolitanism is able to give us a more robust sense of the terrain we must traverse when theorizing identity.  This can successfully be done, I argue, if Appiah\u2019s arguments are unremittingly frustrated by the challenges of racism and racialized subjectivity, and framed according to a world structured by systematic racism. The goal of this project is to reconstruct a philosophical account of lived experience that does justice to the experience of race.

Chrysanthemums arrived in Japan during AD386 where highly prized cultivars were developed within a short period of time. Since the earliest recognition of chrysanthemums in China, popularity of this flower has continued to grow throughout the world.\nChrysanthemum White Rust (CWR), caused by Puccinia horiana Henn., is an autoecious, microcyclic rust that is pathogenic on many chrysanthemum species (Chrysanthemum spp.) and close relatives within the Asteraceae family. Chrysanthemum white rust is economically important due to its ability to infect florist chrysanthemum\n(Chrysanthemum x morifolium) cultivars used as cut flowers and potted plants throughout the world. Puccinia horiana can cause serious damage to chrysanthemums in commercial greenhouses as well as at homeowner sites. Many countries, including the United States, have established Phytosanitary Quarantines against CWR, due to financial loss from CWR and difficulty of eradicating the disease. Currently P. horiana is not\nconsidered indigenous in the United States.\nThe objectives of this study include determining the ability of P. horiana to overwinter in Pennsylvania, and to illustrate morphological details of P. horiana within infected chrysanthemum leaves. Although we previously reported the presence of P. horiana in the roots and stems of asymptomatic chrysanthemum plants, we had not provided detailed descriptions of the morphology, intercellular colonization, and\nintracellular growth of P. horiana in chrysanthemums until this paper. Images produced using compound microscopy and SEM in this paper provide additional, detailed illustrations regarding P. horiana colonization of chrysanthemum stems and leaves. Also,\nanastomosis between two adjacent strands of P. horiana hyphae is illustrated for the first time.\nAnother objective was to determine the economic impact of CWR based on incidence and severity of P. horiana on selected varieties at one location in central Pennsylvania, and to develop a molecular screening technique sensitive enough to detect latent, hidden infections of CWR. Federal regulations state that, for a chrysanthemum plant to be considered positive for P. horiana, it must exhibit visible teliospores on or in the infected plant. Thus, chrysanthemum plants that are determined to be positive for P. horiana via molecular screening do not legally have be eradicated, if teliospores or telial sori are not visible. This need for visualization of morphological symptoms may cause a\nserious time delay in recognition of diseased plants. This delay in identification of CWR increases the financial costs, since later eradication may involve digging and removing larger established plants. Sensitive and accurate molecular screening of chrysanthemum plants by using molecular methods, as demonstrated by our research, employed prior to\ndispersal of asymptomatic, yet P.horiana-positive, chrysanthemum plants could greatly reduce cost of production for wholesale and retail horticultural businesses, as well as homeowners.\nThe final objective of this study was to genotype P. horiana isolates collected throughout the United States, and to compare the genotypes of the United States isolates with previously collected worldwide isolates. This phase of the study considered 101 isolates, including 61 collected within the United States. The 61 United States isolates were collected from seven states. Six multilocus genotypes were identified within the\nUnited States, as compared to 28 for the worldwide collection. We determined there are four main genotypes in the United States, with one newly discovered in this study. This study suggests that five or six separate introductions into the United States have occurred.\nSupported by confirmation of P. horiana overwintering in the United States, this study indicates that P. horiana is now endemic within the United States.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10259], "author_name_tesi": "Okeefe, Grace ", "last_name_ssi": "Okeefe", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Grace", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Durwood Davis", "Dennis R Decoteau", "David Meigs Beyer", "John Andrew Pecchia", "Michael Anthony Fidanza"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Durwood Davis, Dissertation Advisor", "Dennis R Decoteau, Committee Chair", "David Meigs Beyer, Committee Member", "John Andrew Pecchia, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Fidanza, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Puccinia horiana", "white rust", "flower diseases", "chrysanthemums", "plant diseases", "floriculture"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Development of a novel foot slip sensor algorithm", "id": "23832", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10589", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A novel gait and slip detection algorithm for walking robots and humans using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) was developed. An unscented Kalman filter was formulated with a simple dynamic model of a foot as a block on a slope without translations.

These prediction errors were systematically incorporated in a binary Bayes filter to estimate the probability of gait and slip states.  Three stages of experiments with increasing complexities served dual purposes to develop and validate unified gait and slip detection algorithms.  Multiple floor conditions and slopes were used in these experiments.  Stick-slip experiments served as fundamental slip detection test cases without involving gait states.

One set of thresholds was used for detection under all floor conditions in a given series of validation experiments.  It was not necessary to provide explicit knowledge of the inertial and control parameters, walking surface (orientation, contamination, and friction mode), or sensor error models.  Consequently, a universal, simple-to-use, and robust realtime sensor algorithm was developed to detect gait and slip of robots walking on floors with various contaminations and slope.

African American college students are at even higher risk for HIV due to some cultural beliefs and misconceptions.  Although HIV counseling and testing is considered a primary line of defense in reducing HIV transmission, models on which such services are based do not explore socio-cultural contexts within which HIV behaviors takes place.  Use of a cultural model that explores the socio-cultural contexts of students\u2019 behaviors may provide more insight into factors that either enable them to, or prevent students from engaging in HIV risk reduction behaviors. In addition, providing students with the necessary skills to negotiate such contexts along with daily management of their behaviors may prove effective in reducing HIV risk behaviors.   \nThe purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the Enhanced HIV counseling program in reducing HIV risk behaviors by increasing condom use, reducing the number of sexual partners, and alcohol use, as compared to the Standard HIV counseling program (brief counseling) currently offered at the Penn State University Park campus. Using mixed approaches of behavioral surveys and content analysis of semi-structural interviews, opinion guides and field-notes, the study specifically compared the effectiveness of the Enhanced HIV Counseling program with the Standard Counseling program in reducing HIV risk behaviors; determined which component(s) of the Enhanced counseling was most effective, and explored socio-cultural factors identified by students that prevent them or enable them to engage in HIV risk reduction.  \nUsing the PEN-3 model as a guide, the Enhanced HIV counseling consisted of forty minutes of pre-test counseling on skills training on condom application, negotiating safer sex, and exploring socio-cultural factors; followed by the actual HIV testing.  Participants were also provided with self-monitoring logs to complete daily and drop off at the end of each week for the duration of the study. Participants also received twenty minutes of post-test counseling based on completed logs when they returned for their HIV test results, and five minutes of telephone counseling support at nine weeks into the study.  The Standard Counseling comprised of twenty minutes of pre-test counseling\u2019s assessment of risks, and development of behavioral goals, followed by the actual HIV testing, and a ten minutes post-test counseling when students returned 3 weeks later to receive their HIV test results.  Main outcomes of interest were participants\u2019 knowledge about HIV/AIDS; reduction in number of sex partners, use of alcohol and increase in condom use during last sexual encounter; the most effective component in the Enhanced HIV counseling program and socio-cultural factors identified by students\u2019 as supportive of, or impediments to reducing HIV risk behaviors.\nStudents using the off-site testing locations were recruited to participate in the study. Of the 108 students using the off-site testing locations, fifty students agreed to participate in the study, and were randomly assigned to receive the Enhanced HIV counseling or the Standard HIV counseling.  Participants were equally distributed into both study groups, were mostly African Americans (68%), females (64%) and single (66%).  \nParticipants\u2019 knowledge about HIV/AIDS increased at post-treatment when compared with pre-treatment, although this was not statistically significant.  Cross-tabs analysis showed that more participants in the Enhanced Counseling group reported a reduction in the number of sex partners in comparison to participants in the Standard Counseling group. In addition, more participants in the treatment group reported less use of condoms and more alcohol use at last sexual encounter when compared to those in the Standard Counseling group. However, these results were not statistically significant. \nContent analysis of the semi-structural interviews showed that equal number of the participants\u2019 selected the skills training and self-monitoring logs as effective components of the Enhanced HIV counseling. Only one participant selected the telephone counseling, and one participant selected both the skills training and self-monitoring logs.

Of particular interest was whether the experiences of at-risk white males differ from those of other at-risk youth.\n\n     Five specific experiences were examined, namely: program of study, high school graduation, dropout, transition to postsecondary, and transition to employment. The main research question that guided the study was: Among at-risk youth, do the academic and transitional experiences vary by race, race and gender, and race and residence?\t\n\n     Data for the study were drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97). A sub-sample of 837 participants was used. At-risk youth were defined as those from families living below poverty level in the United States and who are at risk of experiencing academic and transitional difficulties as a result of their poor economic backgrounds. Descriptive and multivariate statistics were used to analyze the data. Frequency counts, percentages and Chi-square tests were used in the descriptive analysis and logistic regression and survival analysis were used in the multivariate analyses.\n \n     Findings revealed that among at-risk youth there are no variations in high school graduation, dropout, and transition to postsecondary education. In general, at-risk white males are as likely as all other at-risk youth to experience the negative effects of poverty when faced with equal levels of economic hardships. Their patterns of enrollment in programs vary slightly, but overall all at-risk youth are more likely to follow a general curriculum. The one major exception is that blacks in rural America are significantly less likely to be employed than their white counterparts even when poverty levels are controlled.\n\n     It is recommended that while policy makers should continue to support the disproportionately disadvantaged minorities, it is important to recognize that among at-risk youth there are more whites than other racial groups and they are also experiencing similar academic and transitional difficulties that characterize most minorities.

Such ion specificity has been characterized and named as the lyotropic or Hofmeister series. These recurring ion trends have been elucidated for a wide range of biologically important processes including aggregation of polymers/proteins, protein folding, and enzymatic activities. In this dissertation, we investigated two major issues yet to be solved in ion specific effects on biomacromolecular systems. First, cation associations to the protein backbone was investigated with three different model systems. A simple amide molecule, butyramide, was utilized as a monomer unit for protein backbone. FTIR spectroscopy is employed to monitor the amide I band, and coupled with vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS), which shows aligned water hydration at the air/butyramide/water interface. Contact paired cation binding is monitored via a salt concentration dependent new carbonyl stretch peak (1645 cm-1), which is ~25 cm-1 blue shifted from the original resonance (1620 cm-1). Moreover, enhancement in the degree of aligned water molecules upon cation absorption in the hydration of the butyramide monolayer at the air/water interface demonstrated a complementary set of evidence. Only strongly hydrated cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Li+) demonstrated these spectral changes. Weakly hydrated cations (Na+, K+), on the other hand, did not show any evidence for contact paired binding to simple amides.\n \nThe molecular mechanism of cation-protein backbone interactions was further investigated on neutral biomacromolecules. The hydrophobic collapse of poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) and elastin like polypeptides (ELPs) was exploited to glean the effect of 11 alkali and alkaline earth metal chloride salt. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) data was modeled to a simple equation where weakly hydrated cations once again show no clue for cation binding to neutral biomolecules. These cations mainly salt macromolecules out with surface tension effects. Very weak cation binding, however, was shown for strongly hydrated cations. Moreover, an additional bulk salting-in effect was shown for strongly hydrated cations, where ion hydration thermodynamics demonstrated a direct correlation with the specific salting in effects. \n\nThe second major topic focused in this thesis was the molecular size influence on specific ion effects. It was investigated by using various poly(N,N diethyl acrylamide) (PDEA) from oligomers to large polymers, along with some simple amide molecules; N-methyl acetamide (NMA), and N,N Diethyl acetamide. Hydrophobic collapse of PDEA was probed as a function of three representative Hofmeister anions (SO42-, Cl-, SCN-). Molecular size changes showed no apparent influence with kosmotropic SO42-, and Cl- anions. Nevertheless, chaotropic, SCN-, anion binding was dramatically influenced from molecular size. Similar results were achieved from the Raman spectrum of the model systems where the shifts in the C-H stretch peaks were monitored. Overall, weakly hydrated anion exclusion (KD > 3M), and a strong anion binding (KD ~ 130mM) were observed for simple amides and large polymers, respectively. The molecular size dependence was also elucidated for the hydration of biomolecules. A gradual increase in the ice-like (3200 cm-1) water peak, which is attributed to weakly hydrated sites at the biomolecular surface, was monitored as the macromolecular size increases. This hydration behavior must play a dominant role for the underlying molecular mechanism for the macromolecular size effect.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10049], "author_name_tesi": "Okur, Halil Ibrahim", "last_name_ssi": "Okur", "middle_name_ssi": "Ibrahim", "first_name_ssi": "Halil", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Cremer", "Paul S Cremer", "John B Asbury", "Philip C.

It attempts to identify some of the processes that may facilitate the observed decrease in dexterity with advancing age and investigates the effects of strength training on some of these changes. \nThe experiment on the effects of aging on multi-finger coordination in a moment of force production task showed that elderly individuals had a reduced ability to produce synergies that stabilize the total moment and the total force. This suggests that elderly individuals have a decreased ability to coordinate commands to the fingers in order to stabilize action, and in particular rotational action. \nThe two experiments that addressed anticipatory synergy adjustments (ASAs) showed that elderly individuals are not able to manipulate synergies in preparation to a predictable change in the force output to same extent as the younger people. Combined, the results of these studies suggest that aging is associated with a decreased ability to use feed-forward adjustments in preparation for an anticipated change in the performance variable and provide further support for feed-forward nature of ASAs.\nThe experiment on the effects of repetitive testing on indices of finger interaction displayed that repeated testing is not sufficient to generate changes in these indices. These results can be used to support the argument that the training induced changes observed in the last experiment were truly due to training and not familiarity with the experimental setup.\nThe final experiment, investigated the effects of site specific strength training on maximal voluntary force, enslaving and performance on an accurate force production task and functional clinical tests in the elderly. This study showed that strength training has general improving effects on force produced at both sites of both hands regardless if they received training or not but these effects were most prominent at the trained proximal sites whose force is mostly generated by the intrinsic hand muscles. This suggests that focused training of the intrinsic muscles may result in an improved ratio between the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles and allow the extrinsic muscles to be activated to a larger degree. \nWhen taken together, this series of studies has enhanced our knowledge of changes in finger interaction and coordination in aging. These studies carry a negative message of impaired multi-finger synergies in the elderly but also a positive message that such changes may be counteracted or even reversed with appropriately designed exercise.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2158], "author_name_tesi": "Olafsdottir, Halla Bj\u00f6rg", "last_name_ssi": "Olafsdottir", "middle_name_ssi": "Bj\u00f6rg", "first_name_ssi": "Halla", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Latash", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky", "Steven Howard Zarit", "Karl Maxim Newell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Latash, Committee Chair", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky, Committee Member", "Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Member", "Karl Maxim Newell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aging", "Coordination", "hand", "motor control"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Development of Poly(benzyl ethers) that Undergo Selective, Continuous Depolymerization for Use in Responsive Materials", "id": "26692", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11835", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Polymers that can selectively and continuously depolymerize are finding increasing use as responsive materials.

The design and synthesis of new depolymerizable polymers, however, is an unmet challenge.  Only a handful of polymers have been shown to undergo selective, continuous depolymerization, and fewer still have been demonstrated to respond in the solid state.  This dissertation describes a new class of depolymerizable poly(benzyl ethers) synthesized from stabilized quinone methide monomers.  Upon application of a chosen stimulus and exposure to basic conditions, the poly(benzyl ethers) undergo an anionic elimination cascade to release their constituent monomers within minutes.

It utilized a qualitative inductive design. The constant comparison process supported the existing sociocultural activity theory approach. \nFindings from this study indicated firstly, that PSETs drew on contrasted stories of past and present experiences in one of three thematic categories: stories about a beloved teacher, about writing, and about authenticity. PSETs invoked different forms of telling their stories, such as sharing informed incidents, disclosing uncertainties, and/ or beliefs and expectations. They identified and noted contrasts between their own learning experiences as students and the beliefs they had come to hold about pedagogy via methods courses and preteaching experiences. Secondly, PSETs contrasted their stories of past and present experiences when engaging in certain invitations (the Problems of Practice (PP) inquiry project, proposal for PP, interview, and prompted reflection writing about the PP) during their methods course. These invitations elicited storytelling and reflection, and PSETs reliving and contrasting of past and present experiences as they retold teacher or learning stories where they articulated their pedagogical practice, beliefs and professional identity.\nThis study presented ways PSETs think about teaching writing and the kinds of stories they draw on when learning to teach writing in a methods course. These findings are helpful for the academic community, higher education and PSETs because valuable knowledge will aide and familiarize teacher educators with PSETs\u2019 ways of thinking when learning to teach writing.

After a natural gas field is deemed economically viable for development, and the reservoir properties have been determined, a field development plan will normally be put together as a blueprint for producing the field. However, since the main objective of natural gas field operators is to maximize profits, it is imperative to understand how to optimize recovery from the field. In this study, a model that uses reservoir engineering concepts to determine the optimum hydrocarbon that can be produced per dollar spent has been developed. The model adopts an optimization-based systems approach to field development, which begins with predicting reservoir performance, and subsequently incorporating economic parameters to determine the number of wells that will yield the maximum monetary value of the field.\n\nArtificial neural network (ANN) technology as a tool is increasingly becoming popular for use in reservoir engineering applications such as reservoir characterization and prediction of enhanced oil recovery performance due to its relatively fast, computationally cost-effective, and reliable delivery compared to other tools such as reservoir simulators. In this study, ANN technology is applied to the field development optimization model in order to reliably predict the optimum number of wells for any gas field development project within the specified reservoir and economic parameters. In this regard, an ANN expert system has been developed and several data sets containing relevant parameters have been used to train and test the developed ANN system.

It has been predicted by The U.S. Energy Information Administration that unconventional sources such as the Marcellus Shale gas play will account for 50% of natural gas production by 2030 (US EIA, 2007).This projection suggests that there will be more drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities carried out with several factors at risk and huge consequential environmental effects. These risks include (1) contamination by drilling waste (muds, flow-back water, produced water etc.) also emissions from drilling sites and runoffs (2) natural gas leaks and oil spills (3) direct effects on human health. Statistics have shown that 0.5-1% of wells drilled for exploration result in blowout. The causes of these risks are identified to be due to (1) Violations (2) Operational Pollution (accidental spills and leaks (3) Operators policy (inefficient production practices and waste management policies).\nIn the quest of addressing this concern, an extensive review of literatures with experimental findings was done, and also the potential effect of these activities on the environment was evaluated with statistical analysis (SAS) of all violations by operators in Pennsylvania from January 2008 to November 2010.

Recently, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2014) found that nearly one third of all teachers leave the profession within their first three years; many cited a lack of administrative and professional support as a major factor in their decision to seek alternative employment. \u201cThe problem takes many forms, including the feeling of being isolated from colleagues, scant feedback on performance, poor professional development, and insufficient emotional backing by administrators\u201d (p.7). While there is no replacement for a solid teacher induction program, it is clear that teacher educators need to find alternative and expansive ways to provide intellectual and emotional support to new teachers as they enter the profession, helping them focus not only on their pedagogical and content knowledge skills, but also on nurturing their emerging and constantly evolving teacher identifications. One way that teachers are able to achieve this level of additional support on their own, bridging the gap from the University to their initial in service positions (supplementing what can sometimes be less than ideal professional development), is to turn to online teacher communities, or what I term online teacher affinity spaces.\n\tThe purpose of this study was to investigate the types of support beginning teachers perceive they obtain from voluntary membership within a particular online teacher affinity space called The English Companion Ning (EC Ning). Using a qualitative ethnographic approach, I sought to identify the types of discursive practices that emerge as beginning teachers participate in the content-specific online space. It incorporates sociocultural and social learning theories (Gee, 2006; Lave and Wenger, 1991; Wenger 1998) to explore how beginning teachers, often considered legitimate peripheral participants, display patterns of membership and interaction, as well as how they position and identify themselves as beginning teachers within the discussions they engage in. \n\tThe results of this study suggest the potential of online teacher affinity spaces to support beginning teachers, both professionally and emotionally. A salient finding is that beginning teachers tend to take up various degrees of participation in the EC Ning and this can be closely tied to the levels of support they experience at their schools of employment. In addition, the EC Ning displayed elements of affinity space that provided beginning teachers the opportunity to conduct important identity formation and experimentation. The utilization and implementation of these types of spaces as supplemental support, as early on as in teacher education programs, have the potential to provide beginning teachers with the reinforcements they need in order to survive and thrive during their first years of teaching. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10010], "author_name_tesi": "Olcese, Nicole Rose", "last_name_ssi": "Olcese", "middle_name_ssi": "Rose", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamie Myers", "Jamie Myers", "Priya Sharma", "Anne Whitney", "James F Nolan Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamie Myers, Dissertation Advisor", "Jamie Myers, Committee Chair", "Priya Sharma, Committee Member", "Anne Whitney, Committee Member", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Affinity Spaces", "Teacher Education", "Online Social Networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONING, DIETARY INTAKE, BODY FAT, AND TOBACCO USE ON BLOOD PRESSURE PARAMETERS: A TWO-METHOD MEASUREMENT DESIGN APPROACH\n", "id": "7761", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "102", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The two-method measurement design was applied to answer substantive questions pertaining to hypertension and several lifestyle-based risk factors; specifically, analyses involved estimating the cross-sectional association of three blood pressure parameters (systolic blood pressure (SBP); diastolic blood pressure (DBP); and pulse pressure (PP)) and four known hypertension risk factors (physical conditioning; dietary intake; body fat; and tobacco use). The two-method measurement design, a recent statistical advancement in the area of planned missingness approaches, measures constructs using several indicators of variable cost and validity. Cheaper, less valid measures of a construct and more expensive, valid measures of the same construct collectively serve as manifest indicators. All participants provide data for the cheap measures; a small proportion of participants also provide data for the expensive measures. When at least a subsample of participants provide complete data, bias correction models allow for the modeling of measurement bias (i.e., reduced construct validity) associated with the cheap measures; resulting parameter estimates are efficient and unbiased. \n\nA simulation paradigm was used to apply the two-method measurement design to empirical NHANES data. The performance of the two-method measurement design was compared to that of financially-equivalent complete case designs. For two of the four predictors \u2013 body fat and tobacco use \u2013 application of the two-method measurement design produced statistical power advantages beyond those yielded by the financially-equivalent complete cases models. Under a hypothetical budget constraint of $20,000, complete case body fat data could be collected from N=333 participants; however, the two-method measurement design behaved as if the complete case sample sizes were N=1469, N=1625, and N=1565 for testing the effects between body fat and SBP, DBP, and PP, respectively. Under the same budget of $20,000, complete case tobacco use data could be collected from N=363 participants; the two-method measurement design behaved as if the sample sizes were N=1513, N=655, and N=872 for testing the effects between tobacco use and SBP, DBP, and PP, respectively. Application of the two-method measurement design was comparatively less effective for the physical conditioning and dietary intake variables. A potential explanatory factor involves the general lack of association between cheap and expensive measure indicators for these two variables.\n\nIn general, the strength of association between the independent and dependent variables was inversely correlated with the increase in statistical power produced by the two-method measurement design (results consistent with previous research). Results have implications for future application guidelines. To maximize the utility of the two-method measurement design, cheap and expensive measures for a given construct should be highly correlated. It is recommended that researchers collect small amounts of data from candidate cheap measures to determine, a priori, the set of cheap measures that best correlates with expensive measure data. It is also helpful if researchers are able to anticipate, to some degree, effect sizes between independent and dependent variables of interest; this offers researchers the opportunity to more accurately tailor data collection to achieve maximal cost-effectiveness. \n\nRecent interest in the efficiency of health prevention programs, as well as limited external funding sources, has placed an increased emphasis on cost-effective research within many behavioral health disciplines. Whenever researchers have the opportunity to collect data for a particular construct using several measures of variable cost and construct validity, the two-method measurement design offers the potential for cost-effective data collection and unbiased and efficient parameter estimation.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [103], "author_name_tesi": "Olchowski, Allison Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Olchowski", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Allison", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Walter Graham", "Robert James Turrisi", "Sheila Grace West", "Edward A Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Walter Graham, Committee Chair", "Robert James Turrisi, Committee Member", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Member", "Edward A Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["two-method measurement design", "missing data", "cost-effectiveness"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "An Investigation of the Aerodynamics of Miniature Trailing-Edge Effectors Applied to Rotorcraft\n", "id": "11203", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "618", "abstract_tesi": "The aerodynamics of Miniature Trailing-Edge Effectors (MiTEs) is explored in many aspects with regards to their applicability to rotorcraft. MiTEs are active Gurney flaps that have the ability to modify the lift and moment characteristics of the blades around the rotor disk. MiTEs hold strong potential to be used as active devices to improve performance, reduce vibrations, and reduce noise of rotors. The present work explores the static and unsteady aerodynamic performance of MiTEs by the aid of experimental, numerical, and analytical methods. A static experimental investigation of Gurney flaps is undertaken at The Pennsylvania State University Low-Speed, Low-Turbulence Wind Tunnel. Aerodynamic results are obtained for three distinct rotorcraft airfoils equipped with Gurney flaps of various sizes and placed at different chordwise locations. The effects of Gurney flaps are found to be very dependent on the combination of their height and location, as well as on the airfoil shape. It is observed that when positioned upstream from the trailing edge, the Gurney flap can become sometimes ineffective and provide a decrease in the cl,max of the airfoil, suggesting that great care must be taken into sizing these devices.\nAn experimental investigation of oscillating upstream-located MiTEs is conducted at the Mid-Sized Wind Tunnel at Penn State. Measured unsteady aerodynamic data prove the effectiveness of MiTEs in providing variations in the forces and moments of the airfoil. The amplitude and phase lag of the lift results are in good agreement with the trends predicted by unsteady linear theory. In some cases, however, the occurrence of non-linear effects is observed. These effects are believed to be caused by vortex shedding in the lower surface of the airfoil, and seem to be aggravated as the frequency of deployment increases. Analysis of available computational fluid-dynamic (CFD) predictions on upstream MiTEs indicates the formation and convection of an unsteady vortex in the lower surface of the airfoil, right after MiTE deployment. This disturbance can introduce non-harmonic components in the aerodynamic response, substantially affecting the loads and complicating the analysis. In order to account for these effects during routine helicopter performance and design studies, available CFD results are used to develop a reduced-order, less computer-intensive model based on indicial concepts. The model extends a work previously done for trailing-edge MiTEs by incorporating a vortex model to predict the unsteady lift of upstream MiTEs. A physics-based approach is adopted to minimize the number of constants and improve overall generality. The results from the unsteady-lift model are compared with CFD for different airfoils, MiTE deployment schedules, MiTE chordwise positions, and Mach numbers. Very good agreement is shown for a wide range of conditions that are typical of rotorcraft. Different model constants and correlations may have to be considered in order to improve the predictions for different airfoil shapes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [614], "author_name_tesi": "Oliveira Vieira, Bernardo A", "last_name_ssi": "Oliveira Vieira", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Bernardo", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark David Maughmer", "Mark David Maughmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark David Maughmer, Thesis Advisor", "Mark David Maughmer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["wind tunnel testing", "active devices", "Gurney flaps", "unsteady aerodynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Consideration of Unsteady Aerodynamics and Boundary-Layer Transition in Rotorcraft Airfoil Design", "id": "13934bao137", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13934", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Traditional rotorcraft airfoil design is based on steady-state aerodynamics, despite the many sources of unsteady-flow in forward flight. At high-thrust and high-speed conditions, the rotor may be susceptible to dynamic stall; consequently, large margins are necessary to prevent fatigue loads on the blades and pitch links, limiting operation under high altitudes, payload, and temperatures, as well as during maneuvers.\n\nThis work revises typical design requirements and proposes new ways to qualify airfoils in dynamic stall. A number of design studies are conducted to better understand the relation between airfoil shape and dynamic stall behavior. The design manipulations are handled by an inverse-design, conformal mapping method, and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are used to predict the unsteady aerodynamic performance.  \n\nIn unsteady flow, the occurrence of aerodynamic lags in the development of pressures, boundary-layer separation, and viscous-inviscid interactions suggest more strict requirements than in steady flow. In order to postpone the onset of dynamic stall, the design needs to handle competing leading- and trailing-edge separation mechanisms, which are heavily influenced by shock waves and laminar-turbulent transition effects. It is found that a particular tailoring of the trailing-edge separation development can provide adequate dynamic stall characteristics and minimize penalties in drag and nose-down pitching moments. At the same time, a proper design of the nose shape is required to avoid strong shock waves and prevent premature stall.  \n\nA proof-of-concept airfoil is developed to improve dynamic stall behavior, while meeting other stringent requirements. Performance calculations using information obtained from comprehensive analysis (RCAS) based on a UH-60A helicopter suggest that an expansion of the operational envelope is possible, while also reducing hover drag, maintaining low pitching moments, and providing reasonable margins to drag rise at the maximum speed of the UH-60A helicopter.\n\nFinally, pitching wing calculations are conducted to demonstrate the proposed concepts in three-dimensional flow.

The research suggests that the giving away of resources, time, energy and support associated with code transforms the nature of the relationship between actants in a previously stable Actor Network. The concept identified is a new strain of activism the research refers to as Information Altruism. Information Altruism extends the methods available to organizational activists who seek to change their culture.\n\nInformation Altruism lays out factors that must be juxtaposed to the current organizational culture in order to be applied. These factors include an established currency, power flow, value system and the ability to plant a flag in the ground for your new cause. These concepts are explored through analysis of interviews with members of CentralU after efforts have been donated across the organization.

Iron is essential for E. coli but bioavailable iron is scarce in the environment, making this a critical process in the competition for survival of these cells.  In other Gram negative bacterial species, TonB energizes transport of heme, maltodextrin, sucrose, and nickel.  The precise mechanism of TonB-dependent energy coupling is unknown and studies aim to elucidate the details involved in this process.  In the cytoplasmic membrane, TonB is thought to form a hetero-oligomeric complex with two other integral membrane proteins, ExbB and ExbD.  ExbB and ExbD appear to harness the pmf to energize TonB.  TonB spans the periplasm, retaining cytoplasmic membrane association, directly contacts OM transporters, and transmits energy for release of ligands into the periplasm.  ExbD and TonB each have a single transmembrane domain (TMD), with the majority of each protein occupying the periplasm, while ExbB has three transmembrane domains with the majority of soluble domains in the cytoplasm.  TonB is a conformationally dynamic protein, and ExbD is proposed to direct the conformational changes of TonB.  \nThis study addressed the role of ExbD in TonB-dependent energy transduction and provides evidence to support the proposed function of ExbD in modulating TonB conformation.  Formaldehyde crosslinking was used to identify ExbD-specific interactions in vivo.  ExbD crosslinked into a homodimer and ExbB-ExbD or TonB-ExbD heterodimers.  The TonB-ExbD heterodimer was dependent on the presence of ExbB, supporting the predicted formation of a multimeric energy transduction complex.  The first mechanistic role for pmf was identified, where pmf is required for specific periplasmic domain interaction that allows crosslinking of ExbD to TonB.  The importance of wild-type TMDs of ExbD and TonB for this interaction suggests a role for signaling from the TMD to the periplasmic domain.  Pmf-dependent conformational changes in the TonB system were further examined with limited proteolysis studies.    ExbD conformation was demonstrated to be responsive to changes in pmf.  Pmf appears to be a toggle switch for TonB and ExbD conformational changes.  ExbD was also shown to determine the ability of TonB to change conformation in response to pmf, with distinct roles of the ExbD TMD and periplasmic domain.  A model is proposed for three stages leading to energization of TonB, emphasizing the importance of the ExbD periplasmic domain for TonB to progress to subsequent stages.  The importance of the ExbD periplasmic domain was also apparent in further studies addressing specific regions of ExbD important in its function, using a 10-residue deletion scanning analysis.  Functional division of the ExbD periplasmic domain is proposed, with residues 42-61 important in response to pmf and residues 62-141 important for interaction with TonB.  The conformation of the region between residues 92-121 was especially important in supporting multiple ExbD protein-protein interactions.  Subsequent studies focused on this region with cysteine scanning and disulfide crosslinking.  Multiple sites of homodimeric interaction in vivo were identified.  Specific interaction with TonB was observed through many of the same sites.  Studies of TonB-ExbD interaction were extended to 45 individual cysteine substitutions in the TonB carboxy terminus.  Three of six ExbD cys substitutions examined in combination with these TonB substitutions formed multiple disulfide-linked heterodimeric interactions.  A wild-type ExbD TMD and ExbB were important for disulfide-linked heterodimer but not homodimer formation.  A model is presented where the default configuration of the ExbD periplasmic domain is dimeric with transition from localized homodimeric interactions to heterodimeric interactions with TonB, mediated by the ExbD TMD.  Specific interaction sites on TonB further suggested interaction with ExbD may resolve TonB homodimeric interfaces and configure the TonB periplasmic domain for productive interaction with OM transporters.  This work has provided significant insight into the functional role of ExbD in TonB energization and expanded knowledge of both the mechanisms and sequence of events involved in the cycle of TonB-dependent energy transduction.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13], "author_name_tesi": "Ollis, Anne A.", "last_name_ssi": "Ollis", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Anne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Postle", "Kathleen Postle", "Sarah Ellen Ades", "B Tracy Nixon", "Lorraine C Santy", "William O Hancock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Postle, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathleen Postle, Committee Chair", "Sarah Ellen Ades, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Lorraine C Santy, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ExbD", "TonB", "membrane protein", "conformational change", "energy transduction", "Escherichia coli"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Understanding the role of built and natural features within person-place bonding at a local nature center", "id": "14046mho10", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14046", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research in outdoor recreation has often grappled with the dynamic connection that people cultivate with the places where they choose to recreate (Williams, Patterson, Roggenbuck, & Watson, 1992).

Effective, targeted water management strategies are desperately needed if such populations are to continue thriving. Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) represents a bottom-up approach in which local people from various social fields act collectively to address water scarcity concerns. This qualitative case study sought to explore and describe the factors that lead to the emergence of collective action within the context of CBNRM. The four research concepts that guided the study were: water access and use; common issues within the community; levels of interaction; and sociodemographic characteristics. Seventeen interviews were conducted through purposive sampling of residents in Lamuria, an agro-pastoral village in Laikipia County, Kenya from March - July 2011. The study looked at collective action from an interactional field theory perspective and employed an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to analyze and synthesize the findings. The findings indicate that access to water is a significant concern for participants particularly during the dry seasons and in times of drought. Most of the participants retrieve their water from local rivers, although results varied when it came to boiling and treating the drinking water. Water groups do exist though it remains to be determined how closely they embody the principles of CBNRM. Participants were engaged in other forms of collective action through self-help groups focused on a variety local issues including agricultural enterprises, general health and welfare, education, and financing.

Acoustic data from a sea trial in April 2011 that took place in the Oslofjord, Norway near Larvik were used to estimate the scattering cross section, and probability of false alarm. The data were obtained from high-frequency, high-resolution interferometric synthetic aperture sonar system. Since the acoustic system has not been calibrated, an effective calibration of this sonar was performed based on a natural feature with estimated roughness and a valid scattering model. \n\nThe seafloor around Larvik, Norway consists of glacially-eroded outcrops of rock, which possesses both very rough and very smooth roughness characteristics. These outcrops have been characterized in terms of their elastic properties based on previously measured mineral composition. Their roughness characteristics were measured during the a field experiment conducted in May 2013. A stereo photogrammetry system was designed and built for the purpose of obtaining high resolution roughness measurements. These height field measurements are used to form power spectrum estimates, which were used calibrate the acoustic system. Statistical characterization of facet sizes and orientations were used to motivate numerical modeling.\n\nFor the very rough areas on the rock outcrops, no analytic approximate scattering model is valid. Connections between surface parameters, and trends in the scattering cross section and probability of false alarm were made using the boundary element method.

More consumers are aware of their impact on the environment and are pressuring companies to produce sustainable products that have a lower carbon footprint.  Given that the international average CF caused by manufacturing products in 2001 was 13% of the entire CF, and the fact that consumers purchase more manufactured goods in wealthier nations, efforts towards producing more sustainable products are prime areas for concentration.   It is anticipated that the government will impose cap and trade restrictions on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to keep the pollution from companies regulated. Some companies are trying to record and cut back on their GHG emissions before any laws are enacted so that they are less likely to incur the possible fines, or more likely to keep and expand their customer base by becoming more \u201cgreen\u201d. \nIt is important that product design be considered concurrently with the manufacturing of a product and its supply chain.  A poorly designed product increases costs for redesign and slows it\u2019s release to consumers.  The design stage should consider sustainability of products with additional sustainability criteria.  When these criteria are considered early, there is more flexibility to change the product design using parts from various suppliers with minimal cost.  This way, businesses can mitigate emissions across the whole supply chain, rather than only in their own plant.\nThe research in this thesis is an extension of a previous dissertation where the author proposed a graph-theory based optimization approach for simultaneous optimization of product and supply chain design. The previous dissertation used Design for Assembly (DfA) criteria to initially order 64 different concepts of bicycles from easiest to hardest to assemble.  It chose the best scoring DfA concept and created a model with an objective function to minimize the total cost of processing, transportation and inventory for the finished bike concept.  The model accomplished this objective by choosing which supplier would be used for each bicycle component. This thesis extends the prior work to include the consideration of cradle to gate manufacturing processes to improve sustainability. The product is examined from the manufacturing stages of the parts, to the full assembly of the finished product before it is shipped to a warehouse, store or consumer. It also adds CF as an additional criterion with relevance to: (1) the way in which the product is processed, (2) the material from which the product is made, and (3) the transportation type and distance that the product must be shipped to its final destination. Each of these criteria is measured in the amount of CO2 equivalent gases emitted and is included in the product optimization.\nThe modified model was run: (1) as a minimization problem for single objectives, (2) with an equal weighted objective, (3) with a non-preemptive multiple objective, and (4) as a single objective maximization.  Since each of the objectives of cost, lead-time, and carbon footprint are dependent on each other, this brings about an unavoidable tradeoff situation.  Results for all of the runs are shown as well as the components, modules, and suppliers according to the model results.  As a general trend, when one objective is low, the others will be low as well.  Conversely if an objective is very high, the others will be on the high end too.  This model should serve as an example for companies to use on their own products to regulate cost, lead-time, and CF simultaneously and choose the best suppliers and components.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1717], "author_name_tesi": "Olson, Elizabeth Christine", "last_name_ssi": "Olson", "middle_name_ssi": "Christine", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gul Kremer", "Gul Kremer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gul Kremer, Thesis Advisor", "Gul Kremer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["supply chain", "design", "sustainability", "carbon footprint"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Chasing a Passion: The Early-Career Lived Experience of First-Generation College Graduates\n\n", "id": "10948", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3017", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "First-generation college students (students whose parents have not earned at least a bachelor\u2019s degree) graduate at significantly lower rates than their peers, even when controlling for background characteristics such as race, socioeconomic status, pre-college academic preparation, and so on.

Following this loss, the introduction of geography into the national educational curriculum changed how maps were used and understood in the early Third Republic. Used widely by travel guidebook authors and by government officials administering the city prior to 1870, maps took on an additional role during the Third Republic: through visual representation they helped reaffirm the republic\u2019s desire for a common national identity. This identity, based on the modernity and stability of the new regime, helped a volatile France redefine itself and its capital city. \nThis dissertation is a study of France\u2019s view of Paris and of how the government and publishers wished to portray its capital city to the world. This study aims to define how France promoted Paris as a modern, stable capital city, and how the government used maps as instruments of power associated with the emergence of a more confident Republic. Overreaching concepts in the study are the notions of map discourse (color, text, shapes, and symbols), modernity, and republicanism. \nThough guidebook discourse has been studied in detail, the examination of maps as a valid tool for disseminating the government\u2019s message has been only summarily treated. Studies in this area address primarily French travel or tourism, focusing mainly on the texts supporting these maps, such as travel guides. Among the maps this study examines are those published by the city of Paris and its government agencies, along with maps from the Guide Joanne travel guidebook series. To explore the background of these maps, I use approaches and methods in cultural history, but also rely on semiotics and historiography.\nThe study\u2019s importance lies in multiple definitions of modernity and in how those definitions were used to promote the French capital. 1870 Paris was a damaged city, one prone to rebellion, and the French wished to counter this notion. Documenting the city as calm and republican on maps was one way to do just that. As the Third Republic continued, stability became the norm. Multiple Expositions Universelles served not only as demonstrations of national pride, but also as proof that Paris had recovered from both military defeat and internal strife with official and tourist guide map discourse helping to promulgate this message. Furthermore, as the French Third Republic became more confident in its ability to govern Paris, and France, and the French became better map readers, its discourse adapted.  The examination of maps from the early Third Republic elucidates the changing nature of map use during this period as well as French ability to identify with the new government. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3389], "author_name_tesi": "Olson, Kory Ernest", "last_name_ssi": "Olson", "middle_name_ssi": "Ernest", "first_name_ssi": "Kory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Willa Zahava Silverman", "Deryck William Holdsworth", "Kathryn Marie Grossman", "Monique Yvonne Yaari"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Willa Zahava Silverman, Committee Chair", "Deryck William Holdsworth, Committee Member", "Kathryn Marie Grossman, Committee Member", "Monique Yvonne Yaari, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Third Republic", "Maps", "Paris", "Geography"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "WHAT IS THE SKILL OF CLIMATE PARAMETER ESTIMATION\nMETHODS?

(2) How sensitive is this pdf to priors?

A Gaussian Process emulator is developed to interpolate UVic ESCM output between the ensemble parameter settings. The emulator is constrained with historical observations of temperature and upper ocean warming using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The results are combined with prior independent evidence. The method results in the 95% posterior credible interval for CS from 1.8\u00b0C to 4.9\u00b0C, with the mode of 2.8\u00b0C.

When the prior evidence is discarded, the 95% interval upper bound increases to 10.2\u00b0C.\n   In addition, multiple observation system simulation experiments are performed. First, pseudo-observations of temperature and upper ocean warming are simulated from the emulator at a specified \u201ctrue\u201d CS. Then, CS is re-estimated using the pseudo-observations and the emulator, and compared to the \u201ctrue\u201d value. It is found that CS is more difficult to estimate when it is high. This suggests that a high CS might get undetected when relying on the recent instrumental record alone. Unresolved internal climate variability represents a key uncertainty in CS estimates from global observations and EMICs. Using a single observational record, contaminated by internal variability, can result in a sizeable discrepancy (up to several \u00b0C) between a CS estimate and the \u201ctrue\u201d value. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9011], "author_name_tesi": "Olson, Roman ", "last_name_ssi": "Olson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Roman", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Klaus Keller", "Klaus Keller", "Chris Eliot Forest", "James Kasting", "Murali Haran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Klaus Keller, Dissertation Advisor", "Klaus Keller, Committee Chair", "Chris Eliot Forest, Committee Member", "James Kasting, Committee Member", "Murali Haran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Climate sensitivity", "internal climate variability", "Gaussian Process", "climate model", "Markov chain Monte Carlo"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Quantifying the areal extent and dissolved oxygen concentrations of Archean oxygen oases", "id": "18477", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8589", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Several lines of evidence indicate that the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis preceded the oxygenation of the atmosphere\u2014perhaps by as much as 300 million years.

Simple mass balance predicts that locally oxygenated environments (oxygen oases) could exist in areas of high productivity if the local rate of oxygen production by oxygenic photosynthesis exceeds the combined rate of oxygen loss by a number of processes (e.g., exchange with the atmosphere, transport within the ocean, reaction with reduced aqueous species, biological consumption).

Within oxygen oases, oxygen concentrations locally approach ~1-10 \u00b5M for a large range of plausible Archean conditions.

Normal LGL are critical to the removal of virally-infected or tumor cells from the body.  These cells normally expand when there is an immune challenge and then rapidly undergo apoptosis when the antigen is cleared, but leukemic LGLs are resistant to apoptosis.  Serological evidence indicates that LGL leukemia may be driven by chronic infection of an unknown retrovirus.  Patients with LGL leukemia frequently experience autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and also experience cytopenias requiring medical intervention.  The study of LGL leukemia is therefore important both from a patient standpoint and as a model of normal LGL.  We have recently discovered and characterized multiple somatic mutations in exon 20 and 21 of STAT3 from exome sequencing of an LGL leukemia patient and confirmed this mutation to be present in both Natural Killer and T cell leukemias.  A small percentage was also found to have mutations in STAT5B, with some associated with an aggressive phenotype.  Concurrently, we have undertaken whole genome sequencing to determine what other mutations may contribute to LGL leukemia and to expand our knowledge of STAT3 activation.  Given the antigen driven nature of LGL leukemia, it is unclear what mutations are necessary for their lack of apoptosis and whether these will resemble those seen in other leukemias.\nThe current treatment of choice for LGL leukemia is immunosuppressive methotrexate.  Firstly, we present the first large prospective trial of immunosuppressive therapy in LGL leukemia.  In this trial we identify a correlation between a particular Y640F mutation in STAT3 and a favorable response to first line treatment with methotrexate.  We measure and report 27 serum cytokines collected for this trial, none of which were a priori predictive of treatment response.  Through microarray analysis we identified a gene expression signature indicative of response.  Interestingly, this gene signature does not appear to be driven by STAT3 mutation in all samples.  We propose that there are other methods of STAT activation in these samples and advance a model of how the Y640F mutation enforces response.\nSecondly, we collaboratively sequenced 6 paired, leukemic/saliva genomes from three LGL patients at a high rate of coverage.  Two patient genomes contain a direct STAT3 mutation.  In the third patient we observe a mutation in the 3' UTR of the IL6R that could activate JAK-STAT signaling if it is shown to regulate translation.  Mutations in the histone modifiers, MLL2, MLL3 and NCOR1 are supported in the sequence reads of all three genomes.  Alterations in this pathway would be a new observation for LGL leukemia.  We identify and catalog numerous other mutations which may give insight into LGL biology that could allow us to better understand how symptoms arise and differ between patients and why current treatments may fail.\nLastly, we present data identifying important cis-regulatory modules in LGL leukemia gathered through ChIP-Seq of genomic regions occupied by the master regulator TBET.  We report evidence of binding in the promoter region of numerous constituents of lytic granules which may indicate these are important downstream effectors of TBET.  Overlap between the patients used for genome work above and ChIP-Seq is allowing us to determine whether  mutations can have an effect on TBET binding and subsequent transcription of nearby genes.  As we collect the footprints of additional factors, this holds the promise of elucidating the potential impact of the tens of thousands of non-coding mutations observed in these samples. \nIn summary, we present the results of large collaborative efforts to sequence mutations in LGL leukemia and determine their effect on LGL biology.  We advance the knowledge of STAT3 mutations in LGL biology while identifying and stratifying other mutations for the future study of their potential impacts.  Bioinformatic methods of analysis were focused on publicly available resources such as Galaxy for which new tools, file formats, and workflows were developed.  This allows easy reproduction of methods by other groups and facilitates visualization and future analysis by our own.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8916], "author_name_tesi": "Olson, Thomas Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Olson", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\"", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby", "Thomas E Spratt", "Richard James Courtney", "Bruce A Stanley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\", Dissertation Advisor", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member", "Richard James Courtney, Committee Member", "Bruce A Stanley, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["large granular lymphocytes", "leukemia", "STAT3", "TBET", "genomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FRANCISCO DE ZURBAR\u00c1N\u2019S PAINTINGS FOR THE CALCED AND DISCALCED MERCEDARIANS OF SEVILLE\n", "id": "11416", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3016", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nIn this dissertation, I will show how the Calced and Discalced Mercedarians of Seville developed several iconographic programs, represented most significantly by the paintings commissioned from the great Spanish painter Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n (1598-1664).  The iconography incorporates three interrelated issues within the context of the period.  First, Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s paintings encourage the veneration of saints and martyrs, which represents the efforts of the Calced Mercedarians to reform and confirms the reform of the Discalced Mercedarians.  Second, these paintings reveal the Mercedarians claim to have played an important role in the Reconquest and show their support for the expulsion of the Moriscos. Lastly, Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s representation of Mercedarian scholars and bishops recognize that the Order was beginning to achieve a higher standing in society, as well as the support of patrons from prominent families.\nFollowing King Philip II\u2019s and the Council of Trent\u2019s recommendations to reform monastic orders and venerate saints, the Mercedarians made institutional changes and worked to secure the canonization of their members.  The Castilian Mercedarians took part in the implementation of a new constitution in 1588, and the foundation of a Discalced Order in 1602. The Order did not, however, have any of their own saints; therefore, achieving the canonization of one or more members, would further their goal of achieving a more elevated status in relation to both the court and church.  Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s paintings of their recently canonized founder, Peter Nolasco (c. 1182/89 - c. 1245-56), and Mercedarian doctors, bishops, and martyrs for the Calced Mercedarian monastery of Our Lady of Mercy; and paintings of Peter Nolasco, Raymond Nonnatus, Mercedarian martyrs, and other saints for the Discalced Mercedarian monastery of Saint Joseph of Seville encouraged the veneration of the Order\u2019s principal saints.  \nZurbar\u00e1n incorporates contemporary details into his thirteenth-century life of Peter Nolasco, which allows the Mercedarians to claim an important role in the Reconquest and the expulsion of the Moriscos from Spain.  He represents the Mercedarians working alongside the Spanish monarchs to defend the Catholic faith by aiding in the Reconquest, rescuing enslaved Christians who were in danger of losing their faith, and supporting the expulsion of the Moricsos.  My comparisons of the paintings to the Mercedarian hagiographies, histories of the Order, and other paintings of the same subjects will support these claims.  The paintings will also be compared to other more or less impartial historical accounts.   \nMy examination of the later paintings commissioned by other Mercedarian houses will show that Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s paintings for the Mercedarians of Seville established most of the iconography within a seventeenth century framework.  Other Spanish painters of the later seventeenth through early eighteenth centuries followed, for the most part, the established iconography of the life of the founder.  Some of the historical claims in Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s paintings are not present in these subsequent works of art.\nI shall also argue that the Mercedarians must have intended these images to encourage contemporary support, in the form of contributions, to their ransoming missions, and achieving a higher status in Spain.   The Mercedarians clearly believed that they could advance their Order by visually representing their achievements in academics, their sacrifices on ransoming missions, and their support of the church and monarchy for over four hundred years.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3007], "author_name_tesi": "Olson-Rudenko, Jennifer S.", "last_name_ssi": "Olson-Rudenko", "middle_name_ssi": "S.", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Curran", "Brian A Curran", "Nancy Elizabeth Locke", "Robin Lemuel Thomas Ii", "William Robert Blue"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Curran, Dissertation Advisor", "Brian A Curran, Committee Chair", "Nancy Elizabeth Locke, Committee Member", "Robin Lemuel Thomas Ii, Committee Member", "William Robert Blue, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MERCEDARIANS", "FRANCISCO DE ZURBAR\u00c1N", "SEVILLE"]}, {"year_isi": 2000, "title_ssi": "Testing for a relationship between paleocommunity recurrence and taxonomic turnover using a sequence stratigraphic framework", "id": "5830", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6160", "defended_at_dtsi": "2000-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aim of this project was to test for a relationship between paleoecological community stability and rates of taxonomic turnover using bivalves and brachiopods of the Pennsylvanian-Permian Midcontinent (Kansas and Nebraska).  The first of three main parts focused on building a high-resolution time-environment framework for the upper Wabaunsee, Admire, and lower Council Grove Groups (~2.5 Myr).  Applying the principles of sequence stratigraphy revealed two scales of cyclicity - 51 meter-scale cycles and 5 composite sequences.  Meter-scale cycles are genetic packages bounded by subaerial unconformities; lowstand systems tracts are preserved as incised valley fills, transgressive systems tracts are dominated by nearshore to offshore carbonate deposits, and highstand systems tracts are dominated by nearshore to offshore siliciclastic deposits.  Correlation of these cycles reveals composite sequences that show a rapidly deepening to slowly shallowing succession of meter-scale cycles bounded by angular unconformities.  This high-resolution time-environment framework served as the foundation for paleoecological analysis, the second part of this study.  Exploratory statistical techniques (cluster analysis and correspondence analysis) revealed that bivalves favored nearshore settings and brachiopods favored offshore settings on the Midcontinent Platform.  Monte Carlo and bootstrapping methods indicate that the degree of recurrence of faunal gradients within each of these two paleocommunities is not significantly different.  In the third part of the study, taxonomic turnover in the two paleocommunities was studied over a ~17.5 Myr interval divided into 32 cycles (each ~500,000 years).  No significant difference in the rate of background disappearance could be detected in the two groups, but a significant episode of elevated first appearances occurs in the bivalves during early Missourian time and a significant disappearance event occurs in the brachiopods during early Wolfcampian time.  In conclusion, different turnover histories in the two groups do not correspond to different degrees of paleoecological community stability (as measured by recurrence).  This indicates that processes governing community level patterns of taxonomic associations are different than those governing long-term faunal change in this case.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6153], "author_name_tesi": "Olszewski, Thomas D.", "last_name_ssi": "Olszewski", "middle_name_ssi": "D.", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Sluyter", "Roger J Cuffey", "Rudy L Slingerland", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "Mark E Patzkowsky", "Michael Allan Arthur"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Sluyter, Committee Member", "Roger J Cuffey, Committee Member", "Rudy L Slingerland, Committee Member", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Member", "Mark E Patzkowsky, Committee Chair", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["paleoecology", "bivalve", "brachiopod", "sequence stratigraphy", "Permian", "Pennsylvanian"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECT OF THE STATE CHILDREN\u2019S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM ON HEALTH INSURANCE TRANSITIONS AMONG LOW-INCOME U.S. CHILDREN: A MULTILEVEL APPROACH\n\n", "id": "7302", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "526", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The recent history of the Medicaid program has been characterized by periodic expansions of coverage to new populations. The latest expansion was the establishment of the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 1997. SCHIP extends public coverage to older children from families with income previously too high to qualify for Medicaid. Studies of previous Medicaid expansions have estimated the crowd-out effect of such public program expansions on private coverage using mostly traditional regression methods and often accounting for limited variables in estimated models. This study uses a combination of event history analysis and multilevel modeling techniques to examine both crowd-out and the effect of individual, family, and contextual factors influencing health insurance transitions among low-income U.S. children.   \n The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the post-1996 Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility expansion and other factors on health insurance transitions among low-income children. The results provide some insight into how health insurance policies might be directed to have maximum positive impact on targeted children in low-income families.\nThe sample for the study consists of unmarried children nineteen or younger living in families with incomes at or below 325 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), using data from the 1996 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) spanning the period 1996 to 2000. The empirical approach uses discrete-time logistic regression methods to estimate six health insurance transition models in a competing risk framework.\nThe results do not support the hypothesis that eligibility for the Medicaid/SCHIP expansion causes disenrollment from private insurance; that is, no clear evidence is found of crowd-out of private insurance by the post-1996 public insurance eligibility expansion for children. Instead, the results indicate that the implementation of the SCHIP program might have prevented some low income children in public coverage from becoming uninsured, that is, a small reduction in the rate of uninsurance for sampled low-income children.\nThe results also indicate that state policy decisions and employment characteristics have important effects.  Expanding the existing Medicaid program, relative to establishing new stand-alone new SCHIP programs, is significantly associated with decreased rate of transitions from public to private insurance. The use of income disregard rules by states is also associated with a decreased rate of transitions from public insurance to private coverage. Finally, the results indicate that children living in states with higher proportions of total employment in the retail service sector are more likely to disenroll from private insurance.\nFamily characteristics are another important factor in insurance transitions. The findings suggest that a parent\u2019s full-time employment status, higher educational attainment beyond high school, higher family income, and the presence of two parents in families reduce the likelihood of a transition by a child out of  private health insurance coverage. \nIn summary, results of the study do not suggest that expansion of public insurance coverage through SCHIP implementation led to a significant amount of crowd-out. The form of the SCHIP expansion and administrative policies did influence transitions between public and private coverage as did characteristics of the children and their families. Together, these results suggest that features of the public insurance program and its expansion and private insurance markets have important effects on transitions in insurance coverage. These effects have not been previously been well accounted for and deserve further study.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [523], "author_name_tesi": "Oluwole, Adetokunbo Babatunde", "last_name_ssi": "Oluwole", "middle_name_ssi": "Babatunde", "first_name_ssi": "Adetokunbo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis G Shea", "Pamela Farley Short", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier", "John Casterline"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis G Shea, Committee Chair", "Pamela Farley Short, Committee Member", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Member", "John Casterline, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MULTILEVEL MODELING", "SCHIP", "MEDICAID", "PRIVATE INSURANCE", "UNINSURED", "HEALTH INSURANCE TRANSITION", "CROWD-OUT", "LOW-INCOME CHILDREN", "EVENT HISTORY", "DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Public Employment-Free Speech Jurisprudence: Proposal of a New Constitutional Test for Disciplined Whistleblowing Teachers.\n\n", "id": "7665", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2921", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study proposes a new approach for analyzing teacher whistleblowing cases.

The multiple projects carried on in the past three decades have considerably helped improve the designing of actuation systems and the utilization of smart materials for morphing aircraft structures. However, morphing aircraft and especially aircraft undergoing large shape change still face some significant technical issues. Among them, the skin covering the morphing structure must meet challenging requirements that no current conventional material fully satisfy. The design of such skin, which should be able to undergo large deformations and to carry air-loads, has received some attention in the last several years but no satisfactory solution has been found yet.\n\n\nIn the current study, the design of compliant cellular structures and flexible skins for morphing aircraft structures is investigated for two different morphing deformations. The first morphing deformation considered corresponds to one-dimensional morphing which is representative of a wing or blade changing its chord or span. The second morphing deformation considered is shear-compression morphing which can be found in some morphing wing undergoing change in area, sweep and chord such as NextGen Aeronautics' morphing wing. Topologies of compliant cellular structures which can be used for these two types of structures are first calculated using a multi-objective approach. These topologies are calculated based on linear kinematics but the effect of geometric nonlinearities is also investigated. Then, ways to provide a smooth surface were investigated by considering a general honeycomb substructure with infill, bonded face-sheet or scales. This allowed justifying an overall skin concept made of a cellular substructure with a bonded face-sheet. Lastly, the design of an improved skin for NextGen Aeronautics' morphing unmanned aerial vehicle is presented.\n\n\nThis design project, carried in two phases, investigates in detail a methodology to design a skin with specific objectives and constraints. Constraints related to the buckling of the substructure walls and wrinkling of the face-sheet were accounted for. Driving factors to improve the skin properties were identified. Among them, pre-strains were used to reduce wrinkling and local deflection of the face-sheet, and the substructure shape and geometry was investigated to reduce strain energy and local strains. The detailed study and these driving factors' effect allowed designing a skin better than the original skin design in terms of number of parts, mass and energy input.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3529], "author_name_tesi": "Olympio, Kingnid\u00e9 Raymond", "last_name_ssi": "Olympio", "middle_name_ssi": "Raymond", "first_name_ssi": "Kingnid\u00e9", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Farhan Gandhi", "Farhan Gandhi", "George A Lesieutre", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Timothy Francis Miller", "Fabrizio Scarpa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Farhan Gandhi, Dissertation Advisor", "Farhan Gandhi, Committee Chair", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member", "Timothy Francis Miller, Committee Member", "Fabrizio Scarpa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multiobjective optimization", "topology optimization", "morphing skin", "honeycomb", "hybrid multiobjective genetic algorithm"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Identifying Risk In Cost Reimbursable Contracts \n\n\n", "id": "10422", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5495", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary goal of the research is to assess risk elements in cost reimbursable contracts.

In this format, a vesicle suspension can be injected onto a fused-silica capillary and subsequently isolated to individual components in an applied electric field by capillary electrophoresis.  The separation capillary terminates into a PDMS-based microfluidic device that continuously delivers surfactant from microchannels to the detection zone in a sheath-flow format.  As individual intact vesicles exit the separation capillary, they are chemically lysed and their contents subsequently detected at a carbon-fiber microelectrode positioned at the outlet.  Electrooxidation of vesicular contents by constant potential amperometry allows for the mole amount encapsulant to be quantified on a per vesicle basis.\nThe electrochemical cytometry method design and characterization studies are outlined in Chapter 2.  Here, I investigated how sheath flow of the lysis buffer affected analyte dispersion in the detection zone of the hybrid capillary-microfluidic platform using confocal fluorescence microscopy, computational fluid dynamics simulations, and end-column electrochemical detection to monitor the eluent flow profile.

By modeling the amperometric peak characteristics with the theoretical flux of dopamine from of a lysed vesicle at the detector, I was able to determine the coulometric efficiency of the electrochemical cytometry detection scheme to be 87% (which was increased to > 95% via less signal filtering for investigations in Chapters 3 and 4).  \nAn interesting application of this novel technique is discussed in Chapter 3, where electrochemical data recorded from stimulus-coupled secretion experiments at single PC12 cells were compared to cell-free measurements of vesicular dopamine content using electrochemical cytometry.  Although standard methods used to measure stimulus-coupled release from single cells have classically been thought to assess the entire content of vesicles, there is evidence in the literature that suggests the total transmitter stored in vesicles is not expelled during exocytosis.  This hypothesis was directly interrogated using electrochemical cytometry which allows for the quantification of total vesicular neurotransmitter in a manner that circumvents biophysical release processes of the cell associated with exocytosis.  \nBy comparing total dopamine content from electrochemical cytometry measurements at individual isolated vesicles with the vesicular amount released at single PC12 cells, it was determined that during full exocytosis only a fraction (~40%) of total transmitter load is released from a typical vesicle.  The data from these experiments support the intriguing hypothesis that the average vesicle does not open all the way during exocytosis, resulting in incomplete distention of the neurotransmitter contents.  The implications of these results to neuroscience are large; namely: even during full exocytosis vesicular neurotransmitter release is not necessarily all-or-none.  This suggests that transmitter secretion can be regulated within a single exocytosis event, imparting a potential molecular basis for synaptic plasticity at the subcellular level.  Upon establishing that release in exocytotic processes proceeded in an incomplete manner, electrochemical data quantified from both single cell release experiments and electrochemical cytometry of vesicles were related to vesicular volume from electron microscopy measurements to investigate the location of intravesicular catecholamine stores (e.g., halo or dense core) in PC12 cells retained post-fusion.\nIn Chapter 4, the electrochemical cytometry method was expanded to investigate vesicular content from the midbrain neurons of a mammalian animal model.  Vesicles were isolated from mice striatal tissue and individually probed for endogenous dopamine content in a manner that was independent of release.  This brain region is of great interest in neuroscience research since dopamine pathways that terminate into the striatum have been directly linked to a variety of neurobiological phenomena including motor function, reward, addiction, cognition, and neurological dysfunction, including Parkinson\u2019s and Huntington\u2019s disease.  \nIn addition, electrochemical cytometry was applied to monitor the effects of synaptic vesicle neurotransmitter loading and depletion from mice injected with various pharmacological agents.  It was demonstrated that vesicular neurotransmitter levels were altered and variances observed from these treatments resolved from single synaptic vesicles in a high-throughput manner, thus providing an efficient methodology to screen for the effects of neurological therapeutics in the subcellular domain.  Moreover, the effect of the psychostimulant, amphetamine was investigated and shown to significantly deplete dopamine in the average striatal synaptic vesicle.  \nIn Chapter 5, the development and characterization of a reagentless modified carbon-fiber microelectrode sensor capable of monitoring pH in biological microenvironments is presented.  The voltammetric carbon-fiber sensor was modified using a simple and reproducible procedure that involved electrochemically grafting a commercially available diazonium salt (Fast Blue RR) onto the microelectrode surface.  Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was used to probe redox activity of a quinone-moiety on the surface bound diazonium.  A quantifiable oxidative wave was observed to yield a linear pH-dependent voltammetric response by flow injection analyses.  Then, the sensor was used to measure fluctuations of pH in vivo that were evoked by optogenetic stimulus-coupled secretion in the central nervous system of a mutant fruit fly.\nThe work in Chapter 6 outlines several future bioanalytical applications of electrochemical cytometry.  The first few involve elements that apply to the technical aspects of the measurement to expand upon the separation and detection capabilities of the method.  The latter describe specific applications in liposome research and neuroscience that can be investigated for the quantitative characterization of volume-limited submicron vesicles via electrochemical cytometry. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1485], "author_name_tesi": "Omiatek, Donna M.", "last_name_ssi": "Omiatek", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Donna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing", "Andrew Ewing", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Scott T Phillips", "Michael L Heien", "Peter J Butler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Ewing, Committee Chair", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Scott T Phillips, Committee Member", "Michael L Heien, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electrochemical cytometry", "exocytosis", "neurotransmitter", "vesicle", "electrochemistry", "microfluidics", "capillary electrophoresis"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Data Cleaning Techniques by means of Entity Resolution", "id": "7797", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "895", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Real data are ``dirty.' Despite active research on integrity constraints enforcement and data cleaning, real data in real database applications are still dirty. To make matters worse, both diverse formats/usages of modern data and demands for large-scale data handling make this problem even harder. In particular, to surmount the challenges for which conventional solutions against this problem no longer work, we focus on one type of problems known as the Entity Resolution (ER) -- the process of identifying and merging duplicate entities determined to represent the same real-world object. Despite the fact that the problem has been studied extensively, it is still not trivial to de-duplicate complex entities among a large number of candidates.\n\nIn this thesis, we have studied three specialized types of ER problems: (1) the Split Entity Resolution (SER) problem, in which instances of the same entity type mistakenly appear under different name variants; (2) the Mixed Entity Resolution (MER) problem, in which instances of different entities appear together for their homonymous names; and (3) the Grouped Entity Resolution (GER) problem, in which instances of entities do not carry any name or description by which ER techniques can be utilized, and thus the contents of entities are exploited as a group of elements. For each type of problems, we have developed a novel scalable solution. Especially, for the GER problem, we have developed two graph theoretic algorithms - one based on Quasi-Clique and the other based on Bipartite Matching, and experimentally validated the superiority of the proposed solutions.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [887], "author_name_tesi": "On, Byung-Won ", "last_name_ssi": "On", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Byung-Won", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dongwon Lee", "C Lee Giles", "Sandeep Purao", "Wang Chien Lee", "Piotr Berman", "Reka Z Albert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dongwon Lee, Committee Chair", "C Lee Giles, Committee Member", "Sandeep Purao, Committee Member", "Wang Chien Lee, Committee Member", "Piotr Berman, Committee Member", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Data Mining", "Clustering Algorithms", "Graph Algorithms"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Stability Analyses of Differently Shaped Salt Caverns for Underground Natural Gas Storage", "id": "17647", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8577", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary purpose of underground storage for natural gas is to balance the variable demand for gas in high consumption seasons against the constant supply by production. There are three basic types of underground storage including depleted reservoirs, aquifers and salt caverns. Construction and use of salt cavern storage has expanded significantly during the past decades because it has a rapid cycling ability with to meet daily even hourly variations in customer needs. Cavern stability is the most important consideration for storage cavern design. Main factors for the structural stability of caverns in salt formation are local geology, rock properties, cavern depth, cavern geometry and cavern locations. In this study, impact of different design parameters on cavern stability and possible deformation characteristics such as displacement, shear and volumetric strain are investigated. For this purpose, numerical modeling using finite element method (FEM) was used. The FEM modeling program Phases\u00a9 version 7.0 by RocScience was utilized for stability analyses. This program provides useful data on stress distribution, ground displacement and strains as a function of parameters such as in-situ stress ratio, cavern depth and salt properties. A parametric study was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the program output and results to rock properties, in-situ stresses, and cavern design parameters. The effect of each design factor on the cavern stability with different shapes was studied. The objective of the modeling was to provide optimum cavern design for the given geological conditions. Three specified cavern shapes including cylindrical, tapered cylinder and teardrop was considered in this parametric study. The modeling was performed for three different scenarios. First, single cavern design was studied and behavior of different shaped single caverns was investigated. This effort provided a basis for selection of the most suitable cavern design for underground natural gas storage. The result of modeling showed that the cylindrical design with domed ceiling and floor is the most stable shape and the deformations were below 2% diameter, which is considered to be a reasonable rate for prevention of failure in underground structures. The 2nd step was to study the impact of excavating multiple caverns and the resulting stress, deformation, and stability issues. For multiple caverns, the cavern interaction was the main consideration to evaluate the effects of the spatial configuration of the caverns on deformation of neighboring caverns. The distance of two times the diameter of larger caverns is determined to eliminate mutual interactions between caverns. The third step was to assess the influence of depth of cavern within the salt formation or salt thickness on cavern design. Sufficient salt should be left above the cavern to provide the safe redistribution of stresses. The optimum distance between cavern top and salt formation is investigated and distance of at least one diameter seem to be sufficient to prevent negative interference from the overburden or cap rock.

The gender gap in partisanship is a dynamic process. I address the dynamic nature of the gender gap in partisanship between 1953 and 2003 by tracing its evolution as a function of the social and political context captured by the social definition of gender.  I argue that how society conceptualizes the meaning of gender continually reshapes not only the social, but also the political fabric of the United States giving rise to shifts in the social definition of gender. These shifts produce new policies for women and men, resulting in the reshuffling of partisan attachments. Additionally, this project integrates the theoretical work on the social construction of gender into empirical research by developing empirical measures of the social definition of gender.\n\nThe concept of the social definition of gender is operationalized using public opinion. I use James Stimson's dynamic algorithm, a form of principle component factor analysis, to combine multiple question series into a single time series of the progressiveness of American's gender attitudes. Survey questions pertaining to the roles and expectations of men and women are collected from iPoll and the National Election Studies. The partisanship data has been gathered from Gallup surveys.\n\nChanges in the social definition of gender continually remold the social and political landscape of the United States. However, the connection between changes in social identities and the behavior resulting from those changes is often overlooked.  This project makes that connection through understanding the impact the dynamics of social definition of gender has on men's and women's political alignments. Additionally, this project enhances our understanding of what causes changes in macropartisanship and provide an explanation for the dynamics of the partisan gender gap.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2202], "author_name_tesi": "Ondercin, Heather Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Ondercin", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suzanna DeBoef\ufffd", "Susan Welch", "Lee Ann Banaszak", "Jennifer Mittelstadt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suzanna DeBoef\ufffd, Committee Chair", "Susan Welch, Committee Member", "Lee Ann Banaszak, Committee Member", "Jennifer Mittelstadt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["macropartisanship", "partisanship", "gender gap", "social definition of gender"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Selenocysteine-ligated Cytochrome P450 Intermediates", "id": "27424", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12079", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cytochrome P450s are thiolate-ligated heme enzymes that are capable of performing challenging C-H bond activation reactions. P450s are responsible for the metabolism of many pharmaceuticals as well as the biosynthesis of steroids and other biomolecules. The electron donating ability of the thiolate ligand is believed to be responsible for their ability to oxidize unactivated C-H bonds. This proposed role of the thiolate ligand was investigated using several axial ligand variants. Cysteine-containing axial ligand variants of histidine-ligated heme enzymes were successful in reproducing some spectroscopic features of P450s, but not their reactivity. Axial ligand variants of P450s where cysteine was replaced with histidine, methionine, and serine suffered from poor heme incorporation and misfolding as well as negligible levels of monooxygenase activity.\nInvestigations of axial ligand variants where cysteine was replaced with the more electron-donating selenocysteine indicated that these variants could still perform monooxygenase reactions. However, the intermediates directly involved, compound I and compound II, were not observed. We have produced a selenocysteine-ligated variant of the P450, CYP119, and successfully trapped a selenolate-ligated compound I species. While the UV-visible spectrum resembles the WT CYP119-I spectrum, a larger quadrupole splitting value and J/D ratio result in distinct M\u00f6ssbauer and EPR spectra. Analysis of the reaction with substrate suggests that SeCYP119-I may be more reactive than the compound I of the WT enzyme. \nThe selenolate-ligated P450 compound I species was further characterized using variable temperature M\u00f6ssbauer and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The dramatic increases in both zero field splitting and exchange coupling parameters obtained from the variable temperature M\u00f6ssbauer analyses are believed to result from the intrinsic properties of the ligating selenium. However, the greater increase in J relative to D suggests that the selenocysteine ligand may allow for greater spin delocalization onto the axial ligands in compound I. \nThe features of a selenolate-ligated P450 compound II were investigated using a selenocysteine-ligated variant of CYP158A2 (SeCYP158A2 C158S). M\u00f6ssbauer and EXAFS measurements confirmed that compound II of SeCYP158A2 C158S is a ferryl hydroxide. While a pH-dependent UV-visible transition was observed, Se K-edge XANES measurements indicate that at high pH the selenocysteine ligand becomes oxidized. \nPeroxynitrite (PN) has been controversial in its use to generate high-valent intermediates in heme proteins. The peroxynitrite-derived P450 compound I and compound II species are unusually unreactive compared to those generated using more conventional peroxides. Furthermore, M\u00f6ssbauer and UV-visible measurements have suggested that P450-PN is a nitrosyl complex. We have spectroscopically characterized P450-PN and P450-NO via M\u00f6ssbauer, resonance Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopies as well as UV-visible stopped flow spectrophotometry, confirming that the reaction of peroxynitrite with thiolate-ligated enzymes produces nitrosyl complexes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11499], "author_name_tesi": "Onderko, Elizabeth Lois", "last_name_ssi": "Onderko", "middle_name_ssi": "Lois", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Thomas Green", "Michael Thomas Green", "Carsten Krebs", "Squire J Booker", "Ming Tien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Thomas Green, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Thomas Green, Committee Chair", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cytochrome P450", "selenocysteine", "compound I", "compound II", "peroxynitrite"]}]
