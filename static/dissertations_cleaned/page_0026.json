The formulations were tested for the physical properties of mortars, Vicat Setting Time and Compressive Strengths. The experiments were carried out at varying temperatures in addition to varying proportions of the admixtures.\nThe results of the experimental runs were analyzed using the MINITAB program and a characteristic behavior pattern was developed over the range of admixture proportions for each formulation. The behavior pattern thus obtained was then used to predict the optimized proportions of the admixtures in each formulation using predefined criteria. The admixture formulations were down selected to two (one primary and one back up) based on the synergistic effects of the admixtures with each other.\nFinally a detailed study of the effect of IPANEX, one of the admixtures used in the study, on the yields and its interaction with other admixtures was conducted using MINITAB.

Ecological Light Pollution can affect reproduction, foraging, and behavior at varying degrees on a wide variety of taxa.  The United States has the highest level of light pollution in the world from human infrastructure accounting for a 7 billion dollar expense.  While many studies have shown artificial light can affect the environment, continued investigation of the population level and individual physiological effects of ELP are needed to guide conservation and management decisions in order to mitigate any negative effects.  \nThe three chapters presented here attempted to examine both the population effect on mice and the individual morphological and physiological effects of ELP on salamanders in Pennsylvania.  Chapter I was an observational study looking at the population effect of artificial light on white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) after long-term exposure.  Live traps were used to determine the abundance of individuals in each site to test if more or less individuals inhabited areas with artificial light.  Long-term exposure of artificial light did not significantly change the number of white-footed mice trapped.  Moon phase also had no effect on the number of mice captured.  The poor design and confounding variables, however, weakened the conclusions that could be drawn from this study.  \nChapter II focused on the morphological and physiological changes in salamanders caused by ELP.  Using a quasi-natural mesocosm design, eight transects were built to test if artificial light affects growth or if it causes stress in salamanders.  I found ELP caused no morphological or physiological change in northern dusky salamanders (Desmognathus fuscus).  Chapter III focused on macroinvertebrate abundance between light and dark transects.  Transects were constructed similar to Chapter II except for the addition of pitfall traps.  Trapped macroinvertebrates were dried, weighed and separated into salamander prey and non-prey categories.  Macroinvertebrate dry biomass was significantly higher in treatment transects with 24-hour exposure to artificial light.\nThe overall conclusions drawn from these research projects were that future research should modify study designs to answer questions as to the morphological, physiological and population effects of ELP.  Future studies should control for confounding variables, especially those surrounding light sources that are already present, ensure that the treatment is applied evenly across the study site and ensure lux and wavelength measurements of the light are recorded.  Measuring light in both lux and wavelengths will standardize ELP research so that comparisons across studies can be made.  Furthermore, having an additional measurement in wavelength is more biologically relevant because each wavelength can be perceived differently depending on the focal organism.  Future research should especially focus on testing different wavelengths of light to determine what wavelengths attract or deter species of interest.  Information like this can then be applied to outdoor lighting infrastructure in order to mitigate environmental changes associated with ELP.  Few programs are helping to alleviate the effects of ELP on species other than sea turtle hatchlings.  More research on the effects of ELP is ultimately needed so environmental programs can be designed and employed to mitigate any negative effects while protecting a wider variety of species from ELP.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7819], "author_name_tesi": "Dananay, Kacey Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Dananay", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Kacey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ecological Light Pollution", "Peromyscus leucopus", "Desmognathus fuscus", "artificial light", "anthropogenic pollution"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Initial Residual Formulation of CTF", "id": "25186", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11134", "abstract_tesi": "Nuclear engineering codes are being used to simulate more challenging problems and at higher fidelities than they were initially developed for. In order to expand the capabilities of these codes,state of the art numerical methods and computer science need to be implemented. One of the key players in this effort is the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL) and through development of the Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications (VERA). The sub-channel thermal hydraulic code used in VERA is CTF, which is a version of COBRA-TF (Coolant-Boiling in Rod Arrays - Three Fluids) partially developed at the Pennsylvania State University by the Reactor Dynamics and Fuel Management Research Group (RDFMG). Currently, CTF solves 8 conservation equations for liquid, entrained droplet, and vapor phases of water boiling within the rod structure of a LWR reactor core. The conservation equations analytically reduce into a pressure matrix and are solved using a semi-implicit method. The solid conduction equations are then implicitly solved to determine the temperature within the  fuel.\nSince the liquid solution is solved independent of the solid solution, the solid and liquid equations\nare explicitly coupled.\nIn an effort to help meet the objectives of CASL, a version of CTF has been developed that\nsolves the residual formulation of the 1D single-phase conservation equations. The formulation of\nthe base equations as residuals allows the code to be run semi-implicitly or fully implicitly while\nclearly defining the original conservation equations. This thesis outlines the work to integrate 1D\nsolid conduction equations into the residual formulation. This expands the solid liquid coupling\nto be either explicit or implicit. Different physical models, such as the homogeneous liquid solid\nenergy model, can be readily implemented by adding the residual functions and variables. A\nsimple test problem consisting of a single liquid channel and fuel pin was designed to compare the\noriginal version of CTF to the different numerical and physical models available through the new\nresidual formulation. The methods are compared both for steady state and transient conditions\nto quantify the accuracy and stability of each method. The input parameters are varied over a\nvariety of conditions to demonstrate when different methods are most appropriate.

How can we better understand the processes that underlie decision-making and choice behavior? This dissertation presents a novel hybrid cognitive architecture, ACT-R/\u03a6, which extends the ACT-R cognitive architecture with an integrative model of physiology and a model of affect and emotion. Extending a cognitive architecture with representations of affect and physiology allows the straightforward development of more illustrative computational process models of human behavior that explain experimental results from physiology, neuroscience, and psychology. Computational models were developed that provide an account of how physiological change due to psychological stress or homeostasis can modulate cognitive processes. An experiment was also run to explore how subliminal visual emotional stimuli affect physiology and decision-making behavior during the Iowa Gambling Task. Results indicate that effects of subliminal affective stimuli were dependent on participant sex and personality differences. A computational process model was developed that performs the same task and behaves similarly to the participants.\nPhysiological and affective states continually interact with cognitive processes, biasing memory and, consequently, decisions. Evolved adaptations that support physiological and affective change of behavior (e.g., natural reactions to thirst or hunger) affect the way we learn and make choices. The ACT-R/\u03a6 hybrid architecture, and the theoretical architectural models that define it, can be used to develop models of human behavior that include the necessary accounts of physiology and affect that describe what the body needs and how changes in behavior affects these needs.

The adaptive strategies used by rice farmers to adapt to climate change in the Mekong River Delta and the South Central Coast of Vietnam are categorized into two groups: engineering measures and non-engineering measures. The results from the multinomial logistic regression model employed show that the indicators of the five capital assets- farming experience of the household head, possession of at least one irrigation machine, land types, downstream location of the village, number of people providing financial loans to the household in case of emergency, in-kind support from organizations or agencies, population density of the village- all significantly influence farmers\u2019 adaptive choices. Given limited capital assets at both household and community levels, this study recommends what types of adaptive measures rice farmers can apply to reduce the impacts of droughts, saline intrusion and alluvial deposition.

Unfortunately, patients with HCC present with invasive/metastatic disease that is resistant to traditional cytotoxic treatment and are not eligible for curative therapy such as surgical resection or liver transplantation.  Increasing evidence indicates that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the origin of a subset of HCC.  Furthermore, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program has been demonstrated to generate cells with CSC characteristics. Resistance to therapy and metastatic disease are two factors that correlate a progenitor-phenotype in HCC with poor survival. The EMT program allows epithelial cells to migrate and intravasate into the blood stream and metastasize to distant organ sites. Accordingly, these disseminated cancer cells require self-renewal capability and other characteristics similar to those exhibited by stem cells in order to survive and promote tumor initiation. These observations lead to the hypothesis that the EMT program is responsible for generating stem-like cells that can spawn macroscopic metastases. Our central hypothesis is that cancer stem cells and the EMT program are linked through central regulators such as the TGF\uf062 and c-Met/HGF signaling axes, and that targeting these mechanisms will improve the design of novel therapeutics for advanced HCC. In murine epithelial HCC cells, TGF\uf062\uf020induced EMT through Snail1 is indicated by CSC characteristics including increased tumorsphere formation (self-renewal assay) and increased CSC-related genes including CD44, Nanog, and Bmi-1. We demonstrated that Snail1 induced a CSC phenotype through the regulation of the Nanog promoter and that the inhibition of Snail1 leads to the loss of the EMT and CSC phenotypes. In both CSC and EMT-like murine and human HCC cells, CD44 mRNA expression was high; thus we hypothesized that CD44 plays a central role in regulating the CSC and EMT phenotypes. CD44 undergoes alternative splicing, generating multiple splice variants, each with a different function. Recent evidence indicates that CD44s (CD44 standard form) regulates EMT. c-Met has been demonstrated to regulate CD44 splicing and c-Met+ HCC cells demonstrated a mesenchymal phenotype with CSC characteristics including increased CD44s expression and tumorsphere formation capability. To investigate the regulation of CD44s by c-Met, we inhibited c-Met signaling. The down regulation of c-Met decreased CD44s expression and decreased CSC and EMT phenotypes. Further analysis demonstrated that c-Met regulates CD44s through p-AKT and that subsequent loss of CD44s leads to decreased EMT and CSC characteristics in the human MHCC97-H cell line. To further document that c-Met regulates tumor initiation through CD44s, we knocked down CD44s in MHCC97-H cells. The down regulation of CD44s produced loss of both the EMT and CSC phenotype, minimal change in c-Met signaling. In vivo data demonstrates that CD44s is required for tumor initiation. Moreover, the overexpression of CD44s in Huh7 (CD44sneg/c-Metneg) increased tumorsphere formation, increased stemness genes including NANOG, BMI-1 and OCT4, and increased mesenchymal phenotypes including loss of E-cadherin and increased fibronectin expression. Our data suggest that the induction of tumor initiation is dependent on CD44s in c-Met+ HCC. We investigated whether there is a correlation between c-Met and CD44s expression in human clinical HCC tissues. In 101 HCC cases, 39% of HCC were c-Met+/CD44s+, supporting the hypothesis that there is a relationship between c-Met and CD44s. According to our data, more than 39% of HCC are c-Met+. c-Met is associated with a poor prognosis and has been demonstrated to be  resistant to chemotherapy, therefore targeting c-Met may prove beneficial for HCC patients with invasive/metastatic disease. We further investigated whether the inhibition of c-Met will inhibit tumor growth in vivo by using a selective c-Met inhibitor, PHA665752. Indeed, c-Met inhibition led to tumor stasis but was not enough to inhibit tumor growth completely. Further analysis demonstrated that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) /ERBB3 expression increased after c-Met inhibition and acted as a compensatory mechanism for tumor survival. To further test our hypothesis, we investigated whether combination therapy with PHA665752 and Gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor) could inhibit tumor growth. Interestingly, combination therapy was able to suppress tumor growth compared to c-Met or EGFR inhibition alone. In summary, this dissertation work demonstrates the importance of understanding EMT and its relation to CSCs. The link between the EMT and CSC programs play an important role in the resistance, tumor initiation and metastatic disease seen in HCC patients, and through targeting of key regulators of the EMT/CSC phenotype (i.e., c-Met), HCC progression may be significantly decreased.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7946], "author_name_tesi": "Dang, Hien T", "last_name_ssi": "Dang", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Hien", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kent Eugene Vrana", "Kent Eugene Vrana", "Bill Freeman", "Charles H Lang", "Harriet C Isom"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kent Eugene Vrana, Dissertation Advisor", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Chair", "Bill Freeman, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Harriet C Isom, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["liver cancer", "cancer stem cells", "epithelial to mesenchymal transition"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "AUTHOR NAME DISAMBIGUATION AND CROSS SOURCE DOCUMENT COREFERENCE\n\n\n", "id": "12638", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3627", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis deals with two research problems: author name disambiguation in digital library and cross-source document coreference.\n\nThe first problem comes from the digital library, which is an important technological tool to maintain the information used by users. However, due to the problem of ambiguous author names, users can not distinguish the exact authors of the articles in the digital library. This ambiguity mainly comes from two problems: polyseme, an author name shared by multiple authors, and synonym, an author with multiple name variant. Successfully addressing this ambiguous author name problem can improve the search quality of the digital library when one intends to search a specific author, which happens quite frequently in the digital library. In addition, when one attempts to compute statistics such as the reputation of an author based on his publications, disambiguating the author name enhances the accuracy. In this thesis, we present a comprehensive and synthetically summarization of the author name disambiguation algorithms. We also survey the evaluation datasets and metrics used in the papers. In addition, based on the survey, we suggest several possible directions and interesting ideas in the future.\n\nFor the cross-source document coreference problem, it is a new and important research direction. Cross-source document coreference deals with the problem of disambiguating the entities in documents of one source to their corresponding identities, if exists, in another source. For example, one source, which is called general source, can be World Wide Web and another source can be the Wikipedia, which is called canonical source. The success of cross-source document coreference can benefit many scenarios. We can automatically construct and enrich the entity information in one source according to its information in another source. Search results of entities in one source can also be grouped by their identities in the other sources. Furthermore, we can compute the reputation of one entity discussed in one source from the information of other sources. In this thesis, we utilize one information extraction tools, OpenCalais, and develop a large number of features, 88 features, to help cross-source document coreference. We also make use of a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, random forests, to this new area. In the experiment, we compare the random forests model with three traditional models: Decision Tree, Na\u00efve Bayes and Bayes Network. The experiment results demonstrate that random forests model significantly outperforms Na\u00efve Bayes and Bayes Network by 10.67% and 12.65%.

Within the translation process, the first stage of translation initiation is most rigorously modulated by the actions of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) and their associated proteins.  These 11 eIFs catalyze the joining of the tRNA, mRNA and rRNA into a functional translation complex.  Their activity is influenced by a wide variety of extra- and intracellular signals, ranging from global, such as hormone signaling and unfolded proteins, to specific, such as single amino acid imbalance and iron deficiency.  Their action is correspondingly comprehensive, in increasing or decreasing recruitment and translation of most cellular mRNAs, and specialized, in targeting translation of mRNAs with regulatory features such as a 5\u2019 terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP), upstream open reading frames (uORFs), or an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES).  In mammals, two major pathways are linked to targeted mRNA translation.  The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase induces translation of TOP and perhaps other subsets of mRNAs, whereas a family of eIF2 kinases does so with mRNAs containing uORFs or an IRES.  TOR targets translation of mRNAs that code for proteins involved in translation, an action compatible with its widely accepted role in regulating cellular growth.  The four members of the eIF2 kinase family increase translation of mRNAs coding for stress response proteins such as transcription factors and chaperones.  Though all four kinases act on one main substrate, eIF2, published literature demonstrates both common and unique effects by each kinase in response to its specific activating stress.  This suggests that the activated eIF2 kinases regulate the translation of both a global and a specific set of mRNAs.  Up to now, few studies have attempted to test such a hypothesis; none has been done in mammals.  Also unexplored is the interaction between stress-induced inhibition of translation initiation by the eIF2 kinases and its effect on TOR signaling.  This is particularly relevant given that both pathways are regulated by some of the same environmental signals, such as nutrient availability.  The work presented in this thesis addresses these two topics.  The resulting data demonstrate a dependency on translation initiation status for the regulation of downstream targets of TOR, and identify sets of mRNAs whose translation is commonly or uniquely regulated by two of the eIF2 kinases.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [307], "author_name_tesi": "Dang Do, An Ngoc ", "last_name_ssi": "Dang Do", "middle_name_ssi": "Ngoc ", "first_name_ssi": "An", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Scot R Kimball", "Ralph Lauren Keil", "Douglas Cavener", "Robert A Gabbay"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Committee Chair", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Robert A Gabbay, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["2", "cycloheximide", "4-di-tert-butylhydroquinone", "translation initiation", "translation elongation", "eIF2", "eIF2B", "4E-BP1", "GCN2", "p70S6K1", "PERK", "TOR", "methionine deprivation", "leucine deprivation", "polysome", "microarray", "QRT-PCR", "histidinol", "leucinol", "sucrose gradient", "atf4", "atf5", "slc3a2", "slc3a3", "trfr", "ldlr", "stch", "hspa5", "igfbp-2"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "MECHANISMS OF SHEAR-INDUCED ADAPTIVE RHEOLOGY IN ENDOTHELIAL CELLS \n\n", "id": "8342", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2698", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) constitute the endothelium which lines the entire cardiovascular system and is consequently exposed to mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear stress due to blood flow and cyclic stretch due to hydrostatic pressure fluctuations, and to chemical stimuli, such as growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and hormones. Vascular health and pathology is tied to the adaptation of cell mechanics through the regulation of cellular structures that sense and respond to mechanical forces.  While long term shear adaptation of endothelial cells has been studied extensively, little is know about the temporal changes in cell mechanics occurring on same time scale as hemodynamic forces. The interplay of force, dynamic cell mechanics, and biochemical signaling is the main focus of the studies summarized in this dissertation.  \nThe principal tools used to determine shear-induced temporal changes in cell mechanics were particle tracking microrheology, and analysis of creep functions. To implement these methods, a custom image-correlation based algorithm was designed in LabVIEW to measure nano-scale motions of cellular features and endocytosed beads. Time-lapse images were acquired using high-resolution differential interference contrast digital microscopy of confluent endothelial cells in a flow chamber.  These techniques were optimized for use on cells in flow chambers by extensive minimization of motion artifacts. In particular, photolithography was used to microfabricate fiduciary posts on glass coverslips. Position of microposts relative to thermally-induced motion of vesicles in cells was used to subtract low- and high-frequency microscope stage motion artifacts and to facilitate sub-pixel tracking from time-lapse images of adherent cells.\nThis study documents the first reported observations of rapid changes in cell mechanics in response to large temporal fluctuations in shear stress (i.e. step change).  Endothelial cells subjected to a step change in shear stress from 0 to 10 dynes/cm2 became significantly more compliant as early as 30 seconds after onset of shear stimulation. Viscoelastic parameters recovered within 4 minutes of shearing even though shear stress was maintained and no further rheological modulation was observed after cessation of shear stress. Using a phenomenological model of a viscoelastic liquid, overall macrorheological parameters were calculated and the time and length scales of viscoelastic deformation were found to be 3 sec and 50 nm, respectively. \nFurthermore, experiments were designed to explore the role of actomyosin interactions in the dynamic control of EC mechanics.  This study grew from knowledge that overall cellular mechanics is strongly dependent on actin and from recent in vitro (model polymer systems) and in vivo (dictyostelium cells and myoblasts) studies suggesting a triple role for myosin II in regulating cytoplasmic rheology through cellular prestress, actin crosslinking, and facilitated polymer diffusion. A novel observation from these studies is that actomyosin regulates macrorheology (i.e. viscoelastic deformation in response to shear stress), microrheology (i.e. constrained thermal motion of small beads) and cellular activation.  In fact, the observation of a shear-induced, actin-dependent contraction, the onset time of which depended on myosin II may point the way to a new understanding of the dynamic control of cell mechanics. Together, these studies provide new insight into how early mechanotransduction events may depend on dynamic modulation of mechanical properties and suggest that dynamic adaptive rheology may be one link between hemodynamic force and vascular disease. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2693], "author_name_tesi": "Dangaria, Jhanvi H.", "last_name_ssi": "Dangaria", "middle_name_ssi": "H.", "first_name_ssi": "Jhanvi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter J Butler", "Cheng Dong", "William O Hancock", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter J Butler, Committee Chair", "Cheng Dong, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mechanotransduction", "particle tracking", "viscoelasticity", "atherosclerosis", "cell mechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NATURE OF THE ELECTRICAL CONTACTS IN MOLECULAR ELECTRONIC DEVICE CONSTRUCTIONS", "id": "6692", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6111", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An overview of various molecular electronic device constructions that utilize self-assembly is given in chapter 1 with a more specific analysis of selected devices studied in later chapters.  The second chapter details the use of CPAFM to probe the nature of the evolving interface and metal morphology arising from Au vapor deposition onto the surface of a SAM.  The results show that the Au penetrates the ordered regions of the monolayer and forms a uniform layer at the thiol interface.  However, filaments form at defect sites in the monolayer due to a higher diffusion rate through the monolayer.  These results suggest that vapor deposition of Au is problematic for use in MEDs since no top contact is formed.  The third chapter details the used of various applied techniques to probe the nature of the evolving interface chemistry and metal morphology arising from Ti vapor deposition onto the surface of a SAM.  The results reveal a highly heterogeneous Ti overlayer forms, in which a large fraction of atoms do not stick to the bare SAM surface while the adsorbed atoms lead to a highly heterogeneous film.  The data indicate that for applications such as molecular device contacts the use of Ti may be highly problematic.  The fourth chapter inspects the growth of multilayer molecular films used as molecular resists.  The actual performance of such a resist is dependent on the exact way that the multilayer stacks organize during the assembly, yet little is definitively known about the details.

Cohabitation represents an increasingly prevalent family form and prior research endeavors examine the position of cohabitation.  Past research suggests examining the fertility behavior of cohabitors, such as fertility rates and reports of birth intentions, as one avenue for understanding the role of cohabitation.  Researchers argue that greater acceptance of childbearing within cohabiting unions suggests more similarity to marriage than singlehood.   In addition, existing studies in this area argue that cohabitation may not play the same role for individuals from different racial/ethnic backgrounds.  \nThis study looks at sexual frequency, contraceptive use, and current fertility intentions to investigate variation in the role of cohabitation for White, Black, and Mexican American men and women.  Examining sexual frequency and contraceptive use sheds light on the potential factors behind documented race/ethnic differences in fertility rates among cohabitors.  Looking at current fertility intentions uncovers variation in views on the acceptability of childbearing within cohabitation.  Variation in attitudes associated with the second demographic transition is also examined in relation to differences in the role of cohabitation.\nThe results reveal that variation in sexual frequency is not a factor in fertility differences across race/ethnic groups among cohabitors. However, contraceptive use patterns differ across race/ethnic groups among cohabitors.  Cohabiting Black men and women are more likely than Whites to report not using any method of contraception.  In addition, cohabiting Black women also report greater use of less effective methods compared to more effective methods of contraception relative to Whites.  Cohabiting Black and Mexican American women are substantially more likely to report that they are not using contraception and seeking a pregnancy compared to cohabiting White women.  This suggests greater acceptance of childbearing within cohabiting unions among non-White women and variation in the role of cohabitation across race/ethnic groups.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3299], "author_name_tesi": "Daniels, Kimberly ", "last_name_ssi": "Daniels", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nancy S Landale", "Robert Schoen", "Valarie Elizabeth King", "Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nancy S Landale, Committee Chair", "Robert Schoen, Committee Member", "Valarie Elizabeth King, Committee Member", "Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cohabitation", "non-marital fertility", "race/ethnicity"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "PARENTING AS ADAPTATION: CHANGES IN MATERNAL STRUCTURING ACROSS EARLY CHILDHOOD\n", "id": "11998", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3971", "abstract_tesi": "It has been proposed that competent parenting requires adaptation to children as they grow and develop (Teti & Huang, 2005).

Maternal structuring behavior was examined longitudinally to determine patterns of growth in terms of its frequency, the targets of the structuring attempts, and the strategies used to structure.  To examine maternal structuring changes as a form of adaptation, 119 mothers were observed interacting with their children during a wordless reading task at child age 18, 24, and 36 months.  Alternative hypotheses about the direction of change in maternal structuring were tested using multi-level modeling; also hypotheses about changes in the different child skills that mothers targeted, and in the strategies mothers used to structure, were tested. Contrary to prediction, mothers structured at a high and stable rate over time, but as expected they showed significant patterns of change in their targeting of several child skills and structuring strategies.  The most notable changes were an increase in mothers\u2019 targeting of child attention redirection and a decrease in their use of physical movement to structure child self-regulation.

The Broaden and Build Model of Positive Emotion suggests that positive affect (PA) should facilitate resource identification and promote positive resource appraisals (Fredrickson, 1998, 2001).  The Affect Infusion Model (Forgas, 1995) indicates that affective influences should be particularly strong when people engage in effortful processing. Finally, the coping literature suggests that men might have to engage in more effortful processing than women, because men may have less general coping knowledge (e.g., Tamres et al., 2002). Together, these literatures led me to hypothesize that men would engage in more effortful processing than women when thinking about their resources, and thus be more influenced by affect, particularly PA. In contrast, women would directly retrieve resources and evaluations of resources, and thus not be influenced by affect. Data from two experiments indicated that gender alters how affect influences resource identification and appraisals, though not specifically as predicted. As predicted, men used effortful processing to appraise their resources and were influenced by PA. However, in contrast to predictions, men used a direct access strategy to list their resources and were not influenced by affect. For women, in contrast to predictions, their knowledge did not result in the use of direct access, but rather led to the use of heuristic processing for both listing and appraisals.  Further, both PA and negative affect (NA) altered their judgments, though NA was especially influential. Thus, both PA and NA influenced women, whereas PA alone influenced men.  This research indicates that cultivating feelings of PA and increasing coping skill should help people appraise their resources more positively. Further, this research is a first step in elucidating the complex relationship between coping knowledge and the use of affect during resource identification and appraisal.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1024], "author_name_tesi": "Danube, Cinnamon Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Danube", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Cinnamon", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Gasper", "Karen Gasper"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Gasper, Thesis Advisor", "Karen Gasper, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["mood", "coping resources", "gender differences", "affect", "processing strategies"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "ASSESSING WOMEN'S ENDORSEMENT OF CONFLICTING MESSAGES ABOUT SEXUALITY: DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEXUAL AMBIVALENCE QUESTIONNAIRE (SAQ)\n\n\n", "id": "12133", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13229", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I argue that the American culture provides women with mixed and conflicting messages about sexual expression and will demonstrate that these messages can create conflict in some women that contributes to unhealthy sexual attitudes and behaviors. I focus on two messages. First, women learn to hide their sexual feelings so as to conform to traditional standards of femininity and morally virtuous behavior (Tolman, 2002) and to be disproportionately concerned about the possible dangers of sexual expression (Fine, 1988; Vance, 1984). I label these Suppress messages because they teach women to suppress sexual feelings and \u00c2\u00a8Djust say no\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00ac to sexual expression. Conversely, women learn the importance of proving their desirability by performing their sexuality so as to appear sexually attractive and desiring of sexual attention from men (Douglas, 2010; Levy, 2005; Tolman, 2002), irrespective of their own desires (Tolman, 2002). I label this a Perform message because it encourages women to engage in sexual performance so as to always \u00c2\u00a8Dappear sexually available.\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00ac Suppress and Perform messages are both problematic. However, I go farther to argue that they are particularly problematic because they are contradictory. They pit the idea that sexual expression should be hidden and is dangerous against messages that sexual expression should be performed and displayed. Simultaneous endorsement of Perform and Suppress messages might create a state of conflict in some women, sexual ambivalence (SA), with regards to how to negotiate sexual expression. In this research, I describe the creation (Study 1 and 2) and validation (Study 3 and 4) of a measure that assesses women\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00aes endorsement of these messages, the Sexual Ambivalence Questionnaire (SAQ), such that predictions can be tested. I use the SAQ to demonstrate that endorsement of either Perform or Suppress messages alone, or endorsement of both simultaneously (SA), can lead to negative consequences for women\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00aes attitudes, beliefs, and decision-making.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12776], "author_name_tesi": "Danube, Cinnamon Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Danube", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Cinnamon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Gasper", "Janet K.

Actigraphy was used over seven consecutive nights to estimate nightly sleep duration. The seven-night mean and standard deviation of sleep duration were used to represent HSD and HSV, respectively. Insomnia complaint INS was also assessed in this study. The Youth/Adolescent Questionnaire (YAQ) was used to evaluate the participants\u2019 daily nutrition and food intake behavior. Frequency of consumption of 152 food items were measured and then converted into a series of nutrient indices which was then converted to the amount of different nutrients consumed. 5 micronutrients were assessed: Calcium, Copper, Iron, Magnesium and Zinc. Linear regression models were used to study the association between habitual sleep patterns and micronutrient intake and whether these associations vary between gender and race, whereas logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between insomnia complaint and micronutrient intake.\nResults: After adjusting for age, race, sex, body mass index (BMI) and caloric intake, a decreased HSD was associated with an increase intake of Copper. For example, for every 1 unit increase in log (Cu), there is a 7.28 minutes decrease in HSD. The association between each of calcium, iron and magnesium and the sleep variability was race dependent. For example, among white people, sleep variability was decreased by almost 6 minutes, as compared to 3 minutes increase among non-white for 1 unit log increase in calcium intake, decreased by 4 minutes among white and increased by 4 minutes among non-white for every 1 log unit increase in iron, and decreased by 6 minutes in white as opposed to 5 minutes increase in non-white for every 1 log unit increase in Magnesium. Sex differences had no effect on the associations between habitual sleep patterns and micronutrient intake. No relationships between micronutrient intake and either of insomnia complaint and sleep variability were observed.\nConclusion: Race modifies the associations between micronutrient intake and habitual sleep variability.

Mistresses from John Donne\u2019s reticent lover in \u201cTo His Mistress Going to Bed\u201d to Andrew Marvell\u2019s blushing paramour in \u201cTo His Coy Mistress\u201d model a feminine coyness of inaccessibility, enticement, and manipulation that has long been accepted in studies of Renaissance literature. Participating in a long-standing interest in such depictions of flirtatious but resistant women, my project challenges the limiting assumption that such figures were the only version of coyness that early modern writers employed in their writing. Taking advantage of the increasingly searchability of databases like Early English Books Online (EEBO, I demonstrate that the uses of the word coy diverged sharply from the narrowness of the coy mistress to encompass everything from the alluring and enticing seduction of a wooer to the modesty and chasteness of a virgin to the reticent pride of a sinner to the soothing and coaxing mannerisms of falconers towards their falcons. \n\tRenaissance writers, I argue, conceived of the conception coyness more broadly as a term that marked a deliberate, sometimes gendered performance of reticence, enticement, or engagement. This wider concept of the term made it useful in a variety of contexts\u2014sermons, husbandry manuals, translations, speeches, and letters, in addition to literary works. Also, my study illustrates that early modern writers did not sequester meanings of the word in one discourse or another. Rather, they borrowed freely between disparate meanings to enhance the complexity of their depictions of social interactions and gender dynamics. Such an extensive reconsideration of the meaning of coyness fosters a fuller appreciation of its importance in certain veins of early modern literature, as the remainder of my dissertation shows.\nNot only does this exploration broaden our appreciation of the range of the concept of coyness for the speakers of early modern English, it also exposes how patterns of usage in everyday discourse influenced the appearance of gender and authorship in early modern literary texts. In Chapter 3, I look at how Shakespeare redeploys the term\u2019s function in hawking manuals to enliven his exploration of wooing practices in The Taming of the Shrew. In Chapter 4, I reexamine the concept of coy virginity in John Milton\u2019s A Maske at Ludlow Castle and Thomas Middleton\u2019s Revenger\u2019s Tragedy, where female characters repurpose the simple moral scripts of female behavior to create more dynamic and agential depictions of virginal characters. In Chapter 5, I contend that lyric collections assembled by poetry enthusiasts preserve some of the richest repositories of the diversity of coyness, found especially in the productiveness of female-voiced responses and lyrics by women writers. Finally, I investigate how Margaret Cavendish, to evade conventional restraints on women writing, bridled the potential of coyness as a literary tool for women writers especially. \nIn the end, my study returns us to the idea of female coyness, but that idea is changed. Throughout their diverse portrayals of coyness, I conclude, Renaissance authors confronted the limits of women\u2019s and men\u2019s roles, but coyness\u2019 multiplying references and contradictions inspired women writers in particular to discard old narratives of composition and re-script new ones. Ultimately, such writers embrace a greater creative vision for the functions of coyness in early modern English, as should scholars. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11422], "author_name_tesi": "Darby Fung, Megan Jean", "last_name_ssi": "Darby Fung", "middle_name_ssi": "Jean", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marcy Lynne North", "Patrick G Cheney", "Garrett Sullivan Jr.", "Laura Lunger Knoppers", "Sherry Lynnette Roush"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marcy Lynne North, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick G Cheney, Committee Member", "Garrett Sullivan Jr., Committee Member", "Laura Lunger Knoppers, Special Member", "Sherry Lynnette Roush, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["coyness", "gender", "genre", "women's writing", "Renaissance"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Porticus of Eumachia in the Forum of Pompeii", "id": "28786", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12519", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Porticus of Eumachia is one of the largest, most important and\nyet misunderstood public buildings of the Forum of Pompeii.

The first relates to the impact of wet storage on biomass quality, biofuel yield, and biorefinery system performance. The second relates to the impact of wet storage system on supply chain management and logistics. These impacts have not been well addressed in prior wet storage studies, and several logistic models have overlooked the wet storage option entirely. Feedstock suppliers and feedstock buyers, therefore, have no prior expectation of how wet storage outcomes compares with conventional dry storage, hence making the adoption of this storage option a high risk venture.\n\nOne of the ways in which wet storage is anticipated to affect downstream processes, especially biological processes like fermentation, is through the organic acids produced during storage. These organic acids have the potential to alter the feedstock structure and provide partial pretreatment, but can also inhibit subsequent biofuel fermentation. Pretreatment is necessary for lignocellulosic feedstocks since it allows plant cell wall degrading enzymes to have access to structural sugars (cellulose and hemicelluloses) and convert them to glucose and other simple sugars that can be fermented to ethanol. Inhibition results in reduced specific biofuel productivity (the amount of biofuel produced from the feedstock within a given time), when using biological route of conversion. The contradictory functionality of organic acids generated during wet storage made the impact of organic acids a major focus of this study.\n\nTo address these concerns, a series of experiments were performed to characterize the impact of a wet storage system on biofuel production and elucidate how this storage option compares with conversional dry storage systems. The most familiar wet storage process applicable to biofuel production is ensilage, which has been practiced for centuries in the animal feed industry. The feedstock is stored under anaerobic conditions, typically at moisture contents of 55 - 75% wet basis (w.b.), and these conditions result in the production of organic acids by natural acidogenic microorganisms. In this study, moisture levels outside these conventional ensilage levels were investigated in order to define the full range of suitable levels for the storage of industrial biomass destined for cellulosic biofuels. The feedstock used in this wet storage study was corn stover, which is an agricultural residue and includes the above ground biomass after corn grain is harvested. Corn stover at seven different moisture contents (15-75%) was incubated under anaerobic and aerobic conditions at two temperature levels (23oC and 37oC)  for 0, 21, 90 and 220 days. \n\nThe impact of wet storage was evaluated through its effect on dry matter loss; feedstock composition; reactivity of corn stover fibers, after wet storage, to enzymes; and production of ethanol, which was used as a model fuel. The impact of organic acids was examined specifically through their effect on fiber reactivity; their interaction with subsequent liquid hot water pretreatment process; and interference with ethanol fermentation, when Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used as the fermenting microbe. A process cost model was developed, using results from this study, to explore the cost implications of wet storage and effect on ethanol production. \n\nResults from this study show that the most influential factor with respect to change in feedstock composition during anaerobic wet storage is storage duration. Generally, there were no significant differences in feedstock composition and in feedstock response to subsequent downstream processes when corn stover was stored at moisture levels of 35% to 65%. Although maximum dry matter loss observed under anaerobic storage was approximately 9%, the average loss at 220-day storage period was less than 3%. Total organic acid content after wet storage was up to 9.1%. Hemicellulose degradation during wet storage, which is an indication of the pretreatment capability of organic acids, ranged from ~6% to ~30%. \n\nSome key findings from this study are: (1) the extent of organic acid pretreatment during storage was not adequate to serve as sole pretreatment, implying post storage pretreatment would still be necessary; (2) the organic acid profile that develops during storage is considerably changed during subsequent pretreatment. The amounts and types of acid after pretreatment depends on whether feedstock was dried after storage, washed before pretreatment, or used \u201cas is\u201d, that is without any processing before pretreatment; (3) acetic acid amounts greater than 6% g/g dry basis can inhibit ethanol fermentation if butyric acid is also present. But these high concentrations are observed only in 75% moisture feedstock; (4) if samples stored at 75% are excluded, the organic acids produced during wet storage had no inhibitory effect on ethanol fermentation and in fact enhanced the yield by a mean factor of ~1.11; (5) modeling output showed that at moisture levels \u2264 35%, the minimum delivery cost of wet storage feedstock was lower than cost of dry storage at 25% moisture. (6) A well preserved dry biomass storage system is likely less expensive than high moisture (\u2265 45%) wet storage systems in terms of feedstock delivery cost.  Considering findings 5) and 6), the optimum wet storage system for biomass is likely to be approximately 35 - 40% moisture, which is lower than for animal feed.  This lower optimum is primarily driven by transportation costs of the additional water at higher moisture levels, and will vary with the distance biomass needs to move to a biorefinery.\n\nThis study is useful in providing feedstock suppliers and feedstock buyers with a good understanding of wet storage systems and their impact on feedstock composition, feedstock logistics and downstream processing outcomes. Several major concerns about the appropriateness of wet storage systems for the biofuel industry have been addressed. The information and model from this study provides a basis for comparison of wet storage and conventional dry storage systems and will facilitate the cost effective adoption of wet storage for biofuel production where appropriate. In addition, the results from this study can be used in developing quality indices to facilitate fair trade between feedstock suppliers and buyers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2415], "author_name_tesi": "Darku, Irene Dzidzor", "last_name_ssi": "Darku", "middle_name_ssi": "Dzidzor", "first_name_ssi": "Irene", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Lehman Richard", "Thomas Lehman Richard", "Jude Liu", "Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Lehman Richard, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Lehman Richard, Committee Chair", "Jude Liu, Committee Member", "Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Member", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Biomass", "Wet storage", "Ensilage", "Biofuel", "Logistics", "Ethanol", "Fiber reactivity", "Pretreatment", "Corn stover", "Biofuel", "Delivery cost"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "SEXUAL SELECTION IN THE SPOTTED CUCUMBER BEETLE, DIABROTICA UNDECIMPUNCTATA HOWARDI  (COLEOPTERA: CHRYSOMELIDAE):  \nMALE TRAITS FAVORED BY CRYPTIC FEMALE CHOICE.\n", "id": "7468", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4007", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nIn the spotted cucumber beetle Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi  (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), the female determines the final outcome of mating; internal muscle control allows her the capability of blocking the transfer of sperm from the male.

Our primary focus is to develop\nreliable structures for MANETs and energy-efficient implementations for WMNs.\n\nWe study a MANET setting where each node in the MANET engages in deliberate and discreet\npacket-dropping at a certain rate, while relaying on behalf of other nodes. Assuming the nodes\nto be non-cooperative, we develop a scheme in which each source node would blame its nearest\nneighbor for any packet dropped along the multi-hop path vector. This is simple, but elegant, as\nit still reveals the true relative dropping rates of each packet-dropping node in the MANET.\n\nWe then propose a novel scheme for improving the overall performance or robustness of such a\nMANET by adopting a routing strategy which considers the recent packet-dropping performance\n(reputation) of intermediate relaying nodes in determining the best route from a source to a destination.\n\nFor deciding the best route, we propose the use of mechanisms based on the modification of the\nAd Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol. As opposed to the AODV scheme,\nwhich uses a broadcast mechanism for route discovery, the proposed scheme (called Robust AODV\nor RAODV) considers the reputation levels of neighboring nodes to determine the node(s) to which\nthe route discovery packet should be sent.\n\nIn connection with WMNs, we study a WMN structure deployed for residential broadband Internet access and WMN applications for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).\n\nOur WMN model deployed for residential broadband Internet access has a specific topology of\nthree tiers comprising WMN infrastructure nodes or Mesh Access Points (MAPs), fixed, in-range\nend-users or end-user Stations (STAs), and potentially mobile, out-of-range end-users or Mobile-STAs (M-STAs). Our interest is only at the edge as our primary focus is the range extension of the WMN to M-STAs via the relaying services of STAs. We develop an iterative game model in which\nthe relaying STAs engage in deliberate packet-dropping of M-STA packets for their own throughput\ngain.\n\nWe next extend the model to include the scenario in which the MAP and the STAs are network\nservice providers in respectively a primary and a secondary market. The STAs do not engage in\ndeliberate packet-dropping, since they are now wholly responsible for providing traffic to the M-\nSTAs, and as a result will lose revenue. Obviously, the second model is better for mobile end-users\n(M-STAs) as they receive better service since STAs do not drop packets in this scenario for their\nown selfish reasons.\n\nWe then investigate WMNs used in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), which is a form\nof WSN. These WMNs usually consist of a collection of Neighborhood Area Networks (NANs),\nwhich include smart, wireless-enabled meters or sensor nodes.\n\nWe present an elegant approach to reducing the cost of the AMIs by increasing the ratio of the\nnumber of sensors/meters in Neighborhood Area Networks (NANs) to the number of Access Points\n(APs) or gateways.\n\nFinally, we propose schemes for energy conservation in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks\n(IWSNs), which are variants of WMNs. Our contribution integrates new approaches to partitioning an IWSN into energy-efficient clusters with a graph-theoretical framework for energy-efficient routing within a cluster. The concept of betweenness centrality is demonstrated to be a useful metric to optimize the placement of the cluster head within an IWSN cluster in our clustering approach.\n\nIn addition, our strategy combines a novel scheme for duty cycling of the nodes in a cluster to\nfurther minimize energy expenditure in an IWSN. Betweenness centrality is also used as a metric\nfor developing a duty-cycling approach to further minimize the energy consumption in an IWSN.\n\nMost of the previous contributions have dealt with only one particular approach to minimizing\nenergy consumption in an IWSN.

The main focus of the study was to track the change in cell behavior and response live, as the cell was generating power. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was the most important linear AC technique used for the study. \n     The distinct effects of inorganic components usually present in hydrocarbon fuel reformates on SOFC behavior have been determined, allowing identification of possible \"fingerprint\" impedance behavior corresponding to specific fuel conditions and reaction mechanisms. Critical electrochemical processes and degradation mechanisms which might affect cell performance were identified and quantified. Sulfur and siloxane cause the most prominent degradation and the associated electrochemical cell parameters such as Gerisher and Warburg elements are applied respectively for better understanding of the degradation processes. \n     Electrochemical Frequency Modulation (EFM) was applied for kinetic studies in SOFCs for the very first time for estimating the exchange current density and transfer coefficients. EFM is a non-linear in-situ electrochemical technique conceptually different from EIS and is used extensively in corrosion work, but rarely used on fuel cells till now. EFM is based on exploring information obtained from non-linear higher harmonic contributions from potential perturbations of electrochemical systems, otherwise not obtained by EIS. The baseline fuel used was 3 % humidified hydrogen with a 5-cell SOFC sub-commercial planar stack to perform the analysis. Traditional methods such as EIS and Tafel analysis were carried out at similar operating conditions to verify and correlate with the EFM data and ensure the validity of the obtained information. The obtained values closely range from around 11 mA cm-2 - 16 mA cm-2 with reasonable repeatability and excellent accuracy. The potential advantages of EFM compared to traditional methods were realized and our primary aim at demonstrating this technique on a SOFC system are presented which can act as a starting point for future research efforts in this area. \n     Finally, an approach based on in-situ State of Health tests by EIS was formulated and investigated to understand the most efficient fuel conditions for suitable long term operation of a solid oxide fuel cell stack under power generation conditions. The procedure helped to reflect the individual effects of three most important fuel characteristics CO/H2 volumetric ratio, S/C ratio and fuel utilization under the presence of a simulated alternative fuel at 0.4 A cm-2. Variation tests helped to identify corresponding electrochemical/chemical processes, narrow down the most optimum operating regimes considering practical behavior of simulated reformer-SOFC system arrangements. At the end, 8 different combinations of the optimized parameters were tested long term with the stack, and the most efficient blend was determined.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10529], "author_name_tesi": "Das, Debanjan ", "last_name_ssi": "Das", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Debanjan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Serguei Lvov", "Serguei Lvov", "Derek Elsworth", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Serguei Lvov, Dissertation Advisor", "Serguei Lvov, Committee Chair", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Solid Oxide Fuel Cell", "Impedance Spectroscopy", "Electrohcemical Degradation", "Electrochemical Frequency Modulation", "Kinetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Essays in Strategic Experimentation and Bargaining", "id": "18143", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8764", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of Four Chapters:\n\nChapter  1 analyses a situation where competing agents involved in making the same discovery have alternative  research avenues to pursue.  Agents are uncertain about the quality of the available research methods. They learn about a particular method in light of their search experiences. One can relate this to R&D activities in the pharmaceutical industry, electronics industry etc. This scenario is modeled  as a Two-armed Bandit problem. We consider two alternative settings. One has two risky arms which are perfectly negatively correlated and the other one has one safe arm and one risky arm. I show that with a winner-takes all structure and heterogeneity among agents with respect to their innate abilities, there is always an excessive amount of experimentation  along one of the lines of research. This phenomenon is called Duplication which implies that there is too much specialisation along a line of research when efficiency would require more diversification.\n\n\nChapter 2 explores the scenario where competing agents trying  to make the same discovery have alternate methods of research to choose from and agents may be privately informed about the quality of a method. The model is an extension of the second setting with symmetric firms, where each firm may experience private arrival of information along the good risky avenue. I show that there is a symmetric non-cooperative equilibrium in which there is excessive amount of experimentation along the risky avenue if the prior is high enough and too little  otherwise.\n\nChapter 3 (co-authored with Kalyan Chatterjee) analyses a model of price formation in a market with a finite number of non-identical agents engaging in decentralised bilateral interactions. We focus mainly on equal numbers of buyers and sellers, though we discuss other cases. All characteristics of agents are assumed to be common knowledge. Buyers simultaneously make targeted offers, which sellers can accept or reject. \nAcceptance leads to a pair exiting and rejection leads to the next period. Offers can be public, private or \u201cex ante public\u201d (as in directed search models, which are, however, mostly one-period in the preceding literature).  As the discount factor goes to 1, the price in all transactions converges to the same value.\n\n\nChapter  4 (co-authored with Kalyan Chatterjee)  studies study a model of decentralised bilateral interactions in a small market where one of the sellers has private information about her value. There are two identical buyers and another seller, whose valuation is commonly known to be in between the two possible valuations of the informed seller. We consider two infinite horizon games, with  public and private simultaneous \none-sided offers respectively and simultaneous responses.

The plasma jet is initiated by exploding a thin metallic trigger wire (~3.6mg) through a high-voltage electrical pulse. The exploding wire ablates the hydrocarbon capillary, forms a high-temperature, high-pressure electrothermal-chemical (ETC) plasma that emerges in the open-air environment as an underexpanded, supersonic jet. The ETC plasma jet is allowed to impinge over a stagnation plate that holds a variety of diagnostic tools as well as the propellant samples.\nThe overall objective of this research is to augment the present understanding of the thermophysical and chemical processes involved in the ETC ignition of solid propellants. The particular focus is to deduce the transient variation in radiative heat flux, stagnation pressure, electrical parameters, and plasma jet structure with different capillary and trigger-wire materials, plasma energy levels, and plasma exit port to stagnation plate distance. The effects of trigger-wire mass and capillary diameter are also examined. To understand the role of radiation during ETC ignition, double-base JA2 propellants are exposed to ETC plasma radiation. A variety of measurements are conducted to analyze the gas-phase products generated during the radiative pyrolysis of JA2. These include measurement of transient variation in gas-phase temperature and pressure, identification of gas-phase species, and estimation of species relative mole fractions. To further elucidate the radiative pyrolysis studies of JA2, confined rapid thermolysis of JA2 propellants are also conducted.\n A considerable effort is employed to develop thin-film platinum heat flux gages, electrical circuitry, and the corresponding inverse data reduction techniques to estimate the transient radiant heat flux from ETC plasma. A high-speed CCD camera captures the side-view images of the plasma jet. Photodiodes, placed below the plasma jet, identifies the plasma emergence from the exit port and the plasma impingement on the stagnation plate. K-type thermocouples (12&#956;m diameter) are used to measure the gas-phase temperature during radiative pyrolysis of JA2.\nResults suggest that the instantaneous value of the transient absorbed radiant heat flux is quite high (~103 MW/m2), and that the contribution from the UV wavelength region dominates over the visible and IR regions. It is also observed that the radiant flux is material dependent, and that for a given electrical energy level and pulse duration, higher ablation typically leads to lower radiant flux as well as higher stagnation pressure. Radiative pyrolysis of JA2 within a constant-volume chamber suggests that, for moderate plasma energy levels, radiative heating alone may produce a high temperature and pressure of the products evolved into the gas-phase region, but cannot ignite the propellant. Additionally, species produced during radiative pyrolysis of JA2 are found to be different from that generated during standard thermolysis experiments, but that may be expected due to differences in temperatures and pressures in the two experiments. It is possible that the UV radiation from the ETC plasma photolyzes the oxidizers (such as NO2), and thus reduces the chemical activity of decomposition products, prohibiting ignition of JA2.\n\n \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4185], "author_name_tesi": "Das, Malay Kumar", "last_name_ssi": "Das", "middle_name_ssi": "Kumar", "first_name_ssi": "Malay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stefan Thynell", "Thomas Litzinger", "V Yang", "Michael Matthew Micci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stefan Thynell, Committee Chair", "Thomas Litzinger, Committee Member", "V Yang, Committee Member", "Michael Matthew Micci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Solid-propellant", "Electrothermal-chemical plasma", "Plasma ignition"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Application-Aware On-Chip Networks", "id": "10863", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5342", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multi-hop packet-based Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures are widely viewed as the de facto solution for integrating the nodes in many-core architecture for their scalability and well-controlled and highly predictable electrical properties. The Network-on-Chip (NoC) has become an important research focus in recent years because the network plays a critical role in determining the performance and power behavior of a many-core architectures. Most of the innovative solutions proposed  for NoC research problems focus on independently optimizing the NoC without exploiting characteristics of applications or software stack. This thesis offers a unique perspective of designing high-performance, scalable and energy efficient NoC's by utilizing application characteristics. In this thesis, I show that we can design much superior on-chip networks if we understand application behavior and customize on-chip networks for them. I propose application-aware approaches for packet scheduling in on-chip networks, application communication locality aware hierarchical topologies for NoCs, and data compression techniques which exploit value locality inherent in application data traffic.\n\nThe first contribution of this thesis is to devise application-aware packet scheduling policies for NoCs. The NoCs are likely to become a critical shared resource in future many-core processors. The challenge is to develop policies and mechanisms that enable multiple applications to efficiently and fairly share the network, to improve system performance. A key component of a router that can influence application-level performance and fairness is the arbitration/scheduling unit. Existing polices for arbitration and packet scheduling in NoCs are local and application oblivious. However, we observe that different application characteristics can lead to differential criticality of packets: some packets will be more important to processor execution time than other packets. This novel insight enables us to design packet scheduling polices to provide high performance in on-chip networks.\n\nFirst, I propose a coordinated application-aware prioritization substrate. The idea is to divide processor execution time into phases, rank applications based on the criticality of network on each application\u2019s performance (or based on system-level application priorities) within a phase, and have all routers in the network prioritize packets based on their applications\u2019 ranks in a coordinated fashion. Our scheme includes techniques that ensure starvation freedom and enable the enforcement of system-level application priorities, resulting in a configurable substrate that enables application-aware prioritization in on-chip networks.\n\nNext, I propose a new architecture Aergia, to exploit slack in packet latency. In this thesis, we define slack as a key measure that characterizes the relative importance of a packet. Specifically, the slack of a packet is the number of cycles the packet can be delayed in the network with no effect on execution time. We propose new router prioritization policies that exploit the available slack of interfering packets in order to accelerate performance-critical packets and thus improve overall system performance. When two packets interfere with each other in a router, the packet with the lower slack value is prioritized. I describe mechanisms to estimate slack, prevent starvation, and combine slack-based prioritization with the  application-aware prioritization mechanisms proposed above.\n\nThe second contribution of this thesis is application-aware hierarchical topologies. This proposal leverages the insight that applications mapped on a large CMP system will benefit from clustered communication, where data is placed in cache banks closer to the cores accessing it. Thus, we design a hierarchical network topology that takes advantage of such communication locality. The two-tier hierarchical topology consists of local networks that are connected via a global network. The local network is a simple, high-bandwidth, low-power shared bus fabric, and the global network is a low-radix mesh. Since most communication in CMP applications can be limited to the local network, using a fast, low-power bus to handle local communication will improve both network latency and power-efficiency.\n\nThe final contribution of this thesis is data compression techniques for on-chip networks. In this context, we examine two different configurations that explore combinations of storage and communication compression: (1) Cache Compression (CC) and (2) Compression in the NIC (NC). We also address techniques to hide the decompression latency by overlapping it with communication latency. We comprehensively characterize and quantify in detail the effect of data compression on NoCs. The attractive benefits seen from our evaluations make a strong case for utilizing compression for optimizing the performance and power envelope of NoC architectures. I also take advantage of  compressibility of application data traffic to improve the throughput via novel router microarchitecture, called XShare. The XShare architecture utilizes data value locality and bimodal traffic characteristics of CMP applications to transfer multiple small flits over a single channel.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5337], "author_name_tesi": "Das, Reetuparna ", "last_name_ssi": "Das", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Reetuparna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das", "Chitaranjan Das", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Yuan Xie", "Ravishankar Iyer", "Onur Mutlu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das, Dissertation Advisor", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Chair", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Yuan Xie, Committee Member", "Ravishankar Iyer, Committee Member", "Onur Mutlu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["On-chip networks", "multi-core", "arbitration", "prioritization", "memory systems", "packet scheduling", "slack", "criticality", "topology", "compression", "hierarchical"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPING STATE-DEPENDENT ROUTES FOR THE VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEM UNDER UNCERTAINTY", "id": "6316", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5639", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation extends the study of an extensively studied problem in logistics, the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). We first model the variant of this problem that incorporates uncertain customer demands (VRPSD), in a single-vehicle environment, as a Markov Decision Problem (MDP). The advantage of using such a model\nlies in its ability to incorporate unfolding information---in this case the customer demand, revealed upon visiting the customer---as it is obtained; a focus of our research is utilization of such information. While MDP formulations are not new to the literature, our description of the properties of such formulations represents\nan enhancement of the existing literature. Furthermore, our computational experiments on VRPSD with a number of MDP-based solution procedures also establish the problem sizes that can effectively be addressed by MDP models, given the dimensional constraints and current computational ability.\n\nComputational intractability, however, implies that exact techniques would be impracticable for large problems; accordingly, we next study some existing heuristic approaches to VRP and VRPSD.\nWe modify these and demonstrate the improvements our modifications can bring about to available solutions, from the perspective either of solution quality in practice, or of guarantees on\nsolution quality or computational time in theory. \n\nApart from these modifications, we use network-flow techniques to construct an approximate solution for a special case of VRP. For VRPSD, in\nseparate sets of computational experiments, we apply an MDP-based procedure and a heuristic tour-improvement procedure to an initial solution, and thereby improve solution quality with reasonable\ninvestment in computational resources.\n\nFinally, we use the intuition and solution-development insight gained from the above studies to develop a heuristic approach to solve a real-world problem that to our knowledge has not been\naddressed in the literature before. This problem is actually a combination of two existing multiple-vehicle VRP variants: (a) a VRPSD that additionally incorporates stochasticity in customer presence, and that is formally referred to as VRPSCD, and (b) a (deterministic) VRP where all vehicles are assumed to conduct delivery as well as pickup (also called backhaul) operations,\nformally referred to as VRPB. We call this problem the VRPSCDB.\n\nSpecifically, we modify existing ``tabu search' (a neighborhood search approach that makes recently considered solutions inaccessible, or tabu, for a number of iterations)\ntechniques for solving the VRPSCD, and apply them to VRPSCDB. We also compare our solutions with practice-based solutions, and we incorporate polynomial-time refinements that allow dynamic updates to vehicle routes as new information about customer presence and demands becomes available.

This research focuses on understanding dynamics of space charge polarization and mechanisms controlling electrical conduction in these glasses. Both DC and AC characterization techniques were developed to elucidate electronic and ionic conduction mechanisms under a variety of temperatures, electric field and frequency conditions. Ionic conduction and space charge polarization have been studied in low alkali glasses as a function of electric field and temperature by thermally stimulated depolarization and low frequency impedance spectroscopy. Moreover, due to the low alkali content in these glasses, it was possible to study the transport properties of alkaline earth ions in multicomponent silicate glasses. It was observed that the potential energy barrier height for ionic hopping was reduced at high electric field. Impedance spectroscopy and second harmonic generation microscopy techniques were applied to determine the thickness and electric field distribution across the cation depleted layer that was generated during the thermoelectric poling. Both of these measurements show that the depletion layer thickness depends on the poling conditions and the intrinsic breakdown strength of the material.

The proposed framework models the main processes in gene expression, which are transcription, translation and decay processes, as stand-alone modules while superimposing the regulatory circuitry to obtain an accurate time evolution of the system. The stochasticity inherent to gene expression and regulation processes is captured using Monte Carlo based sampling. Overall, the results demonstrate the simulation framework\u2019s ability to make accurate predictions about system behavior in response to perturbations and distinguish between different plausible regulatory mechanisms postulated to explain observed gene expression profiles. </P>\n<P>Finally, we explore how optimization based approaches can be used to construct synthetic genetic networks that exhibit a specific function. Specifically, we introduce OptCircuit, an optimization based framework that automatically identifies the circuit components from a list and connectivity that brings about the desired functionality. The dynamics that govern the interactions between the elements of the genetic circuit are currently modeled using deterministic ODE\u2019s but the framework is general enough to accommodate stochastic simulations. The desired circuit response is abstracted as the maximization/minimization of an appropriately constructed objective function. The optimization framework is applied on a variety of applications ranging from the design of circuits that exhibit a specific time course response to circuits that discriminate between the presence, absence and level of external stimuli (e.g., genetic decoder). The results for the demonstrate the ability of the framework to (i) generate the complete list of circuit designs of varying complexity that exhibit the desired response; (ii) rectify a non-functional biological circuit and restore functionality by modifying an existing component and/or identifying additional components to append to the circuit. </P>\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4322], "author_name_tesi": "Dasika, Madhukar S", "last_name_ssi": "Dasika", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Madhukar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas", "Reka Z Albert", "Patrick C Cirino", "Antonios Armaou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas, Committee Chair", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member", "Patrick C Cirino, Committee Member", "Antonios Armaou, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gene regulatory networks", "signaling networks", "Optimization", "synthetic biology"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Transport properties of Dirac fermions in two dimensions", "id": "14904", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7435", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Dirac equation in particle physics is used to describe spin 1/2 fermions (such as electrons) moving at relativistic speeds. In condensed matter physics, this is usually not relevant, since particles in matter move slowly compared to the speed of light. However, recent progress has revealed two-dimensional realizations of Dirac fermions in condensed matter systems with zero mass and a redefined \"speed of light.\" One of these systems, graphene, has been studied theoretically for decades as a building block of graphite. The other, the topological insulator, is quite new; this state of matter was predicted less than 10 years ago. \n\n\nGraphene was first isolated in 2004, and since then there has been an explosion of graphene research in the physics community. Much of the recent excitement has to do with the potential applications of graphene in devices. In this dissertation, I will discuss two problems related to graphene devices, and in particular how to use the strong interaction of graphene with its surroundings as an asset. I will show that a Boltzmann transport theory with all scattering mechanisms describes the current vs voltage of a graphene sheet extremely well using {\\em no adjustable parameters}. One crucial element of this model is the transfer of energy from electrons {\\em directly} to the substrate via scattering with optical phonons at the interface. The interaction is due to an electric field that is set up by these optical phonons, which is so strongly interacting in part due to the two dimensionality of the graphene. I will also discuss the adsorption of He atoms on a graphene sheet. This causes a change in the graphene conductivity which is large enough to be measurable. Work in this direction could provide a route to graphene sensors.\n\nThe topological insulator is a recently predicted state of matter which is nominally an insulator but has metallic surface states which are topologically protected. This topological protection arises from the symmetry of the system, which requires a two-fold degeneracy at any time reversal symmetric momentum, and a band inversion, which provides a swapping of the conduction and valance band at a surface. These two conditions imply that an odd number of states will cross the gap even in the presence of disorder (as long as that disorder is time reversal symmetric). This manifests as a Dirac cone at the surface of insulators such as Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3. To be a true topological insulator, one must have a bulk insulator; experimentally however, most samples are bulk conductors. While rapid improvement is being made through techniques such as doping, one of the goals of the research presented in this thesis is to work towards a transport signal which is unique to the surface state even in the presence of a conducting bulk. In this direction, quantum corrections to the magnetoresistance have been shown to fail, as both bulk and surface have similar experimental signals. However work in this dissertation shows that we can still gain some insight by modeling the experimental data with the theory of quantum corrections. I will show evidence that electron-electron interactions are necessary to understand the low temperature conductivity of Bi2Se3 thin films. One unambiguous transport signal is the quantum Hall response; the energy of Dirac fermions in a strong magnetic field is quite different than their parabolic counterparts. Given this, a question that arises is the nature of the fractional quantum Hall effect in topological insulator surface states. I will predict the conditions under which the fractional quantum Hall effect is stable. Finally, one of the reasons topological insulators have gained so much enthusiasm is the potential application to topological quantum computation. This may be made possible if the theoretical predictions of particles called Majorana fermions could be realized experimentally. I discuss evidence that two necessary (although not sufficient) conditions are met: topological insulators can be made superconducting and there is evidence for the formation of vortices in such superconducting topological insulators.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7381], "author_name_tesi": "Dasilva, Ashley Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Dasilva", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Ashley", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain", "Gerald Dennis Mahan", "Nitin Samarth", "Jun Zhu", "James Bernhard Anderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain, Dissertation Advisor", "Gerald Dennis Mahan, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Jun Zhu, Committee Member", "James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dirac fermions", "graphene", "topological insulators", "transport", "two dimensional systems"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Mechanistic Investigations of Class I Ribonucleotide Reductases and Related Oxygen-utilizing Metalloenzymes", "id": "17413", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8425", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Enzymes, nature\u2019s preferred catalysts, often effect remarkable transformations of their substrates, and the mechanistic elucidation of these catalysts has significantly advanced our understanding of biological processes. Our work is focuses on the detailed characterization of enzymes operating in an aerobic environment that utilize one or more transition metals as cofactors to facilitate transformation of their substrates.  The approach of choice to facilitate the mechanistic elucidation of these enzymatic reactions involves the capture of transient species (reactive intermediates) that occur along each reaction sequence, and the kinetic and spectroscopic characterization of each captured species. A major focus of this thesis involves mechanistic investigations of a classic O2-utilizing metalloenzyme, ribonucleotide reductase (RNR).\n\tBy catalyzing the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides [ND(T)Ps], RNRs provide all organisms with the required precursors for the de novo synthesis and repair of DNA. RNRs accomplish this chemically challenging feat with great fidelity by harnessing free-radical chemistry. To date, all RNRs characterized utilize an unstable cysteine thiyl radical (C\u2022), formed in close proximity to the bound ND(T)P to initiate ribonucleotide reduction. Class I RNRs, which all of our studies are focused on and encompass the enzymes from all mammals, aerobically-growing Escherichia coli (Ec), and the human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), are comprised of two non-identical protein subunits, termed \u03b1 and \u03b2. The \u03b1 subunit contains the oxidizable C residue and the site of nucleotide reduction, whereas the \u03b2 subunit assembles a metallocofactor cofactor,  ~ 35 \u00c5 away from the site of catalysis in \u03b1. To reduce ribonucleotides, all RNRs must transfer an oxidizing equivalent or \u201chole\u201d, stored at the metallocofactor in \u03b2, to \u03b1 and generate the C\u2022 in a reversible process. The identity of metallocofactor is key distinguishing factor between the subclasses of class I RNRs, with the Ia and Ib enzymes utilizing diiron- and dimanganese-tyrosyl radical cofactors, and Ic employing a MnIV/FeIII cofactor.\n\tThe first part of this thesis addresses the proper assembly of the MnIV/FeIII cofactor of Ct RNR. The heterodinuclear nature of the cofactor raises the question of which metal site, 1 or 2, houses the MnIV that functionally replaces the Y\u2022 of the class Ia enzyme\u2019s cofactor. This work, a collaborative effort with the laboratory of Prof. Amy C. Rosenzweig at Northwestern University, answers this question using a combination of X-ray crystallography, spectroscopy, analytical metal-content analysis, and enzymatic activity assays. Our results, presented in Appendix A, established that in vitro, Mn is not inherently selective for a particular site, and that both 1Mn/2Fe and 1Fe/2Mn forms of the enzyme are assembled under different conditions. However, enzyme forms containing predominantly 1Mn/2Fe appear more active than those containing both 1Mn/2Fe and 1Fe/2Mn, and it is possible that 1Mn/2Fe is the only active form. \n\t Our work in Appendix B focuses on the mechanism by which the catalytic C\u2022 in Ct \u03b1 is generated. This reaction does not occur in a single electron-transfer step via a tunneling mechanism in which the C residue transfers an electron to the MnIV/FeIII cofactor. Instead, an oxidizing equivalent or \u201chole\u201d is transferred in discrete electron-hopping events that may be coupled to proton transfers, which further complicates this already intricate process. This process, termed a radical-translocation (RT) process, is suggested to be mediated by several redox-competent amino acids [tyrosines (Ys) and perhaps a tryptophan (W)] along a specific pathway \u03b1 and \u03b2 that span the ~ 35-\u00c5 distance. The residues are transiently oxidized, generating radical intermediates. Our work to initiate the RT process in Ct RNR with a more oxidized metal cluster provides the first capture and characterization of these radical intermediates in any class Ic RNR. Using the cofactor-assembly MnIV/FeIV intermediate, expected to have an elevated reduction potential relative to the stable MnIV/FeIII cofactor, we can oxidize a Y (or multiple Ys) on the proposed RT pathway in a super-oxidized \u03b1\u2022\u03b2 complex, and use the resultant Y\u2022(s) to effect nucleotide reduction. Remarkably, this super-oxidized complex appears to subvert, at least partially, the gating mechanism of the RT process \u2013 variants containing defective RT pathways were still capable of generating transient Y\u2022s and actuating nucleotide reduction. Our work reported in Chapter 2 discusses our efforts to identify the precise location of the Y\u2022(s) that accumulates in the wild-type super-oxidized \u03b1\u2022\u03b2 complex. Present results indicate that all of the observed Y\u2022 in that complex resides within the \u03b2 subunit. Detailed kinetic investigations, also presented in Chapter 2, addressed the role of the lone W residue suggested to participate in RT. While the transient oxidation of the putative RT W residue (Ct \u03b2-W51) has never been observed during RT, our work revealed that the ramification of replacing W51 with a phenylalanine, a defect that still leads to Y\u2022 formation with super-oxidized \u03b2, is a significantly slower formation of the Y\u2022. Thus, the W may not be necessary for RT when using a more potent oxidant but its presence accelerates the rate by ~ 8-fold. \n\tThe second part of this thesis focuses on the development of a method with utility that extends beyond our studies on Ct RNR. The capture (by rapid-mixing kinetic techniques) and characterization (by spectroscopy) of fleeting, reactive intermediates is the most-favored approach to mechanistic dissection of metalloenzymes. For metalloenzymes that also utilize molecular oxygen, O2, this approach is often hampered by the gas\u2019s modest aqueous solubility, which, at < 2 mM (at 1 atmosphere) limits both the effective rate constants for formation of reactive intermediates and the concentrations to which the intermediates can accumulate. Our work presented in Appendix C sought to overcome the challenge imposed by the poor solubility of O2 by using the enzyme chlorite dismutase (Cld), for the rapid, in situ generation of O2 at concentrations far exceeding 2 mM. Cld, a heme enzyme, efficiently converts chlorite (ClO2-) to O2 and chloride ion (Cl-). The method a) permits accumulation of O2-derived complexes at concentrations well above 2 mM, b) allows greater precision in determining the O2-dependent kinetics of enzymes that bind or react with O2, and c) permits substantial increase in the yield of intermediates that form in a reversible, disfavored equilibrium with O2. This means of in situ O2 generation permits a > 5 mM \"pulse\" of O2 to be generated in < 1 ms at the easily accessible [Cld] of 50 \u00b5M. It should therefore significantly extend the range of kinetic and spectroscopic experiments that can routinely be undertaken in the study of these enzymes and could also facilitate resolution of mechanistic pathways in cases of either sluggish or thermodynamically unfavorable O2-addition steps.\n\tOf the many applications we envisioned for the Cld/ClO2- method, the one that has advanced significantly is for the preparation of intermediates at concentrations that would afford their physical characterization by highly informative but relatively insensitive spectroscopic techniques. One of these techniques is Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, which provides structural information for systems not amenable to X-ray crystallography. EXAFS is often employed in the characterization of metalloenzymes intermediates, and for several O2-derived diiron protein intermediates, the characterization has proven difficult, largely due to the low concentration of the intermediates (a consequence of the poor solubility of O2) that could be trapped. The Fe\u2212Fe separation (dFe\u2212Fe), by far the largest determinant factor of the core structures of these protein intermediates, has been reported as being ~ 2.5 \u00c5. This short distance dictates unusual structures for the intermediates. One such intermediate is the high-valent cofactor-assembly Fe2III/IV intermediate in the class Ia Ec RNR. This enzyme\u2019s reaction to generate its stable diferric-Y\u2022 radical cofactor proceeds via the Fe2III/IV intermediate, termed X, which is the ultimate oxidant of the cofactor-Y residue. The importance of X in ribonucleotide reduction, and the fact that it was the first non-heme FeIV enzyme intermediate to be discovered has made it the focus of many structural studies that seek to characterize it. The EXAFS characterization of X by Riggs-Gelasco et al. yielded a dFe\u2212Fe of ~ 2.5 \u00c5, a distance that demanded an unprecedented structure for which three single-atom oxo groups bridge the two Fe ions. Knowing that the EXAFS characterization of intermediate complexes benefits from increased concentration and purity of the species being investigated, we hoped that samples of X, prepared with the Cld/ClO2- method, at much higher concentrations than had ever been reported, would encourage a re-investigation into the EXAFS characterization. This work, a collaborative effort between our laboratory and that of Dr. Michael T. Green that is discussed in Appendix D, revealed that X does not contain a 2.5 \u00c5 dFe\u2212Fe, but in fact contains a prominent 2.8 \u00c5 dFe\u2212Fe. Computational studies predict that with this revised distance, X contains a di-\u03bc-oxo core. This development has encouraged re-examination of the structures of other intermediates that were also reported to be similar (i.e., short dFe-Fes) to X, and we are now actively pursuing those studies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8336], "author_name_tesi": "Dassama, Laura Massah", "last_name_ssi": "Dassama", "middle_name_ssi": "Massah", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Carsten Krebs", "Squire J Booker", "Ming Tien", "Christopher Howard House"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Carsten Krebs, Dissertation Advisor", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ribonucleotide Reductase", "metalloenzymes", "dioxygen activation", "M\u00f6ssbauer", "chlorite dismutase", "electron paramagnetic resonance"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Spectacular Maneuvers: Explorations of Sexual Deviancy and Early Film in Henri de Toulouse-lautrec\u2019s Au cirque Series", "id": "23593", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10695", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My analysis of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec examines previously overlooked aspects of his work.

In this thesis, I present algorithms and statistical models for inferring image semantics and aesthetics from visual content, specifically aimed at improving real-world image search. First, a novel approach to automatic image tagging is presented which furthers the state-of-the-art in both speed and accuracy. The direct use of automatically generated tags in real-world image search is then explored, and its efficacy demonstrated experimentally. An assumption which makes most annotation models misrepresent reality is that the state of the world is static, whereas it is fundamentally dynamic. I explore learning algorithms for adapting automatic tagging to different scenario changes. Specifically, a meta-learning model is proposed which can augment a black-box annotation model to help provide adaptability for personalization, time evolution, and contextual changes. Instead of retraining expensive annotation models, adaptability is achieved through efficient incremental learning of only the meta-learning component. Large scale experiments convincingly support this approach. In image search, when semantics alone yields many matches, one way to rank images further is to look beyond semantics and consider visual quality. I explore the topic of data-driven inference of aesthetic quality of images. Owing to minimal prior art, the topic is first explored in detail. Then, methods for extracting a number of high-level visual features, presumed to have correlation with aesthetics, are presented. Through feature selection and machine learning, an aesthetics inference model is trained and found to perform moderately on real-world data. The aesthetics-correlated visual features are then used in the problem of selecting and eliminating images at the high and low extremes of the aesthetics scale respectively, using a novel statistical model. Experimentally, this approach is found to work well in visual quality based filtering. Finally, I explore the use of image search techniques for designing a novel image-based CAPTCHA, a Web security test aimed at distinguishing humans from machines. Assuming image search metrics to be potential attack tools, they are used in the loop to design attack-resistant CAPTCHAs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5383], "author_name_tesi": "Datta, Ritendra ", "last_name_ssi": "Datta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ritendra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Z Wang", "James Z Wang", "Jia Li", "Robert Collins", "C Lee Giles", "David Miller", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Z Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "James Z Wang, Committee Chair", "Jia Li, Committee Chair", "Robert Collins, Committee Member", "C Lee Giles, Committee Member", "David Miller, Committee Member", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["image aesthetics", "automatic annotation", "image search", "statistical learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Physiological ecology of hydrocarbon seep tubeworms from the gulf of Mexico", "id": "6959", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6057", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cold seeps are located worldwide at active and passive continental margins, and are characterized by the seepage of hydrocarbon-rich fluids from deep reservoirs to the seafloor. Chemosynthetic communities comprising tubeworms, clams and mussels thrive at cold seeps and derive nutrition from reduced chemicals such as methane and sulfide. This study focuses on thiotrophic vestimentiferan tubeworms from the upper Louisiana slope of the Gulf of Mexico. These tubeworms, dominated by the species Lamellibrachia luymesi and Seepiophila jonesi, are nutritionally dependent on internal sulfide-oxidizing bacterial symbionts. These tubeworms form large, bush-like aggregations that provide habitat for numerous associated fauna, and can persist for centuries. Individual tubeworms grow posterior root-like structures to mine sulfide from the sediment underlying their aggregations. Microbial communities that oxidize hydrocarbons using sulfate as an electron donor produce sulfide in the sediment. Previous to this study, it was hypothesized that tubeworms could release sulfate, a byproduct of sulfide oxidation by their symbionts, through their roots into the underlying sediment. They could thereby enhance microbial sulfate reduction, and ensure themselves a lifetime supply of sulfide.\n\tIn this study, I provide the first empirical evidence for this phenomenon. I used a multi-disciplinary approach that included live animal physiology, tissue biochemistry, sediment geochemistry and theoretical modeling, to demonstrate that tubeworms can enhance microbial sulfate reduction through root sulfate release. My experiments with live L. luymesi tubeworms demonstrated that they release 85% of the sulfate produced by sulfide oxidation, and 67% of the protons produced by various metabolic processes across their root. Based on inhibitor experiments, I suggest that they use sulfate-bicarbonate exchangers to mediate sulfate transport across their root epithelium. Further, I measured the proton-ATPase activity of their plume and root tissues and surmised that these tubeworms might use passive proton channels for root proton transport. In combination, these results suggest that tubeworms could conserve energy by eliminating sulfate and protons using ATP-independent mechanisms across their roots. \n\tIn situ geochemical characterization of the tubeworm habitat showed that these tubeworms could exert a significant influence on the chemistry of their environments. Geochemical data, in combination with a theoretical model, suggest that tubeworms release between 70-90% of the sulfate produced by their symbionts across their roots. The combination of root sulfide uptake and sulfate release appears to maintain a steady sulfide-to-sulfate ratio in sediments adjoining tubeworm roots. The model suggests that by releasing sulfate, tubeworms can maintain basal metabolic requirements as well as enhanced growth rates under conditions where sediment sulfate concentrations would otherwise become limiting. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6050], "author_name_tesi": "Dattagupta, Sharmishtha ", "last_name_ssi": "Dattagupta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sharmishtha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Sarah Mary Assmann", "Dr Simon Gilroy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Chair", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member", "Sarah Mary Assmann, Committee Member", "Dr Simon Gilroy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Deep-sea", "Hydrocarbon seep", "Tubeworm", "Sulfate excretion"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Ltino Men with HIV/AIDS in New York State: Factors Influencing Use of Vocational Rehabilitation Services\n", "id": "9397", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4849", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As part of the fastest growing minority population in the U.S., Latino men are an ethnically and racially diverse group who are disproportionately affected by both HIV/AIDS and unemployment. As people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) continue to live longer and healthier lives, interest in their vocational development has been increasing, and research in this area has expanded. State vocational rehabilitation (VR), the most widely used system of vocational services for individuals with disabilities, represents a viable service alternative for many PLWHA; however, Latinos are underserved in this arena. Research investigating VR use patterns by Latinos and PLWHA is vital for understanding factors related to service use and addressing disparities. As no known studies have specifically examined VR service use by Latino men with HIV/AIDS, the purpose of this study was to investigate variables associated with VR use as well as examine the ethnic subgroup differences among them.\n\nParticipants were 101 Latino men with HIV/AIDS recruited from AIDS service organizations and networks funded by the AIDS Institute - New York Department of Health, who took the National Working Positive Coalition - Vocational Training and Employment Survey, an instrument designed to assess the vocational-related needs of PLWHA. Andersen\u2019s Behavioral Model of Service Utilization provided a theoretical framework for identifying and investigating variables in predisposing, enabling, and need domains as they related to VR use. Logistic regression was used to identify variables predictive of VR use with a hierarchical approach to the analysis to determine changes in model significance when variables were added in blocks per variable domains.\n\nChi Square analyses found significant differences between VR users and non-VR users on knowledge of VR, and on racial identification between ethnic subgroups.

Experiments were conducted to examine C. canadensis adaptations that facilitate seed dispersal and population spread.  Early fall and early spring emerging plants grew taller, set seed earlier, and produced 80,000 \u2013 100,000 more seeds than late spring emerging plants.  Management of glyphosate-resistant C. canadensis should be effective on early fall and early spring emerging plants since they may be contributing to a greater extent to the spread of the glyphosate resistance gene than late spring emerging plants.\nExploration of seed release and escape from the surface boundary layer (SBL) was conducted by vertical and aerial seed sampling in concert with micrometeorological measurements.  Vertical sampling was conducted in 2005 and 2006 in Pennsylvania using a 6 m vertical sampler positioned 14 m downwind of a C. canadensis point source.  Thermal turbulence were greatest in the afternoon sampling periods which corresponded with the greatest seed collection at 5 and 6 m, the heights above which seed are escaping the SBL.  Only 0.04% of seed were predicted to be collected at 5 and 6 m on the vertical sampler, equating to 52 seeds per plant (out of 130,000) predicted to be escaping the SBL.  Using the same vertical samplers, remotely piloted airplanes were included in sampling events to quantify the seed concentration profile extending from ground level to 120 m.  More seeds (54%) were predicted to escape from the SBL during the afternoon than during the morning (37%), which correlated with maximum mechanical turbulence rather than thermal turbulence.  Most seed dispersal studies report dispersal distances of tens of meters, but C. canadensis seed collected aerially will stay aloft for 5-7 hours and were predicted to travel 20 to 100 km.\nA spatially explicit model was developed to assess the changes in glyphosate-resistant (GR) C. canadensis spread rate as the agricultural landscape varied with genetically modified GR crop adoption.  The model predicted that after 5 years with the current GR adoption in soybean (89%) and corn (21%), 80% of the possible 360 fields would be infested.  Adding alfalfa into the current or increased adoption scenarios reduced the number of infested fields after 5 years by 10%.  The greatest reduction in spread was accomplished by reducing the amount of glyphosate-resistant crops on the landscape.  When encountering a wind dispersed species, like C. canadensis, which can easily move among fields, decisions about weed management are not made independent of decisions in neighboring fields, but instead are coupled.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3021], "author_name_tesi": "Dauer, Joseph Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Dauer", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A Mortensen", "William Curran", "Scott Alan Isard", "Edward Luschei", "Ottar N Bjornstad"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David A Mortensen, Committee Chair", "William Curran, Committee Member", "Scott Alan Isard, Committee Member", "Edward Luschei, Committee Member", "Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wind dispersal", "glyphosate-resistance", "horseweed"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Improving Autonomous Soaring via Energy State Estimation and Extremum Seeking Control", "id": "19982", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9471", "abstract_tesi": "This research is motivated by the significant potential of soaring UAVs to efficiently accomplish both civil and scientific missions by atmospheric energy harvesting.

This study addresses the hydrogen embrittlement of non-irradiated, stress-relieved Zircaloy-4 cladding under conditions (state of stress and temperature) relevant to those of a reactivity initiated accident.  Specifically, the study has investigated the effects of a concentrated density of hydride particles (in the form of a rim at the outer surface of the cladding tube introduced by gas-charging) on the cladding ductility when tested under a near-plane-strain tension at 25, 300, and 375\u00b0C.  The influence of the hydride-rim thickness and local hydrogen contents on cladding ductility is studied as a function of temperature and correlated with the hydride microstructure.\nUsing synchrotron x-ray diffraction, this study has found that the &#948;-hydride phase (i.e., ZrHx, where x &#8776; 1.66) is the predominant hydride phase to precipitate in stress-relieved Zircaloy-4 cladding for hydrogen contents up to 1250 wt ppm.  At hydrogen contents above 2700 wt ppm, although &#948;-hydride is still the majority phase, both &#61543;- and &#949;-hydride phases are also observed.  The volume fraction of hydrides was estimated as a function of hydrogen content, using the diffracted x-ray intensities.  These estimated values agree well with calculated values assuming hydride precipitates are &#948;-hydride.\nUnder near-plane-strain hoop tension, the ductility and fracture of the cladding is highly dependent on both the hydride-rim thickness and the testing temperature.  At room temperature, due to a high density of hydride particles within the rim, a Mode I crack is injected shortly after yielding.  This limits cladding ductility, such that it decreases with increasing thickness of the hydride rim.  Cladding containing hydride rims with a thickness of &#8805;100 &#956;m was thus macroscopically brittle (the macroscopic failure strain was small) as the result of the initiation and propagation of a Mode I (i.e., tensile) crack through the thickness of the cladding.  Crack growth occurred due to void initiation at fractured hydride particles and subsequent strain-induced coalescence.  \nMode I cracks were also observed at 300\u00b0C within the hydride rim, but the substrate failed by a mixed Mode I/II crack with no signs of void nucleation, as the hydride particles in the substrate resisted fracture.  Macroscopically brittle behavior occurred for cladding with hydride rims thicker than &#8776;170-&#956;m.  In contrast, at 375\u00b0C, materials with rim thicknesses up to 260 &#956;m were ductile and failed due to localized necking.  As a result, the effect of hydrogen on ductility at this temperature is small.  Also, at this highest temperature, small Mode I cracks were occasionally observed within the hydride rim; these cracks were associated with high local hydrogen contents (>4000 wt ppm) and the presence of the tetragonal &#949;-hydride phase near the outer surface, suggesting that this hydride phase is highly brittle at all temperatures of this study.\nThis study also tested specimens with a uniform distribution of hydrides (containing &#61603;2200-wt-ppm hydrogen) in order to compare their behavior to that of hydride-rim specimens.  Uniformly-hydrided specimens containing &#8776;2200-wt-ppm hydrogen tested at 300\u00b0C showed the initiation of Mode I cracks and macroscopically brittle behavior, similar to that of the hydride-rim cladding.  However, when tested at 375\u00b0C, cladding with &#8776;2200-wt-ppm hydrogen showed comparable macroscopic ductility (>4% uniform hoop strain) and fracture (i.e., plastic instability) to that of non-hydrided cladding, suggesting that this cladding is macroscopically ductile.  The difference between material behavior at 300 and 375\u00b0C indicates that the survivability of cladding during a reactivity initiated accident may depend critically on the exact cladding temperature at maximum load.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5293], "author_name_tesi": "Daum, Robert Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Daum", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Donald Albert Koss", "Paul Raymond Howell", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Michael C Billone"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Chair", "Donald Albert Koss, Committee Member", "Paul Raymond Howell, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Michael C Billone, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrides", "hydrogen", "embrittlement", "Zircaloy-4", "phases", "synchrotron diffraction", "tension", "ductility", "fracture"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Fully Bayesian Approach to the Efficient Global Optimization Algorithm", "id": "19010", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9039", "abstract_tesi": "Finding the global optimum(s) of a non-convex function is of great importance in numerous applications in science and engineering where the function takes the form of an expensive computer code and its inputs are the independent variables.

Given a spatio-temporally indexed data set, Gaussian Random Field (GRF) models are powerful prediction/classification tools  which are used in different fields, e.g., in machine learning, geostatistics, and in engineering. In this thesis, we propose new methods for fitting different GRF models to large spatial data sets. From an optimization perspective, we seek computationally efficient algorithms that scale well with the size of the data sets. From a statistical perspective, we explore the convergence bounds of the resulting optimal estimators.\n\nA first goal of this dissertation is to propose an efficient algorithm that fits a second-order stationary and isotropic GRF model to large data sets. The dominant frequentist approach is Maximum Likelihood (ML) which requires non-convex optimization. The problem is aggravated in big data settings, given the  $\\cO(n^3)$ computational complexity of the ML method, where $n$ denotes the number of spatio-temporal data points. We make connections with the covariance selection problem and propose a two-stage algorithm with linear convergence in the first stage and a second stage that consists of solving a convex problem for a large class of spatial covariance functions. Furthermore, with proper tuning of a sparsity parameter in the first stage, the proposed algorithm has a theoretical convergence bound, in general. Large datasets are handled by two blocking (i.e., segmentation) schemes that enable parallel computation and ensure, without further formulation, that the predicted surface has no discontinuities at the block boundaries in contrast to other recently proposed GRF fitting methods for large datasets that also rely on segmentation.\n\nOur second goal in this thesis is to extend the proposed methods to more general classes of GRF models. The first extension consists of estimating the parameters of an anisotropic covariance function where convexity of the second stage optimization problem is shown for a dominant class of exponential covariance functions. Next, a novel algorithm is proposed for fitting multivariate GRF models with separable covariance functions. The proposed algorithm fits a multivariate GRF in four stages with provable convergence rates that highly benefits from parallel processing capabilities. Finally, an extension of the proposed algorithm for prediction problems under a class of continuous, non-Gaussian data known to have a nonparanormal distribution is studied.\n\nApplications of GRFs in modeling manufactured surfaces, emulating expensive to evaluate computer simulations, and predicting meteorological fields are presented towards the end of this dissertation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11344], "author_name_tesi": "Davanloo Tajbakhsh, Sam ", "last_name_ssi": "Davanloo Tajbakhsh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Enrique Del Castillo", "Necdet S Aybat", "Vinayak V Shanbhag", "James Landis Rosenberger", "Murali Haran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Enrique Del Castillo, Dissertation Advisor", "Necdet S Aybat, Dissertation Advisor", "Vinayak V Shanbhag, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member", "Murali Haran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Convex Optimization", "Gaussian Random Field", "Spatial Statistics", "Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers", "ADMM."]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Equivariant Noncommutative Residue and an Equivarirant Weyl's Theorem\n", "id": "6765", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5810", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Let $M$ be a smooth, compact manifold acted upon smoothly\nby a group $Gamma$.

However, the precise composition, dimension and life span of these domains in biological membranes are still under debate.  Detergent extraction and biochemical characterization of membrane domains, including cholesterol depletion studies, have been widely used but are often plagued by various problems and do not allow for direct visualization of domains in live, intact cell membranes.  Various microscopic and spectroscopic methods have been developed to provide the spatial and temporal information required to better understand domain formation and function.  Still, many of these methods are not amenable to live cells, do not provide single cell data, are spatially limited by optical diffraction, or provide only seconds to microseconds temporal resolution.  Under physiological conditions, membrane domains are likely transient and smaller than the diffraction limit of optical microscopy and therefore defy detection using conventional imaging methods.  \n\n   To overcome these limitations and obtain molecular-level, spatio-temporal information on membrane domains, we developed an ultrafast fluorescence dynamics imaging assay that includes time-resolved fluorescence lifetime and polarization anisotropy imaging.  Supported lipid bilayer model membranes and suspended and adherent RBL mast cells under non-physiological and physiological conditions of IgE receptor cross-linking were used as model systems in these studies.  The excited-state dynamics and rotational diffusion (picoseconds to nanoseconds timescale) obtained with this assay are inherently sensitive to the immediate surroundings of a fluorescently labeled molecule and allow for real-time monitoring of membrane structure, organization and heterogeneity in individual, live cells.  \n\n   In this Dissertation, the feasibility of this ultrafast fluorescence dynamics assay is demonstrated on simple model lipid membranes labeled with a fluorescent phospholipid analog.  The fluorescent probe exhibits longer lifetime, higher order and longer overall rotational correlation time in more ordered, gel phase membranes as compared to fluid, or liquid-disordered, phase.  These site-specific observations agree with the literature for model membranes analyzed via traditional ensemble spectrofluorimetric lifetime and anisotropy experiments.     \n\n   The fluorescence dynamics assay is then used to detect more ordered, cholesterol enriched domains and relate their nanostructure and dynamics to IgE receptor signaling, in the plasma membrane of single, live RBL mast cells under non-physiological and physiological conditions.  In mast cells, antigen-mediated cross-linking of the high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) results in movement of FceRI into cholesterol-rich domains in the plasma membrane, where it is phosphorylated by the Src kinase, Lyn, to initiate the exocytotic release of histamine in the allergic response.  Lyn-induced phosphorylation of FceRI occurs in a cholesterol-dependent manner, leading to the hypothesis that cholesterol-rich membrane domains may act as functional receptor signaling platforms.  When IgE-FceRI is non-physiologically cross-linked with anti-IgE at 4\u00b0C, molecules associated with cholesterol-rich microdomains (e.g., saturated lipids [the lipid analog 1,1\u2019-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2019,3\u2019-tetramethylindo\u00accarbo\u00accyanine (diI-C18) or glycosphingolipids]) and lipid-anchored proteins co-redistribute with cross-linked IgE-FceRI.  We find an enhancement in diI-C18 and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled IgE-FceRI fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy in optically resolvable micro\u00acdomains where these molecules co-localize.  These results suggest that fluorescence lifetime and, particularly, anisotropy permit us to measure lipid molecule recruitment into more ordered domains that serve as IgE-mediated signaling platforms.  \n\n   In a collaborative effort, using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) imaging of intact, individual mast cells, lipid chemical identity and distribution are also investigated as a function of extensive cross-linking.  Multiple lipid species are visualized at the sub-cellular level, with the results suggesting that IgE-FceRI cross-linking induces very subtle changes in cholesterol distribution, necessitating exquisitely sensitive analysis methods such as fluorescence lifetime and polarization anisotropy. \n \n   Under more challenging physiological conditions, excited-state fluorescence dynamics are used to correlate sub-resolution nanostructural changes in the diI-C18-labeled plasma membrane with IgE-FceRI cross-linking in adherent mast cells stimulated with multivalent antigen at ~20\u00b0C.  Time-dependent fluorescence lifetime imaging of diI-C18 shows changes in lifetime that agree with the kinetics of stimulated FceRI tyrosine phosphorylation under the same conditions.  Lifetime imaging of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled IgE-FceRI indicates that fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurs with diI-C18 with similar kinetics.  These live cell studies provide direct evidence for IgE-FceRI associations with specialized cholesterol-rich domains within ~4 nm at maximal association during IgE receptor signaling.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [263], "author_name_tesi": "Davey, Angel Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Davey", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Angel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Erin Elizabeth Sheets", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets", "Ahmed A Heikal", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Tae Hee Lee", "Peter J Butler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Erin Elizabeth Sheets, Dissertation Advisor", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets, Committee Chair", "Ahmed A Heikal, Committee Chair", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Tae Hee Lee, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fluorescence lifetime", "fluorescence anisotropy", "IgE receptor", "lipid domains", "mast cells"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Improvements in Numerical Modeling of Airflows Around Multiple Buildings\n\n", "id": "10864", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1639", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The airflow around buildings and turbulent dispersion of the airborne contaminants has been studied extensively in the last few decades. However, most of the studies restricted their attention to isolated buildings or obstacles placed in relatively simple surroundings with simplified boundary and initial conditions. In addition, more realistic scenarios, such as multiple buildings in urban areas, require more advanced numerical tools. Current engineering practice in computational fluid dynamics involves two equation \u00a1\u00a7k-\u0192\u00d5\u00a1\u00a8 turbulence model, which is typical representative of Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling approach. Unfortunately, this turbulence modeling approach is not capable of resolving all important features of the engineering flows with complex geometries and boundary flow conditions. Improvements in numerical modeling with k-\u0192\u00d5 turbulence model are typically achieved by mesh refinement in the regions with sharp changes in the boundary conditions. However, the increase in the computational cost does not justify very fine mesh refinement in many practical applications. On the other hand, more advanced numerical techniques, such as large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simulations (DNS) are still not entirely applicable tool in engineering design because of high sensitivity to the variations in initial and boundary conditions, and requirement for finer meshes at higher computational cost when compared with Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling approach.\n\tThe main objective of the thesis was to provide faster, yet reliable and simple modeling tool for simulation of outdoor airflow around multiple buildings. The intent was to improve the existing zero-equation turbulence models mainly developed and used for modeling of airflows in indoor environments. The zero-equation turbulence model adopts the local mean velocity and distance to the nearest wall surface as the characteristic velocity and length scale to estimate the turbulent viscosity. However, the coefficients in the model equation require assessment for each particular application. For that reason, the wind tunnel modeling of complex airflow around four scaled student dorm buildings at the Penn State University campus has been carried out in the closed loop, low speed wind tunnel at the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University using triple hot wire anemometry to collect the velocity time series. The obtained results on 1:250 scale modeled buildings provided the base for calibration of the coefficients in the zero-equation turbulent model. The derived expression for calibration coefficient implements both the bulk and turbulent Reynolds number as relevant characteristics of approaching wind flow.  The calibrated zero-equation turbulence model has been incorporated in commercial CFD software PHOENICS and tested against the wind tunnel results. The simulation results show satisfactory agreement with measured data for longitudinal velocity components. The prediction of vertical velocity component was less accurate and inferior performance of the model was observed for lateral velocity component prediction. Limitations in measurement equipment and negligence of all mean strain rate tensor components including lateral and vertical velocity gradients are two most likely sources of discrepancy between the numerical and wind tunnel experimental results. Further estimate of exponents in the derived expression for calibration coefficient is recommended for different buildings layouts.\nExperimental study with regular array of cubes placed in the boundary layer wind tunnel provided the data for additional validation of the developed model. The experimental results comprised of streamwise and vertical velocity profiles along the centerline of the modeled building cube array. The developed model for calibration coefficients in the expression for turbulent eddy viscosity in the zero-equation turbulence model demonstrated good agreement in streamwise velocity prediction with experimentally acquired results. Implemented turbulence model showed comparative competitiveness with more advanced one-point turbulence closure models, such as two equation \u00a1\u00a7k-epsilon\u00a1\u00a8 and modified \u00a1\u00a7Kato-Launder\u00a1\u00a8 version of the \u00a1\u00a7k-epsilon\u00a1\u00a8 model, although, the full adjustment of the calibration coefficients in the model was not feasible due to lack of input information that was not measured in the wind tunnel experiment.  \nPart of the thesis effort focused on possible improvements in the description of inlet boundary conditions of incoming wind. For that purpose, an extensive literature review on the atmospheric surface layer flows, their characterization and parameterization has been performed. In addition, the systematic overview of various strategies for synthetic turbulent wind speeds generation has been discussed in detail. As an outcome, the most suitable techniques for implementation in CFD models are described with sufficient level of detail for easy coding. The described techniques should provide substantial foundation for the future implementation of unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations (URANS) turbulence modeling approach for simulation of outdoor airflow in complex urban settings.\nThe developed methodology for calibration coefficients in the zero-equation turbulence models represents the major contribution of this study. Further improvements of the model are possible with provision of experimental data with high spatial resolution using advanced non-invasive measurement techniques such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA). More comprehensive set of experimental data would enable further refinement of the proposed model in terms of adjustment of the exponents in the proposed equation for calibration coefficients. Instead of using single constant value, the exponents should be defined as a function of plan area density, frontal area density and other morphological parameters already established to describe various buildings layouts and boundary layer flows in urban environments. \nTo end this journey through the magical world of turbulence, I will quote several lines from the famous poem that many people have quoted before, but in my case, this time, with much deeper understanding and appreciation:\n\u00a1\u00a7What we call the beginning is often the end\nAnd to make and end is to make a beginning.\nThe end is where we start from\u00a1K\n\u00a1KWe shall not cease from exploration\nAnd the end of all our exploring \nWill be to arrive where we started\nAnd know the place for the first time.\u00a1\u00a8\nTomas S.

Often, a polyubiquitin chain is built onto a substrate to target it for degradation by the 26S proteasome.  The selection of a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) for a particular ubiquitin ligase (E3) and the subsequent transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 onto the substrate lysine are two processes that remain to be better understood.  It is known that E3s harbor a limited number of conserved sequence motifs that recruit specific E2 enzymes.  One such motif is known as the RING domain, comprising of amino acids that coordinate two zinc atoms in a conserved structural fold.  Based on the finding that RING domains from known or putative E3 partners of Ubc7, E2-25K and Cdc34 are able to activate an intrinsic ubiquitin to ubiquitin linkage activity in these three E2 enzymes, work in this thesis uses the premise that insights on E3-E2 interactions can be obtained by studying the interactions between an E2 enzyme with isolated RING domains. \n\nA collection of human RING domains that belong to ~100 E3s is available in our laboratory for a study toward the identification of RING domains that selectively activate Ubc7, E2-25K, or Cdc34.  In work carried out in this thesis, eleven new Ubc7- and seven new E2-25K-activating RING sequences were identified.  To understand the structure-function relationship of these E2-activating sequences, work in this thesis examined a RING-E2 fusion strategy to facilitate structural analysis of RING-E2 interactions.  Independently of this thesis work, the gp78RING-Ubc7 fusion protein was used to obtain diffraction quality crystals from which a 2.2 &#506; resolution structure was obtained.  Using the atomic coordinates of this structure, calculation and mutational analyses were carried out to assess selected contacts at the two-protein interface.  Results from this analysis identified three residues in Ubc7 (R8, L66, and V113) that contribute importantly to the binding affinity, of indicating that positive interactions make a significant contribution to E2-E3 pairings. Thus, selective E2-E3 pairings can be dictated in part by the presence of specific residues in the sequence of these proteins that supply positive interactions. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that certain amino acids cannot readily be accommodated into the gp78-Ubc7 interface, and a negative selection process may also contribute to the stringent pairing of an E2 with an E3. \n\nWork in this thesis also examined the catalytic function of a set of residues in Ubc7.  The transfer of ubiquitin from the thiolester-linked form in an E2~Ub complex to a lysine requires the latter to be in the deprotonated form.  To examine residues in Ubc7 that may assist in this deprotonation step of the reaction, work in this thesis examined the pH dependence of Ubc7 activity, with the rationale that loss of this function in a Ubc7 mutant will lead to a pH profile that is dictated by the substrate lysine.  This analysis indicates that H94 and E104 function together in this mechanism.  This finding differs from that suggested for Ubc9, a SUMO-conjugating enzyme that belongs to the UBC family of proteins.  \n\nIn conclusion, work carried out in this thesis led to the identification of a set of E2-activating RING domains that can be used to analyze how E3 and E2 enzymes are selectively paired.  A study examining the interaction between the RING domain in gp78 and Ubc7 has provided initial structure-function insights.  The work in this thesis also identified important catalytic residues in Ubc7.  These results have led to further testable hypotheses on the selection of an E2 by an E3 and how the RING domain may allosterically activate an E2 enzyme.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3348], "author_name_tesi": "Davidshofer, Kristine C", "last_name_ssi": "Davidshofer", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Kristine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent Chau", "Hui Ling Chiang", "Scot R Kimball", "Charles H Lang", "Lisa M Shantz", "Mary E Truckenmiller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent Chau, Committee Chair", "Hui Ling Chiang, Committee Member", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member", "Mary E Truckenmiller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["RING domain", "ubiquitin", "ubiquitin conjugating enzyme"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "RELATEDNESS WITH PARENTS, PEERS, TEACHERS, AND MENTORS IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD AND EARLY ADOLESCENCE: PERSON-ORIENTED AND VARIABLE-ORIENTED APPROACHES\n", "id": "9218", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "156", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-01-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nEstablishing and maintaining positive relationships with parents, non-familial adults, and peers are important tasks linked to social and academic adjustment during childhood and adolescence. Few studies have examined patterns of relatedness in youths\u2019 experiences with various social partners using person-oriented and variable-oriented approaches. The present research aims to address these limitations and provide new information about the antecedents and consequences of youths\u2019 experiences with parents, peers, teachers and mentors. In the first study, links between youths\u2019 perceptions of friendship intimacy and mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 reports of parental acceptance were examined among 246 Mexican American 7th graders. Three patterns of parent-peer linkage were identified using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA): Low Parent; Positive; and Low Friend. A mixed model ANCOVA indicated that youth in the Positive profile had higher bi-cultural orientations relative to other youth, reflected by their higher Anglo orientations, and familism and respeto values. Further, there was greater congruence between the familism values of youth and parents in the Positive profile than for youth and parents in the other profiles. Finally, univariate ANCOVA models indicated that youth in the Positive profile had better adjustment relative to youth in the Low Parent profile, but comparable adjustment to youth in the Low Friend profile. Findings revealed the benefit of a person-oriented approach to illuminate the within-group variability in parent and peer experiences and the unique cultural experiences of minority youth, as well as the implications of parent-peer linkages for the adjustment of minority youth. In the second study, links between youths\u2019 closeness with teachers, their social preference among peers, and their perceptions of peer competence were examined among 383 white, lower- to middle-class, rural students in the fall of 6th grade. Three patterns of teacher-peer relatedness were identified using LPA: Low Relatedness; Peer-Oriented; and Teacher-Oriented. A multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that prosocial behavior in 5th grade positively predicted membership in the Teacher-Oriented and Peer-Oriented profiles in contrast to membership in the Low Relatedness profile, and aggressive behavior negatively predicted membership in the Teacher-Oriented profile in contrast to the Low Relatedness profile. In hierarchical linear regression models, indicators of relatedness with teachers and with peers and patterns of teacher-peer relatedness were uniquely associated with youths\u2019 social and academic adjustment across middle school. Findings also indicated a maladaptive synergistic effect for Low Relatedness youth, such that having a pattern of poor relationships in the school context was worse than the additive effects of the independent indicators of relatedness. The third study examined patterns of association among mentoring match characteristics in 565 youth and 554 mentors participating in the Big Brothers Big Sisters school-based mentoring program. Four distinct mentoring match profiles were identified using LPA: Intuitive; Disengaged; Sufficiently Trained; and Efficacious. Hierarchical linear regression models indicated that the Disengaged profile tended to have less positive mentoring relationship outcomes compared to other profiles. Youth age moderated associations between mentoring profiles and adjustment, such that profiles characterized by mentors\u2019 perceptions of sufficient pre-match training in combination with average to high mentor efficacy and engagement in social and academic activities was associated with more positive outcomes for older youth. Collectively, findings from the present studies support the use of person-oriented techniques to examine how features of relationships with parents, peers, teachers and mentors are connected in different ways for different youth and associated with a host of adjustment outcomes. Implications include the importance of assessing relatedness patterns to address youths\u2019 adjustment in family, school and mentoring program contexts.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [155], "author_name_tesi": "Davidson, Alice Jane", "last_name_ssi": "Davidson", "middle_name_ssi": "Jane", "first_name_ssi": "Alice", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott David Gest", "Scott David Gest", "Susan Marie Mc Hale", "J Douglas Coatsworth", "Constance A Flanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott David Gest, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott David Gest, Committee Chair", "Susan Marie Mc Hale, Committee Member", "J Douglas Coatsworth, Committee Member", "Constance A Flanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["peers", "parents", "person-oriented", "early adolescence", "relatedness", "teachers", "mentors"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Development and Use of a Trade Space Visualization Model for Software-Defined Radio Receiver Design\n", "id": "10831", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1779", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Software-defined radio (SDR) systems are flexible communications systems in which key operational radio characteristics are reconfigurable and defined in software.  Free from many of the rigid constraints associated with traditional hardware radio (HR) systems, SDR systems are driving modern communications technology development and innovation.  However, the ability to develop highly reconfigurable radio systems gives rise to a large number of difficult and complex multivariable design decisions involving tradeoffs between many design criteria.  Essential system features such as cost, radio flexibility, size, weight, and power result not only from typical component selection choices but also from complex decisions such as those surrounding the determination of what will be defined in software versus hardware.  The massive quantity of design alternatives and the complexity of the selection provide a challenge to the designer that can be overwhelming, motivating the need for new design tools.  One tool that could serve to benefit SDR developers is a trade space visualization tool that supports multi-dimensional data visualization of design alternatives, tradeoffs, and goals.  Such a tool would allow SDR developers to simulate design alternatives and visualize them while determining and analyzing design preferences for selection.  This work describes the considerations, development, and use of a proof-of-concept model for trade space visualization of simple, single-RF-chain SDR receiver design to show the merits and feasibility of trade space visualization for SDR system design.  For this work, system components were cataloged into SDR receiver component databases (SR-CDs), an SDR receiver model (SDR-RM) was developed, and an existing trade space visualization tool was leveraged that was developed at the Applied Research Laboratory (ARL) at The Pennsylvania State University called the ARL Trade Space Visualizer (ATSV).\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1764], "author_name_tesi": "Davidson, Erik James", "last_name_ssi": "Davidson", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Erik", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sven G Bilen", "Sven G Bilen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sven G Bilen, Thesis Advisor", "Sven G Bilen, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["visualization", "trade space", "ATSV", "SDR", "Software-Defined Radio", "trade space exploration"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Testing an Interactionist Theory of Treatment Engagement in a Prison-Based Therapeutic Community", "id": "14812kbd5175", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14812", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The prison-based therapeutic community (TC) is a promising drug and alcohol treatment program that emphasizes sobriety and desistance through group interaction and individual responsibility. While program evaluations have demonstrated positive results, the cognitive, behavioral, and social processes that define the prison-based TC, processes that ultimately separate those who desist from those who relapse, are largely absent from prior research. In particular, the TC model rests on the assumption that residents increase their treatment engagement and willingness to change through peer interactions and positive role modeling, but this social interactionist process has received virtually no research attention. TC-PINS (Therapeutic Community Prison Inmate Network Study) data collected over ten months captures self appraisals, reflected appraisals, and peer appraisals of resident willingness to change, tracing alignment of those appraisals over time in treatment. In this thesis, I explore peer-driven mechanisms of the TC model by examining the alignment of residents\u2019 appraisals over time and by predicting within-person changes in treatment engagement by changes in the appraisal measures.  Results suggest that self, peer, and reflected appraisals tend to converge over time and that changes in reflected appraisals are most predictive of changes in treatment engagement over time in treatment. Such results, consistent with a symbolic interactionist perspective, inform prison-based treatment programming and contribute to research on individual-level trajectories of desistance and substance use recovery.

In addition, the incidence and duration of OM in these infants and toddlers was evaluated.  Finally, the ages of the children studied were analyzed to determine if it was a factor affecting these four issues.\n\tDuring this longitudinal study, 10,245 weekly health screenings were attempted on 132 daycare-attending children between 6 months to just over 36 months of age.  A complete pneumatic otoscopy examination for each ear was completed for only 60% of all health screenings.  However, a complete tympanometry measurement for each ear was completed for 84% of all screenings.  If a complete pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry evaluation was obtained, the child was more likely to be diagnosed with OM, suggesting that OM may be under diagnosed.  The ability to complete pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry improved with age. \n\tStatistically significant differences were noted for all of the pneumatic otoscopy descriptors and tympanometry measures except ear canal volume (ECV) based on ear health diagnosis (healthy versus OM).  However, neither pneumatic otoscopy nor tympanometry was an ideal tool to diagnose OM in this group of children.  Pneumatic otoscopy was often difficult to obtain, particularly if the children were under 24 months of age.  Further, even though most tympanometry measures were statistically different between groups, several of the tympanometry measures did not clearly distinguish healthy ears from ears with OM due to measurement overlap.  Age was a significant factor in all pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry measures.\n\tThese children were frequently ill.  Only 40% of health screening diagnoses were classified as healthy.  Ninety-nine percent (99%) of the children suffered from at least one episode of OM.  The average child had OM for 20 weeks during their participation in the study.  Nearly half of the children were labeled as Chronic OM even though their experience with OM was due primarily to episodes of unilateral (rather than bilateral) OM.  This finding suggests that the current definition of Chronic OM may need to be re-evaluated.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2843], "author_name_tesi": "Davie, Jackie M.", "last_name_ssi": "Davie", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Jackie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Sciences and Disorders", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas A Frank", "Ingrid Maria Blood", "Adele Miccio", "Robert Anthony Prosek", "Stephen Petrill"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas A Frank, Committee Chair", "Ingrid Maria Blood, Committee Member", "Adele Miccio, Committee Member", "Robert Anthony Prosek, Committee Member", "Stephen Petrill, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["otitis media", "pneumatic otoscopy", "tympanomtery", "chronic OM"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU):  The Evolution of Transmedial to Spherical Modes of Production", "id": "td96k248x", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12542", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As a brand, Marvel has undergone large changes in the past thirty years.  They have gone from a popular comic book brand, to bankruptcy, to a licenser of products, to an independent film studio, and finally ended up as the latest branch in the super conglomerate Disney.  The brand has been a popular topic of study, as the past few years have seen Marvel grow to be the most lucrative franchise in film history.  Past studies have either focused on Marvel's trade story and the economic backdrop that led to such success, or the cultural elements of the films such as plot and theme. In this paper, I want to construct a fusion of these two narratives while taking a close at Marvels past and present.   While fusing the cultural and economic elements of the Marvel brand, I have discovered a distinct new paradigm of production and storytelling that will change the relationship consumers have to franchises.   What makes Marvel different is that their franchises utilize a spherical model of production. What I mean to suggest by this spherical model is that many franchises are being linked together through character cross overs between films in different franchises.  The metaphorical visualization of such a process could be thought of as a sphere, since the many connections can be rotated and perceived from different angles and origins.  Why has this strategy not been used in the past, and where did Marvel get the idea for such a bold paradigm shift?  I argue that these two questions can only be answered together, and to do so requires a sharp examination of the economic and cultural landscapes surrounding Marvel in the past thirty years. Marvel will fade as time moves forward, but the paradigm they will leave behind is why this study is so important.  Already, companies are making an attempt to emulate this model (as will be explained in greater detail).   As consumers, we may be witnessing a shift in the way we view franchises.

I find that, contrary to standard theory, the APD contract maintains or exceeds the Push contract in terms of both retailer and supplier profits, suggesting that a Push contract should never be considered when an APD contract is a possibility.\n\nIn Chapter 3 I narrow the focus of the dissertation and consider only Pull contracts.  I investigate three Pull contracts in a controlled laboratory environment: a wholesale price contract and two coordinating contracts.  The primary result of this section is that the theoretical benefit of the two coordinating contracts over the wholesale price contract does not perfectly translate into practice.  Instead, subjects set wholesale prices too high and the second contract parameter too low in the coordinating contracts.  I explore alternative models to explain this behavior and find that a model of anticipated regret fits the data well.\n\nIn Chapter 4 I again narrow the dissertation's focus and study service-level agreements (SLAs), a type of contract where a retailer pays a bonus to a supplier when the supplier satisfies a certain fraction of the retailer's demand (fill rate).  Specifically, I investigate a unique class of SLAs which I call \"Grace\" SLAs.  Grace SLAs consider the fill rate separately for each stocking decision, as opposed to aggregating the fill rate, and awards the bonus if the fill rate is achieved a certain number of times out of all stocking decisions.  I find that Grace SLAs increase both retailer and supplier profitability beyond that of a wholesale price contract in a number of scenarios.

When macromolecules exist in high concentrations, media exhibit non-ideal solution chemistry that can have a variety of chemical effects on a biomolecule of interest. One consequence of macromolecular crowding is aqueous phase separation, wherein one solution multiple distinct phases exist. Such phase separation has been directly observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm and has been hypothesized to be the basis for microcompartmentalization due to the partitioning of biomolecules. The resultant localization of cellular activity may be a means of metabolic control, though due to the inherent complexity of the cell it has been difficult to elucidate the importance of this cellular phase separation.

Examples of experimental model systems that mimic the crowded cytoplasm and nucleoplasm are described with focus on the microcompartmentalization of biomolecules and enzymatic activities. Chapter 2 introduces the kinetic analysis of coupled enzyme reactions within a heterogeneous biphasic system of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sodium citrate. A mathematical model is employed to describe the observed behavior and is able to accurately predict product formation under different experimental conditions. The model is constructed on the basis of biomolecule partitioning and the enzymatic rates in each phase, which differs substantially for horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the PEG-rich phase. This study exposes the importance of substrate mass transfer across the available interface of the phase compartments. Chapter 3 expands on this work in effort to explain the observed effects of PEG on the kinetics of HRP. Michaelis-Menten kinetic assays are performed for two different HRP substrates in a variety of crowding agents and cosolutes. The substrates differ in their relative hydrophobicity, which leads to different reaction rates within solutions of different crowding agents and cosolutes. Diffusion NMR studies demonstrate that the diffusion of the more hydrophobic substrate is hindered in the relatively hydrophobic PEG. Macromolecule solution chemistry is often thought of in regard to its effects on enzymes, however this work shows that interactions with substrates must be considered as well. Chapter 4 investigates the sequential kinetics of enzymes from the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway within a PEG/dextran aqueous two-phase system. The purine enzymes are of interest because they have been shown to reversibly colocalize within the cell. In these studies, experimental assays are conducted so that the model described in Chapter 2 could be tailored to this system. Simulations are systematically conducted to determine at which conditions compartmentalization enhances product formation. This work illustrates the adaptability of such models and how they may be used to predict enhancements in activity through microcompartmentalization, which is important for understanding metabolic networks in vivo as well as for biotechnology purposes where several enzymes may be required to produce a desired product. Chapter 5 shifts the focus from studying kinetics within heterogeneous systems to fundamentally characterizing a temperature sensitive biphasic system composed of poly(uridylic acid) (polyU) and cellular polyamines that form a complex coacervate, which mimics RNA-rich cellular compartments. PolyU serves as a model RNA and polyamines are important cellular growth factors known to interact with nucleic acids. For comparison to cellular bodies, several fluorescently labeled nucleic acids and peptides are shown to partition to these coacervates and subsequently, the diffusivity of these molecules throughout the system is investigated with photobleaching microscopy techniques. These compartments prove to be highly dynamic, as are their cellular equivalents. \n     Overall, this thesis presents experimental systems that have furthered our understanding of the consequences of cellular phase separation. Mathematical models that account for biomolecule partitioning can accurately describe experimental kinetics within biphasic systems, a mechanism the cell undoubtedly takes advantage of through the formation of cellular phase compartments, which can be formed solely with a model nucleic acid and common cellular polyamines. These experimental and mathematical approaches can be applied to various other systems as illustrated throughout this work.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9882], "author_name_tesi": "Davis, Bradley William", "last_name_ssi": "Davis", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Bradley", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating", "Philip C.

The effects of climate change on distributions of individual species do not occur in isolation but instead are the outcome of interactions between climate, co-occurring species, and the physical environment in which interactions occur. However, current models do not consider community dynamics or complex interactions between climate and the physical environment, making it difficult to predict how community assemblages will be affected. For wetland communities, in particular, shifts in regional climate are likely to have profound and ongoing effects on site suitability and as a result, species composition. We examined how patterns of amphibian occurrence responded to extreme climate events at St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge from 2009 \u2013 2014, where fluctuations in precipitation have resulted in periods of extreme drought as well as expansive flooding. High rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Debby in 2012 allowed for the colonization of predatory fishes to many previously isolated wetlands. Using long-term monitoring data, we parameterized a set of dynamic multispecies occupancy models that incorporate habitat dynamics and species interactions to investigate the occurrence dynamics of three representative amphibian species in response to changing water availability (Chapter 1). Additionally, we investigate how an adaptation to variable environmental conditions \u2013 facultative paedomorphism, as exhibited in one of these three species \u2013 further structures responses to these disturbance events (Chapter 2). \n     Drought and predatory fishes had differing effects on amphibian occurrence dynamics for each of the three species we examined. The occupancy of ornate chorus frogs (Pseudacris ornata), a species that preferentially selects ephemeral wetlands to breed, increased from 30% to 50% of surveyed wetlands during periods of drought in 2010 \u2013 2011. Mole salamander (Ambystoma talpoideum) occupancy, however, decreased from 40% to 25% due to the reduction of wetland hydroperiod at this time. For both of these species, fishes negatively impacted occurrence; wetlands occupied by fish were rarely, if ever, colonized by either the ornate chorus frog or the mole salamander. Despite the ability to modify its phenotype in favorable environmental conditions, the mole salamander occupied less than 20% of wetlands by 2014, suggesting that conditions remained unfavorable for this species, in particular. Pig frog (Rana grylio) occupancy, however, was not influenced by changes in climate during the study or changes in fish presence on the refuge. Projecting community composition under various climate scenarios (i.e., future increases in drought and/or flood frequency), we further demonstrate that responses to changing water availability are linked to species traits, characteristics of individual wetlands, and the interaction between climate and the physical environment. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11177], "author_name_tesi": "Davis, Courtney Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Davis", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Courtney", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Andrew Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Andrew Miller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Amphibian communities", "climate change", "multispecies occupancy"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "RELATIONS AMONG MEDITATION EXPERIENCE, MINDFULNESS, \nDIFFERENTIATION OF SELF, AND COUNTERTRANSFERENCE MANAGEMENT\n\n\n", "id": "11671", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1484", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Given that research supports that therapists\u2019 individual differences can facilitate positive client outcome or impede therapy, better understanding what mechanisms can contribute to countertransference management qualities can help further therapists\u2019 training and development, and subsequently lead to more successful treatment.

Since the acceleration received by radiation pressure increases as the spacecraft nears the Sun, missions to inner solar system planets are commonly proposed. Finding optimal trajectories for such missions can be difficult because the equations of motion must be solved numerically and the optimization problem includes many nonlinear constraints. One technique that has good shown good results is direct collocation with non-linear programming (DCLNP). The method sets up the problem as a non-linear programming problem which is traditionally solved with a method that requires gradient information. However, such solvers generally need a good initial guess to converge. This research found that the trajectory optimization problem formulated as a DCLNP and optimized with the evolutionary algorithm, NSGA II, can be used to create sub-optimal trajectories for the solar sail spacecraft. Although DCNLP includes a number of nonlinear algebraic constraints, these cannot be satisfied exactly with an evolutionary algorithm. Therefore, Pareto multi-objective optimization was used to minimize error in these constraints, while also minimizing the time-of-flight.

The second part of this thesis investigated the carbon mitigation of bioenergy relative to forest or grassland sequestration and alternative transportation energy carriers.  Essentially, this thesis asks--is there enough existing agricultural land to supply both food and bioenergy land demand, and if so, what is the relative merit of pursuing bioenergy as a carbon mitigation strategy?   Global and U.S. agricultural land use patterns were examined in terms of food consumption, crop or livestock productivity, or waste.  In the U.S., we found healthier diets and reducing waste in the food supply system could spare 8.6 to 64 million hectares (Mha).  This land could be used for bioenergy without conflicting with food security.  Globally, future population increases and reducing food insecurity will require significantly more food.  The type of diet, and in particular ruminant meat and dairy consumption, have a key impact on land use\u2014however, even low levels of meat consumption could lead to significant expansion of agricultural land at higher rates of crop productivity.  Future rates of crop productivity are expected to continue to increase but at a slower rate due to climate change and other factors.  Globally, we found that regardless of increases in yield or dietary scenarios, when future population growth is considered, currently existing supplies of agricultural land are quickly outstripped, likely leading to large scale deforestation or habitat destruction.  This result contradicts previously published reports purporting a surplus of land\u2014a key shortcoming of this previous work is that pasture land demand for ruminants was not considered, and, researchers implicitly assumed all pasture land is suitable for bioenergy (SCOPE 2015).  A detailed examination using two models of crop suitability showed most pasture is not capable of supporting unirrigated food or bioenergy crops.  Thus, if we only consider future demand for cropland for food and bioenergy, and this demand is low, then there is enough suitable pasture land to divert to crop production; but if either food or bioenergy land demand is moderate or high, then there is an insufficient supply of existing agricultural land and deforestation or grassland habitat destruction is likely to occur.  These results only considered projected increases in cropland and not pasture.  If future demand for both cropland and pasture is considered for food production, then there is no spare existing agricultural land for bioenergy.   In part two, this thesis then examined the carbon mitigation of bioenergy to forest or grassland sequestration on the land spared in the U.S. due to a shift in diet or reduction of waste.  We found current bioenergy has much greater carbon benefits than grasslands.  Current bioenergy offers less or equivalent carbon reductions as forest sequestration, but theoretical future bioenergy has greater carbon reduction than forest sequestration.  In relation to other energy carriers (electricity, hydrogen, etc.), we found bioenergy could be a low carbon source of energy, and could offer deep emission reductions if emissions from land use change (deforestation) can be avoided.  If land use change is not avoided, then future biofuels do not reduce emissions as much as future electric vehicles or fuel cells.  If land use change is avoided then carbon reductions of biofuels are equivalent or higher than electric vehicles or fuel cells.  Given the results from part one of this thesis, unless there is a fundamental shift away from beef consumption, or, a halting to population growth, additional land demand from large-scale bioenergy will cause land use change and release carbon stores.  However, there are alternatives to shifting land from food to bioenergy--riparian corridors could be planted in perennial bioenergy crops to reduce eutrophication; urban environments along interstates, rail, and powerlines could supply biomass; novel crop rotations that used bioenergy crops in extended fallows, or hay-bioenergy, could supply biomass while maintaining food production; perennial strips could be intercropped to control erosion; or biomass could rehabilitate brownfields, marginal or degraded land.  Use of these alternative types of land would likely limit biomass supplies and reduce bioenergy supply\u2014perhaps to fuel heavy duty vehicles, shipping, or aviation.  This thesis shows there is real and considerable risk of bioenergy conflicting with food security for land, but this conflict, while very challenging, is not inevitable, and if currently managed lands can supply bioenergy, then reconciling enhanced food security and developing low carbon fuels is theoretically possible.

As a poet with theoretical interests, then, I have created an academic study that examines twentieth- and twenty-first-century American poetry, but with a twist: I double-down (or meta-up) by also thinking more deeply about critical works by poets, and, even more specifically, about the strange linguistic idiom often produced at the intersection of poetry and criticism. Rather than talk about what volumes of poetry \"mean\" (to suggest that they're \"about\" something people have missed) or import theories in order to evaluate texts, my project\u2019s method begins by situating poetry collections *as* theoretical documents.\n\nThe commitment of Idiomatics looks to resituate poetry\u2019s language production as logical and critical starting points for producing or challenging social and theoretical knowledges. Poetry deliberates about the world by attending to ways of knowing and acting that have emerged from subjugation or distortion, and that have the potential to raise new insights about the social world. This study offers an explicit and rigorous idiomatic engagement with the material, aesthetic, and socialized identity experiences shaped by poetry and philosophies of reality found therein.\n\nTaking its critical-creative discursive cross-pollination one step further, this study also develops a critical language that is, at times, inflected (stylistically) by both criticism and poetics. The close attention and response to language is finally what \u201cidiomatics\u201d is all about. The existing theoretic, aesthetic, and cultural overlaps between criticism and poetry demand that we take seriously the need to revive cultural and critical idioms inflected by considerations of the theory of poetry, as well as the poetics of theory. This project\u2019s approach, accordingly, looks to hone in on the ways in which literary representation works through and toward more singular, critical-creative idioms in order to produce new modes, tools, and sites of critical and theoretical inquiry.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9812], "author_name_tesi": "Davis, Geffrey M", "last_name_ssi": "Davis", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Geffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Nealon", "Garrett Sullivan Jr.", "Aldon Lynn Nielsen", "Janet Wynne Lyon", "Jonathan Paul Eburne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Nealon, Dissertation Advisor", "Garrett Sullivan Jr., Committee Chair", "Aldon Lynn Nielsen, Committee Member", "Janet Wynne Lyon, Committee Member", "Jonathan Paul Eburne, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Poetry", "Literary Criticism", "Idiom", "American", "Modern", "Contemporary"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "THE WORKING SELF AND THE SUBJECT OF FREEDOM:\nMICHEL FOUCAULT\u2019S ANALYTICS OF LIBERALISM AND THE WORK \nETHIC AS A TECHNIQUE OF LIBERAL GOVERNMENTALITY\n", "id": "6543", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2104", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-01-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation I explore how the work ethic plays an important role in the government of modern life, specifically, how we use it to govern ourselves and govern others.  First, I consider how Foucault's concept of government as \"conduct of conduct\" can be useful in coming to terms with the ways in which liberalism (as an art of government that is always suspicious of governing too much) governs, even in those spaces usually considered \"free from\" government.  Using Foucault's notion of government, and the related notion of governmentality reveals ways that we are governed \"beyond the state,\" i.e., through various techniques of the self and techniques of domination.\n\nSecond, this dissertation provides an overview of Foucault's \"critical ontology\" of liberalism; Foucault\u2019s work on disciplinary power and bio-politics, I argue, provides a useful critique that reveals how the space of freedom is actually constituted by specific political practices and how the production of this space assumes a specific kind of liberal subject, which is the product of disciplinary and bio-political regimes.  Assessing Foucault\u2019s body of work though this \"governmentality\" lens reveals a more continuous line of thought concerned not only with power and subjectivity, but also government.  \n\nFinally, I use this Foucault inspired approach to political theory to examine how the work ethic operates as a technique of liberal government in the contemporary United States. Specifically, I focus on how the work ethic has informed psychiatric definitions of normality and how our assumptions about normal subjectivity have led to an individualization of the causes of poverty and unemployment, further marginalizing the poor and unemployed. Ultimately we must rethink the nature of freedom with the knowledge that we are never truly \"free from\" government. By engaging in what Foucault calls a critical ontology of our limits, we might begin to grasp how things as seemingly benign as the work ethic govern us in specific ways and how we use them to force others to govern themselves accordingly.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2085], "author_name_tesi": "Davis, George V.", "last_name_ssi": "Davis", "middle_name_ssi": "V.", "first_name_ssi": "George", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nancy Love", "Holloway Sparks", "Marie Hojnacki", "John Philip Christman", "Daniel Joseph Conway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nancy Love, Committee Chair", "Holloway Sparks, Committee Member", "Marie Hojnacki, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Daniel Joseph Conway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Work Ethic", "Foucault", "Government", "Governmentality"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "HIGH-FIDELITY MULTI-PHYSICS COUPLING FOR PREDICTION OF ANISOTROPIC POWER AND TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION IN FUEL ROD: IMPACT ON HYDRIDE DISTRIBUTION", "id": "19119", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9109", "abstract_tesi": "Hydrogen absorbed into the nuclear fuel cladding during reactor exposure is distributed in highly inhomogeneous fashion as a result of temperature and stress gradients. To correctly describe and predict this hydrogen distribution there exists a need for multi-physics coupling to provide accurate heterogeneous temperature distributions in the cladding. The Department of Energy (DOE) recognized the need for better hydrogen modeling, and generously sponsored a project at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) to investigate this need under the Nuclear Energy University Programs (NEUP). Furthermore, this study was conducted with the idea of a two-fold approach: 1. Combine accurate high-fidelity thermal-hydraulic models for heat transfer, reactor physics models for neutron flux, and thermal-mechanics models for fuel performance calculations to acquire detailed temperature and stress distributions in the fuel rod; 2. Analytically model and experimentally test the temperature and/or stress dependent hydrogen pick-up, diffusion, and precipitation in nuclear fuel cladding. The work and results specific to this thesis fall under the first part of the two-fold approach. Further detailing the first part, combination of the computational models is achieved by coupling a subchannel code to a neutronics code and a fuel performance code. The thermal-hydraulics code chosen is COBRA-TF (CTF), which is a subchannel code that was modernized and further developed at PSU.

This data was, in turn, used to generate the temperature and stress distributions in the cladding. To do this, CTF was coupled to the fuel performance code BISON. BISON is a finite element code developed by Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to study all aspects of thermal and mechanical behavior of fuel rods in the reactor core.

In this thesis, a feedback-based solution to automatically track a selected target is proposed and implemented, based on object motion in different parts of the scene and experimentation is performed to illustrate fulfillment of the Pan Tilt Zoom operations of the camera while tracking test subjects in real-time.   The approach uses Consensus Based Matching and Tracking of Keypoints to track the centroids of the objects.  After each frame, the algorithm updates the location of the object centroid relative to the center of the camera\u2019s point of view.  With the proposed real-time tracking system, this location is then used to calculate what direction and by how many degrees does the camera need to move so that the object of interest is contained with the camera\u2019s center of view.  This solution can be even be extended to function on multiple cameras tracking a single object, allowing to factor in other elements such as depth perception, or even the expanded to function as part of a fully autonomous localization and navigation systems for unmanned vehicles and robots.

The present study also examined crossover by testing the associations between mothers\u2019 daily work experiences and children\u2019s positive and negative affect, as well as the associations between children\u2019s daily experiences and mothers\u2019 affect. Youth age and gender were treated as moderators. Multilevel models revealed both between- and within-family differences in these processes. Evidence of negative work-to-family spillover included the finding that mothers with high interpersonal stressors at the hotel were described by their children as more stressed when they came home from work than mothers with no interpersonal stressors. Further, adolescents (aged 13-18) but not children (aged 10-12) rated their mothers with high interpersonal stressors as more tired after work, on average. On days mothers had work overloads, they were more tired after work. Contrary to expectations, mothers\u2019 daily positive work experiences were associated with negative outcomes, such as the finding that on days when mothers experienced positive events at work with coworkers, children (not adolescents) reported that mothers were more stressed after work. There was no evidence of family-to-work spillover, nor was there evidence of positive spillover or crossover. There was some evidence of negative crossover. On days when mothers had interpersonal stressors, boys (not girls) reported having lower positive affect. Children\u2019s daily experiences were also linked to maternal affect: On days when youth had arguments with others, not their parents, mothers reported lower positive affect the same day.

First, photoexcitation studies delve further into the fundamental phenomena of clusters. One of the processes considered is the emission of a delayed atomic ion upon photoexcitation of a molecular beam of metal-carbon clusters. The origin of this delayed atomic ion is uncovered by simultaneously studying the delayed ionization of zirconium and titanium carbides using species produced with a mixed metal alloy rod in a standard laser vaporization source coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. These experiments have provided the ability to observe, for the first time, both the zirconium and titanium delayed atomic ions concurrently. Through an extensive investigation of clusters formed under these conditions, the origin of the delayed atomic ions is elucidated and a mechanism is proposed. The mechanism states that the delayed atomic ion is a product of a delayed ion-pair separation that is formed due to the excitation of the MC2 molecule to a compilation of Rydberg states near its ionization threshold. The detection of C2- following excitation of MxCy clusters provides further evidence of this mechanism being the source of the delayed M+ emission.\nFurthermore, the design and calibration of an anion photoelectron spectrometer is discussed in this thesis. Copper anions are isolated using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The copper anion is then excited to its neutral state by removing an electron. The photodetached electron is analyzed by a \u201cvelocity map imaging\u201d photoelectron spectrometer, which determines its kinetic energy. This information allows for the determination of copper\u2019s photoelectron spectrum, which provides insight into its electron affinity that can be used as a calibrant to aide the study of clusters in future experiments.\nThe second theme of this thesis regards a new protocol that is proposed providing a pathway to producing materials with clusters as their building blocks. Through a synergistic effort by Professor Castleman\u2019s research group, Professor S. N. Khanna\u2019s research group, and Professor A. Sen\u2019s research group that combined results of gas phase, theoretical and synthetic research, the feasibility of this procedure is demonstrated by making a solid via assembly and comprised of As7K3 units identified as being a stable magic cluster in the gas phase. X-ray diffraction and theoretical studies show the material to have rings consisting of As7 and K units as its building block. To our knowledge, the example presented herein offers the first viable protocol for accomplishing successful passage from free gas-phase clusters to cluster-crystals.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3486], "author_name_tesi": "Davis, Kevin Matthew", "last_name_ssi": "Davis", "middle_name_ssi": "Matthew", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "J B Anderson", "John V Badding", "Karen Eklund"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Chair", "J B Anderson, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Karen Eklund, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metal carbide", "met-car", "cluster", "photoelectron spectroscopy", "delayed ionization"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Second Language Phonological Acquisition: The Role of Musical Aptitude\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12171", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "3311", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It has long been suggested that those with greater musical aptitude possess an advantage when learning foreign languages; such hypotheses have been around since the early twentieth century.  There are many structural, cognitive, and neural similarities between language and music.  Both language and music operate in the acoustic realm, stringing a finite set of sounds together to form longer and more meaningful sequences.  These sounds involved in music and language are made of several frequencies as well. One also finds similar mismatched negativity effects in language and music: a speech stream that contains a syntactic violation produces the same MMN effect as a musical sequence that contains an analogous violation in key-modulation.  In recent years, more and more evidence has pointed to language and music using a shared system of sound acquisition for creating mental representations of sounds.\nTo test this hypothesis, twenty-five undergraduate students enrolled in the Basic Spanish Language Program here at Penn State performed tasks which test their musical aptitude, working memory, and an information suppression task.  Then, they are asked to say a list of common Spanish words\u2014once by reading the list of words one at a time from a computer screen, and the second time by repeating the words after a native speaker.  Results show that those with higher scores on the musical aptitude test had pronounced certain speech sounds closer to native speaker norms than those participants with lower musical aptitude.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3298], "author_name_tesi": "Davis, Kristopher Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Davis", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Kristopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chip Gerfen", "Dr Chip Gerfen", "Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "John Andres Ochoa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chip Gerfen, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Chip Gerfen, Committee Chair", "Paola Eulalia Dussias, Committee Member", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member", "John Andres Ochoa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Accent", "Language", "Phonetics", "Individual Differences", "Accentedness", "Music", "Phonology"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Prediction of Indirect Losses, Direct Losses, and Seismic Resilience of Aging Highway Bridges", "id": "25039", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11309", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Natural disasters over the past decades, especially earthquakes, have caused varying levels of devastation to transportation systems around our nation.  Bridges are typically the most vulnerable components of the transportation network during severe seismic excitations. Bridges are also prone to other natural phenomena that can lead to significant damage to its structural health over its intended or reduced life span. Some of these natural phenomena cause the bridge to \u201cage\u201d, affecting the overall bridge performance resulting in partial to complete bridge failure. One way a bridge responds to either phenomenon is characterized by its resilience.\n\nWithin the scope of this study, one of the primary focuses was to assess a bridge sector for a pre-defined seismic event to estimate the financial costs. The full extent of the damage to this bridge does not only surround the costs associated with the bridge rehabilitation, but it also includes the costs associated with the delays faced by bridge users and the impacted highway network. These costs are just one of the factors that influence the seismic resilience of a given bridge system. The seismic resilience of a bridge relates to how well the bridge performs during seismic activity and the length of time it takes to reach some percentage of its original functionality. This resilience can be predicted with mathematical derivations that incorporate the results of a vulnerability analysis of the bridge for a given ground excitation, an assessment of the costs incurred from the earthquake damage, and an in depth look into how the bridge recovers.\n\nThroughout this thesis, the seismic resilience of the targeted bridge sector will be further investigated for each of the three factors. However, the first intended outcome of this research is to shed light on a comprehensive recovery model for variable bridge damage and to create a MATLAB function that can compute direct and indirect losses given specified data inputs. In addition, a secondary outcome is to apply these findings to a bridge network that experienced aging over its life cycle due to the corrosion of structural steel components.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10848], "author_name_tesi": "Davis, Lindeon Sherlock", "last_name_ssi": "Davis", "middle_name_ssi": "Sherlock", "first_name_ssi": "Lindeon", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Swagata Banerjee Basu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Swagata Banerjee Basu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["indirect losses", "direct losses", "resilience", "bridge", "recovery", "sigmoidal", "corrosion", "aging", "highway", "seismic"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Daughters Reading and Responding to African American Young Adult Literature: The Umoja Book Club\n", "id": "9338", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4244", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation details efforts undertaken by the researcher to address a group of African American adolescent girls\u2019 need for positive role models and Black female-centered spaces where discussions of issues such as Black female identity, voice, and relationships could take place.  During the 2005-2006 school year, I facilitated a book club with ninth and tenth grade girls participating in the Umoja Youth Empowerment Program.  This book club provided an opportunity for teen girls to read and discuss with peers and adult mentors issues in young adult texts written by African American female authors.  This book club aimed to examine how African American female readers discussed African American young adult literature (AAYAL) in an out-of-school context. \n     In Chapter One, I outline the theoretical framework that undergirds this study.  It is largely informed by feminist and Black feminist/womanist theories that offer a way to discuss social, personal, cultural, and literacy issues concerning African American adolescent girls and women.  Chapter Two describes the youth empowerment group from which participants were recruited and details my data collection methods and analysis procedures.  In Chapter Three, I present the results of my textual analysis of AAYA novels read in the book club.  I use Black feminist literary criticism to analyze works by Sharon Flake, Rita Williams-Garcia, and Connie Porter and to demonstrate how these authors use AAYA fiction as a tool to tell Black girls\u2019 and women\u2019s stories and to challenge the ways we view Black teenage girls.  Chapter Four reveals the most frequently discussed topics among participants during the book club: relationships with mothers, relationships with boys, and support and guidance for girls.  I employ Black feminist and reader-response theory to analyze the ways the girls responded to these topics.  In Chapter Five, I reflect on the research experience and emphasize the need for continued efforts to identify adolescent girls\u2019 personal, social, and cultural needs and to affirm their identities.

Here we present near equilibrium dissolution and precipitation results for quartz and forsterite.  For quartz, dissolution was expected to follow a simple first order kinetic model, but quartz studies at pH 8-10 and 125-200 \u00b0C indicate a more complex dissolution mechanism not easily normalized by solution chemistry.  Nucleation theory, which has been used by Dove to describe silicate dissolution, is used along with surface evolution models proposed by Bandstra and Brantley to describe near equilibrium kinetics.  Unlike quartz, understanding forsterite dissolution is complicated by incongruent magnesium-to-silicon release, leached layer formation, and the precipitation of a secondary magnesium-rich phase.  29Si magic angle spinning (MAS) and 1H-29Si cross polarization (CP) MAS nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of forsterite have identified a polymerized silicon rich leached layer on the forsterite surface for experiments conducted under acidic conditions at high temperature.  25Mg MAS, multiple quantum (MQ) MAS, quadrupolar Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (QCPMG), and 1H-25Mg CP QCPMG experiments have also been utilized to characterize the two nonequivalent magnesium sites in forsterite and examine the changing magnesium environment as a result of dissolution.\n     A NMR interrogation of hydrated albite glasses is also presented.  The presence of water in silicate systems has direct influence on the physical properties of melts including transition temperature, viscosity, conductivity, and density.  Therefore, studying the role of water in aluminosilicate glasses is essential in understanding a wide variety of geochemical processes.  NMR is a sensitive probe of both local structure and dynamics, and in this study 27Al MAS and MQMAS NMR experiments were performed on hydrated albite glasses created from quenched silicate melts. Optimized simulations of the 2D MQMAS spectra were performed and the extracted NMR parameters (chemical shift, quadrupolar coupling) were compared with literature values in making site-occupancy assignments. These results coupled with iterative fits to MAS spectra indicate a complex bonding environment which may include unreacted albite glass (Q4-Al), aluminum terminated with a single hydroxyl group (Q3-Al), or aluminum coordinated to a protonated oxygen linking Al-O-Si bonds (Q4-Al(Obr)).  We conclude that the mechanism of depolymerization contributes to the structural and physical properties of hydrous albite glass.  In addition, using an empirical relationship from the literature and the integrated intensities from MAS lineshapes, local bonding arrangements were quantified as a function of hydration.\n     In addition, studies of strontium in apatite and carbonate samples were also conducted.  87Sr QCPMG NMR results indicate the presence of two nonequivalent strontium environments corresponding to the two available sites for substitution in the crystal structure.  Strontium-calcium carbonate (CaxSr1-xCO3) solid solutions were synthesized and investigated with 87Sr QCPMG NMR.  Multiple strontium sites have been observed by 87Sr QCPMG NMR but the observed resonances were broadened by second order quadrupolar broadening causing significant overlap between different sites.  Future studies will try to elucidate the number of sites present by combining ab initio calculations with simulations of the strontium lineshapes using the computer package SIMPSON.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3988], "author_name_tesi": "Davis, Michael Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Davis", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller", "Karl Todd Mueller", "Alan James Benesi", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Brian Dempsey", "David J Wesolowski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller, Dissertation Advisor", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Chair", "Alan James Benesi, Committee Member", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Member", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "David J Wesolowski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Kinetics", "NMR", "Quartz", "Forsterite"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Student Affairs and the Black Experience: Exploring How Black and African American Student Affairs Staff Experience Race at Predominantly White Institutions ", "id": "19068", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8485", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Racism in the American workplace is a topic that not many organizations attempt to tackle.

Protons produced from the oxidation of organics at the anode result in anolyte acidification and reduce performance. A new method was used here to mitigate anolyte acidification based on adding non-buffered saline catholyte effluent from a previous cycle to the anolyte at the beginning of the next cycle. This method was tested using a larger-scale MDC (267 mL) containing four anode brushes and a three cell pair membrane stack. With an anolyte salt concentration increased by an equivalent of 75 mM NaCl using the catholyte effluent, salinity was reduced by 26.0 \u00b1 0.5% (35 g/L NaCl initial solution) in a 10 hour cycle, compared to 18.1 \u00b1 2.0% without catholyte addition. This improvement was primarily due to the increase in buffering capacity of the anolyte, although increased conductivity slightly improved performance as well. There was some substrate loss from the anolyte by diffusion into the membrane stack, but this was decreased from 11% to 2.6% by increasing the anolyte conductivity (7.6 to 14 mS/cm). These results demonstrated that catholyte effluent can be utilized as a useful product for mitigating anolyte acidification and improving MDC performance.

Removal of the hydrophobic region results in an excised heme-binding domain of approximately 100 residues (referred to in this document as \u201ccyt b5\u201d), the solubility properties of which make it suitable for spectroscopic study in aqueous solutions.  Cyt b5 can be further sub-divided into residues responsible for the formation of two hydrophobic cores.  The first of these cores (core 1) forms the contacts between the protein and bound heme and loses most of its secondary structure in the apoprotein state.  The second hydrophobic core (core 2) is responsible for stabilization of a scaffold that retains its secondary and tertiary structure in the apoprotein state.  \nThe secondary structure of the holoprotein is described sequentially by &#61538;1-H1-&#61538;4-&#61538;3-H2-H3-&#61538;5-H4-H5-&#61538;2-H6.  This is the &#61537;-&#61538; topology that defines the cyt b5 fold.  In this study, the role of local interactions in the behavior of apo- and holocyt b5 was investigated using peptide fragments.  Each fragment was designed to preserve the ability to sample the secondary structure of the native holoprotein state, while eliminating conformational restraints arising from higher order structure in the protein.  In this way, the effect of sequence on structural propensity in both the presence and absence of heme coud be examined.\nOne of the elements of secondary structure of interest was the C-terminal 310 helix, H6.  The sequence of this helix starts with HPDD and, with respect to the cis-trans isomerization of the Xxx-Pro bond, contains a potentially catalytic, positively-charged imidazolium side chain (His80).  In the apoprotein, H6 fluctuates between two states.  The conformational exchange is slow on the NMR chemical shift time scale,  The peptidyl-prolyl bond of the model peptide for helix H6 (H6P-1) was found by NMR spectroscopy to isomerize at rates inconsistent with the fluctuations observed in this region of the intact apoprotein,.  This led to the conclusion that a cis-trans isomerization event did not account for the minor conformer observed in apocyt b5.  NMR data demonstrated that the peptide sampled a native-like conformation including an N-capping interaction between His80 and Asp82, implicating it as a possible nucleation site for protein folding.  \nIn the apoprotein, the region binding the heme (H2\u2013H5) is partially disordered.  Peptide models of the heme binding loop and its variants were examined by NMR and CD spectroscopy in the presence of TFE to determine the relative helical propensity of each region (H2\u2013H5).  CD and NMR in TFE solutions demonstrated that H2 and H3 contained small, but significant helical propensity and sequence-encoding for the intervening turn.  The H4 region of the binding loop proved to have the least helical propensity of the four regions.  CD experiments showed that replacement of Asp60 with an Arg residue acted to stabilize H4 through an electrostatic interaction (most likely with Glu56).  Increased stability of the D60R holoprotein variant was consistent with the native-like stabilization provided by the putative side chain interaction.  An Asn-to-Pro substitution at position 57 proved to have little effect on helical propensity of H4, indicating that the observed stability of the corresponding holoprotein variant was the result of complex interactions in the apo- and holoprotein states.\nTo model H4 and H5, covalently conjugated mesoheme-peptide compounds were synthesized.  UV-visible spectroscopy revealed a strained bis-histidine coordination state in the constructs, but no appreciable helix stabilization was detected in the attached peptides.  These results implied that the proximity and register of the loop termini imposed by the loop-core 2 contacts were crucial to the cofactor induced folding of core 1 in the protein.  Theses studies offered insights into the relationship among local structural propensity, loop-scaffold contacts and heme binding in core 1, as well as a potential protein folding nucleation site in core 2.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5093], "author_name_tesi": "Davis, Ronald B", "last_name_ssi": "Davis", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Ronald", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Juliette Lecomte", "Alan James Benesi", "John H Golbeck", "Philip C.

The Transportation Research Board in its 2000 Task Force on Women's Issues in Transportation identified a need to learn more about women leaders in transportation and their career paths.  Such new knowledge would help the transportation industry in the pursuit and hiring of women into transportation careers.  Additionally, such information would assist those females wishing to pursue a career in transportation.  The purpose of this study was to examine the career paths and professional challenges of women managers in major university and college transportation departments.\n     A theoretical model by Karaevli and Hall that shows how managerial adaptability develops from career variety over the span of a person's career was used as the study's conceptual framework.  Additionally, due to the lack of information related to women managers in transportation, demographic information of women managers in major university and college transportation departments was obtained.\n     Qualitative analysis was used to gather and analyze data about the career paths and professional challenges of women managers in major university and college transportation departments.  Descriptive statistics were used to gather valuable demographic information on the women managers.  Thirty-three women managers from universities and colleges with a student enrollment of 20,000 or more students participated in a survey developed to gain demographic information, information related to their career paths, and any information about professional challenges.  Twelve in-depth interviews were conducted with higher-level women managers in transportation.  Finally, a focus group comprised of five participants was conducted to verify and/or confirm findings from the in-depth interviews.\n     The findings from the study resulted in the following three themes:  \"Climbing the Ladder;\" \"Experience is the Key;\" and \"Support of the Administration.\"  Most of the women managers rose within the ranks of their department rather than moving between various external work experiences.  And, in terms of those work experiences, experience assumed the dominant role over training and education in relationship to preparing for managerial positions in these transportation departments.  Most participants agreed that in order to be successful in their positions they also needed the support of the university or college administration.\n     Additional findings from this study provide demographic information that can be used to help build a base of knowledge for the topic of women in transportation.  All of the women participating in the study were over the age of thirty-one years old with the majority over forty-one.  The majority of these women were married with almost half with children still residing in their homes.  Over half of them possessed a four-year degree.  When identifying the career variety of these women managers the findings reflect a fairly low level of career variety, however when evaluated in terms of knowledge internal to the industry these women showed a high level of career variety.  Although the participants pursued advancement within their departments and in some cases, within their university or college, few were interested in pursuing career variety outside of those areas.  \n     Professional challenges were identified and discussed during the interviews.  The findings from these discussions indicated a variety of challenges ranging from issues related to working in a traditionally-male industry, to learning how to deal with the politics of the university and industry, to issues related to support or lack of support from the university or college administration.  Various issues related to communication were also identified.  Skills to handle such professional challenges were obtained more through previous work experiences and personality traits than any other areas.\n     The findings of the study led to recommendations for women wishing to pursue a profession in major university or college transportation departments and will add to the current body of knowledge on transportation as a career.

The results could aid in the use of nanowires, or other non-spherical particles, in areas such as electronic device manufacturing or analysis of biological particles.\n\nAnalysis of nanowire motion under electrokinetic forces was carried out using both experimental and numerical methods.  From our initial experiments we determined the average velocities of populations of nanowires.  The measured velocities were used to validate theoretical predictions of electrokinetic motion.  Numerical studies were used to study the motion of individual nanowires, focusing on interactions with the channel walls.  Nonsteady numerical studies and subsequent experiments demonstrated that an interaction with the channel walls caused the nanowires to oscillate in angle and position in the channel as they moved through the channel.\n\nControl over the position or orientation of the particles was explored through active and passive means.  A 90$^{circ}$ corner was shown to be a passive aid in aligning the nanowires.  As the nanowires traveled around the corner, the nonuniform electrical and flow fields caused the nanowires to align along the center of the channel.  To actively control the position or orientation of non-spherical particles, induced-charge electroosmosis (ICEO) was explored.  ICEO uses an AC electric field to induce motion around conducting features in the channels.  Numerical studies showed a wide range of control possibilities, while preliminary experiments demonstrated ICEO flows were present in the channel.\n\nThis research is consistent with previous theoretical predictions of electrokinetic motion of non-spherical particles and explores passive and active methods for motion control.

To assess the full extent of such impacts, one must consider the non-uniform interplay between the constituents of both physical and socio-economic systems. My dissertation research focuses on understanding the costs (direct and indirect) of North-Atlantic hurricanes on the US coastal economy and the role adaptation plays in fostering economic recovery and local resilience. \nThe first part of the dissertation investigates the effectiveness of various public adaptation measures provided under hazard mitigation and public assistance programs of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and local governments in relation to direct costs of disasters, given by property losses. Results indicate that wealth and economic exposure, together with infrastructure and socio-economic vulnerability, are the primary drivers for high costs from hurricanes in the United States. While major hurricanes can bring immense hazard to exposed counties, results show that counties with prior land-falling hurricanes are more resilient to disaster shocks. Clear evidence has been found about the importance of regulatory-based loss mitigation strategies as exhibited by improved building codes and effectiveness of enforcement. Results suggest that where to build (zoning, land-use planning, etc.) is a significant policy direction when complemented by how to build (building codes, retrofitting, etc.) policies. While non-structural and regulatory based projects are found to be extremely efficient in term of mitigating property losses, results also indicate that public protective measures may not always exhibit loss-reducing features and can, on the contrary, exacerbate costs. This is seen throughout by loss inducing features of major structural and infrastructural projects implemented by FEMA in hurricane impacted counties. \nThe second part of the dissertation focuses on understanding local labor market impacts of hurricane disasters and the role adaptation plays in mitigating these higher order impacts. Employing synthetic control methodology allows identifying not only the effects of the 2005 hurricanes on county quarterly employment and per worker earnings, but also investigating time to recovery to a hypothetical \u201cno-hurricane\u201d employment level, that was forgone because of devastations. Significant negative effects of hurricanes on employment are found in counties at the extreme end of damage distribution. Opportunity loss of employment due to the hurricanes is estimated at around 7.3% for these counties and shock is found to be very persistent, no complete recovery even 7 years after the 2005 hurricanes. Results show that the traded sector employment contracts by 6%, while the local services sector employment drops by 5-8%. Results indicate that the construction sector employment booms for only 5.5 years after the devastation, nonetheless this boom is not sufficient to spur employment in other local services sectors. We find large local multipliers of adverse shocks, one job lost in the traded sector implies around 7.13 jobs lost in the local services sector. Results indicate that where long-term mitigation programs are implemented by FEMA counties are more resilient to disaster shocks.  Counties, where flood hazard and non-structural mitigation projects are initiated by local governments, exhibit similar responses. Nonetheless, significant evidence of two sources of moral hazard problems are  found, one stems from the provision and generosity of disaster related public assistance spending, while another originates from unemployment insurance payments. \nInterestingly, the results from part I of the dissertation and those from part II are contradictory in that they indicate different sources of moral hazard. Specifically, when disaster impacts were proxied by property losses, we found that the FEMA Public Assistance programs promoted smooth community recovery, while major structural and infrastructural projects financed under the FEMA Mitigation program exacerbated losses and thus created moral hazard issues. On the contrary, when the impact is investigated in relation to local labor markets, results indicate that mitigation programs are more effective and moral hazard stems from public assistance programs and generous unemployment insurance payments. The significance of these finding is that it emphasizes the relativity of effectiveness of adaptation programs. There is no unified solution to address and cope with consequences of disasters; a solution provided in a certain context may create inefficiencies in another context. Continuous rebuilding of major structures and infrastructures, in the context of direct impacts of disasters, seem to perversely impact and limit individuals\u2019 adaptive behavior to protect their private properties. While in the context of labor markets, an individual\u2019s decision involves labor supply and subsequently public assistance transfers aftermath of hurricanes and unemployment insurance payments are found to be behavior distorting.\nMy dissertation work provides a significant contribution to the growing research area dealing with disaster impacts, vulnerability, adaptation aspects, thus helping to set the stage for more involved and cohesive research in areas related to environmental issues and climate change impacts. The dissertation is organized as follows. In chapter 1 effects of adaptation measures are investigated in relation to property losses of hurricanes. Chapter 2 deals with local labor market effects of hurricanes and reviews existing literature, presents conceptual framework and estimation strategy. Chapter 3 presents results and discussions related to hurricane impacts on county quarterly employment and per worker earnings, adaptation effects of higher order impacts of hurricanes as well as spillover effects of disasters. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8880], "author_name_tesi": "Davlasheridze, Meri ", "last_name_ssi": "Davlasheridze", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Meri", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Ann Fisher Vanden", "James Samuel Shortle", "Stephan J Goetz", "Jenni Evans", "H Allen Klaiber"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Ann Fisher Vanden, Dissertation Advisor", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Member", "Stephan J Goetz, Committee Member", "Jenni Evans, Committee Member", "H Allen Klaiber, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Natural Disasters", "Impacts", "Vulnerability", "Adaptation", "FEMA Programs", "Moral Hazard", "Hurricanes", "Local Labor Markets", "Spillovers"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Essays in Directed Search with Private Information", "id": "26188", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11478", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of two chapters, each of which is based on a theoretical research paper. The two chapters are related in that in both chapters I study models of directed (competitive) search with private information. However, some details of the environments and the questions addressed in each chapter are different.\nIn Chapter 1, I mainly address a normative question about the (in)efficiency of equilibrium, while the main question in Chapter 2 is how to characterize the equilibrium and what properties the equilibrium has.\n\nIn Chapter 1, I characterize the constrained efficient or planner\u2019s allocation in a directed search model with private information. In this economy, buyers post contracts and sellers with private information observe all postings and direct their search toward their preferred contract. Then buyers and sellers match bilaterally and trade. I define a planner whose objective is to maximize social welfare subject\nto the information and matching frictions of the environment. I show in my main result that if the market economy fails to achieve the first best, then the planner, using a direct mechanism, achieves strictly higher welfare than the market economy. I also derive conditions under which the planner achieves the first best. I show that\nthe planner can implement the direct mechanism by imposing submarket-specific\ntaxes and subsidies on buyers conditional on trade (sales tax).\n\nIn an asset market application, I show that in general the efficient sales tax schedule is non-monotone in the price of assets. This non-monotonicity makes the implementation of the direct mechanism difficult in practice. I show that if in addition to sales tax the planner can use entry tax, submarket-specific taxes and\nsubsidies imposed on buyers conditional on entry to each submarket whether they find a match or not, then the planner can implement the direct mechanism by using monotone tax schedules, increasing sales tax and decreasing entry tax.\n\nIn Chapter 2, I study a model in which firms invest in capital and post wages, and heterogeneous workers, who have private information about their skills, choose where to apply. Workers and firms match bilaterally. Each matched agent gets an exogenous payoff from the match before wages are paid. Each of these payoffs displays complementarity in capital and skill. I derive conditions under which the market exhibits PAM, positive assortative matching. Under these conditions, the firms over-invest in capital compared to the first best, because capital is used as a\nscreening device.\n\nI show that the fact that firms need to screen workers in the presence of private information changes the predictions of the model compared to that in the presence of complete information. In particular, I show that the complete information\nallocation exhibiting PAM is not necessary nor sufficient for the market allocation to exhibit PAM.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10992], "author_name_tesi": "Davoodalhosseini, Seyed Mohammadreza", "last_name_ssi": "Davoodalhosseini", "middle_name_ssi": "Mohammadreza", "first_name_ssi": "Seyed", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil Wallace", "Shouyong Shi", "Neil Wallace", "Edward James Green", "Manolis Galenianos", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Neil Wallace, Dissertation Advisor", "Shouyong Shi, Dissertation Advisor", "Neil Wallace, Committee Chair", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "Manolis Galenianos, Special Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Directed search", "Competitive search equilibrium", "Adverse selection", "Pre-match investment", "Assortative matching", "Complementarity"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Template Directed Synthesis and Characterization of Nanocrystalline Metal Oxides and Chalcogenides\n", "id": "10491", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1991", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-01-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The increased interest in the use of inorganic nanomaterials in modern technology has stimulated many research efforts to expand the synthetic techniques that are currently available for the synthesis of inorganic nanocrystals. One such method uses nanocrystalline materials as reactive templates, where they serve as precursors for the controlled chemical synthesis of complex nanostructures. Here, the chemical composition, morphology, and crystal structure of the product can be controlled by using well-established and straightforward synthetic techniques. In addition, parameters such as phase purity, crystallinity, and dispersity can be tuned in order to access nanocrystalline solids that have properties that differ from their bulk analogues. We and others have been exploring the technique of templating in order to predict and better control the composition, morphology, and crystal structure of the final product. For this study, we use metal oxide and chalcogenide nanocrystals as prototypes due to their unique properties which in turn can be harnessed for a variety of applications. \nThe first approach uses compositional templates where intermetallic nanocrystals of Bi2Pd and Bi-Pt synthesized via a modified polyol process are utilized as reactive precursors for the formation of multimetal oxides via a two-step thermal oxidation process. Once thermally oxidized, Bi2Pd nanoparticles form a Bi2O3/Pd nanocomposite which transforms into textured Bi2PdO4 upon further heating. This method provides an alternative strategy for the synthesis of multimetal oxides, supported nanoparticle catalyst systems and textured ceramics using low-temperature synthetic methods. \nWe also use the process of morphology-based templating for the synthesis of nanoparticulate intermetallics and mixed metal sulfides. Here, spherical and platelet \u2013like Bi nanoparticles are chemically transformed first to NiBi nanoparticles of similar morphology and then Ni3Bi2S2 nanoparticles via a two-step low temperature solution-based technique. Due to the limited reports on the synthesis of Ni3Bi2S2, this method provides an alternative route and helps expand the toolbox of synthetic techniques available for the formation of Ni3Bi2S2. \nThe final approach is related to the method of structural templating where ZnO nanoparticles are used for the predictable and controllable formation of metastable wurtzite-type ZnS and ZnSe.

However, because of the subtle structural differences between the two crystal structures, subtle synthetic differences can favor the formation of one polymorph over the other.

Isoprenoids are methyl-branched hydrocarbons, and include biomarkers from all three domains of life such as archaeal lipids, hopanoids, and sterols. Isoprenoid production was examined through variation in the molecular structure of archaeal lipids across a hypersaline gradient (Chapter 5). This study identified unsaturated analogues of archaeol in four halophilic archaeal strains and revealed an increase in the percentage of unsaturated lipids with increasing salinity. Anaerobic isoprenoid biodegradation was examined through the enrichment of bacteria under anaerobic conditions utilizing pristane as a carbon source (Chapter 2). Further analysis of anaerobic degradation utilized 13C-labelled phytane as a stable isotope tracer (Chapter 3). In both cases, a microbial community dominated by denitrifying Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria was responsible for the degradation of pristane and phytane. Environmental anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation was examined through the analysis of in situ microbial communities associated with the transformation of coal to methane (Chapter 4). Through FISH and 16S rRNA tag pyrosequencing a coal transformation pathway ending in acetoclastic/methylotrophic methanogenesis was identified in the Cook Inlet Basin, Alaska.

These studies have revealed a soluble GA receptor system that utilizes the 26S proteasome to modulate the levels of transcriptional repressors of the GA response. In addition, intensive studies of the events associated with the suite of GA-induced responses in the aleurone of cereal grains have provided a wealth of molecular elements of GA signal transduction ranging from Ca2+ to cGMP. However, despite these insights into GA action, the molecular details of the earliest stages of signal transduction remain remarkably poorly defined. Therefore, I sought to identify novel GA signaling genes by analysis of GA signaling in rice seed germination. This work required development of a functional rice aleurone preparation that had previously not been achievable. This new purified rice aleurone preparation exhibited the same sensitivity and responses to GA and abscisic acid (ABA) as those reported in the literature for barley or wild oat aleurone and represents a new model for dissecting the events occurring during early rice seed germination and seedling establishment. As there is an emerging understanding of the critical role of lipid signaling in plant biology, I specifically set out to obtain a better understanding of the complex regulatory role(s) of lipid-modifying enzymes in membrane-localized signal transduction in the GA response. Thus, by developing rice aleurone as a new model system by which to study the molecular details associated with GA signaling and response in vivo, I have identified phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) as a novel and positive regulator of GA action. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases are a conserved family of lipid kinases that play a central role in receptor-activated signaling and protein sorting in eukaryotes. Two putative PI3K catalytic genes, and one putative PI3K regulatory gene, were identified in the rice genome by sequence comparisons to yeast and Arabidopsis PI3K genes. I have demonstrated for the first time in plants, a specific and quantitative induction of PI3K biochemical activity in response to a GA signal, GA-treatment of the rice aleurone preparations. The GA-induction of PI3K enzyme activity was detectable by 7.5 minutes post-treatment, and was sustained over the course of 48 hrs. The GA-induced PI3K biochemical profiles preceded the GA-induced secreted &#945;-amylase activities of these cells by many hours. I also found that GA induced/enhanced the differential expression of all three rice PI3K genes. I further report that transient over-expression of one of the two rice PI3K catalytic subunits, OsVps34A in aleurone enhanced the activity of GA-responsive, but not ABA-responsive, expression reporters.  Interestingly, the stimulatory effect was specifically observed at physiologically normal (nM) GA concentrations, but not at saturating (&#956;M) hormone levels. Consistent with a functional role of PI3K in GA action, I further discovered that the PI3K-specific inhibitor wortmannin (WM) selectively inhibited GA-induced PI3K activity, as well as blocked GA-induced &#945;-amylase secretion and GA-induced gene expression in aleurone. This inhibitor had no effect upon constitutive, or ABA-responsive gene expression. Thus, my work has identified PI3K as a positive regulator of GA signaling in cereal grains where it appears to play a role of facilitating or amplifying the GA signal, leading to an enhanced GA response. My work highlights the emerging roles of lipid signaling systems such as the phospholipases, sphingosine kinases and phosphatidylinositol kinases in hormonal signaling systems of the plant.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4906], "author_name_tesi": "Day, Phillip Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Day", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Phillip", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr David Braun", "Teh Hui Kao", "Dr Simon Gilroy", "Sarah Mary Assmann", "Dr Randen Patterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr David Braun, Committee Member", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Dr Simon Gilroy, Committee Chair", "Sarah Mary Assmann, Committee Chair", "Dr Randen Patterson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rice", "aleurone", "gibberellin", "PI3K"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "High Pressure Chemical Deposition of Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon in Extreme Geometries", "id": "20119", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "9604", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) is the second most technologically relevant semiconductor, which is being researched for applications such as optoelectronic devices and solar cells. However, the hydride precursor, silane has a significant kinetic barrier to pyrolysis at low enough temperatures for hydrogen passivation to enhance the electronic and photonic properties. Consequently, external activation sources such as radio frequency plasma and heated filaments are used for the synthesis of thin film a-Si:H in a chemical vapor deposition technique at reduced temperatures. However, these complex deposition apparatus are extremely expensive and are limited to planar substrates. \nThe focus of this dissertation is to utilize a high pressure chemical vapor deposition technique for the fabrication of a-Si:H in confined one-, two-, and three-dimensional geometries. The orders of magnitude increase in the precursor pressures utilized in this high pressure approach allows for a-Si:H deposition within meters-long, high aspect ratio templates such as silica optical fiber capillaries. The optical fiber capillaries serve as both the high pressure reactor and substrate in which the high pressure reactant mixture is able to deposit high quality, void-free, atomically smooth a-Si:H wires with micrometer to nanometer diameters. The high pressure decomposition of silane within optical fiber capillaries is intensively studied in order to optimize the material quality by controlling the hydrogen content with appropriate hydride precursor, deposition temperature, and precursor mixture. These a-Si:H micro-wires exhibit exceptional nonlinear optical properties which are useful in telecommunications optoelectronics devices.\nThis high pressure deposition technique can also be extended to planar substrates without the need for external activation sources present in traditional methods. The reaction vessel geometry is a key aspect for the production of heterogeneous films rather than homogeneously nucleated particle formation which has been observed in previous high pressure processes. This high pressure deposition approach can therefore produce inexpensive thin film a-Si:H photovoltaic devices due to the simplicity of the process over that of conventional deposition methods. Furthermore, this high pressure process can be scaled for fabrication of a-Si:H films on large-area, flexible substrates in a roll process.\nAdditionally, three-dimensional nanostructured templates can be infiltrated using this high pressure deposition technique. High-purity, amorphous and crystalline Si can conformally coat nanoscale pores and channels due to the high pressures employed in this process. Fabrication of well-ordered, nanoscale geometries with semiconductor materials can lead to the discovery and study of unparalleled physics related to electronic, photonic, magnetic, and vibrational processes.

NCS-1 contains an N-terminal myristoylation modification, as well as three EF-hand domains which bind calcium with moderate to high affinity.  These attributes have been previously shown to affect the structural and functional behavior of the protein.\nIn order to better characterize these changes, a protocol presented here has been designed and optimized to produce large quantities of recombinant N-myristoylated and unmodified NCS-1 in E. coli.  Using this technique, novel mutants showing a spectrum of functional deficiencies are expressed, isolated and then characterized by a number of assays.  The large quantities of homogenous protein produced are shown to be suitable for biophysical studies using a variety of in vivo and in vitro techniques.\nContrary to what would be expected for a protein of small size, NCS-1 interacts with a wide diversity of other proteins.  One mechanism by which NCS-1 could assume this functional assortment of roles is by forming higher order homo-complexes.  Experimental results presented here demonstrate that NCS-1 is capable of forming calcium dependent homo-dimer complexes.  The propensity for self-association is enhanced by N-terminal myristoylation.  In the absence of ligand, all three functional EF-hand sites must be intact in order for NCS-1 dimerization to occur.  As NCS-1 plays a wide diversity of roles in the cell, the formation of homo-dimers may have pronounced functional implications.\nNCS-1 forms a signaling complex with the D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) and other downstream effectors, ultimately regulating desensitization of the receptor in response to dopamine signaling.  As a result, this regulatory complex may be involved in a number of neurological disease states including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A better understanding of the biophysical and regulatory details of this complex will have important implication for understanding disease pathology and exploring novel drug treatments.   Using a fluorescent peptide substrate in a fluorescence polarization assay, the equilibrium binding behavior of the NCS-1 / D2R interaction is described here. The formation of the NCS-1 / D2R complex is shown to be calcium dependent and involve the NCS-1 dimer.  The contribution of the various EF-hand domains to binding is also investigated, and a discrete role in dimerization and binding is implied for each pair of EF-hand domains.  The outcomes of these experiments could be used to optimize a large format drug screen scaled from this assay system, which could ultimately isolate lead compounds for the treatment of D2R related diseases.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1298], "author_name_tesi": "De Cotiis, Daniel A", "last_name_ssi": "De Cotiis", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Flanagan Jr.", "John Michael Flanagan Jr.", "Maria Christine Bewley", "Robert G Levenson", "Thomas E Spratt", "Ira Joseph Ropson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Flanagan Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "John Michael Flanagan Jr., Committee Chair", "Maria Christine Bewley, Committee Member", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member", "Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["neuronal calcium sensor 1", "signalplex", "myristoylation", "dopaminergic signalling"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "An Auction System for Nurse Scheduling", "id": "7947", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4481", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Inflexible work schedules are a major source of dissatisfaction among hospital nurses.  The time and complexity involved in creating schedules that simultaneously satisfy hospital requirements and nurses\u2019 preferences can lead to frustration among staff, and eventually, nurse shortages. This research develops a scheduling system that allows nurses to individually express their preferences and attempts to honor those preferences while meeting hospital standards and regulations.\n\nThe system consists of an auction step, in which nurses bid on their preferred shifts, an award step, and an assignment step.  Nurses bid for the shifts they want to work using \u201cpoints\u201d.  After bidding is over, an optimization model seeks to award the highest bidders insofar as possible while meeting hospital requirements. In the assignment step, the model allocates unfilled shifts to nurses who have not yet met their minimum hours.  \n\nThe base model is designed to handle bids which specify days in which nurses would like to work. An extension of this model is developed in this research to simultaneously handle requests for working days as well as days off.  A more complex version of the auction system is also created to model the emergency department at York Hospital.  Test problems indicate that a high percentage of requests are being awarded as a result of the methodology, and at a faster rate than other scheduling methods.\n\nThis interesting application of auctions has potential to revolutionize the scheduling process for nurses and many other types of employees.  Incorporating nurses\u2019 personal preferences through the auction process will increase staff satisfaction with their schedules and quality of life.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4451], "author_name_tesi": "De Grano, Melanie Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "De Grano", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Melanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah Jean Medeiros", "Jose Antonio Ventura", "Catherine Mary Harmonosky", "Michael Freimer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah Jean Medeiros, Committee Chair", "Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Member", "Catherine Mary Harmonosky, Committee Member", "Michael Freimer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nurse scheduling", "auctions", "integer programming", "healthcare industry"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE  TERESIAN EPISTOLARY OR THE BACKSTAGE OF FOUNDINGS AND REFORMS:THE CONSTRUCTION OF POWER IN THE LETTERS OF SAINT THERESE OF AVILA\n\n\n\n", "id": "11173", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "262", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Teresa de Jes\u00fas is one of the most studied authors of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Spanish Golden Age. Studies devoted to her work concentrate on style, lineage, and matters of spirituality.  Critical works have mainly focused on her autobiography, Libro de su vida, and Las moradas del castillo interior, but her epistolary production has recently attracted attention from several critics, among them, Joan Cammarata, Alison Weber, Pilar Cocejo, and Barbara Mujica. \nThis study will examine the Epistles of Teresa of Jes\u00fas, in particular the letters to King Philip II, Mar\u00eda Mendoza (a lady of the nobility who helps Teresa in founding the convent in Valladolid), Mar\u00eda de San Jos\u00e9 (prioress of the convent of the Carmelites in Seville), and Graci\u00e1n (her confessor and spiritual director). It explores ways in which Teresa, through her letters, seeks a position of power and authority, fashioning for herself a voice within a  male church hierarchy. In a society where the Inquisition had the power to impose and sanction the practices of Catholic orthodoxy, Teresa manages to become a noted reformer and founder of Carmelite convents. She writes about her spiritual experiences, knowing that this could very well cost her her own life. This study is a testament to the courage of a woman who opted to use the pen as an instrument of power.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [259], "author_name_tesi": "De Jesus, Arlette M.", "last_name_ssi": "De Jesus", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Arlette", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Barnard", "Mary Elizabeth Barnard", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt", "Thomas Oliver Beebee", "John Andres Ochoa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Barnard, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Elizabeth Barnard, Committee Chair", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt, Committee Member", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member", "John Andres Ochoa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Saint Theresa of Avila", "Golden Age Literature", "Epistolary", "Teresa de Jes\u00fas"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Altered stimulatory and inhibitory feedback signals in the CCK-1 receptor deficient OLETF rat", "id": "7072", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2567", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present studies examine alterations in stimulatory and inhibitory feedback signals in the obese CCK-1 receptor deficient OLETF rat. In the first series of experiments, both gastric emptying of various nutrients and volumes, as well as gastric detection of volumetric distension were assessed to test whether gastric feedback impairments contribute to hyperphagia in the OLETF rat. Our findings showed that OLETF rats exhibit marked differences compared to LETO controls in both feeding and neuronal responses to gastric distension, while no such differences were noted for emptying. Our second set of studies provided evidence of altered orosensory controls of meal size in the OLETF rat. Specifically, OLETF rats showed increased preference and intake of sucrose, even when post-absorptive effects were removed. In addition, OLETF rats showed diminished satiation responses to intestinal sucrose infusions. The next succession of experiments went a step further to show that OLETF rats demonstrate increased conditioned preference for sweet solutions, as well as an increased role of orosensory signaling in the consumption of palatable solutions independent of motivational state. The final segments of this work sought to scrutinize dopamine pathways as a possible substrate responsible for increased orosensory sensitivities in the OLETF. Indeed, OLETF rats exhibited altered functioning acoustic startle responses: a measure known to be mediated by dopaminergic pathways. Furthermore, OLETF rats showed greater reductions in palatable sucrose intake after dopamine receptor antagonism.  These data complement work by other laboratories, including our own, by provided evidence of altered central processing of orosensory stimuli in the OLETF rat.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2547], "author_name_tesi": "De Jonghe, Bart-Gerard Callay", "last_name_ssi": "De Jonghe", "middle_name_ssi": "Callay", "first_name_ssi": "Bart-Gerard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mihai Covasa", "Michael Thomas Green", "Andras Hajnal", "Byron C Jones", "Rebecca L Corwin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mihai Covasa, Committee Chair", "Michael Thomas Green, Committee Member", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member", "Rebecca L Corwin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cck", "food intake", "dopamine", "OLETF", "reward", "sucrose", "preference"]}]
