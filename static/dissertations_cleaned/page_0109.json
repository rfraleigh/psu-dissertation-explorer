Large-scale battery packs, instead of individual cells, are implemented in those applications; therefore sophisticated battery management system (BMS) becomes necessary and crucial to ensure the longevity and efficient utilization of battery packs. Such a BMS must have several key elements: a simple but accurate system model that captures battery performance and aging processes, sensor measurements that gather information to help the controller monitor battery health and identify major aging mechanisms, and an advanced controller that estimates state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) of cells and optimizes their usage accordingly. \n\nThis research first reviews six modeling techniques that are suitable for developing electrochemistry-based system models of batteries. Fundamental battery models, consisting of nonlinear coupled partial differential equations, are often difficult to discretize and reduce in order so that they can be used by systems engineers for design, estimation, prediction, and management. In this work, six methods are used to discretize a benchmark electrolyte diffusion problem and their time and frequency response accuracy is determined as a function of discretization order. The Analytical Method (AM), Integral Method Approximation (IMA), Pade Approximation Method (PAM), Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Difference Method (FDM) and Ritz Method (RM) are formulated for the benchmark problem and convergence speed and accuracy calculated. The PAM is the most efficient, producing 99.5\\% accurate results with only a 3rd order approximation. IMA, Ritz, AM, FEM, and FDM required 4, 6, 9, 14, and 27th order approximations, respectively, to achieve the same error. If both modeling complexity and efficiency are considered, Ritz method is the best candidate.\n\nSecondly, this research presents a nondestructive experiment method to perform real-time aging diagnosis of lead-acid batteries. VTLA batteries can degrade due to a variety of mechanisms, including corrosion, hard sulfation, water loss, shedding, and active mass degradation. VRLA batteries are designed to minimize these effects as much as possible but the operating environment, cell-to-cell and battery-to-battery manufacturing variations, and use can cause different degradation mechanisms to dominate capacity loss and/or impedance rise. With accurate State of Health monitoring, cell usage can be adjusted by the battery management system (BMS) to optimize the performance and life of the energy storage system. The BMS must be able to determine in real time the predominant degradation mechanism for each cell and adjust use accordingly. In this work, new and dead VRLA batteries are tested with constant, sinusoidal, and pulse charge/discharge current inputs while measuring the cell voltage and pressure to determine the cause of death of the cells. As expected, the new cells have fairly uniform performance with limited signs of degradation. The cells in the dead battery, however, have widely ranging performance, especially at the end of discharge and charge. Analysis of the charge/discharge data indicate that three cells died of water loss and a fourth cell died of sulfation. The remaining two cells were fairly healthy but will accompany their dead companions to the recycling center nonetheless. While the full charge/discharge data provided useful forensic pathology data, EIS and pulse charge/discharge data varied with aging mechanisms and only provided supplementary pathology information.\n\nFollowing the real-time diagnosis work, a charging control scheme is proposed that removes hard sulfation in lead-acid cells without introducing excessive gassing. In a battery string, the cell with the lowest capacity dominants that of the entire string. If that cell's capacity can be recovered, the capacity of the whole string will increase. However, not all aging mechanisms in lead-acid batteries are reversible but hard sulfation is. Often, removal of one degradation mechanism might worsen another. In this study, it appears that one cell of a 6-cell string died from sulfation and another three from dehydration. The battery capacity is mainly dictated by the sulfated cell. A desulfation charging control scheme with pressure feedback is designed to break up hard sulfate and recover capacity while minimizing water loss by using low current charging. The capacity of the cell is recovered by 41\\% with minimal water loss, demonstrating the effectiveness of the desulfation charge controller. \n\nThe experiments reveal the great potential of charge strategies with pressure control. To make this health-cautious charge more cost-effective and easy to implement, a nonlinear system model is developed, aiming to eliminate the pressure transducers by covering gassing side reactions in the model. The system model is fifth-order with parameters and states that are based on the electrochemical processes and battery properties. It preserves the majority of the underlying complex mathematical model but enjoys the beauty of state space form, which eases future controllers and estimators design. The model is validated with testing data and shows good match in battery voltage and pressure responses. It also returns the internal states such as acid concentration, solid-phase potentials, and transfer current densities. Those states can be used for control in the future. \n\nPowered by the nonlinear system model a health-cautious charge strategy, constant-current constant-overpotential (CC-Ceta), is presented. In a lead-acid cell, the overpotentials directly control the oxygen and hydrogen generation. Compare to conventional constant-current constant-voltage charge protocols, CC-C$\\eta$ charge protocols produce less gas and increase the charge efficiency. Controlling eta on the positive electrode directly suppresses the oxygen generation and also affects eta on the negative electrode, slowing down hydrogen production, vice versa. It has also been shown that a SOC estimator based on the internal acid concentration level has better performance than one that is based on current counting in the overcharge stage, where SOC curve is high nonlinear and part of the input current goes to side reactions.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9173], "author_name_tesi": "Shi, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Shi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn", "Christopher Rahn", "Chao Yang Wang", "Hosam Kadry Fathy", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Chair", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Member", "Hosam Kadry Fathy, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["modeling", "battery system management", "degradation diagnosis", "desulfation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "bernoulli polynomials and riemann zeta function\n", "id": "17775", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8732", "abstract_tesi": "In this paper, we derived Bernoulli polynomials from differential operators e^{xd/dx}, which was originally considered for summation of powers.

A fully-coupled land surface hydrologic model, Flux-PIHM, is developed by incorporating a land-surface scheme into the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM). The land-surface scheme is mainly adapted from the Noah LSM, which is widely used in mesoscale atmospheric models and has undergone extensive testing. Because PIHM is capable of simulating lateral water flow and deep groundwater, Flux-PIHM is able to represent both the link between groundwater and the surface energy balance as well as some of the land surface heterogeneities caused by topography. \nFlux-PIHM has been implemented at the Shale Hills watershed (0.08 km2) in central Pennsylvania. Observations of discharge, water table depth, soil moisture, soil temperature, and sensible and latent heat fluxes in June and July 2009 are used to manually calibrate Flux-PIHM. Model predictions from 1 March to 1 December 2009 are evaluated. Model predictions of discharge, soil moisture, water table depth, sensible and latent heat fluxes, and soil temperature show good agreement with observations. The discharge prediction is comparable to state-of-the-art conceptual models implemented at similar watersheds. Comparisons of model predictions between Flux-PIHM and the original hydrologic model PIHM show that the inclusion of the complex surface energy balance simulation only brings slight improvement in hourly model discharge predictions. Flux-PIHM does improve the evapotranspiration prediction at hourly scale, the prediction of total annual discharge, and also improves the predictions of some peak discharge events, especially after extended dry periods. Model results reveal that annual average sensible and latent heat fluxes are strongly correlated with water table depth, and the correlation is especially strong for the model grids near the river.\nTo simplify the procedure of model calibration, a Flux-PHIM data assimilation system is developed by incorporating the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into Flux-PIHM. This is the first parameter estimation using EnKF for a physically-based hydrologic model. Both synthetic and real data experiments are performed at the Shale Hills watershed to test the capability of EnKF in parameter estimation. Six model parameters selected from a model parameter sensitivity test are estimated. In the synthetic experiments, synthetic observations of discharge, water table depth, soil moisture, land surface temperature, sensible and latent heat fluxes, and transpiration are assimilated into the system. Results show that EnKF is capable of accurately estimating model parameter values for Flux-PIHM. The estimated parameter values are very close to the true parameter values. Synthetic experiments are also performed to test the efficiency of assimilating different observations. It is found that discharge, soil moisture, and land surface temperature (or sensible and latent heat fluxes) are the most critical observations for Flux-PIHM calibration. In real data experiments, in situ observations of discharge, water table depth, soil moisture, and sensible and latent heat fluxes are assimilated. Results show that, for five out of the six parameters, the EnKF-estimated parameter values are very close to the manually-calibrated parameter values. The predictions using EnKF-estimated parameters and manually-calibrated parameters are also similar. Thus the results demonstrate that, given a limited number of site-specific observations, an automatic sequential calibration method (EnKF) can be used to optimize Flux-PIHM for watersheds like Shale Hills.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7621], "author_name_tesi": "Shi, Yuning ", "last_name_ssi": "Shi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuning", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ken Davis", "Ken Davis", "Christopher J Duffy", "Fuqing Zhang", "Marcelo Chamecki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ken Davis, Dissertation Advisor", "Ken Davis, Committee Chair", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member", "Fuqing Zhang, Committee Member", "Marcelo Chamecki, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Meteorology", "hydrology", "land surface", "numerical modeling", "ensemble Kalman filter", "Shale Hills watershed"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Risk, Ambiguity, and Anomalies in the Fixed Income Market", "id": "21997", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10110", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation contains five essays on the implications of risks and ambiguity for asset pricing puzzles, especially in the fixed income market. The first essay studies the effects of time-varying Knightian uncertainty (ambiguity) on equilibrium asset prices; the second and third essays focus on the term premia in the nominal and real Treasury bond markets; The last two examine the performance of structural models of credit risk in explaining the levels and changes of corporate yield spreads.\n\nIn the first essay, I consider a continuous-time Lucas exchange economy in which an ambiguity-averse agent applies a discount rate that is adjusted not only for the current magnitude of ambiguity but also for the risk associated with its future fluctuations. As such, both the ambiguity level and volatility help raise asset premia and accommodate richer dynamics of asset prices. With a novel measure for the ambiguity level, I show that the estimated model is able to explain a wide range of asset markets anomalies, including the equity premium puzzle, the risk-free rate puzzle, the credit spread puzzle, and the expectations puzzle. In particular, this paper establishes both theoretical and empirical linkages of ambiguity with the unspanned predictability in the Treasury market. \nFurthermore, the proposed ambiguity measure is found to exhibit significant predictive power for excess returns on equities and bonds as well as for corporate yield spreads, a finding that justifies uncertainty channels highlighted in the model.\n\nThe remaining four essays are based on work that is coauthored with Professor Jingzhi Huang. In the second chapter, we provide new and robust evidence on the power of macro variables for forecasting bond risk premia by using a recently developed model selection method--the supervised adaptive group \"least\nabsolute shrinkage and selection operator\" (lasso) approach. We identify a single macro factor that can not only subsume the macro factors documented in the existing literature but also can substantially raise their forecasting power for future bond excess returns. Specifically, we find that the new macro factor, a linear combination of four group factors (including employment, housing, and price indices), can explain the variation in excess returns on bonds with maturities ranging from 2 to 5 years up to 43%. The new factor is countercyclical and furthermore picks up unspanned predictability in bond excess returns. Namely, the new macro factor contains substantial information on expected excess returns (as well as expected future short rates) but has negligible impact on the cross section of bond yields.\n\nIn the third essay, we document a number of new empirical findings about the dynamic behavior and economic determinants of risk premia on real bonds. Specifically, we find that the real bond risk premium changes over time and fluctuates between positive and negative values. We also find that the real term structure itself contains a component that drives risk premia but is undetectable from cross section of bond yields. In addition, we present evidence on the link between real bond premia and macroeconomic variables. More specifically, we find that macro factors associated with real estate and consumer income and expenditure can capture a large portion of forecastable variation in excess returns on real bonds. These empirical findings have important implications for both affine term structure models and consumption-based asset pricing models of real bonds.\n\nThe fourth essay provides new insights into the equity-credit market integration puzzle. Empirical evidence has documented that while variables suggested by structural credit risk models can explain only a small portion of corporate bond spread changes (Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin 2001), these models provide quite accurate predictions of hedge ratios for corporate bond returns (Schaefer and Strebulaev 2008). These two stylized facts together are often considered to have conflicting implications for the level of integration between equity and credit markets -- given the fundamental relationship between corporate bond spread changes and returns. we provide a rational explanation of this anomaly by demonstrating that the two aforementioned seemingly conflicting findings can be reconciled with each other within the standard structural modeling framework. In particular, we show empirically that sensitivities of spread changes to leverage ratio or equity predicted by the Merton (1974) model  are not rejected in time-series tests -- namely, the Merton hedge ratios for spread changes are too consistent with data. That is, the equity-credit market integration puzzle can be explained from a traditional hedging perspective.\n\nIn the last essay, we empirically examine the hedging performance of structural models using data on corporate bond transaction prices over the period July 2002--December 2012 from the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) database. While there is a large literature on the pricing performance of structural credit risk models, there is little empirical evidence on the empirical performance of these models on hedging corporate bonds. We find that the Merton (1974) model is not as useful as univariate regression models for the purpose of hedging corporate bond returns with equity. Further, for investment-grade bonds, hedging with Treasury bonds with a hedge ratio of unity is more effective than the Merton delta hedging with equity. However, we find that the Merton model is more useful for the purpose of hedging corporate bond spread changes, especially for high-yield bonds. Lastly, we also investigate the pricing performance of the Merton model. We find that on average the model overestimates (underestimates) prices (yield spreads) of bonds in our sample. Specifically, the model overestimates prices of corporate bonds by 1.87% on average. To sum, the evidence based on more recent data on transaction prices indicates that the Merton model still underpredicts yield spreads, especially for short-maturity or investment-grade bonds.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9804], "author_name_tesi": "Shi, Zhan ", "last_name_ssi": "Shi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jingzhi Huang", "Jingzhi Huang", "Heber Farnsworth", "Joel Matthew Vanden", "Jared Williams", "Runze Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jingzhi Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Jingzhi Huang, Committee Chair", "Heber Farnsworth, Committee Member", "Joel Matthew Vanden, Committee Member", "Jared Williams, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Knightian uncertainty", "asset pricing", "equity premium", "term premium", "credit spreads"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF NON EXPRESSOR OF PR1 (NPR1) AND ITS PARALOG NPR3 IN THEOBROMA CACAO AND ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA\n", "id": "11441", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6994", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Arabidopsis NON EXPRESSOR OF PR1 (NPR1) is a key transcription regulator of the salicylic acid (SA) mediated defense signaling pathway. The NPR gene family consists of NPR1 and five other NPR1-like genes in Arabidopsis. This research focuses on the functional analysis of an NPR1 ortholog from Theobroma cacao L. and characterization of one of the NPR1 paralogs, NPR3, in both Arabidopsis and cacao. To identify the function of NPR3 in Arabidopsis, I first examined the gene expression pattern of NPR3 and found it to be strongly expressed in developing flower tissues. Interestingly, an npr3 knockout mutant displayed enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae tomato pv. DC3000 (P.s.t.) infection of immature flowers. Gene expression analysis also revealed increased basal and induced levels of PR1 transcripts in npr3 developing flowers. To investigate the possible mechanism of NPR3-dependent negative regulation of defense response, I tested the physical interactions of NPR3 with both TGA2 and NPR1 in vivo, which suggests that NPR3 represses NPR1-dependent transcription by inhibiting the nuclear localization of NPR1 through direct binding to TGA2 and NPR1. To characterize the NPR1 ortholog from cacao, I isolated TcNPR1 gene from genotype of Scavina6, and demonstrated that it expresses constitutively in all the tested tissues. To functionally analyze this gene, a bacterial growth assay was carried out with npr1-2 transgenic lines overexpressing TcNPR1, and a reduced level of bacterial growth demonstrated that TcNPR1 can partially complement Arabidopsis the npr1-2 mutation. In addition, TcNPR1 was shown to translocate into nuclei upon SA treatment in a manner identical to Arabidopsis native NPR1. To further explore the NPR gene family in cacao, I identified a total of four NPR-like genes from the cacao genome, and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the duplications of three clades in this gene family occurred before the divergence of Arabidopsis and cacao. To identify the functional ortholog of Arabidopsis NPR3, I isolated a putative TcNPR3 gene and demonstrated that its expression level was higher in un-open flowers and older leaves, a pattern similar to Arabidopsis NPR3.  A complementation test of TcNPR3 expressed in the Arabidopsis npr3-3 null mutant showed that TcNPR3 can functionally substitute for the Arabidopsis NPR3 gene, demonstrating that TcNPR3 is the functional ortholog of AtNPR3. To obtain the genome-wide transcriptional responses of SA treatment in cacao, I used microarray analysis to measure gene expression in two cacao genotypes (ICS1 and Scavina6), three leaf developmental stages (A, C and E) and two treatments (water and SA). After validating the microarray results with RT-PCR, I identified differentially expressed genes from all twenty-four pair-wise comparisons. Interestingly, chloroplast and mitochondrial genes are enriched in SA-induced Scavina6 but those genes are underrepresented in ICS1, suggesting that the oxidative burst and hypersensitive response during defense response may vary between the two genotypes. In all, this research will not only offer us the knowledge of defense response mechanism and signal transduction regulation in Arabidopsis and cacao, but also provide molecular tools for selecting cultivars with enhanced disease resistance for cacao breeders and farmers. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6991], "author_name_tesi": "Shi, Zi ", "last_name_ssi": "Shi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Guiltinan", "Mark Guiltinan", "Siela Maximova", "Sarah Mary Assmann", "Hong Ma", "Yinong Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Guiltinan, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Guiltinan, Committee Chair", "Siela Maximova, Committee Member", "Sarah Mary Assmann, Committee Member", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Yinong Yang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cacao", "Arabidopsis", "plant defense", "NPR3"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "PREPARATION OF ALUMINA / POLY (ETHYLENE OXIDE) NANOCOMPOSITES WITH CONTROLLED SPACING\n\n", "id": "10408", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6599", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes the production of &#947;-Al2O3 \u2013 poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) nano-composites by a novel colloidal processing route.   PEO is a candidate for use as a solid polymer electrolyte in lithium ion batteries, but the ionic conductivity of pure PEO is too low to be of practical use.  The addition of ceramic nanoparticles into the PEO matrix results in increased ionic conductivity.  Additionally, the ionic conductivity of these nanocomposites correlates directly with the specific surface area of the dispersed ceramic phase.  Therefore, the dispersion and spacing of the ceramic phase in these nanocomposites is of the utmost importance.  As ceramic nanoparticles aggregate very easily in PEO, the preparation of highly dispersed nanoparticles composites with well-controlled spacing presents a unique processing challenge.  In this work, well dispersed, colloidal suspensions of &#947;-Al2O3 and PEO nanoparticles were prepared in a common solvent system and were spin cast to evaporate the solvent.  The resulting films can then be melted to leave isolated &#947;-Al2O3 nanoparticles in a continuous PEO matrix.  &#947;-Al2O3 nanoparticles were dispersed in non-polar organic solvent by a solvent extraction technique, while two separate approaches were utilized to prepare the PEO nanoparticle suspensions.  A reverse emulsion technique yielded PEO particles from 100 to 300 nm in size, while a solvent displacement method produced average sizes of 100 to 200 nm.  Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) was used to measure the particle size distributions of PEO and alumina nanoparticles in suspension and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) characterized the resulting polymer nanocomposites. \n\tThe techniques discussed in this work were developed to test the influence of nanoparticle addition to solid polymer electrolytes [SPEs] by creating a series of samples with controlled, adjustable nanoparticle spacing subsequently.  These samples will directly reveal the effects of confinement and surface area on the ionic conductivity of SPEs.  A study such as this could reveal how the spacing and dispersion of nanoparticles affects the ionic conductivity of SPEs, as the mechanisms leading to increased conductivity are not well understood.  This work focuses heavily on the study of processing methods, surfactant behavior, and dispersion of &#947;-Al2O3 in a specific set of solvents that show promise for producing well-dispersed PEO nanoparticles.  Using this system, &#947;-Al2O3 -PEO nanocomposites were prepared from &#947;-Al2O3 and PEO nanospheres in the range of 100 - 300 nm. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6597], "author_name_tesi": "Shi , Wenjin  ", "last_name_ssi": "Shi ", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenjin ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janna Kay Maranas", "Janna Kay Maranas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janna Kay Maranas, Thesis Advisor", "Janna Kay Maranas, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["solvent extraction", "solvent displacement", "miniemulsion", "nanocomposites", "alumina", "PEO"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SAS (SOMETHING ABOUT SILENCING) COMPLEX IN BUDDING YEAST SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE", "id": "7080", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6556", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The yeast SAS2 (Something About Silencing 2) gene encodes a member of MYST (hMOZ, yYbf2/Sas3, ySas2, and dTIP60) family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and is involved in transcriptional silencing at all silent loci (HML, HMR, telomeres, and rDNA) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we show that the native SAS complex is a trimeric protein complex composed solely of Sas2, Sas4, and Sas5. The SAS complex is capable of acetylating core histones and nucleosomes through its catalytic subunit Sas2. The conserved MYST domain in Sas2 is essential for both the silencing function and histone acetyltransferase activity of the SAS complex. More importantly, SAS exclusively acetylates lysine 16 of histone H4, and this specific lysine preference corresponds to the role of SAS complex in antagonizing the spreading of Sir proteins at chromosome ends.\nIn addition to the SAS complex, histone variant H2A.Z also plays an important role in anti-silencing function at subtelomeric regions. We demonstrate that SAS2 and HTZ1 synergistically regulate a subset of genes near telomeres for transcription activation. In the absence of SAS2, H4 lysine 16 acetylation and H2A.Z are both reduced at subtelomeric regions. Furthermore, mutation at H4 lysine 16 causes the same H2A.Z loss. When recruited, SAS enhances the H4 lysine 16 acetylation and the subsequent H2A.Z enrichment. Our data suggest that acetylation of H4 lysine 16 by SAS is required for incorporation of H2A.Z near telomeres.

The principle of Quantum Mechanics was applied to establish simulation models for prediction of mobile ion concentration and ion mobility which determine the ion conductivity. Several favorable features for optimal electrolytes will be demonstrated and compared with experimental results for model validation.\n        A four-state model was built to optimize the ionomer composition for maximal mobile ion concentration. A cluster-continuum solvation model (CCM) was developed to incorporate specific solvation in the first shell surrounding the cation, all surrounded by a polarizable continuum.  A free Li cation, Li+-anion pair, triple ion and quadrupole was used to represent the states of Li+ within the ionomer in the CCM. Predicted concentrations of Li+-conducting states (free Li+ and positive triple ions) are compared among a series of anions to indicate favorable features for design of an optimal Li+-conducting ionomer; the perfluorotetraphenylborate anion maximizes the conducting positive triple ion population among the series of anions considered.\n        An ion-hopping model was established to investigate the effect of anion-anion spacing on Li+ hopping barriers. An optimal spacing of 1.3 nm to facilitate ion transfer with a minimum hopping barrier is identified, and the existence of an optimal ion content is supported by the notion of polarizability volume overlap. This implies that there is a peak in the ion mobility as a function of ion content, leading to an observed peak in conductivity as seen in many experiments on Li-PEO ionomers. The proposed ion hopping mechanism is corroborated by comparison of predictions with observed experimental ion mobility, facilitated by extracting the distribution of hopping distances from small-angle X-ray scattering data.\n        The unique properties of ionomers arise from self-assembly of ionic groups into various aggregates. A cluster-continuum ab initio solvation model is used to simulate ion aggregates in a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solvating environment. The interplay of specific solvation energy, entropy and ion associations is investigated regarding the transition between \u201csparse\u201d aggregates (ion chains) and \u201cdense\u201d aggregates (ion sheets). The conversion from ion sheets to ion chains can be solely enthalpically driven by the difference in PEO specific solvation. Enthalpy of sulfonate - Li interactions increase with T because the dielectric constant decreases as 1/T.  In contrast, the Li solvation interaction with ether-oxygens is much less sensitive to temperature because such very local specific interactions have dielectric saturation. The stronger ion-ion interactions that increase with temperature combine with the entropy gain from less solvation to drive ions to aggregate as temperature is raised. The implication of the free energy differences of ion chains between contact and separated states for conducting ion fractions in ionomers is discussed in comparison with the experimental results from dielectric relaxation spectroscopy.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10260], "author_name_tesi": "Shiau, Huai-suen ", "last_name_ssi": "Shiau", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Huai-suen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael John Janik", "Michael John Janik", "Ralph H Colby", "Themis Matsoukas", "Enrique Daniel Gomez", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael John Janik, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael John Janik, Committee Chair", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ionomers", "electrolytes", "ionic conduction", "lithium batteries"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "The Compared Costs and Benefits of Interagency Cooperation and Separate Accreditation Processes: A Case Study\n\n", "id": "6267", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3841", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-01-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using open systems theory as a theoretical framework, this case study examines the costs and benefits of accreditation processes at a public research university.

While physiological changes occurring upon mechanical stimulation are well described, the underlying molecular mechanism are mostly unknown. To identify the molecular components of early mechanical signaling, I used confocal fluorescence ion imaging to perform a biased sceen of T-DNA insertional mutants in candidates genes. In the Catharanthus roseus receptor like serine/threonine kinase 1-like (CrRLK1L) family, I isolated a mutant, feronia, in which the second phase of bending induced extracellular alkalinization. Furthermore, the second phase of root bending activated cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) elevation is abolished in fer-2 and fer-4 mutants.  Fer mutants show several impaired mechanical phenotypes, including biased root skewing, a diminished ability to penetrate into high-density agar, and an abnormal growth response to impenetrable barrier. Computer vision-assisted kinematic analysis of root growth revealed that fer mutants exhibit unstable and faster root growth rate, as well as a broader root elongation zone. Finally, I show that FER-GFP becomes internalized when plants are treated with the FER peptide ligand, RALF1.\nNull mutants in the LLG1 gene encoding a predicted GPI-anchored protein show similar morphological and mechanical phenotypes as fer mutants. Root bending-induced FER-dependent [Ca2+]cyt transients and extracellular alkalinization are completely abolished in llg1 mutants and llg1 mutants also show similar defects in root cell expansion and growth responses to a mechanically challenging environment as fer. This supports the idea that LLG1 is involved in the FER-dependent mechanical signaling pathway. The subcellular localization of FER-GFP at the plasma membrane is not noticeably altered in the llg1 mutant compared to WT, suggesting that clear mislocalization of FER is not the cause of llg1 phenotypes. Interestingly, the activity of RALF1 triggered FERONIA internalization is attenuated in llg1 mutant, suggesting that LLG1 is important for normal function of FERONIA. \nThe plant hormone auxin is an important regulator of multiple aspects of plant growth and development. In roots, auxin elicited [Ca2+]cyt influx and Ca2+-dependent extracellular alkalinization. To identify ion channels responsible for Auxin-induced ion signaling in roots, I screened mutants in the family of Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channels, which encode predicted and confirmed cation channels. Among the tested mutants, cngc14 was identified as having a defect of auxin-induced extracellular alkalinization. Auxin induced [Ca2+]cyt elevation is also abolished in the cngc14 mutant, suggesting CNGC14 is essential for activating the auxin induced Ca2+ and pH signaling. Gravistimulated cngc14 mutant shows a delayed extracellular alkalinization and gravitropic curvature compared to wile type. In response to treatment with exogenous auxin, cngc14 mutants have a lag of auxin-induced root growth inhibition. Taken together, this result indicate that CNGC14 is necessary for the Ca2+-dependent auxin signaling to suppress the root cell expansion and early root gravitropism. \nI have generated two fluorescent Ca2+ indicators targeted to plastid stroma, recA-YC3.6 and recA-D3cpv.  In response to abiotic stresses known to elicit cytosolic Ca2+ signaling, recA-YC3.6 in leucoplasts of different root tissues also shows an increase in Ca2+-dependent FRET/CFP ratio, likely reflecting the entry of Ca2+ into the plastid stroma.

ISC is an EOR method used to produce heavy oils with high viscosity levels that are either infeasible or not economical using other EOR methods. The ISC process is a thermal recovery method that initiates when hot air is injected into the injection well to create heat inside the reservoir, which will in turn create a burning front moving from the injection well toward the production well. During this process, some of the reservoir's oil will be utilized as fuel by the process of in situ oil burning. The fuel that is produced by this process will support the combustion front. Once the heat is generated steadily by the continuous injection of hot air, the oil viscosity in the reservoir will be decreased which allows the new less viscous oil to flow to the producer. The project's goal is to create an expert system for forward in-situ combustion that has the ability to predict similar outcomes to those obtained by a thermal recovery simulator . The predicted outcomes are the oil production, the gas production and the abandonment time of the project. In order to develop the expert system, relevant output results of oil production, gas production and abandonment time of the project need to be obtained using a thermal simulator for three field patterns with varying sizes ranging from five acres to 25 acres. The numerical simulator uses ten input variables including field properties and design parameters. Such examples of these inputs are porosity, permeability, injection rate, oxygen content of injection, thickness of the reservoir, initial temperature and pressure of the reservoir and the initial oil and water saturation. Due to these different variables, it is expected that the output from the simulations will have a large range and wide scope, which will help in developing a useful and flexible expert system.\nThe simulations generated data for three different sized patterns ranging from five to twenty five acres. The next objective in the project was to create an expert system for each different pattern using artificial neural networks (ANN) . ANN is a tool that functions like the human brain. It is a mathematical model that uses an inter-connected set of neurons that is able to adapt itself depending on the data fed to the system.  Because of the characteristic of continuous adjustment, ANN is called an adaptive and a non-linear system. The ANN, when modeled correctly to fit a specified set of data, will be able to spot trends in the data when going through the learning process. If the learning process is successful, the ANN system will be able to predict the simulated data within a certain level of accuracy. The targeted level of accuracy for this work was five percent error or lower. The process meeting this target is called the validation process and in this project the average error of the ANN system is found to be below five percent, which deemed the expert system to be successful.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5410], "author_name_tesi": "Shihab, Rizvi ", "last_name_ssi": "Shihab", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rizvi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Turgay Ertekin", "Robert W Watson", "Li Li", "Larry Grayson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor", "Robert W Watson, Thesis Advisor", "Li Li, Thesis Advisor", "Larry Grayson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["in-situ combustion neural networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The effectiveness of an environmental education program on increasing environmentally conscious behavior in college students \n", "id": "19902", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9492", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the year 2050, the world population is projected to reach 9 billion (United States Census Bureau, 2011).

Forty-five college students in an environmental education program completed a survey immediately prior to the program, immediately after the program, and again six weeks later. The surveys measured participants\u2019 environmental attitudes, beliefs, worldviews, values, and behaviors. The pre-test determined the perceived environmental beliefs and behaviors that each participant had upon entering the program. The post-test sought to determine beliefs and attitudes directly after participation in the program and to determine the likeliness of each participant to engage in environmental behaviors presented in the pre-survey. The six-week delayed post-survey sought to determine the self-reported environmental behaviors that each participant engaged in six weeks after participating in the educational program. In addition, a focus group was held to gain a greater understanding of the changes in behavior of the participants and attitudes about the environment and the environmental program. Pre program survey scores were compared with post program survey scores and analyzed for differences. Qualitative findings from the focus group were analyzed for common themes across responses. \nThe responses indicated that the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scores were higher on the post-program survey than on the pre-program survey. The likeliness of the participants to practice environmental behaviors was also higher on the post-program responses than were on the pre-program responses. The participants responses showed six weeks later, their behaviors were also higher than their pre-program surveys indicated. The six-week responses were lower than the post-program responses. The focus group responses indicated that the environmental education program did indeed have an effect on respondent environmental behavior and that education is an important tool to communicate the importance of sustainability. \nResults from this study can be used to encourage others to take an environmental education course or workshop or to possibly make it a requirement for graduation or for inclusion in a freshman seminar. Every major can incorporate environmental education and sustainability in some way. As the population grows, sustainability is important. The results also indicate that a short program may be an effective way of influencing behavior. The knowledge that a short program can be effective may lead to more being developed and utilized to teach others about the world around them, how to coexist with it, and how to ensure that the resources that are present today exist for many generations. Other short courses may also be developed and utilized in other areas or even as a precursor to longer courses.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9275], "author_name_tesi": "Shilladay, Jessica Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Shilladay", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patreese Donette Ingram"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patreese Donette Ingram, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["behavior", "environmental education"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "ROTATIONAL EQULIBRIUM CONTROL IN MULTI-DIGIT HUMAN PREHENSION\n", "id": "6497", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3096", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-01-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current dissertation addresses strategies used by human performers to control orientation of the hand-held objects.

The volume of scholarly research and writing has increased, and departments of leisure studies have played an increasingly important role in serving as a home for this traditionally multidisciplinary subject. In South Korea, leisure studies is a newer, developing academic area. With the adoption of the five-day workweek and increased public recognition of the importance of leisure, the field is expected to grow in the region. The purpose of this study is to examine the comparative evolution of leisure studies in North America and South Korea. \nThe study was undertaken using cultural consensus analysis. Cultural consensus, or lack of it, might well serve as an indicator of the stage of development of leisure studies: in other words, if a discipline becomes more mature or established, there will be a greater level of cultural consensus among the scholars of the field. The term, cultural consensus analysis (or cultural consensus theory), then, refers to a formalization of such a conceptualization that agreement between individuals is a function of shared knowledge of the correct answer, and, therefore, by knowing the pattern of agreement, the culturally correct answer can be inferred. \nThe study comprised two rounds of surveys, both of which were conducted via e-mail. In the first survey, called freelisting, items constituting each cultural domain thought to be involved in leisure studies were identified. In the second, respondents were asked to rate the components identified in the previous freelisting on five-point scales. Forty three North American and thirty three Korean leisure scholars participated in both or either surveys. \nAnalysis of the data included three sections. First, content analysis was undertaken with responses obtained from the freelisting. Secondly, the respondent rating was described using simple statistics such as mean of the rating scores (1-5 scales) for each variable and, when necessary, paired t-tests. The two sets of analysis revealed diverse findings, often comparable, but sometimes substantially different. The discrepancies in results between the two methods need further explanation. Finally, cultural consensus analysis was performed using ANTHROPAC (Borgatti, 1992). The results showed that the North American leisure scholars had consensus in more areas, usually at higher levels than Korean scholars, and also the former group exhibited less negative individual knowledge scores than the latter. These findings suggest that, overall, there is a more cohesive leisure studies culture in North America than in Korea. It was speculated that such circumstances in North America as a longer history of leisure studies (programs) and the presence of institutions in leisure such as, among others, the Society of Park and Recreation Educators (SPRE) and an accreditation system in university leisure programs, could have contributed to developing a homogeneous culture in the field. Answer keys of those domains where consensus was found are also presented: to name one, health, gerontology, and tourism are areas that will increase in importance in the field in North America.\nThis study might be important in its exploratory role for future studies, raising some questions to be investigated in the future such that how the developmental stage of a disciplinary field is related with cultural consensus, what types of intracultural variability exist within a leisure studies and why, what is the implication of having cultural consensus within the field, and so on.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3207], "author_name_tesi": "Shim, Jae-Myung ", "last_name_ssi": "Shim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jae-Myung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Leisure Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Geoffrey Clay Godbey", "Garry Chick", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Gary Scott Cross"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Geoffrey Clay Godbey, Committee Chair", "Garry Chick, Committee Chair", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Member", "Gary Scott Cross, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["leisure studies", "cultural consensus"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "CONFLICT, CONTROVERSY, AND ART EDUCATION:  SOCIAL AND PEDAGOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF TRAVELING EXHIBITIONS OF CONTEMPORARY ART", "id": "13783jus399", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13783", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since the late 20th century, a new level of attention has been focused on inequality, difference, and struggles, putting Americans at center stage under the name of postmodernity.

Nevertheless, the relationship between the form of outrage and conflict over artistic and revolutionary movements and community structure has still been under-analyzed. Moreover, it remains unclear as to why a single art event can receive different public reactions depending on the community in which it is held.

These cases gained prominence in local and national presses, drawing concern among scholars and the public about the exhibitions themselves, and encouraged increasingly public dialogue over religious and political entities and control.

Data include approximately 60 hours of video recordings of the teachers teaching lessons (i.e., 3 to 5 lessons per teacher), observation-related interviews, and problem-solving interviews, as well as lesson and interview artifacts.  \nInitial examination of data was done using the lens of a conceptual framework whose development was based upon research supporting two perspectives of teaching:  Teaching is an application of knowledge for teaching mathematics and teaching is communication of mathematical ideas.  These perspectives are reflected in the four constructs that make up this initial framework:  decompressing, trimming, bridging, and framing.  The first three constructs originated in the Knowledge of Algebra for Teaching (KAT) and are described by KAT researchers as ways in which teachers use their KAT.  Framing emerged from research literature in fields for which communication is an object of study.  Loosely speaking, framing is the ways in which teachers make TMIds accessible and comprehensible to students.  \nData analysis was conducted in four rounds, each round examining the data using a different lens.  In Round 1, the data are examined using the initial conceptual framework as a lens (i.e., close-up lens) to identify instances of framing, and resulted in the identification of more than fifty instances of framing.  After the instances of framing were identified, the framings were sorted and re-examined for patterns that cut across the framings.  Round 2 resulted in the identification of 11 characteristics of framing.  The 50+ instances of framing were also sorted into framings that reflected the use of decompressing, trimming, bridging, and nonmathematical elements and/or approaches.  The fourth set of framings was examined more closely to determine how the nonmathematical elements were employed.  This round of analysis (round 3) led to the identification of three additional teaching practices:  quasi-decompressing, quasi-trimming, and quasi-bridging; and the modification of the initial conceptual framework guiding this study, the Conceptual Framework for Framing.  In the fourth and final round of data analysis, the instances of framing were revisited, examined using the lens of the Conceptual Framework for Framing, and coded according to what teaching practice(s) are being used in the framing.  The three teachers\u2019 tables of coded framings reflect how different these teachers are with respect to which teaching practices were emphasized during the data collection.  The tables of coded framings for each teacher provided a concise way of representing each teacher\u2019s efforts to make TMIds accessible and comprehensible to students, and facilitated side-by-side comparisons of which teaching practices may be emphasized.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9205], "author_name_tesi": "Shimizu, Jeanne Keiko", "last_name_ssi": "Shimizu", "middle_name_ssi": "Keiko", "first_name_ssi": "Jeanne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Kathleen Heid", "Mary Kathleen Heid", "Rose Mary Zbiek", "Glendon Wilbur Blume", "Mark Levi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Kathleen Heid, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Kathleen Heid, Committee Chair", "Rose Mary Zbiek, Committee Member", "Glendon Wilbur Blume, Committee Member", "Mark Levi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["teaching practices", "quasi-teaching practices", "teaching", "accessible", "framing", "decompressing", "trimming", "bridging"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Maternal distress and infant sleep arrangements in the first year: The roles of cultural consonance and maternal preferences for sleep arrangement choices", "id": "20006", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9411", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present longitudinal study examined the differences in levels of criticism and distress between mothers who did not adhere to American cultural prescriptions for infant sleep arrangements and those who followed it.

In Western cultures, however, co-sleeping is not strongly endorsed. Past studies in Western countries have reported the negative impact of co-sleeping practices on infant sleep, family life, and children\u2019s socio-emotional development.  However, additional studies have not supported the premise that co-sleeping undermines children\u2019s healthy development and sleep quality.  This suggests that infant sleep arrangements per se may not be a determinant of child development.  This dissertation aimed to explicate the contradictions in literature regarding the consequences of infant sleeping arrangements and examined the linkages between infant sleeping arrangements, family life, and infant sleep and development, through cultural and family systems perspectives.  \n\nData were drawn from a larger NIH-funded study of 167 families. Study I used multilevel modeling to examine the associations between parenting beliefs, sleeping arrangements, and mothers\u2019 perception of infant sleep behavior, and the ethnic group differences in these associations.  The results suggested that mothers who co-slept with their infants beyond 6 months (persistent co-sleeping) were more likely than mothers who moved their infants to a separate room by 6 months to report greater frequency of the infant\u2019s night waking and perceive the child\u2019s night waking to be problematic.  Further, when mothers were more likely than fathers to endorse close parent-child relationships, mothers\u2019 perceptions of positive co-parenting decreased and negative coparenting increased among persistent co-sleeping families.  However, these results were found only among European American families.  Sleeping arrangements were unrelated to mothers\u2019 perception of infant sleep behavior among ethnic minority families.  In addition, the association between inter-parental discrepancies in parenting beliefs and coparenting quality among ethnic minority families was not significant.  Cross-lagged panel models further suggested that when European American mothers perceived a poor alliance with their partner, they brought their infant to the parent\u2019s bedroom.  \n\nBuilt on family systems theory, Study II examined whether sleeping arrangements per se or family processes were associated with families\u2019 well-being in the first year and children\u2019s socio-emotional development at a later age.  The results of the latent linear growth models for two parallel processes indicated that greater coparenting quality over time was predictive of a reduction in mothers\u2019 depression over time.  This association was found, independent of whatever sleeping arrangements parents used across the first year.  Further, the results of the latent linear growth models suggested that greater coparenting quality over time was predictive of children\u2019s fewer externalizing problems, more regulation, and more competency at a later age, independent of whatever sleeping arrangements parents used across the first year.  Indeed, sleeping arrangements were related to none of the child outcomes.\n\nTogether, the results of this dissertation suggest that (1) it is not sleeping arrangements per se but a mismatch between cultural beliefs about sleep arrangements and what parents actually do that leads co-sleeping mothers to be sensitive to infant sleep behaviors and vulnerable to a risk for unfavorable family functioning, and (2) it is not sleeping arrangements per se but family processes that play an important role in parents\u2019 well-being and children\u2019s socio-emotional development.  This dissertation provides new insights about the importance of culture and family functioning in studies involving infant sleeping arrangements.  Parents, pediatric professionals, and parenting experts must focus less on arguing the benefits or pitfalls of particular sleeping arrangements and, instead, increase their awareness of the importance of the health of the family systems.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15515], "author_name_tesi": "Shimizu, Mina ", "last_name_ssi": "Shimizu", "first_name_ssi": "Mina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas M.

Somatic homozygous mutant clones of mats produce large tumour due to failure in all these processes. mats shows genetic interaction with components of Wts/Lats signalling such that it can increase the growth suppression effects of wts and hpo. mats acts downstream of hpo, but it appears to have both upstream and downstream functions to wts. The function of mats is important for early embryonic development, and it is required for proper DNA segregation. Mats is accumulated at the centrosome with its kinase partner Wts throughout the cell cycle. Mats can be localized both in the nucleus and cytosol, but upon high activity of Wts in the cytosol, it is depleted from the nucleus thereby it elevates growth suppression effect of Wts. mats belongs to the structurally and functionally highly conserved Mob gene family, thus homologues in human may act as tumour suppressive factors.

The material removal results in a serious decrease of its life-time and an increase of repair and replacement cost. A good understanding and prediction of erosion on a helicopter rotor blade is thus very important to reduce the damage and to develop erosion protection system (EPS). However, an erosion prediction on helicopter rotor blades is still challenge because of the complexity of the physical processes involved and the limitation of existing open literature.\nTherefore, in this dissertation, accurate and time-efficient methodologies were developed for performing sand particle tracking and predicting sand erosion damage on actual helicopter rotor blades under realistic hover and vertical lift conditions. The development of these methodologies were performed based on an extensive literature review in the area of solid particle erosion in turbomachinery systems because flow physics and erosion phenomena in turbomachinery components and those around helicopter rotor blades. \nIn this dissertation, first, injection (release) conditions of solid particles with new injection parameter, sand particle mass flow rate (SPmFR), were specified to deal with the effect of non-uniform and unsteady flow conditions surrounding at each injection point from which solid particles are released. The SPmFR defines the number of solid particles released from the same injection position per unit time. \nSecondly, a general definition of erosion rate, \u201cmass or volume loss from the metal surface due to the impact of a unit \u201cmass\u201d of solid particles\u201d was also modified by multiplying with SPmFR in order to solve the limitation for predicting erosion damage on actual helicopter rotor blade. \nNext, a suitable empirical particle rebound model and an erosion damage model for spherical sand particles with diameters ranging from 10 \u00ecm to 500 \u00ecm impacting on the material Ti-6A1-4V,  the material of helicopter rotor blade, were developed. \nFinally, C++ language based codes in the form of User Defined Functions (UDFs) were developed and implemented into the commercially available multi-dimensional viscous flow solver ANSYS-FLUENT in order to develop and integrate with the general purpose flow solver, ANSYS-FLUENT, for a specific Lagrangian particle trajectory computing algorithm and rebound and erosion quantification purposes. \nIn the erosion simulation, a reasonably accurate fluid flow solution is necessary. In order to validate the numerical results obtained in this dissertation, computations for flow-only around 2D RAE2822 airfoil and 3D rotating rotor blade (NACA0012) without any sand particle were performed. In the comparison of these results with experimental results, it is found that the flow solutions are in good agreement with the experimental data. Next, second computational validation for flow around the SC1095 airfoil for various turbulence models were performed in order to select a suitable turbulence model. These results concluded that numerical results with k-\u00f9 SST model have a reasonably best accuracy. \nBy using developed methodologies for particle tracking, erosion prediction, and flow simulation, 2D erosion simulations for various inflow conditions, such as inflow Mach number, inflow angle of attack, and the diameter of solid particle, were performed in order to understand the details of erosion mechanism existing on helicopter rotor blades. These results indicate that the magnitude of erosion rate is affected by inflow Mach number and that erosion rate distribution, including maximum erosion rate position and the area of erosion damaged airfoil, is highly depended upon the diameter of solid particle and inflow angle of attack.  \nRelative inflow conditions to the blade section of helicopter rotor blades are highly dependent upon rotor blade geometric conditions and helicopter rotor operational conditions. Therefore, in this dissertation, 3D erosion simulations for four different rotating blades with uniform airfoil profile (SC1095) were performed in order to understand the details of erosion mechanism. These results indicate that erosion patterns including maximum erosion rate position and the extent of erosion damaged area on the blade section were highly dependent upon a spanwise twist distribution. It is found that the magnitude of erosion damage on the blade section is affected by not a spanwise twist but a swept tip. \nNext, in this dissertation, UH-60A helicopter rotor blades rotating in the computational domain for various collective pitch angles and climb velocities were simulated.  These results indicate that overall erosion characteristics for helicopter rotor blades can be considered to be not dependent upon these operational parameters though there is a little difference in the magnitude of erosion damage and the maximum erosion rate position. These results concluded that a hover condition can be chosen as a reference operational condition for predicting erosion characteristics or for investigating erosion reduction methods. \nThe final phase of this research is a generalization for particle trajectories and erosion characteristics on 3D helicopter rotor blades in order to reduce very expensive erosion computational cost. The generalized results show that aerodynamic and erosion characteristics for a 3D rotor blade can be predicted by using the 2D airfoil results for corresponding relative inflow angle of attack with coefficient for inflow velocity magnitude and aerodynamic loss difference between 2D and 3D flow simulation results. \nThe present thesis provides a complete and unique methodology in predicting sand particle trajectories and their erosion damage on actual helicopter rotor blades under realistic hover and vertical lift conditions. This thesis describes completely detailed phenomena of sand particle trajectories and sand erosion damage on 2D airfoils and on 3D helicopter rotor blades. Finally, this thesis suggests a generalization for sand particle trajectories and sane erosion damage in order to reduce significantly computational cost. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [892], "author_name_tesi": "Shin, Bong Gun ", "last_name_ssi": "Shin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bong Gun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci", "Cengiz Camci", "Dennis K Mclaughlin", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Timothy Francis Miller", "Michael H Krane"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci, Dissertation Advisor", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Chair", "Dennis K Mclaughlin, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Timothy Francis Miller, Committee Member", "Michael H Krane, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rotorcraft", "Aerodynamics", "Particle Trajectory", "Sand Erosion", "Helicopter rotor blade"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "A Formal Model for Analysis and Control for Human-involved Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems", "id": "6706", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1609", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two separate and very distinct approaches to research related to factory control have been pursued \u2013 automatic control and man-machine interactions.  In spite of the significant work conducted in both areas, very limited crosscutting research has been conducted in this important integration area.  It is still true that human integration into highly automated manufacturing environs can be cumbersome and result in system anomalies (crashes and illogical transitions).  Research in this critical integration area has likely been limited due to the nature and tools used in these two areas.  The focus of the proposed research is to develop formal models and controllers that utilize previous work in both of these critical areas in order to create a comprehensive framework for controller modeling and development containing both automatic and human components.   \nThe proposal offers a vision of how a human can fit within a computer-control framework so that the system can take full advantage of tasks and activities that humans do well, and those that computers perform more effectively.  The specific classes of human activities addressed herein include: 1) dynamic decision making and 2) physical material handling.  The environment that is modeled is one that contains CNC machines, robots, automatic storage systems, and humans.\nTo address the central issue of the proposed work, an automata-based system control model is used to control flexible automated equipment on the shop-floor.  Hooks for integrating the human into the controller are modeled by creating a descriptive model using finite state methods where a set of possible human activities is developed.  An operator function model characterizing the behavior of human in the various shop-floor roles is developed so that a logical partition of activities can be created.  Transition methods and software tools that allow the human and computer system to interact seamlessly are developed for a general class of automata and operator function models.\nIt is critical to identify how parts are handled in a system so that a system controller for the human-automation cooperative system can consider possible situations caused by a human operator. For this reason, the impact of human activities on the control complexity from a part states\u2019 view is addressed. The number of possible part flows at a certain state is used to measure the control complexity.\nFinally, a structure specification of a human-automation interaction and a formal approach to describe the operational features of the structure are presented from a control-theoretic perspective.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1592], "author_name_tesi": "Shin, Dongmin ", "last_name_ssi": "Shin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dongmin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Allen Wysk", "Ling Rothrock", "Timothy William Simpson", "Ali R Hurson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Allen Wysk, Committee Chair", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Chair", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "Ali R Hurson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Formal Model", "Control", "Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems", "Material Handling"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Thermodynamic properties of solid solutions from special quasirandom structures and CALPHAD modeling:\nApplication to Al-Cu-Mg-Si and Hf-Si-O\n\n", "id": "6908", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1610", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis focuses on calculating thermodynamic properties of solid solution phases from first-principles studies for the CALPHAD thermodynamic modeling.\nSince thermodynamic properties of solid solutions cannot be determined accurately\nthrough experimental measurements, various efforts have been made to estimate them from theoretical calculations.

SQS\u00a1\u00afs are structural templates whose correlation functions are very close to those of completely random solid solutions, thus can be applied to any relevant system by switching the atomic numbers in first-principles calculations.

Six photolithography layers were processed on 4-by-4 inch flexible samples, forming a-Si:H TFTs and n+ \u00b5c-Si:H strain bridges. Discrete test structures and arrays with up to 32-by-32 sensors were fabricated. By using Wheatstone bridge sensors with varying orientation for different sensors in an array it was possible to determine both strain magnitude and direction.  Strain sensor array operation was demonstrated with a custom interface circuit board and a LabView program from real-time data display.\nIn resistive microbolometer devices, the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) is a key property for high sensitivity. Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) silicon and sputtered germanium deposited with various deposition parameters were investigated to achieve high TCR. Real-time spectroscopic ellipsometry (RTSE) was installed onto a load-locked PECVD system, and the growth evolution of films was monitored successfully. Depending on the deposition conditions, film phases were correlated with variations in film electrical properties. One major factor that limits microbolometer performance is 1/f noise, and the normalized Hooge parameters of PECVD silicon and sputtered germanium films were evaluated.\nIn a more theoretical approach to understanding amorphous silicon, an a-Si:H bandstructure was modeled using a commercial software, Synopsis Sentaurus, and the temperature dependence of resistivity was simulated using a variety of band structure models. An a-Si:H model was constructed to examine the TCR dependence on several model parameters: band-tail slope / concentration, gap-state slope / concentration, doping concentration, and mobility. Comparison of experimental and modeled conductivity over a wide temperature range can help determine the slope of the band-tail traps.\nAutonomously powered circuits are of interest for a range of applications.  Thin film solar cells currently occupy a smaller portion of the market than solar cells made from bulk materials, but still have large potential for use in mobile and portable electronics.  Here, the heterogeneous integration of a-Si:H solar cells and ZnO TFT circuits was demonstrated.  The process requires only two additional photolithography steps compared to a standard ZnO TFT process. As a simple integration example, 15 series connected n-i-p solar cells were fabricated to provide the supply voltage for 7-stage ZnO ring oscillator.  The resulting a-Si:H/ZnO integration requires only illumination (no other external power) and oscillates at about 28 kHz. This integration of PV cells into functional TFT circuits to create an autonomously powered devices may be groundbreaking for the development of cost-effective low-power sensors.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7362], "author_name_tesi": "Shin, Hang-beum ", "last_name_ssi": "Shin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hang-beum", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Chair", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogenated amorphous silicon", "PECVD", "autonomous powered circuit", "uncooled IR microbolometer", "strain sensor array", "thin film transistor", "flexible substrate", "TCAD simulation", "high TCR", "1/f noise", "normalized Hooge parameter", "sputtered germanium", "ZnO TFT", "a-Si:H solar cellcircuit", "uncooled IR microbolometer"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Ultra wideband noise tomography: principles and validation", "id": "26626", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11589", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Imaging techniques have been used for a long time in many applications such as nondestructive testing, medical diagnosis, civil infrastructure assessment, and homeland security.  Advances in signal and image processing techniques have made considerable progress in a way that the multi-dimensional images of the target object are successfully reconstructed from electromagnetic (EM) scattering; the shape of the object is clearly identified by visual inspection.\nThe dissertation explores the diffraction tomographic imaging of a target object using ultra-wideband (UWB) white Gaussian noise (WGN) waveforms in radar system.  The principles and validation of UWB noise radar system for tomography application are presented including the theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and experimental results.\nUsing WGN waveform as the transmit signal ensures the low probability of intercept (LPI) since the transmitted noise waveform is constantly varying and never repeats exactly.  Ideally, such a signal is a stochastic process with a flat spectral density over a wide frequency range; however, the spectral density of WGN cannot be uniform and consistent for all frequencies in reality.  In order to obtain a flat spectral density over the desired frequency range, a method of averaging multiple independent and identically distributed (iid) noise waveforms is proposed.  From the simulation results, tomographic images of various target scenarios are successfully reconstructed with random noise waveforms.  \nIn addition, the hardware system of bistatic UWB noise radar for tomographic imaging application is designed and implemented.  The tomographic image processing technique for large sets of collected data samples are also proposed.  Both metallic and dielectric target objects are correctly imaged based on measured scattering data, and the experimental results compare well with the numerical simulation results.

In particular, we address this issue in the context of frequency by severity models.  Prior literature on frequency by severity models has focused on the use of discrete outcome models and count models as the baseline frameworks (Lord and Mannering 2010; Anastasopoulos and Mannering 2011; Milton, Shankar and Mannering 2008; Park and Lord 2007; Kweon and Kockelman 2003; Ye, Pendyala, Shankar and Konduri 2008).  In discrete outcome models, the severity distribution is modeled as a proportions variable as function of geometric, traffic volume and potentially environmental factors.  In count models, the outcome variables are either univariate or multivariate counts of severity, and modeled as functions of geometric, traffic volume and potential environmental effects (see for example Venkataraman et al. 2011).  While the aforementioned modeling efforts provide significant insight into the unconditional probability of severity occurrence in terms of segment level measurements of geometry and volume, they ignore the impact of selection bias.  The models are constructed on the observed histories of segments, which means that segments with no crash histories are omitted from the estimation procedure.  Due to this omission, the severity distributions that are estimated may be biased.  We provide a method to account for this selection bias via an examination of interstate crash histories in Washington State.  \n\nIn conventional severity analysis, as summarized via the above literature references, there are two main approaches \u2013 conditional analysis of severity where crash specific factors related to collision types, vehicle types, and occupant information are mainly used to estimate severity models.  Roadway geometry is used in the form of dummy variables to describe the presence or absence of curvature for example, in the neighborhood of a crash site.\nThe second aspect of conventional severity analysis relates to the unconditional analysis at the segmental level where frequencies of severities are estimated as a function of roadway geometry and traffic volume.  In this case, collision type is ignored in conventional analysis because such information is not available in aggregate form.  \n\nAs a result of the above approaches, gaps exist in terms of hybrid data including both geometrics and collision type.  This restricts the formulation of comprehensive models of severity.  This thesis addresses this gap by using hybrid data including segmental geometry and collision information at the segmental aggregation level.  \n\nSeverity distributions are estimated as a function of interstate geometry and traffic volume factors, and observed collision type proportions.  A comparison of parameters with and without the selection bias effect is provided.  We also explore the effect of selection bias in terms of heterogeneity in the mean of parameters, where parameters are estimated to be random.  We note in concluding that the extant literature on selection bias in the conditional context of severity modeling is scant (Tarko et al. 2010).  It is a fruitful area of future research, which can lead to opportunities for integrating insights from conditional and unconditional severity analysis.  Some evidence of this prospect can be seen in recently published papers (see for example, Anastasopoulos and Mannering 2011; Shankar et al. 2006).\n\nThe original contribution of this thesis is two-fold: a) it addresses a gap in the published literature on the accommodation of potential information from segments that are observed to have not crashes, which as a result can affect the estimated severity distributions; and b) by accounting for such selection effects, the thesis also makes original contributions in the area of the nature of the impact of selection effects on parameters associated with severity models.  In particular, the severity models are formulated as two-stage models where information on both geometrics and collision type is incorporated to provide for comprehensive analysis of segment level severity distributions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7360], "author_name_tesi": "Shin, Seunghwan ", "last_name_ssi": "Shin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seunghwan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["safety", "severity distribution", "selection bias"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Adaptive nanoparticle amphiphiles as multifunctional particle surfactants ", "id": "26723", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11814", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A wide range of molecules, polymers, and particles which possess both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains are desirable as surface active agents. Unlike their molecular analogs, inorganic nanoparticle (NP) amphiphiles have the ability both to adapt their surface chemistry in response to environmental changes and to respond to external stimuli acting on the particle cores. These unique capabilities enable new strategies for a variety of applications in drug delivery, emulsification, assembly of hierarchical structures, surface coatings, and optoelectronic devices. This dissertation describes experimental methods for preparing and characterizing NP amphiphiles and also discusses their applications in assembly and biomedical engineering.\n\nThe synthesis of gold NPs functionalized asymmetrically with domains of hydrophobic and hydrophilic ligands on their respective hemispheres is described in Chapter 2. These particle amphiphiles form spontaneously by a thermodynamically controlled process, in which the particle cores and two competing ligands assemble at the interface between two immiscible liquids to reduce the interfacial energy. The asymmetric surface chemistry resulting from this process is confirmed using contact angle measurements of water droplets on NP monolayers deposited onto hydrophobic and hydrophilic substrates. The spontaneous assembly process is rationalized by a thermodynamic model, which accounts both for the energetic contributions driving the assembly and for the entropic penalties that must be overcome. In addition to gold NPs and thiolate ligands, generality of this approach is demonstrated by extending it to the preparation of amphiphilic iron oxide NPs using two types of diol-terminated ligands. The synthetic strategy described here provides a comprehensive solution for designing NP amphiphiles with controlled surface composition and ligand distribution.\n\nThe self-assembly of gold NP amphiphiles in water is discussed in Chapter 3. Unlike typical amphiphilic particles with \u201cfixed\u201d surface chemistries, the ligands used here are not bound irreversibly but can rearrange dynamically on the particles' surface during their assembly from solution. Depending on the assembly conditions, these adaptive amphiphiles form compact micellar clusters or extended chain-like assemblies in aqueous solution. By controlling the amount of hydrophobic ligands on the particles' surface, the average number of nearest neighbors \u2013 that is, the preferred coordination number \u2013 can be varied systematically from ~1 (dimers) to ~2 (linear chains) to ~3 (extended clusters). To explain these experimental findings, an assembly mechanism is presented in which hydrophobic ligands organize dynamically to form discrete patches between proximal NPs to minimize contact with their aqueous surroundings. Monte Carlo simulations incorporating these adaptive hydrophobic interactions reproduce the three-dimensional assemblies observed in experiment.\nThe spontaneous incorporation of amphiphilic gold NPs into the walls of surfactant vesicles is reported in Chapter 4. When the NP amphiphiles are mixed with preformed surfactant vesicles, the hydrophobic ligands on the NP surface interact favorably with the hydrophobic core of the bilayer structure and guide the incorporation of NPs into the vesicle walls. Unlike previous strategies based on small hydrophobic NPs, the approach described here allows for the incorporation of water soluble particles even when the size of the particles greatly exceeds the bilayer thickness.\n\nFinally, a strategy to stabilize open bilayer structures using NP amphiphiles is described in Chapter 5. Molecular amphiphiles self-assemble in polar media to form ordered structures such as micelles and vesicles essential to a broad range of industrial and biological processes. Some of these architectures such as bilayer sheets, helical ribbons, and hollow tubules are potentially useful but inherently unstable owing to the presence of open edges that expose the hydrophobic bilayer core. The particle amphiphiles described here bind selectively to the open edge of bilayer membranes to stabilize otherwise transient amphiphile assemblies. It is demonstrated how such particles can precisely control the size of lipid tubules, how they can inhibit the formation of undesirable assemblies such as gallstone precursors, and how they can stabilize free-floating lipid microdiscs.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11271], "author_name_tesi": "Shin, Sun ", "last_name_ssi": "Shin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kyle Jeffrey Magnuson Bishop", "Darrell Velegol", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr.", "Raymond Edward Schaak"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kyle Jeffrey Magnuson Bishop, Dissertation Advisor", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Member", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanoparticle", "Amphiphile", "Self-assembly"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "ESSAYS IN APPLIED MECHANISM DESIGN", "id": "6682x3930", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12738", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of two chapters.\n\nChapter 1: On Monotone Strategy Equilibria in Simultaneous Auctions for Complementary Goods\nWe explore existence and properties of Bayesian Nash equilibrium in simultaneous first-price auctions for complementary goods. We introduce a novel partial order on bidder types and apply methodology in Athey (2001), McAdams (2003) and Reny (2011) to demonstrate existence of monotone equilibria in these auctions when the bid space is finite. We then apply this finding to demonstrate two new results on monotone equilibria in continuous bid spaces. The first of these establishes existence of monotone equilibria in a setting similar to Krishna and Rosenthal (1996), in which a single global bidder bids for multiple objects against a set of local bidders who bid for single objects only. The second considers equilibria with communication as in Jackson, Simon, Swinkels and Zame (2002), showing that in our setting their statements on distributional strategies can be refined to be monotone. Finally, we discuss conditions under which these results can be extended to all-pay, second-price and other standard simultaneous auctions.\n\nChapter 2: Discrimination in Organizations\nA number of the largest U.S. firms have been involved in labor discrimination despite having policies in place designed to avoid that outcome. This paper diagnoses the phenomenon and proposes contractual and regulatory solutions to ameliorate the situation. Existing research (e.g., Becker (1957), Coate and Loury (1993)) studies a situation in which an individual person practices discrimination. In contrast, this paper considers a hierarchical organization in which a manager (the agent) may or may not have a discriminatory taste toward his subordinates, whereas an owner (the principal) is unbiased and only cares about profit. The manager perfectly observes productivity levels of the subordinates and decides whom to promote. The owner only sees results of the manager\u2019s decision: the promoted worker\u2019s identity and that worker\u2019s performance. In this environment, I study a direct mechanism and characterize an optimal contract. Additionally, I compare the allocation implemented by the optimal direct mechanism to the first-best (full information) allocation and discuss the effectiveness of current regulations (e.g., affirmative action, taxation on the minority promotion ratio): I find that a regulator (such as the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) can improve compliance with non-discriminatory conduct, despite the fact that the person on whom the regulation is directly incident\u2014the principal\u2014is not intrinsically biased. I also show that the regulation can be counter-productive if it attempts to enforce perfect fairness (the first-best allocation) when that allocation is not incentive feasible.

Structural virologists have historically taken advantage of the icosahedral symmetry of many viral capsids to enhance the resolution of cryo-EM reconstructions. Recent technological advances in the field have lifted this requirement for achieving high-resolution, making high-resolution reconstruction of asymmetric virus capsids possible. The work presented here parallels the advances made in the field of cryo-EM to explain conformational changes that occur in capsids of the viral order Picornavirales.\n\tThe order Picornavirales contains the Picornaviridae and Iflaviridae families that infect mammals and insects, respectively. Several picornaviruses are prominent human pathogens including enterovirus 71 (EV71), poliovirus (PV), and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). The iflaviruses contain numerous agriculturally important pathogens, such as the honey bee virus, deformed wing virus (DWV). Structural studies of the several capsid forms used to complete the viral life cycle of these microbes have been completed.\n\tThe lifecycle of the picornavirus capsid is well defined. There are five distinct capsid forms that include procapsid, provirion, infectious capsid, altered particle (A-particle), and empty capsid. Structures are available for all of these forms except the provirion, which is a short-lived intermediate. The procapsid and A-particle structures are of particular interest, as the function of the procapsid is uknown and the exact structural rearrangements needed to form A-particle have yet to be identified. Here we present structures that represent the procapsid, A-particle, and empty capsid forms to answer a variety of biological questions.\n\tThe EV71 A-particle and empty capsid cryo-EM structures were formed by applying heat to the infectious capsid. The A-particle structure displayed prominent density pillars that connected the particle interior to the viral RNA. Pseudoatomic modeling and density difference map calculations were used to determine that the density pillars were composed of a portion of the N-terminus of VP1. We propose that this interaction tethers the genome to the capsid until a secondary signal for genome release is sensed by the capsid. The predicted surface charges of the A-particle and empty capsid structures also suggest that the RNA is released from an opening at the viral two-fold axis.\n\tThe EV71 procapsid is expanded compared to the infectious virus. This expansion causes the two capsid forms to have different antigenic properties. The mechanism of neutralization of a monoclonal antibody (MAb 22A12) generated against a highly immunogenic peptide in the EV71 VP1 protein was investigated by cryo-EM image reconstruction. MAb 22A12 binds more readily to the procapsid than the infectious capsid. A 3-D reconstruction of FAb 22A12 in complex with EV71 procapsid reveals that the epitope is near the canyon at a loop that is flexible in the procapsid, but gains ordered structure in the infectious capsid (VP1 GH loop). The suspected mechanism of neutralization is to occlude receptor binding and to cause immune aggregates by capsid cross-linking. This study presents the first evidence for a function of a picornavirus procapsid, suggesting that it is capable of acting as an immune decoy to enhance the infectivity of infectious capsids.\n\t The CVB3 A-particle formed by focused receptor engagement using receptor embedded nanodiscs provides the first high-resolution asymmetric reconstruction of a picornavirus entry intermediate. The work presents a new definition for the picornavirus A-particle. The capsid expands radially by ~5% as the VP4 proteins, pocket factors, and N-termini of VP1 proteins exit the capsid at the site of receptor engagement. This work shows the power of DED technology and suggests that it can be used for studies of numerous protein-protein interactions in the future.\n\tDespite the severity of disease caused by deformed wing virus infections in honey bees also infected with the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor the molecular biology literature detailing the virus is limited. The first structures of DWV were solved by cryo-EM and represent two distinct empty capsid forms. One capsid form is decorated at the 5-fold vertices with open finger-like projections, similar to the related triatoma virus (TrV). The second empty capsid form is similary decorated, however the density protrustions form a closed ring. Both capsids are held together by pentamer-pentamer contacts at the viral 2-fold axes. These connections resemble the strand swapping mechanism used by TrV and other related viruses. We propose that DWV capsids also participate in strand swapping.\n\tThe work presented here opens many doors for future investigations. The EV71 A-particle formed after receptor stimulation needs to be studied to draw parallels between specific and non-specific triggers. The function of other picornavirus procapsids should be investigated to understand the evolutionary conservation of the production of this noninfectious capsid form. The combination of nanodisc technology with DED data collection opens the door for the study of many protein-protein interactions, including interactions between pleomorphic viruses and their receptors. The DWV infectious capsid needs to be isolated so that its structure can be determined. This will help determine the function of each empty capsid form. These studies will add to the growing body of structural virology work that helps to define the function of proteins in large complexes.\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11486], "author_name_tesi": "Shingler, Kristin Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Shingler", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Kristin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Hafenstein", "Aron Eliot Lukacher", "Rebecca C Craven", "Neil David Christensen", "Clare E Sample", "Katsuhiko Murakami"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Hafenstein, Dissertation Advisor", "Aron Eliot Lukacher, Committee Chair", "Rebecca C Craven, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Clare E Sample, Committee Member", "Katsuhiko Murakami, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["picornavirus", "cryo-EM", "structure", "virology", "cryo-electron microscopy", "A-particle"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Governing Environmental Variability: Flooding and natural resource access in the Okavango Delta, Botswana\n", "id": "26246", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11398", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates how existing vulnerabilities result in differential adaptive capacity for residents of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Using a political ecology approach, I link concepts of environmental governance, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity to more fully understand the social-ecological complexities of climate change adaptation. This contributes to the growing body of work that views adaptation as an opportunity for social and political transformation. The dissertation is based on nine months of mixed-methods research in two communities of the Okavango Delta. While variable flooding patterns are an inherent part of this dynamic wetland ecosystem, higher than average annual floods in 2009-2011 inundated floodplain agricultural fields for multiple seasons and displaced many residents from their homes. I used a combination of semi-structured household interviews, a structured household survey, and participant observation to examine how the governance systems that mediate resource access in this region responded to the high floods of 2009-2011, and the resulting implications for residents\u2019 livelihood practices and adaptive capacity. There are three key findings. First, residents prefer to use transitional livelihood strategies, shifting between dryland and floodplain farming practices in response to variability in precipitation and flooding. Second, recent government regulations have decreased access to floodplain resources, resulting in residents feeling pressured to shift farming practices permanently to the dryland. This is reducing their capacity to respond to current and future environmental change. Third, a permanent shift to dryland farming has differential impacts for residents in these communities, with particularly negative consequences for already vulnerable single female-headed households and members of the historically marginalized Bayei tribe. The dissertation thus finds that flooding variability, changing governance of floodplain resources, and existing social vulnerabilities are combining to create differential and decreased adaptive capacity for many residents of this region. I draw from literature on transformative adaptation to envision and offer suggestions for alternative and more equitable forms of adaptation and environmental governance for the Okavango Delta. More broadly, the dissertation shows how the investigation of issues of governance and vulnerability can lead to a fuller understanding of the complex factors shaping adaptive capacity in communities experiencing environmental change.

However, many of these microorganisms exclusively occupy habitats not containing lactose, suggesting unknown functions for these enzymes. My research objective was to examine natural functions of bacterial glycosyl hydrolases with beta-galactosidase activity. Chosen from my several hundred isolates, one beta-galactosidase was purified and characterized because it belonged to a glycoside hydrolase family (GHF) not known for this enzymatic activity, GHF 3. This enzyme also had beta-glucosidase activity, a low thermal optimum, and was most active on aryl-glucosides. During this work, examinations of more typical beta-glucosidase substrates, such as cellobiose, led me to hypothesize that analogous galactosidic plant compounds could be beta-galactosidase substrates. I further examined the GHF 42 group of beta-galactosidases and created PCR primers specific for identifying their genes in certain spore-forming bacteria. My consequent observations of a homologous gene arrangement shared by several organisms (gene synteny) specifically suggested oligosaccharide degradation products from the pectic plant polysaccharide arabinogalactan type-I (AG-I) as beta-galactosidase substrates. \n\nI proposed an AG-I degradation pathway and used Bacillus subtilis as a model to demonstrate that more microbial beta-galactosidase activity was generated in response to the addition of AG-I than to other sugars and polysaccharides. By separately inactivating the two beta-galactosidase genes of B. subtilis, lacA and yesZ, I showed that lacA was responsible for this effect. I also showed that wild-type Escherichia coli gains the ability to grow on galactan when heterologously expressing LacA together with a B. subtilis galactanase, GalA. This supports the hypothesis that the oligomers of AG-I produced by the GalA (GHF 53) enzyme are substrates for LacA (GHF 42). This is the first in vivo evidence for a reasonable function for the GHF 42 beta-galactosidases, and allows us to start understanding their environmental role. Similar functions for other beta-galactosidases in both GHF 2 and 42 are suggested by genomic data. This indicates that although some GHF 42 enzymes do not hydrolyze lactose, they might be useful for modifying pectic substances in plant-based foods.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5492], "author_name_tesi": "Shipkowski, Stephanie Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Shipkowski", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jean Elnora Brenchley", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Allen T Phillips", "Ming Tien", "James Gregory Ferry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jean Elnora Brenchley, Committee Chair", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Allen T Phillips, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "James Gregory Ferry, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["beta-galactosidases", "glycoside hydrolase family 42", "Bacillus", "gene synteny", "arabinogalactan"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Life patterns of family caregivers of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "id": "15131", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7714", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, degenerative motor neuron disease that is associated with the loss of upper and lower motor neurons.  ALS is a terminal disease that represents an expected death trajectory that impacts greatly on patients as well as the family caregivers who provide the majority of their care.  While providing this critically important care, family caregivers face significant threats to their own health, including psychological, physical, and financial distress.  Despite the strain placed on these family caregivers, little research efforts have been directed at this caregiving phenomenon.  Therefore, the purpose of this research study was to advance understanding of the experience of family caregivers who care for a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through a unitary transformative lens for the advancement of nursing science.  To accomplish this purpose, two aims were established for this research study.  Aim 1 was to document the life patterns of family caregivers of ALS patients exhibited through the nurse researcher/ALS family caregiver process of health as expanding consciousness (HEC).  Aim 2 was to integrate the life patterns of individual family caregivers of ALS patients into a thematic pattern of the whole representing the ALS caregiving experience across all caregiving families.\nMethods: The theory of health as expanding consciousness (Newman, 1979, 1986, 1994) is the theoretical framework for the study and basis for the research protocol. The researcher engaged in a nurse researcher/ALS family caregiver process with a purposive sample of eight family caregivers who care for a loved one with ALS. The researcher and families together facilitated pattern recognition, insights, and transformations to discover and describe the everyday world of providing care to an ALS family member.  Sixteen audio-taped and transcribed open-ended interviews were analyzed using hermeneutic dialectics.  Data collection spanned three months and utilizing researcher as instrument life patterns of health as expanding consciousness emerged as the family caregivers lived day to day providing care to their family member with ALS.\nResults:  Nine patterns of the whole across all ALS family caregivers emerged from the data.  These patterns of the whole were: (a) suspicions emerge but ALS diagnosis is delayed, (b) support that helps the caregiver, (c) support can make caregiving more difficult, (d) looking toward the future, (e) adaptations from ALS, (f) obstacles to the caregiving role, (g) caregiver respite, (h) focus of others, and (i) strategies aiding the caregiving role. The nurse researcher/ALS family caregiver process that was revealed in this research study was: (a) establishing a time and place for the nurse researcher and ALS caregiver to form a relationship, (b) developing a bond with each ALS caregiver, (c) creating an atmosphere which allows the caregiver and nurse complete freedom to express themselves openly, (d) offering a sense of timelessness for insights about the ALS caregiving experience, and (e) transformation as the nurse researcher and ALS family caregiver came together to find meaning in the chaotic experience of family caregiving for an ALS patient.\nConclusion: This research study examined the experience of family caregivers who care for an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patient within the theoretical framework of Newman\u2019s health as expanding consciousness (HEC).  The researcher formed a caring relationship with each family caregiver and made a concerted effort to be fully present in the moment during all interactions with each ALS family caregiver. The caring relationship initiated by the nurse researcher blossomed into a partnership in which both nurse and ALS family caregivers experienced pattern recognition, insight, and transformation. \nThis research provided new insights into the life patterns of ALS family caregivers as well as demonstrated the importance of understanding the meaning of this unique caregiving experience. The insights revealed through this research study disclosed important implications for nursing research and practice while adding to the empirical support of health as expanding consciousness (HEC) and the potential for expansion of this nursing theory and method. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7647], "author_name_tesi": "Shipley, Peggy Zoe", "last_name_ssi": "Shipley", "middle_name_ssi": "Zoe", "first_name_ssi": "Peggy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janice Lee Penrod", "Janice Lee Penrod", "Susan Jayne Loeb", "Sharon Louise Falkenstern", "Fred Michael Schied"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janice Lee Penrod, Dissertation Advisor", "Janice Lee Penrod, Committee Chair", "Susan Jayne Loeb, Committee Member", "Sharon Louise Falkenstern, Committee Member", "Fred Michael Schied, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["family caregiver", "health as expanding consciousness", "ALS", "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "life pattern"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Design, Implementation and Testing of a Hydrogen-Assisted Combustion System for a Light Duty Diesel Vehicle\n", "id": "8345", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4136", "abstract_tesi": "Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects and feasibility of the addition of gaseous hydrogen to the intake air of two similar, production compression-ignition (CI) engines fueled primarily with a biodiesel fuel blend.  In the first experiment, a 1.3L, 52 kW CI engine coupled to an eddy-current dynamometer was tested at eight steady-state operating modes of fixed speed and load.  The operating points for steady-state dynamometer testing were chosen based on those most prevalent in a computer-simulated urban drive cycle.  The drive cycle was simulated in the Matlab-based Powertrain Systems Analytical Toolkit (PSAT) program using the specifications of the engine to be tested along with those of a 2005 Chevrolet Equinox that has been modified for further testing of a hydrogen-assisted diesel combustion system.  During the tests, data were collected on engine operating parameters, fuel consumption, and the concentration of total oxides of nitrogen (NOX) in the exhaust stream.  Each steady-state point was baseline tested, without the addition of hydrogen to the intake air.  Each mode was then tested with hydrogen being fumigated into the intake air at flow rates equivalent to both five and ten percent of the total fuel energy flow into the engine.  \n\nFor the second experiment, the drivetrain of a 2005 Chevrolet Equinox was stripped was removed and replaced with a 1.3L, 67kW CI engine, an improved version of the engine used in the first experiment.  The engine was mated to a five-speed automatic transmission utilizing a modified torque converter calibrated for the CI engine and vehicle mass.  A gaseous hydrogen storage system was installed in the vehicle along with fueling, fuel delivery, leak detection, and hydrogen fuel injection systems developed as part of this experiment.  The gaseous fuel injector used to deliver hydrogen to the engine intake was calibrated to correlate hydrogen flow rate to duty cycle, and a control strategy was developed to inject the hydrogen as a function of real-time diesel fuel energy flow into the engine.  The fuel injection system was controlled by code embedded in a master vehicle controller (MVC) via the vehicle\u2019s controller area network (CAN) bus.  After months of extensive road and track testing of the vehicle operating in the hydrogen-assisted combustion mode, chassis dynamometer testing was used to run repeatable drive cycles while logging data.  On the dynamometer, the vehicle was operated through a portion of the urban drive cycle simulated for the first experiment, while engine data were logged along with diesel and hydrogen fuel flows, and temperature and NOX concentration of the exhaust stream.  The drive cycle was repeated, with different hydrogen quantities commanded, and the same data were logged.  NOX emissions and engine data recorded during the baseline testing were compared with those results obtained while injecting hydrogen during the drive cycles.\n\nThe results of the experiments indicated a slight rise in exhaust temperatures, little change in NOX concentration, and minimal changes in efficiency as the engine was operated with five and ten percent hydrogen during steady state and cycle testing.  An increase in thermal NOX was expected due to elevated exhaust temperature, along with slightly lower efficiency due to the increased premixed combustion of the pilot injection and hydrogen mixture before top dead center.  This effect was expected to be exacerbated by the decrease in the amount of working fluid in the cylinder, as air was displaced by aspirated hydrogen.  The onboard dual-fuel hydrogen-biodiesel system was shown to be feasible through operation, both during dynamometer and road testing.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4115], "author_name_tesi": "Shirk, Matthew Glenn", "last_name_ssi": "Shirk", "middle_name_ssi": "Glenn", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Connell Haworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Connell Haworth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogen diesel", "dual-fuel", "hydrogen", "diesel", "challenge x"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": " Low Salivary Cortisol Levels and Externalizing Behavior Problems: A Latent State Trait Model in Normally Developing Youth\n", "id": "6043", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1710", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-03-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research linking basal cortisol levels with internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in youth has yielded inconsistent results.

For boys only, higher levels of externalizing problem behaviors were consistently associated with lower cortisol attributable to trait-like sources across all three years of behavioral assessment.  The inverse association between individual differences in cortisol and externalizing problem behavior has previously only been reported in studies of at-risk or clinical groups.   The present findings suggest the relationship is a stable phenomenon that spans both normative and atypical child development.

The problem has been aggravated by the overuse of antibiotics and antimicrobial agents leading to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant superbugs such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) which are difficult to kill. Lower immunity of sick patients coupled with the escalating concurrent problem of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has resulted in increasing incidences of hospital acquired (nosocomial) infections. There is an immediate need to control the transmission of such infections, primarily in healthcare environments, by creating touch-contact and work surfaces (e.g., door knobs, push plates, countertops) that utilize alternative antibacterial materials like the heavy metal, silver.\n\nRecent research has shown that it is silver in its ionic (Ag+) and not elemental form that is antibacterial. Thus, silver-based antibacterial surfaces have to release silver ions directly into the pathogenic environment (generally, an aqueous media) in order to be effective. This dissertation presents the study and analysis of a new silver-based surface system that utilizes low intensity direct electric current (LIDC) for generation of silver ions to primarily inhibit indirect contact transmission of infections. The broader objective of this research is to understand the design, and characterization of the electrically activated silver ion-based antibacterial surface system. The specific objectives of this dissertation include:\n(1) Developing a comprehensive system design, and identifying and studying its critical design parameters and functional mechanisms.\n(2) Evaluating effects of the critical design parameters on the antibacterial efficacy of the proposed surface system. \n(3) Developing a response surface model for the surface system performance.\nThese objectives are achieved by formulating the system design, fabricating prototypes with appropriate design parameters, evaluating the prototypes using various physical and electrical characterization techniques, and characterizing the antibacterial efficacy of the prototypes using statistical experiments. The major contributions of this dissertation include:\n(1) Design of a systems focused approach that quantifies the potential effectiveness of silver ions under various configurations of the surface system design.\n(2) Development of meso and micro-scale fabrication methodologies for prototype fabrication.\n(3) Development of microbiological testing protocols utilizing variance reduction techniques to test the antibacterial efficacy of system prototypes.\n(4) Development of empirical models for the surface system using factorial design of experiments.\n\nBasic results from the research demonstrate significant antibacterial efficacy of the surface system against four dangerous bacteria including Staph aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis which are together responsible for more than 80% of nosocomial infections. Results of the DOE characterization study indicate the statistically significant contributions of three system parameters \u2013 size of features, electric current, and type of bacteria \u2013 to the antibacterial performance of the system.\n\nThis dissertation synergistically utilizes knowledge and principles from three broader areas of research \u2013 industrial engineering, materials science and microbiology \u2013 to model, design, fabricate and characterize an electrically activated silver-ion based antibacterial surface system with practical applications in improving human health and healthcare systems.

In the boiling water reactor (BWR) environment, Zircaloy-2 fuel\ncladding and reactor core components, such as water rods and channel boxes, can\nexperience accelerated hydrogen pick-up (higher pickup fraction) at high burnup when\nexposed for one extra 24-month cycle, while Zircaloy-4 components under similar\nconditions do not. Because the principal difference between the two alloys is that\nZircaloy-2 contains nickel, this accelerated hydrogen pick-up has been hypothesized\nto result from the presence of nickel and its role in the corrosion process when\nincorporated into the protective oxide layer.\n\nZircaloy-2 and Zircaloy-4 sister samples were corroded in 360 _C water and an\nadditional set of Zircaloy-2 samples was corroded in 400 _C steam. Total weight\ngain, assumed to be due mostly to oxygen, and hydrogen content were measured as\nfunctions of exposure time. The results indicate that Zircaloy-2 samples absorbed more\nhydrogen than did Zircaloy-4 samples on the basis of total weight gain (hydrogen pickup\nfraction), though both exhibited similar corrosion kinetics parameters. Microbeam\nsynchrotron radiation X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) of selected\nZircaloy-2 samples at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) was used to probe the\noxidation states of nickel and iron in these materials and understand the evolution\nof the oxidation states of these alloying elements as functions of distance from the\noxide/metal interface. Result showed that a significant fraction of nickel atoms\nremained metallic upon incorporation in the oxide layer. In contrast, iron atoms\noxidized much earlier than did nickel atoms and, in most cases, fully oxidized within\nseveral micrometers from the oxide/metal interface. A general hypothesis was made\nthat metallic nickel in contact with the coolant may catalyze the surface reactions\ninvolved in the hydrogen pick-up mechanism.\n\nTo understand accelerated hydrogen pick-up of certain Zircaloy-2 samples at high\nburn-up, additional XANES examinations were performed on Zircaloy-2 water rods\nexposed in-reactor to high burn-up in commercial BWRs. The first set of samples was\ncorroded in the Limerick-1 reactor, while the second set was corroded in the Dresden-2\nreactor. Within each set of samples, fluences, oxide thicknesses, and sample elevations\nwere similar, but hydrogen pick-up fractions were vastly different. In the first set\nof samples, oxide thicknesses ranged from 28 - 35 \u03bcm, but hydrogen pick-up ranged\nbetween 15 and 51%. In the second set of samples, oxide thicknesses ranged between\n3.5 \u03bcm and 16 \u03bcm, but hydrogen pick-up ranged from 28 - 69%. All samples were\nirradiated to fluences between 9.4 and 13.1 \u00d71021 n/cm2 for neutron energies above\n1 MeV. Results of XANES examinations showed a similar correlation between the\ndelayed oxidation of nickel and higher hydrogen pick-up of Zircaloy-2 at high burn-up.\nA significant fraction (greater than 30%) of nickel atoms were found to be in the\nmetallic state in the porous oxide layer. It was hypothesized that this metallic nickel\nis responsible for enhancing hydrogen pick-up by catalyzing the surface reactions that\naffect the overall hydrogen pick-up reaction. This would allow for easier absorption\nof hydrogen into the protective oxide layer from the coolant. Ab initio modeling of\nXANES of selected iron- and nickel-containing compounds was also performed and\ncompared to experimental results to help understand how different populations of\nalloying elements oxidized upon incorporation into the oxide layer.\n\nA concurrent study of the microstructure of oxide layers formed on these same\nirradiated water rods was performed to understand if there was a characteristic\nmicrostructure associated with accelerated hydrogen pick-up. Microbeam X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) at the APS was performed on water rod samples to study oxide\ntexture, phase content, and grain size. A similar examination was performed on\nsteam-corroded Zircaloy-2 to serve as a comparison. Results showed that the oxide\nlayers formed on these samples consisted primarily of highly-oriented monoclinic phase\nzirconium oxide with a small fraction of tetragonal phase oxide.

Body weight (BW) loss achieved by following an energy-restricted diet (ERD) promotes several metabolic benefits, and research suggests additive beneficial effects of certain dietary components within an ERD on weight-related outcomes including BW, body composition, insulin sensitivity and metabolic indicators of cardiovascular disease risk. However, maintenance of bone mineral density (BMD) may be compromised with BW loss, especially with continual cycles of BW loss and regain. Moderate protein (25-30% of kcal) and non-fat dairy (4-5 servings/d) within an ERD may increase the extent to which metabolic benefits are achieved. Similarly, an ERD including moderate dietary protein and non-fat dairy combined with daily exercise may help to maintain BMD with significant BW loss. This research project was conducted to evaluate the effects an ERD including moderate dietary protein and non-fat dairy on BW, body composition, metabolic parameters and inflammatory factors. Secondary measures included biomarkers of bone turnover and BMD. Additionally, a secondary analysis of data was performed to explore the relationship between change in dietary energy density (ED) in study participants during intervention and reductions in BW and fat mass (FM).\nPremenopausal women, ages 20-45 years, with overweight/obesity [body mass index (BMI) \u226525 and <36 kg/m2] were recruited for this 24-week parallel-arm randomized controlled trial. Women were randomized to an ERD including moderate protein (30% of kcal) and non-fat dairy (4-5 servings/d) combined with daily walking (YL group) or to an ERD including standard protein (16-17% of kcal) and non-fat dairy (3 servings/d) combined with daily walking (EXG group), for 12 weeks of weight loss (baseline through Week 12) followed by 12 weeks of weight-loss maintenance (Week 13\u2013Week 24). The proportion of dietary carbohydrate was approximately 45% and 59% of kcal for the YL group and EXG group, respectively. Dietary fat was kept constant comprising approximately 24-25% of total energy in both YL and EXG groups. These macronutrient distribution patterns were maintained throughout the intervention, and women in both YL and EXG groups walked at a moderate pace for 30 to 40 minutes per day for the duration of the study. \nDietary intake, BW, BMI, FM, fat-free soft tissue mass (FFSTM), body fat percentage (BF%), waist circumference, and hip circumference measurements were all primary outcome measures. Central abdominal tissue percentage (CAT%), selected vital signs, resting energy expenditure (REE), blood lipids, glucose, insulin, selected adipose-derived hormones, high-sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (hsCRP), biomarkers of bone turnover and BMD at select skeletal cites were secondary measures.\nBaseline testing was completed by 123 women. Women enrolled at Week 2 (n=104) were included in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and an efficacy analysis was conducted including the 80 women who completed the 24-week intervention. Multivariate analysis of covariance with repeated measures on the time factor were performed to assess differences between YL and EXG groups. Independent or paired t-tests using Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons were completed when significant group or group x time interactions were found. Tests were two-sided, and a probability of p<0.01 was considered statistically significant for primary analysis.\nWomen with compete dietary records (n=71) were separated into dietary ED change tertiles and included in an exploratory secondary analysis examining change in the primary outcomes of BW, body composition and anthropometrics. Tertile 1 included 23 women who had a small mean reduction in ED (\u22640.67 kcal/g), Tertile 2 (n=24) included women with a medium reduction in ED (>0.68 and <0.87 kcal/g), and Tertile 3 (n=24) included women with a large reduction in energy density (\u22650.92 kcal/g) from baseline to Week 12. A 3x3 analysis of covariance with repeated measures on the time factor were performed to assess differences between tertiles of ED change across three time intervals. Bonferroni adjustments were applied for multiple comparisons when significant group or group x time interactions were found. A probability of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nUsing ITT analysis, estimated average energy intake was significantly reduced in both YL and EXG groups, respectively, from baseline by 25% and 30% at Week 12 and by 18% and 27% at Week 24 with no significant differences between groups. Protein intake did not reach 30% of total energy intake as designed in the YL group; however, estimated average protein intake was significantly greater in the YL group compared to EXG group at Week 12. No significant effect of time was observed for estimated energy expenditure from self-reported physical activity records.\nThere were no significant effects of diet group on body composition and anthropometric measurements. Both YL and EXG groups, respectively, had significant decreases in BW (-4.9\u00b13.2 and -4.3\u00b13.3 kg), BMI (-1.8\u00b11.2 and -1.6\u00b11.2 kg/m2), FM (-3.0\u00b12.2 and -2.3\u00b12.3 kg), FFSTM (-1.5\u00b11.6 and -1.7\u00b12.1 kg), BF% (-1.7\u00b11.7 and -1.2\u00b12.0 %), waist circumference (-4.4\u00b12.9 and -3.8\u00b13.1 cm), hip circumference (-4.7\u00b13.5 and -4.3\u00b13.6 cm) and CAT% (-3.0\u00b13.2 and -2.8\u00b12.9 %), from baseline to Week 12. These losses were maintained through Week 24. Group x time interactions were not observed for any of the primary outcome variables. Similar results were found with analysis in study completers.\n\tThere were no significant effects of diet group on resting heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and REE with ITT analysis. There were no significant differences in resting heart rate or systolic and diastolic BP over time in either YL or EXG groups, and group x time interactions were not observed for any of these measures. There was a significant reduction in REE from baseline to Week 12, which was maintained through Week 24 in both groups. Similar results were found with efficacy analysis, with the exception of a significant increase in diastolic BP between Weeks 12 and 24.  \nThere were no significant effects of diet group for biochemical markers of health with ITT analysis, and women in both groups experienced a significant reduction in triglycerides and total cholesterol concentrations from baseline to Week 12. These reductions were maintained to Week 24. Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly decreased at Week 12, but this reduction was no longer significant at Week 24. There were no other significant changes in groups over time, and group x time interactions were not observed in any of these secondary outcome measures. Results were similar with efficacy analysis.\nSignificant diet group effects were not found for serum leptin, resistin and adiponectin concentrations. Leptin concentration significantly decreased from baseline to Week 12, and this reduction was maintained through Week 24 in both groups. There were no significant changes in resistin concentration over time. There was a significant increase in adiponectin between Weeks 12 and 24 in both groups. Significant group x time interactions were not observed in these adipose-derived hormones. Results using efficacy analysis were similar to ITT analysis.\nThere were no significant differences in markers of bone turnover, including N-telopeptide of type I collagen and osteocalcin, between groups or over time. hsCRP decreased significantly from baseline to Week 12 in all women, and this reduction was maintained to Week 24. There were no significant differences in BMD at the total body, lumbar spine, total proximal femur and forearm between YL and EXG groups or over time. Results were similar with efficacy analysis.\n\tIn secondary analysis of ED change tertiles, women in Tertiles 1, 2 and 3 significantly reduced estimated energy intakes and ED; these reductions were maintained through Week 24. By design, Tertiles 2 and 3 had greater reductions in ED than Tertile 1, and Tertile 3 had a greater reduction in ED than Tertile 2.\nWomen in Tertiles 1, 2 and 3 significantly reduced BW, BMI, FM, FFSTM, waist and hip circumferences and CAT% from baseline to Week 12. Participants in Tertile 2 also reduced BF% from baseline to Week 12 and maintained this reduction to Week 24. The pattern of change in BW, BMI, FM, BF% and waist circumference was significantly different between tertiles. Women in Tertile 2 had significantly greater reductions in BW and BMI at Weeks 12 and 24 and greater reductions in FM, BF% and waist circumference at Week 24 compared to women in Tertile 1 but not compared to Tertile 3.\nFree-living, premenopausal women with excess adiposity, facilitated by a weight-loss intervention including dietary modification within an ERD and moderate walking exercise significantly reduced BW and FM, triglycerides, total cholesterol, CRP and leptin across a 12-week weight-loss phase and maintained these changes across a 12-week weight-loss maintenance phase. The absence of detectable differences in primary outcome variables and markers of bone turnover and BMD between YL and EXG groups suggests that these two approaches, both meeting dietary guidelines for intake of at least three servings of dairy per day and recommendations for protein intake, may have been equally effective at inducing BW loss and maintaining BMD. In conclusion, free-living, premenopausal women with overweight/obesity who completed a 6-month lifestyle intervention with sufficient protein and non-fat dairy intake along with daily moderate walking achieved and maintained an approximate 6% loss of BW while reducing FM, CRP and leptin, and maintaining BMD.\nSecondary analysis from this research project found that women who had a medium reduction in dietary ED, within a lifestyle intervention that included an ERD and daily walking, had greater reductions in BW, BMI, FM, BF% and waist circumference compared to women who had a small reduction in ED through Week 24. Thus, medium or large reductions of dietary ED best promoted BW and FM losses, suggesting a sustainable approach to weight-loss maintenance. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7486], "author_name_tesi": "Shlisky, Julie Danielle", "last_name_ssi": "Shlisky", "middle_name_ssi": "Danielle", "first_name_ssi": "Julie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sharon M Nickols Richardson", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Connie Jo Rogers", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Neil Sharkey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sharon M Nickols Richardson, Dissertation Advisor", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Neil Sharkey, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["weight loss", "protein", "dairy", "bone", "body composition"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Lepidopteran Larval Salivary Secretions and their Effect on Tomato Plant Defenses", "id": "10227", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1726", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nForty-five percent of the over one million described insect species feed on plants.  Agricultural losses due to arthropod pests account for about 100 billion dollars annually.  Investigation of the role of caterpillar saliva is motivated by the long-term coevolutionary relationship between plants and the herbivores that consume them.  Over the past 35 years it has become increasingly apparent that a wounded plant undergoes a variety of significant changes in plant chemistry and these changes affect the palatability of the plant as well as the fitness of the herbivore.  Many plant defenses are activated and these include the accumulation of protease inhibitor genes.  The cost related to these defenses provides the selection pressure behind the evolution of inducible defenses.  Using genetic engineering in conjunction with these naturally occurring genes can lead to a more environmentally friendly pest management solution.  This work is an important contribution towards investigating a cost-effective, environmentally safe solution to the insect herbivores\u2019 role in the loss of crops in agriculture.  \nIn this research I have investigated seven lepidopteran larvae:  H. zea, H. virescens, S. frugiperda, S. exigua, O. nubilalis, T. ni and M. sexta.  Saliva initiates digestive processes and may also be the first line of defense against microbes as well as plant defenses.  Salivary glucose oxidase is primarily produced in the labial glands, and many entomologists currently believe it helps to suppress toxins produced by plants that are triggered by herbivore feeding.  Herbivores acquire their amino acid nutrition from plant proteins.  Many plant defense genes such as protease inhibitors block amino acid uptake in the feeding herbivore depriving it of the nutrition it needs.  Protease inhibitor proteins are found in all forms of life and are one of the most plentiful classes of proteins found in the living world.  In 1972, Green and Ryan were the first to discover the accumulation of protease inhibitors after wounding.  Tomato has been widely studied as a model system for investigating the mechanism of induced resistance based on its\u2019 response to wounding and herbivory.  Tomato leaf inhibitor II is a protein that acts as a potent inhibitor of endopeptidases displaying specificity towards trypsin and chymotrypsin proteases; it accumulates in the leaf as a result of insect attack.  Jasmonates are a class of oxylipin molecules that are the best-characterized class of elicitors involved in the defensive responses of plants to wounding and herbivory.  Ethylene, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), oligogalacturonides (OGAs), fatty acid-amino acid conjugates (FACs), and abscisic acid (ABA) along with UV light activate jasmonic acid (JA) formation.  Salicylate and nitric oxide (NO) repress JA formation.  Local wounding along with prosystemin causes systemin to bind to the SR160 receptor.  This activation of systemin along with the activation of JA leads to pin2 formation via the octadecanoid pathway.  Protease inhibitor genes provide a new perspective on improving plant defense systems through two routes:  either through using traditional breeding methods in order to select lines with enhanced expression or through the use of DNA technologies for the direct transfer of inhibitor genes to target specific digestive enzymes of pests and/or pathogens of plants.\nThe systemic nature of induced plant responses can be compared with the vertebrate immune response based on the manner in which endocrine signals target several tissues through the circulatory system.  The polypeptide systemin has been isolated from tomato leaves and was found to be a powerful signal for systemic defense as well as inducing and regulating over 20 defense genes.  Choice tests have been used to answer a broad array of research questions pertaining to behavior.  Researchers try to obtain an understanding of insect feeding preference because understanding it is critical to the fields of entomology and ecology.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1712], "author_name_tesi": "Shoemaker, Erica Beth", "last_name_ssi": "Shoemaker", "middle_name_ssi": "Beth", "first_name_ssi": "Erica", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Felton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Felton, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lepidopteran Salivary Secretions", "Tomato Plant Defenses"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Acceleration Response of Rigid and Flexible Nonstructural Components in Building Subjected to Strong Ground Motions", "id": "10739", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2895", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A formulation is presented for estimating the maximum horizontal acceleration of nonstructural components attached to the floor system of multistory structures subjected to strong earthquake motions.\n\tFirst, a method is developed for rigid nonstructural components after shake-table acceleration data measured on the horizontal floor diaphragms of small-scale multistory reinforced concrete test structures.

This is a county-level analysis that explores how different ecological-level factors, such as the rurality of a county, the rate of family planning clinics, and percentage of population in poverty affect the teenage birth rate.  Three separate measures of rurality are used in this analysis: rural dummy, rural rate, and population density.  Using the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s definition of rural, the rural dummy measure assigns the county a value of one if 50 percent or more of the total population is classified as rural, the rural rate is measured as the rural population divided by the total population, and then multiplied by 1,000, and the population density is measured as the total population per square mile of land in the county.  Using multiple secondary data sources including the National Center for Health Statistics 2004 non-public use microdata natality file and Summary Files 1 & 3 of the 2000 U.S. Census, three separate weighted least squares regression models are estimated using each of the rurality measures, and the results are compared.

I find that the spatial error regression model is a better model fit than ordinary least squares and weighted least squares regression models.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) have detrimental effects on both the mother and her infant (Bryson, Ioannou, Rulyak, and Critchlow 2003).  Approximately 5 to 10 percent of pregnant women in the United States experience HDP (Bryson, Ioannou, Rulyak, and Critchlow 2003; Sibai, Ewell, Levine, Klebanoff, Esterlitz, Catalano, Goldenberg, and Joffe 1997).\n     Differentials in HDP have been well documented for women of various racial and ethnic groups, women of different socioeconomic statuses, and for those women participating in individual health risk behaviors.  Despite the growing body of research on disparities in HDP, and the fact that 20 percent of births that occur in the United States are to women who live in rural areas (Lishner, Larson, Rosenblatt, and Clark 1999), very little attention has been paid to disparities in HDP in rural areas compared to more urbanized places.  To date, research has not addressed geographical differentials in HDP due to individual and residential characteristics.  This dissertation seeks to examine the extent to which the odds of a woman experiencing HDP differ by individual and residential/county-level characteristics. \n     Predictors of HDP may not be limited to individual-level maternal demographic and behavioral characteristics.  The characteristics of counties in which women live also may affect the odds of a woman experiencing HDP.  In addition, the effect of individual characteristics may vary from place to place and the impact of residential context may vary from person to person; therefore, it was necessary to test for cross-level interactions in order to tease out the relevant effects on health (Verheij 1996).  In order to correctly account for the hierarchical nature of the hypothesized relationships and structure of the data, multilevel logistic regression models were estimated using data from the 2007 National Center for Health Statistics Non-Public-Use Natality Detail Files linked to characteristics of the women\u2019s county of residence across rural and urban areas of the United States.\n     This study goes beyond prior research on HDP by demonstrating how the combined attributes of the places in which women live (such as population density, isolation, and large distances between residences and health care services) affect the likelihood of a pregnant woman experiencing HDP.  In addition, this dissertation builds upon previous research that has focused on rural/urban health disparities and disparities in pregnancy outcomes by considering how multiple indicators of rurality (i.e., ecological, occupational, and sociocultural dimensions) are associated with HDP.\n     Specifically, the results of this study identified that when women live in more rural areas they are more likely to experience HDP.  After establishing this geographical disparity in HDP, further analyses revealed that the effect of individual maternal characteristics on HDP varied significantly by the level and dimension of rurality of the woman\u2019s residential county.  By identifying these differences, more appropriate strategies for reducing the odds of HDP can be established through health policy and other initiatives.

Confirmation from semitrailer repair facilities found that in some cases the semitrailer\u2019s supporting structure developed unexpected cracks.  These cracks were not thought to be age related but were most likely caused by high stresses from coupling.  A literature search found no valid documented kingpin coupling tests and determined the SAE J133 kingpin loading requirements were incorrect.  Previous reports relating to kingpin impact testing only tested the kingpin itself and not the kingpin supporting structure on the semitrailer or employed vague descriptions of actual test procedures.  \n\nThe development of a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model of the tractor-semitrailer coupling determined that high coupling speeds would overload the kingpin-fifthwheel structure.  The FEA model also allowed researchers to determine that a damping system would lower the forces at the semitrailer\u2019s kingpin and tractor\u2019s fifthwheel interface to an acceptable magnitude equivalent to forces experienced during normal operations.  To begin the modeling, the kingpin supporting structure consisted of rigid elements.  \n\nValidation of the FEA models was provided through two separate sets of tests.  A coupling test was conducted at the Applied Research Laboratory (ARL) at the Pennsylvania State University.  The FEA model gave predictions of the tractor deceleration during coupling tests within 10% of the measured decelerations at various impact speeds.  \n\nThe other set of validation tests was conducted at the Mack Trucks facility in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  The FEA model was used to predict tractor CG decelerations for a heavy weight trailer to within 10% of the test data.  \n\nThe original tractor-semitrailer coupling FEA model was refined to include an elastic kingpin supporting structure.  The elastic kingpin supporting structure model was compared to the original rigid kingpin supporting structure model; the elastic simulation was within 3% difference when compared to the original Mack Trucks rigid model.  The modified semitrailer model was used to predict standardized SAE J133 vertical and horizontal kingpin coupling loads in order to calculate the stress distribution within the kingpin supporting structure.  \n\nThe simulations and validation tests provided information to develop a fifthwheel damping system.  Preliminary design concepts were simulated using the validated coupling FEA model to provide an optimized set of parameters.  The implementation of the translational fifthwheel spring/damper system in the simulation resulted in a considerable reduction of impact force and tractor decelerations.  The simulations and measured results have provided enough data to facilitate the detailed design of a damping system prototype.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [833], "author_name_tesi": "Shoffner, Brent William", "last_name_ssi": "Shoffner", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Brent", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Moustafa El Gindy", "Kevin L Koudela"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Moustafa El Gindy, Thesis Advisor", "Kevin L Koudela, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["FEA", "kingpin", "Fifthwheel", "Coupling"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Genotype-phenotype relationships and the patterning of complex traits as exemplified in the mammalian dentition\n\n", "id": "8971", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5633", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The relationship between genes and traits is complex, involving the interaction among genes, environment, and chance.  However, common practice in genetics treats this relationship as a straightforward one-to-one mapping from genotype to phenotype.  The roots of this practice can be traced to Mendel who chose traits with a direct relationship between genetic variation and phenotypic variation in formulating his particulate theory of inheritance.  It has been further solidified by the successes of modern genetics in identifying genes involved in many simple traits, such as rare human diseases.  However, most traits are not simple and to understand complex traits it is necessary to decipher the developmental processes that occur between genes and traits.  To date most attempts to build developmental models of traits have relied on natural or experimentally induced mutations that produce pathologic-scale phenotypic effects, but the raw material of most evolution is normal variation in traits found among members of a population.  The goals of this dissertation, therefore, are to describe the cellular mechanisms and developmental processes that lead to a many-to-many genotype-phenotype relationship and to attempt to decipher the genetic and developmental processes that produce normal variation in traits using the mammalian dentition as a model system.\n  Two approaches to understanding the genotype-phenotype relationship are described and examples given of how both lead to a many-to-many relationship.  First, cellular and genetic mechanisms, such as alternative splicing, DNA and chromatin modification, cellular gene choice, and gene regulation, which lead from DNA sequence to protein structure, are discussed.   And, second, examples of variation in the genotype-phenotype relationship which can produce variable phenotypes from the same genetic information and stable phenotypes despite genetic variation are presented.  \nTo examine how normal variation in complex repeated traits such as the mammalian dentition is produced two experimental approaches are taken.  First, the AXB/BXA recombinant inbred mouse set is used to genetically map normal variation identified in cusp pattern between the teeth of C57BL/6J and A/J mice.  Three chromosomal regions on mouse chromosomes 11, 13, and 19 reach the suggestive level of association with the trait.  Within these regions candidate genes are identified by direct sequence comparison between the C57BL/6J and A/J mice.  Two genes, Itga3 and Glis3, with non-synonymous substitutions and several genes with potential regulatory variation, including epiprofin/Sp6, may play a role in producing the variation identified.  Additionally, identification of all genes in the mapping regions that are expressed in developing teeth using the GenePaint database suggests that traditional methods of identifying candidate genes are biased.  In the second approach the expression of the signaling molecule Bmp4 was altered transgenically using the epithelium-specific enhancer of the Dlx2 gene.  No overt phenotype was produced suggesting that tooth development is robust to over-expression of Bmp4.  Examination of gene expression of downstream targets and antagonists of BMP4 suggests that a complex buffering mechanism is involved.\nThis dissertation highlights the complexities of the genotype-phenotype relationship and attempts to directly confront this complexity by developing methods to study normal variation in traits.  The question of how normal variation is produced is complex and no simple answers are provided, but the importance of explaining complex common traits and the production of normal variation for biomedical purposes and our basic understanding of evolution means that we cannot hide from this complexity or pretend it does not exist.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5630], "author_name_tesi": "Sholtis, Samuel Jacob", "last_name_ssi": "Sholtis", "middle_name_ssi": "Jacob", "first_name_ssi": "Samuel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Monrad Weiss", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss", "Joan Therese Richtsmeier", "Alan Walker", "Cooduvalli S Shashikant", "Kazuhiko Kawasaki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Monrad Weiss, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss, Committee Chair", "Joan Therese Richtsmeier, Committee Member", "Alan Walker, Committee Member", "Cooduvalli S Shashikant, Committee Member", "Kazuhiko Kawasaki, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Genetics", "Developmental Biology", "Evo-devo", "mammalian dentition", "patterning", "genotype-phenotype"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Problem Definition and Agenda Setting Among Pennsylvania's Municipal Governments:  Sex Offender Residency Restriction Ordinances\n\n", "id": "10168", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1386", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examined public problem definition and agenda setting at the local government level.

Multiple methods were employed for this single state case study including the primary means of statistical analyses, content analysis, and time analysis.  These were supplemented by survey research and records research. \n \nResults suggested that ordinances enacted by one municipality triggered another municipality to consider the issue.

However, the ordinances' details covered a wide range of specified restricted areas, distances, processes, protocols, and sanctions for violations.  The subjective nature of policy making was exposed as was the lack of evidence-based research and practices.\n\nEnd products included a model for examination of agenda setting and problem definition in this field across states and a framework for measuring components of ordinances themselves.

One of the challenges in dairy farming is properly managing manure.  Manure can be used as a fertilizer but also has environmental concerns.  Anaerobic digesters offer farmers the opportunity to gain more benefits from their manure.  Anaerobic digesters produce biogas which is approximately 60% methane.  The methane can be burned in an engine generator set to produce electricity and heat.  Both the electricity and heat can be used to help offset some of the farm\u2019s costs. \n\tHowever, farmers have little knowledge and time to devote to digester operation.  For that reason, problems can be difficult to correct and uncorrected problems can lead to digester failure.  A computerized monitoring and operation system could alert the farmer to problems sooner and allow the farmer to remotely operate the digester, and thus save the farmer time and reduce the risks of digester failure.

We found that 66% of 471 sinks and 80% of 131 buildings surveyed yielded at least one Fusarium culture.  The 297 isolates of Fusarium collected were subjected to MLST to identify the phylogenetic species and sequence types (STs) of these isolates. The six most common STs in sinks were identical to those most frequently associated with human infections. We speculate that the most prevalent STs, by virtue of their ability to form and grow in biofilms, are well adapted to plumbing systems. The most common group observed, the Fusarium solani species complex, (FSSC) is the most common group of fusaria associated with life-threatening opportunistic human infections as well as infections of the cornea.  Here we present the description and taxonomy of Fusarium fistularum sp. nov., the single most common human pathogen in the genus Fusarium, that was previously known as FSSC Group 2.  F. fistularum is genetically diverse, cosmopolitan and associated with biofilms on plumbing surfaces in the environment.  Morphologically, F. fistularum isolates show high levels of variation in a range of characteristics that are typical for most concepts of \u2018F. solani,\u2019 with many isolates failing to produce sporodochia in culture and possessing aberrant morphological characters.  Similar ranges of morphology were observed in three other commonly encountered phylogenetic species in FSSC.  Secondary metabolites produced by F. fistularum include anhydrofusarubin, fusarubin, solaniol, and javanicin.  A haematonectria-like heterothallic sexual stage was produced for F. fistularum; an epitype was provided for the sexual stage, and described as an addendum to the description of F. fistularum.  Most pairings of isolates indicated possible high levels of infertility.  In addition, based on a DNA sequence connection with an ex-Type culture, we apply the name F. petroliphilum, elevated to species status from F. solani var. petroliphilum, to another common Fusarium species associated with human infections and biofilms, FSSC 1.  To better understand the population dynamics of this F. fistularum for purposes of epidemiology and control, we expanded an existing 3-locus MLST system by adding six novel sequence-based markers developed based on the complete genome sequence of Nectria haematococca Mating Population VI (FSSC 11).   9-locus MLSTs were generated for 231 isolates from six continents and from a variety of sources, including plumbing and from human and animal infections.  High levels of genetic diversity and evidence for both recombination and clonality were detected among 111 unique 9-locus STs. Inclusion of the mating type as a tenth marker revealed ten additional STs, indicating that true clones are not well resolved even with ten loci.  The most common ST (2-d2), with 49 members, was found in plumbing, contact lenses and lens cases, as well as fusarial keratitis. No evidence for population differentiation between clinical isolates and isolates from environmental sources was found.  Cryptic speciation with F. fistularum suggested in the previous three-locus MLST system was not supported with the addition of new loci, but evidence of introgression of ribosomal RNA genes from another strongly supported phylogenetic species also known from plumbing and human infections (FSSC 9), was detected in two isolates of F. fistularum.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1520], "author_name_tesi": "Short, Dylan Phillip", "last_name_ssi": "Short", "middle_name_ssi": "Phillip", "first_name_ssi": "Dylan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Michael Geiser", "David Michael Geiser", "Maria Del Mar Jiminez Gasco", "Gary William Moorman", "Seogchan Kang", "Eddie Holmes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Michael Geiser, Dissertation Advisor", "David Michael Geiser, Committee Chair", "Maria Del Mar Jiminez Gasco, Committee Member", "Gary William Moorman, Committee Member", "Seogchan Kang, Committee Member", "Eddie Holmes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mycotic keratitis", "opportunistic pathogens", "fungi", "multilocus sequence typing", "phylogenetic diversity", "Fusarium", "population genetics", "species diversity"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Kantian Cosmopolitanism and the Racial Hierarchy", "id": "27113", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "11954", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation offers an account of Kant's concept of race in the context of his cosmopolitan theory. This account is framed as a critical response to two widely accepted claims: the claim that Kant's work can be separated into distinct periods before and after he allegedly abandoned his thinking about race, and the claim that Kant's views on race are marginal, having no systematic implications for the rest of his philosophy. I contend that the concept of race is an integral part of what Kant sets out to accomplish in the 1790s. His understanding of the cosmopolitan society is built on the theory of inequality, and that theory has its start in the concept of race along two concepts. The first is the idea that the human race must be stratified on the basis of racialized characteristics which are related to Anlagen. Second, based on these natural inabilities, certain groups within the species are justified in their inferior status. I show that Kant integrates these two ways of looking at race into a theory of inequality that has a decisive impact on his cosmopolitanism. In turn, my critical approach to the marginalization of Kant's concept of race in recent scholarship is thematic: I examine Kant's texts on race, teleology, and cosmopolitanism as a part of a single coherent narrative about the purpose of race.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11396], "author_name_tesi": "Shorter, Jameliah Inga", "last_name_ssi": "Shorter", "middle_name_ssi": "Inga", "first_name_ssi": "Jameliah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Lambert Bernasconi", "Kathryn Teresa Gines", "Sarah Clark Miller", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Lambert Bernasconi, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathryn Teresa Gines, Committee Member", "Sarah Clark Miller, Committee Member", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["race", "Kant", "Cosmopolitanism", "Anlagen", "slavery"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Molecular Tubes as Receptors for Biological Analytes", "id": "6361", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "702", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The design, synthesis, and binding properties of novel molecular tubes based on naphthalene subunits are described.

The results suggest that images alone and text descriptions alone are equally effective at conveying visually salient landscape attributes.

To further improve the efficiency, pressure ratios in modern gas turbine engines continue to rise, which also causes higher temperatures in the turbine and combustor.  As such, advanced cooling methods are necessary to protect the engine components from the high temperatures that occur in the engine and to maintain durability.  Modern combustors commonly use a double-walled liner with impingement and effusion cooling plates.  The impingement cooling enhances the backside cooling, while the effusion cooling creates a protective film on the external surface.  In addition, modern combustor liners also include large dilution holes to promote mixing of the air and fuel in a process that reduces NOx emissions.  However, the dilution jets interrupt the cooling film, making it difficult to cool the combustor walls, especially near the dilution holes.\n\tThis study evaluates the surface cooling effectiveness and flowfield for a double-walled combustor liner with impingement and effusion cooling as well as a row of large dilution holes.  The effusion cooling hole pattern was varied with three different hole patterns in the region surrounding the dilution holes including:  no additional effusion holes, effusion holes blowing radially outward from the dilution holes, and effusion holes blowing radially inward toward the dilution holes.  The momentum flux ratio of the dilution jets and approaching freestream turbulence were also varied.  The effusion hole patterns with addition effusion holes surrounding the dilution holes improved the cooling effectiveness through in-hole convection.  For each panel geometry, increasing the momentum flux ratio generally increased effectiveness levels with diminishing returns.  In addition, decreasing the approaching freestream turbulence intensity increased the effectiveness across the panels.  Flowfield measurements showed that the outward blowing effusion jets created a vortex that transported a significant amount of freestream fluid toward the surface at the leading edge of the dilution hole.

Finally, despite knowledge that occupations are highly segregated by race/ethnicity, research has failed to examine how occupational characteristics might differ by race/ethnicity and that outcomes associated with working in occupations with specific characteristics may differ by race/ethnicity.\n\nThe studies presented here expand on prior studies by linking data from the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Information Network (O*NET) with the National Survey of Fertility and Infertility (NSFI).  The O*NET is a database of over one hundred characteristics for nearly one thousand occupations.  Randomly selected employees working in each occupation responded to standardized questionnaires regarding the characteristics of their occupations.  The NSFI is a nationally-representative sample of women between the ages of 25 and 45 that includes a number of variables related to fertility.  Occupational characteristics of prestige, autonomy, supervising others, complexity, supportive workplace practices and policies, hazardous working conditions, routinization, and high interpersonal conflict from the O*NET were linked to NSFI respondents\u2019 occupations.  This provides subjective assessments of occupational characteristics.\n\nThis dissertation demonstrates that occupational characteristics differ by race/ethnicity, and several characteristics have implications for women\u2019s fertility intentions and ideals and individual well-being as assessed by life satisfaction.  Many of the significant outcomes associated with occupational characteristics are moderated by race/ethnicity, indicating that minority women experience differential outcomes from White women.  These findings suggest that occupational characteristics have an important role in the relationship between work and well-being for women, but not all women derive the same benefits or face the same negative consequences based on their occupational characteristics.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3488], "author_name_tesi": "Shreffler, Karina M.", "last_name_ssi": "Shreffler", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Karina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David R Johnson", "Alan Booth", "Michelle Lynn Frisco", "Robert Drago"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David R Johnson, Committee Chair", "Alan Booth, Committee Member", "Michelle Lynn Frisco, Committee Member", "Robert Drago, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["occupational segregation", "ethnicity", "race", "job characteristics", "occupational characteristics", "fertility", "life satisfaction"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Readability and German Bibles", "id": "8550", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4681", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary goal of this dissertation is to compare two German Bible versions in terms of readability and related linguistic features: the classic translation of Martin Luther and the more modern translation Hoffnung f\u00fcr alle.

In order to compare the readability of these two texts, I explore four linguistic areas via the use of corpus analysis:  1) lexical density, 2) clausal complexity, 3) nominalization, and 4) lexical bundles.  Each of these areas is analyzed based on markers that can be searched for within the corpus, relying mainly on part-of-speech tagging of content words and conjunctions, suffix markers of nominalization, and the frequency of recurring lexical bundles.  Using the patterns established via corpus analysis, I discuss the implications of those patterns for readability.  \nThere has been much criticism and praise of both versions of the Bible to be discussed here.  Most criticism, however, is based on limited linguistic data.  It is the aim of this project to compare the two versions via statistically prevalent linguistic aspects of readability found in the two texts.  Critique based on a systematic study of readability will contribute to the vast literature already present on Bible translation, as well as to the literature engaged in the study of Luther and his works.

Essays are titled: (1) Maternal human capital and childhood stunting in Nepal: a multi-level modeling approach, (2) Community environmental contexts and childhood underweight status in Nepal: a multi-level modeling approach, and (3) Government farm payments and off-farm labor response of principal farm operators: a spatial analysis of U.S county-level data.\n\nThe first essay examines the influence of maternal human capital: maternal education, maternal health and community maternal education on childhood stunting, a form of long-term child nutritional deprivation, in Nepal. Community maternal education that captures community spillover effects of maternal education is a new innovation adopted in this study of child nutritional deprivation. This study adopts the multi-level modeling approach to account for the unobserved heterogeneity of the childhood stunting outcome at the household and community levels. Data for this study are from the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS), 2001. Maternal own education is negatively related to childhood stunting, especially with higher levels of education. Interestingly, the spillover effect of community maternal education stands out to be negative and robust on the childhood stunting outcome, even if mothers of children are uneducated. Further, results provide evidence of intergenerational transmission of genetic endowment from mother to child: mother\u2019s height is negatively related to childhood stunting, regardless of mother\u2019s educational attainment and place of residence. Key policy implications drawn from the findings, among others, are that the public health policy of alleviating long-term nutritional deprivation among children should further emphasize (1) promoting education among women and mothers, and (2) not only child nutritional health but also maternal long-term health, especially in geographically-disadvantaged areas. \n\nThe second essay also utilizes the multi-level modeling approach applied to nationally-representative NDHS data. This study focuses on community environmental contexts, especially season and altitude of current place of residence as potential determinants of childhood underweight (short-term nutritional deprivation) among preschool-age children in Nepal. These factors have been largely overlooked in past studies on childhood underweight status. Results provide unequivocal evidence of seasonal variation in childhood underweight status. The odds of children being underweight during the unfavorable season are much higher than during the favorable season. Wealthier households appear to be able to better cope with the environmental stresses associated with unfavorable season. Overall, the caste/ethnicity of household heads is found to moderate the influence of altitude on childhood underweight status. However, in urban communities, the odds of children being underweight significantly decrease with altitude. Findings suggest that public health policies towards achieving the Millennium development Goals of alleviating short-term childhood nutritional deprivation in Nepal should account for seasonal variation in prevalence of childhood underweight status. Public health and food security interventions targeting child nutritional health should be concentrated in pre-harvest months. Similarly, lower altitude urban areas where underweight prevalence is higher should be the focus of public health and food security interventions. \n\nThe focus of the third essay is on participation and scale effects of U.S. government farm payments in total and by type on off-farm employment decisions of U.S. principal farm operators working off-farm for at least 200 days a year. Additionally, this paper for the first time ascertains if there exists a spatial dependency in off-farm employment decisions in the U.S. The paper adopts a recently-developed technique, the Feasible Generalized Spatial Two-Stage Least Squares (FGS2SLS) estimator, to address a system of equations with spatial lagged dependent variables and spatial dependency in error structure as well as endogenous explanatory variables. The county-level data are primarily from the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture. Results provide evidence of spatial dependency of off-farm employment among principal farm operators in the U.S., suggesting the need to correct for spatial bias in any off-farm employment studies in the U.S. Overall, participation and scale of government farm payments are negatively related to off-farm response of principal farm operators, but the extent of effects varies substantially between participation and scale of government payments. Further, different types of government payments have different impacts on the extent of off-farm response of principal farm operators. Interestingly, the off-farm employment impacts of government farm payments by type are associated with the magnitude of income transfer, suggesting policy consideration of strong caps on government farm payments. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5789], "author_name_tesi": "Shrestha, Sundar Shyam", "last_name_ssi": "Shrestha", "middle_name_ssi": "Shyam", "first_name_ssi": "Sundar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics and Demography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis", "David Gerard Abler", "David Blandford", "John B Casterline"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis, Committee Chair", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Chair", "David Blandford, Committee Member", "John B Casterline, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["child stunting", "chuild underweight", "child malnutrition", "government farm payments", "spatial dependency", "spillover effects"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Object Lessons: Examination Of Spending\nand Revenue Patterns In Pennsylvania\nk-12 Public School Distircts:\n1998 Through 2008\n", "id": "18858", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9009", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "                   Abstract\n\tThis study analyzed changes in school district expenditure spending patterns to observe how major educational policies, initiatives, and mandates translated or were reflected by school district expenditure accounting. The target population was all 501 Pennsylvania school districts from 1998 through 2008. Within that time period, district expenditure patterns were examined focused at the major Object and Function series of accounts. Object codes by design capture strong indicators of expenditure traits. Expenditures changes over time observed in each object\u2019s share of total expenditures, the share of new funds it commanded, and the direction of share growth or decline. Mandates and state policy may have expenditure impact on districts by design, default, or by unintended consequence. Analyses revealing policy lead and lag times, as well as trend direction and strength may provide valuable insight for understanding component flows of school district expenditures.  The confluence of a decade of increasing mandates, major policy implementations, and student outcome accountability measures met headlong into the great 2008 recession. There remains a tremendous amount of legacy costs facing school finance funding systems, including multi-year labor contracts, pension liabilities, contractual health care obligations, post-retirement benefit packages, debt service and capital requirements for infrastructure and major equipment needs. There is little indication that districts or states have taken time to fully analyze impact and adjust to post recession spending patterns for school funding policy. To that end, this study observed and analyzed educational expenditure and revenue trends over a decade and investigated linkages to public policy initiatives that were occurring over the time period. Understanding these past trends, inclusive of trend strength and direction, serve to provide well-grounded perspective to vision post-recession policy issues.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8844], "author_name_tesi": "Shrom, Tim ", "last_name_ssi": "Shrom", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tim", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Hartman", "Preston C Green Iii", "Roger C Shouse", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Hartman, Dissertation Advisor", "Preston C Green Iii, Committee Member", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["K-12 School Finance", "Multi-Year Expenditure Study", "Expenditure Share Changes over-time", "Object and Function Expenditure Analysis", "State Policy impact on School Expenditures"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "AN INVESTIGATION OF MEASUREMENT METHODS TO TEST CUTTING FLUID EFFECTS ON TOOL WEAR IN THE PROCESSING OF ACME THREADS\n", "id": "12505", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5634", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n A single point threading process is used to cut threads for pipe designated for the oil drilling and gas drilling industries.  Thread geometries are complex and tightly toleranced. Threading insert wear is the primary reason for threads going out of tolerance. The geometric errors of each machined pipe thread are measured and tracked.  If the errors reach a threshold, the tool offsets are changed in order to accommodate loss of tool geometry.  If the tool wear is too great, the insert is flipped or replaced. Regardless, the machining process must be stopped for any adjustments or insert replacement to occur.  This stoppage negatively affects threading process lead time, throughput and cost. \nCurrently there is significant interest from the academic community, pipe manufacturers, cutting fluid suppliers and cutting insert suppliers in developing new technologies and processing methods that will reduce the rate of threading insert wear for pipe threading processes.\nPROBLEM TO BE SOLVED:  \nIn general, technology-process development projects require an assessment procedure in which alternatives are tested in a controlled, designed experiment and important dependent process variables are measured.  These experiments are replicated in order to provide statistical samples and allow the use of statistical analysis tools to filter out the effects of random variation. The data is subsequently analyzed and alternatives are identified as leading to the greatest overall improvements in the process variables. \nA well designed experiment uses dependent process variables that are highly sensitive to changes in the process (e.g. differences in the alternatives) and/or that are subject to minimum random variation. In turn this implies that the measurement system should have sufficiently high accuracy and resolution.  In general, a well designed experiment leads to the identification of superior alternatives, having the least amount of time and cost. \nThe problem currently encountered by those seeking to improve gas pipe threading processes, is that there are currently no prescribed methods for how to carry out tool wear experiments for single point threading processes in general especially for ones to be used to machine complex threads such as those found on drilling pipe.  \n&#8195;\nRESEARCH GOAL AND OBJECTIVES\nThe goal of this research was to develop experimental procedures that would effectively identify changes in threading insert wear rate in response to changes in the threading process.  The objectives of this research were:\n\u2022\tDesign a set of simple experiments that can be carried out off-line of the production equipment ordinarily used to thread drilling pipe \n\u2022\tIdentify experimental design procedures necessary to take into account the systematic variation observed in threading pipe stock\n\u2022\tIdentify process variables that show the greatest sensitivity with regard to changes in threading process\n\u2022\tIdentify measurement systems that are effective at measuring the critical process variables\n RESEARCH METHODLOGY \nThe basis for this research was an experimental study used to characterize the impact of different cutting fluids on the wear rate of cutting inserts used to machine multi-vector threads into pipe made of API L80 and API P110 steel.  This study was a collaboration between TMK-IPSCO (pipe manufacturer), Quaker Chemical (cutting fluid supplier), and Penn State. Despite its limited scope, it is believed that the results of this investigation can be generalized to studying the effects of all process variables on threading insert wear.\nRESEARCH RESULTS\nThe threading cycle used in this investigation was a simplification of the threading process carried out by TMK-IPSCO. Specifically, a 3\u201d long, external ACME 8P thread was machined into the straight end of a 2-3/8\u201d OD pipe.  This eliminated the need to form the ends of the pipes prior to machining.  In turn, it significantly reduced the time and cost necessary to carry out the investigation.  It also eliminated the need for TMK-IPSCO to divulge proprietary information regarding their thread geometry and threading process.  \nThe threading inserts used in this investigation were supplied by High Tech Tool.  They are comprised of the same substrate and coating as the threading inserts supplied to TMK-IPSCO.  The cutting speeds and in-feeds were varied depending on pipe grade.  Each set was chosen from ranges published to be suitable for generating the ACME 8P threads into the respective pipe grades.  Specific values were selected to induce a measurable amount of tool wear within a reasonable rate of time.   \nDespite the simplifications discussed, the experimental design focused on assuring that the threading processes and thread geometry used in this investigation were close enough to those used by TMK-IPSCO to capture the critical interactions between the cutting fluid, threading insert and pipe material and therefore data and conclusions from this thesis are a good representation of the effects each cutting fluid would have if used in the TMK-IPSCO process.\nThree measurement processes were developed in order to estimate the effects of the different cutting fluids on the wear rate of the threading insert. Each process was used to monitor data collected from the change in different variables. The three methods are:\n1.\tPart dimension changes as a correlation to tool wear \u2013 a method that monitors the geometric changes in the final machined part. This method was not efficient in this experiment due to inconsistency in the shape of the raw pipe. This shape affected the finished part dimensions as well as the stresses induced on the threading insert.\n2.\tTool weight loss method \u2013 a method that monitors weight change in the threading insert. This method resulted in inconsistent results, due to the fact that the number of data points collected using this method is smaller than in other methods. This brings forth a less accurate statistical analysis. Also, there are several different phenomena which need to be addressed in order to ensure this method is accurate. An example of this is built up edge which would directly affect the weight of the threading insert and skew the results.\n3.\tImage processing tool wear measurement system \u2013 this method monitors the changes taking place with the threading insert itself. Eleven wear variables were developed and monitored using this measurement method. The results found using this method showed statistical differences between the different cutting fluids. Some of the developed variables proved to be more valuable in the analysis than others due to the fact that the results shown were different using the image processing equipment available for analysis. The variables which have not resulted in good results are Rake Face \u2013 Tool Wear \u2013 Crater Area and Rake Face Leading Edge \u2013 Tool Wear \u2013 Wear Width. Overall, it is recommended to monitor all the variables in conjunction in order to get an overall final picture which is clearer due to the fact that different sides and aspects of the insert are being monitored.\nA major factor has affected the entire experiment development process. Egg shaped pipe directly affects the wear rate of the threading inserts and the overall efficiency of the process. The unique shape induces higher stresses than designed and therefore cause the threads to be out of specifications and the inserts to wear faster than designed.\nThe discovery of the inconsistency in the pipe shape directly affected the data collected in the first developed measurement method. Monitoring changes of the machined part dimensions is affected by the lack of consistent shape of the raw material. \nIn order to overcome the effects of the raw material shape, a randomization system was developed which takes the shape of a specific pipe out of the overall data. Randomizing consisted of using each raw pipe with all different cutting fluids. This step ensures that any original shape the raw pipe has, affects the results of all cutting fluids and all measurements and therefore the egg shape does not affect the conclusions of the thesis.\nBased on the experiments conducted and data collected, it is concluded that the Image Processing Tool Wear Measurement System is the most efficient and accurate method of identifying the wear rate induced on threading inserts.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5631], "author_name_tesi": "Shtub, Shai ", "last_name_ssi": "Shtub", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shai", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Demeter", "Edward Demeter", "Dr Christopher Saldana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Demeter, Thesis Advisor", "Edward Demeter, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Christopher Saldana, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cutting fluids", "measurement methods", "ACME threads"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Impacts of urbanization and climate change on the hydrological cycle: A case study in modern and ancient land use change", "id": "14146lzs157", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14146", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The past one hundred years have seen a tremendous migration to towns and cities worldwide. This population movement exerts serious impacts on surface and ground- water supplies, soil health, and the sustainability of ecosystems. At the same time, climate change has become a decisive influence on water systems as land conversion continues. Historically, urbanization and climate change were two important determinants in the sustainability of water, food and energy supplies, as well as the increasing risk of environmental hazards.\nAt the watershed scale the evolving land use change in urban areas does not only change the flood risk because of increasing impervious areas or by directly reducing the consumption of water by trees and plants, but also fundamentally alters the local water balance and the partitioning of water within the land-atmosphere- ecological system. Both land use change and climate change may influence the urban watershed in ways that reinforce or compensate sustainable management.\nIn this study we applied two spatially explicit models to the problem. One is the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM), a hydrologic model that partitions the water balance in space and time over the urban catchment. The other is the Cellular Automata Land Use Change Model (CALUC), a land use change model, which simulates the evolution of land use classes based on physical measures associated with population change and land use demand factors.\nWe selected two study sites, one modern and one ancient, to highlight the capability of coupling catchment hydrology with land use change models. The goal is to assess the role of hydrologic change in urbanizing watersheds and to evaluate the contemporaneous impacts of climate change. The modern sites are the Conestoga watershed and the Lancaster PA urban center; the historical site is the ancient Maya city of Tikal in Peten region of Guatemala. In each setting, the essential data was developed and the models were used to evaluate how urbanization and land use change gradually altered the entire water balance often in unexpected ways.\nChapter 1 introduces the overall problem and carries out a comprehensive literature review for each of the following chapters. Chapter 2 discusses the relevant models used in the study, and the role of model parameterization, particularly the important role that macropores have on maintaining a healthy soil and supporting soil moisture and recharge to groundwater. Chapter 2 also describes the Cellular Automata Land Use Change model, which is adopted here to simulate land use conditions. Chapter 3 then evaluates the past, present and future land use conditions in the Conestoga watershed and develops quantitative metrics of evaluation. Chapter 4 extends the Conestoga case study to evaluate hydrologic performance when dynamic land use and future climate change scenarios from IPCC are the drivers. An evaluation of the relative importance of land use and climate to hydrologic change is presented. Chapter 5 implements the models in a retrospective scenario of the water history of the ancient Maya city of Tikal and discusses the problem of urbanization-deforestation-agriculture land conversion, and the likely sensitivity of their water supply to extreme climate events. Chapter 6 summarizes the two case studies and makes inferences on the resilience and elasticity of the two study sites to climate and land use change.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16190], "author_name_tesi": "Shu, Lele ", "last_name_ssi": "Shu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lele", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Duffy", "Christopher Duffy", "Xiaofeng Liu", "Alfonso Mejia", "Kirk French"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Duffy, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Duffy, Committee Chair", "Xiaofeng Liu, Committee Member", "Alfonso Mejia, Committee Member", "Kirk French, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydrology", "land use change", "urbanization", "climate chnge", "hydrologic modeling", "PIHM", "water availability", "Maya", "Tikal", "Conestoga", "Lancaster"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Cytoplastic NAD+ biosynthesis affects gonad development in Caenorhabditis elegans\n", "id": "28837", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12441", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) has gained renewed attention from scientists. This is because NAD+ serves not only as a cofactor but also as a substrate for numerous enzymes that are widely dispersed in cellular signaling reactions. These signaling pathways affect many aspects of organisms, like aging, development, circadian rhythm and axon pathology. However, the mechanism that NAD+ homeostasis influences development is still elusive.\n    In my project, I used the C. elegans pnc-1(pk9506) mutant as a model to understand why blocked NAD+ salvage biosynthesis delays gonad development. Our lab has found that blocking salvage NAD+ biosynthesis affects gonad developmental progression in worms. My project was to investigate the mechanism linking NAD+ production to gonad development in C. elegans. Because the block in salvage synthesis had already been linked to a deficit in glycolysis, I hypothesized that disrupted glycolysis caused by NAD+ deficiency leads to the gonad developmental defects. I supplied the pnc-1(pk9605) mutants with late glycolytic intermediates 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and found that these intermediates increased the percentage of normal gonad development in the pnc-1 population, which supported the hypothesis that disrupted glycolysis causes the gonad developmental defects. \n     Cells have relatively separated NAD+ pools between mitochondria, nucleus and cytoplasm, and individual NMNAT genes independently regulate these NAD+ pools to meet specific requirements of NAD+ in cells. I would like to use NMNAT function to investigate the compartment-specific requirements for NAD+ biosynthesis in C. elegans gonad development. However, it is unclear which of the two C. elegans NMNAT genes, nmat-1 and nmat-2, corresponds to which compartment-specific gene. To determine the subcellular localization of the two C. elegans NMATs. I fused nmat-1 and nmat-2 to CFP under the myo-3 promoter and examined their subcellular localization in muscle cells. The subcellular localization experiment results showed that NMAT1 is a mitochondrial protein and NMAT2 is a Golgi/cytoplasmic protein. To further explore the function of NMNAT, I applied the new genomic engineering CRISPR/Cas9 system to create an allele of nmat-1. Now, I am screening for homozygous nmat-1 mutants.\n    This work will provide us the insights on metabolic products function in animal\u2019s development and also will shed light on an intimate connection between metabolism and development in human health and disease.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11798], "author_name_tesi": "Shu, Muya ", "last_name_ssi": "Shu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Muya", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["C. elegans", "NAD+", "NMATs", "development", "Glycolysis."]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Delta-v Feasibility of Piggyback Lunar Transfers", "id": "27505", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11226", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents the results of analysis to determine the feasibility of lunar missions as secondary, piggyback payloads.

This thesis focuses specifically on the assessment of pesticide exposure to pollinators, differences in pollinator community composition associated with orchards and floral enhancement plantings, and the interaction between pest management practices and pollinator health. Pesticide residue levels in apple pollen and nectar were measured to determine the oral exposure of bees to pesticides, and dose mortality curves depicting the oral toxicity of commonly used pesticides to honey bees were created. Furthermore, the bee communities in commercial apple orchards were compared to the bee communities in government-funded pollinator habitats. \nPesticide residue levels in the pollen and nectar were significantly lower than the application rate, and laboratory assays indicate that these levels did not pose a threat to honey bees. Additionally, the bee communities in the orchards were different from the bee communities in the managed pollinator habitat, but the pollinator habitats did not support more tree fruit pollinating or rare bee species than the orchards did. The results from these experiments should be influential in instructing new policy regarding pollinator health, specifically pesticide toxicity testing on pollinators, and the use of managed bee habitats as a conservation tool.

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate mechanisms utilized by tumor cells to promote growth in and destruction of the secondary sites.  Advances in microarray technology allow for rapid screening and identification of potential genetic targets involved in host response to cancers, however there is a need for high-throughput screening of the identified targets to determine their efficacy.  In vitro systems that more accurately represent in vivo microenvironments would be a useful tool to screen potential genetic targets as treatment of diseases.  Here we examined the interaction of breast cancer cells with osteoblasts in a specialized culture device (bioreactor).  Breast cancer preferentially metastasizes to the bone resulting in the formation of osteolytic lesions.  While administration of osteoclast-inhibiting drugs, such as bisphosphonates, slow further lesion formation, existing lesions do not heal. Therefore, osteoblasts appear functionally disabled in the presence of metastatic breast cancer cells.  Previous studies in this laboratory have shown that breast cancer cells alter osteoblast adhesion and morphology, increase osteoblast apoptosis, and decrease the expression of osteoblast differentiation genes when exposed to metastatic breast cancer cell conditioned medium for extended periods (5 \u2013 35 days).  In order to examine the interaction of metastatic breast cancer cells with osteoblasts apart from osteoclasts, a specialized bioreactor culture system was utilized.  In this culture device, osteoblasts grew and differentiated into a multiple-cell-layer, three-dimensional mineralizing tissue. Co-culture of metastatic breast cancer cells with osteoblasts in a bioreactor were compared to co-culture in conventional cell culture.   The breast cancer cells not only attached and grew on the osteoblast tissue in the bioreactor culture system, but also formed distinct colonies that aligned in the same axis as the osteoblasts, similar to \u201cIndian filing\u201d seen in authentic pathological tissue. Moreover, in this culture system, the breast cancer cells penetrated the osteoblast tissue, a phenomenon not apparent with conventional cell culture methods.  Metastatic breast cancer cells also interfered with the differentiation of osteoblasts as evidenced by a decrease in production of proteins, such as osteocalcin and collagen. In addition, co-culture of the metastatic breast cancer cells with osteoblasts resulted in increased production of the inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, a known activator of osteoclasts. The bioreactor culture system is advantageous over conventional cell culture systems in emulating the bone microenvironment and for studying the interaction of metastatic breast cancer cells with osteoblasts.\nAdditionally, in this report, transcription factor targets within MC3T3-E1 cells treated with MDA-MB-231 human metastatic breast cancer cell conditioned medium were identified.  Expression of a particular transcription factor, Early Growth Response \u2013 1 (EGR-1), was silenced in MC3T3-E1 cells using shRNA targeting murine EGR-1.  Osteoblast differentiation and cytokine production was measured in the presence or absence of MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cell conditioned medium.  Osteoblasts having decreased expression of EGR-1 differentiated in culture and when exposed to metastatic breast cancer cell conditioned medium showed reduced cytokine production.   However, the reduction in osteoblast-derived cytokines did not interfere with the ability of the breast cancer cells to attach or colonize the osteoblast layer.  When osteoblasts having decreased EGR-1 expression were cultured in metastatic breast cancer cell conditioned medium for extended periods (19 \u2013 37 days), differentiation was still inhibited as indicated by decreased alkaline phosphatase staining and RNA expression of type I collagen and osteocalcin.  Therefore, these data indicate that decreased EGR-1 expression in MC3T3-E1 cells leads to decreased inflammatory cytokine production by these cells when treated with metastatic breast cancer cell conditioned medium.  However, decreased EGR-1 expression in osteoblasts does not reverse the block in osteoblast differentiation caused by the metastatic breast cancer cell conditioned medium.  Therefore, these data imply that EGR-1 expression in osteoblasts is directly related to inflammatory cytokine production by, and not differentiation of, osteoblasts stimulated with metastatic breast cancer cell conditioned medium. \nCombined together, these studies provide useful information for future studies focusing on identification and screening of potential therapeutic targets to treat breast cancer cell metastasis to the bone.  The first study validates the use of a bioreactor culture system as an in vitro culture device to better examine the interaction of breast cancer cells with osteoblasts, while the second study identifies a potential therapeutic target in osteoblasts for inflammatory cytokine production induced by breast cancer metastasis.   \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3694], "author_name_tesi": "Shuman, Laurie  Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Shuman", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Laurie ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrea Marie Mastro", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Adam Bleier Glick", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby", "Robert Paulson", "Danny Welch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrea Marie Mastro, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Chair", "Adam Bleier Glick, Committee Member", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Danny Welch, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transcription factor", "cytokine", "metastasis", "osteoblast", "Breast cancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "TEACHER RESPONSES TO CHILDREN\u2019S VERBAL BULLYING AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION\n\n", "id": "7057", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3316", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Few studies have examined how teachers respond to bullying in children, yet knowledge of teacher reactions to bullying are important for the development of effective intervention programs.

Teachers were asked to indicate their likelihood of intervening in the situations and rate how likely they would be to use a list of strategies to respond to the scenarios. Teachers were likely to intervene in the scenarios, but likelihood of intervention ratings were higher for verbal bullying and bullying that was witnessed. Teacher likelihood of intervention was not significantly different based on the sex of the children involved.

Teachers were more likely to intervene in verbal bullying and bullying that was witnessed when years of experience were controlled. Teachers did not demonstrate strong likelihood of using most response strategies, although the strategies they did use differed by witness condition and type of bullying. The results of this study are important because, if teachers respond to actual bullying situations in a similar manner as the teachers in this study reported they would, they are likely to reinforce bullies for their behavior and contribute to further bullying in their schools.

To passivate biosensing substrates, self-assembled monolayers composed of oligo(ethylene glycol)alkanethiols (OEGs) were formed on gold substrates. To enable functionalization of monolayers with a dilute, non-phase-separated distribution of small-molecule probes, insertion-directed self assembly was used to intercalate OEGs with different terminal functional groups into existing monolayer matrices. Carbodiimide coupling chemistry was used to derivatize the dilute functional groups with small-molecule probes. Initially, a prototypical small-molecule neurotransmitter, serotonin, was used to produce small-molecule-functionalized substrates. \nExploiting the knowledge gained from functionalizing surfaces with serotonin, a modified chemistry was used to attach the serotonin biological precursor, 5 hydroxytryptophan (5 HTP), to similarly prepared surfaces via its ectopic carboxyl group. 5 HTP surfaces were shown to be capable of selectively binding membrane-associated serotonin receptor proteins. In contrast, serotonin-functionalized surfaces fail to bind these receptors. Because native serotonin receptors bind serotonin in solution, these results suggest that all functional groups of serotonin are necessary for receptor recognition. \nTo enhance the breadth of applications of such surfaces, the creation of chemically patterned surfaces was investigated. Both photolithographically assisted chemical patterning and microcontact insertion printing were used to create spatially controlled regions of inserted tether molecules. New probes, dopamine and biotin, were successfully used on these surfaces. Dopamine was functionalized in situ, while prefunctionalized biotinylated OEGs were used to create biotin-functionalized surfaces. Both types of surfaces were capable of capturing binding partners with high affinity for the small-molecule probes on the surfaces in single- and mixed-protein solutions.\nIn addition to the biocapture properties of OEG monolayers, how insertion-directed self-assembly and chemical functionalization of OEGs compared to n alkanethiols were investigated. Differences in protonation and monomer/dimer ratios of the carboxy group of carboxy-terminated OEG vs n alkanethiol molecules on surfaces were found. Additionally, the fraction of insertion of OEGs into n-alkanethiolate monolayers under identical conditions was observed to vary based on the terminal functional groups of the OEG molecules. It was also found that single-component monolayers of OEGs were more amenable to chemical reaction than n alkanethiolate monolayers. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4175], "author_name_tesi": "Shuster, Mitchell ", "last_name_ssi": "Shuster", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mitchell", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss", "Paul S Weiss", "Anne M Andrews", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Reka Z Albert", "Jun Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul S Weiss, Committee Chair", "Anne M Andrews, Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Chair", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member", "Jun Huang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["quartz crystal microgravimetry", "infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy", "oligo(ethylene glycol)", "small molecule functionalization", "microcontact insertion printing", "alkanethiol", "self-assembled monolayer"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO INCORPORATE HETEROGENEITY IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENT SEVERITY", "id": "7354", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4438", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\nMethodological Approaches to Incorporate Heterogeneity in Traffic Accident Severity Models\n\nMing-Bang Shyu\n\nChair of the Supervisory Committee: Associate Professor Venkataraman N. Shankar\n\nScope of the Problem\nFatal accidents exact a significant toll in terms of economic cost, in excess of 150 billion dollars yearly.  Over 40,000 drivers, passengers, pedestrians and bicyclists are killed each year on United States highways.  Traffic accidents cause what is termed in the medical literature as unintentional harm and injury.  Only heart attacks, cancer, stroke and respiratory related illnesses cause more deaths in the United States than unintentional injuries.  While traffic accident deaths may comprise less than 2 percent of all registered deaths annually, their impact on future income earners can be telling.  As an example, over 40 percent of childhood deaths are due to unintentional injuries, with over 30 percent contributed by motor vehicle accidents.  Among teenagers, the three leading causes of death are unintentional injuries, homicide and suicide.  Nearly 52 percent of the 15-24 age group dies from unintentional injuries, with a significant number perishing in motor vehicle accidents.  From an infrastructure standpoint, fatalities contribute to increase in lifecycle costs including transportation, social and emergency infrastructure.  Given this backdrop, my goal in this dissertation is to parse out the contribution of infrastructure to motor vehicle related deaths.  A 1993 study by the Carter Center estimated approximately 25,000 deaths annually to be behaviorally related.  In a traffic accident context, common cited reasons that constitute behavior include speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol, driving without seat belt fastened, driving under fatigue, aggressive driving such as tailgating, and failure to yield.  What are of interest in this dissertation are the impact of infrastructure in these deaths, as well as infrastructure impact in single and multi-vehicle collisions leading to death.  For example, fixed object related collisions contribute to nearly 27 percent of all motor vehicle deaths, while multi-vehicle collisions contribute to almost 45 percent of motor vehicle deaths.    \n\nI formulated the hypothesis that a variety of factors relating to human, roadway and vehicle effects are associated with motor vehicle accident injuries.  I attempted to identify those that are strongly associated with injury severities.  A focused study on single- and two-vehicle driver occupant only accidents using empirical data from the Washington State Patrol\u00a1\u00a6s accident database was conducted.  I compiled over a 79-month period in Washington State from 1990 to 1996, detailed accident reports on over 127,000 cases.\n\nObjectives\nA multi-variate analytical framework that is robust and helps identify the marginal impact of important policy variables related to seat belt use, drunk driving enforcement and driving age related issues, while controlling for vehicle and roadway influences, was developed.  It is also our objective to develop a framework with commonly available data without placing undue demands on data collection.  Such a method will enhance the portability of our approach to be applicable to a variety of locales.  \n\nMethod\nStatistical methods relating to the analysis of ordinal and discrete outcomes were employed.  The developed models also incorporated heterogeneity.  Heterogeneity refers to effects that are not measured for various reasons.  In our context, not measured implies not measurable, could be measured but was not measured for economic reasons, as well as unknown and hence not measurable.  The impact of heterogeneity and correlation that exists in severity contexts is at the very least, loss in statistical efficiency of parameters in the model.  As a result, strong associations can be imprecisely identified.   \n\nUsing a variety of techniques within this broad category of analysis, common denominator variables that were found to be strongly associated with driver only occupant severities were identified.  These methods have been embraced by WSDOT as potential frameworks for implementing their safety project prioritization plan.  Three model types known as extensions of the generalized extreme value model were examined.  The multinomial logit is the simplest and most popular form.  However, its structure impedes incorporation of heterogeneity.  By definition, the multinomial logit assumes all outcomes are identically and independently influenced by random effects that are unobserved.  As alternatives, in order to address the heterogeneity problem, the nested logit, the heteroskedastic logit and the covariance heterogeneity logit structures were examined.  These structures are uniquely flexible in accommodating heterogeneity.  The idea behind examining these structures is the need for robustly identifying a set of strong associations in terms of infrastructure variables.\n\nResults\nFactors relating to driver sobriety, seat belt use, human error in driving, vehicle type, type of collision and type of object struck appeared to strongly associate with injury.  The findings reinforce in a single multi-variate framework insights from case-controlled studies on seat belt use and driver sobriety.  Over 300,000 individual accidents were initially examined, and culled to include 127,000 accidents for final model development.  Separate models of injury outcomes were developed for single-vehicle and two-vehicle accidents.  Several hundred model specifications were tested prior to the finalization of model structures.  Due to the variety of structures that are possible within the nested logit class of models, the modeling requirement extended to over a thousand specifications in order to identify the preferred structure.  The nested logit analysis showed that after substantial testing heterogeneity and correlation effects are not clearly accommodated using a nested logit structure, thereby creating an argument for more sophisticated and flexible structures such the heteroskedastic and covariance heterogeneity models.  \n\nDue to data constraints, multi-vehicle accidents involving three or more vehicles were not addressed.  Furthermore, in two-vehicle accidents, vehicle mass difference effects are distinct, if they in fact exist as strong associations.\n \n\nConclusion\nThe benefits of this research are numerous \u00a1V it presents a multi-variate analytical framework that is robust by incorporating the heterogeneity issue in modeling and helps identify the marginal impact of important policy variables related to seat belt use, drunk driving enforcement and driving age related issues, while addressing critical infrastructure issues as well.  For example, addressing the sensitivity of injury probabilities to the removal of fixed objects is a critical infrastructure issue.  A decision maker can use the results of this model to estimate benefits in terms of societal cost reductions and compute the benefit cost of fixed object removals or collision protection.  In addition, this research also highlights the importance of data types that need to be collected for robust policy development on traffic accident injury prevention.  The nested logit model was suggested as the common denominator model to incorporate unobserved heterogeneity between PDO and PINJ.  This important modeling capability has the potential to significantly enhance statewide consistency in infrastructure related decision making.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4408], "author_name_tesi": "Shyu, Ming-Bang ", "last_name_ssi": "Shyu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ming-Bang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar", "Martin T Pietrucha", "Thorsten Wagener", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar, Committee Chair", "Martin T Pietrucha, Committee Member", "Thorsten Wagener, Committee Member", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Covariance Heterogeneity Model", "Nested Logit Model", "Accident Severity Model", "Heterogeneity", "Heteroskedastic Extreme-Value Model"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Statistics-based Framework for Bus Travel Time Prediction", "id": "15369", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7822", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this paper, we develop a statistics-based bus travel time prediction framework, called Historical Trajectory\nbased Travel/Arrival Time Prediction (HTTP) for real-time prediction of travel time at future\nsegments (and thus the arrival time at stops) of an on-going bus journey.

A major source of uncertainty is due to the weather or meteorological forcing. In turn, the uncertainties from the meteorological forcing are propagated into the streamflow forecasts when using the meteorological forecasts (i.e., the outputs from a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model) as forcing to hydrological models. Additionally, the hydrological models themselves are another important source of uncertainty, where uncertainty arises from model structure, parameters, initial and boundary conditions. To advance the science of hydrological modeling and forecasting, these uncertainties need to be quantified and modeled, using novel statistical techniques and robust verification strategies, with the goal of improving the skill and reliability of streamflow forecasts. This, ultimately, may allow generating in advance (i.e., with longer lead times) more informative forecasts, which could eventually translate into better emergency preparedness and response.\n\tThe main research goal of this dissertation is to develop, implement and verify a new regional hydrological ensemble prediction system (RHEPS), comprised by a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, different hydrological models and different statistical bias-correction techniques. To implement and verify the new RHEPS, the U.S. middle Atlantic region (MAR) is selected as the study area. This is a region of high socio-economic value with populated cities and, at the same time, vulnerable to floods and other natural disasters. To meet my research goal, the following objectives are carried out: Objective 1 (O1) - To choose a relevant NWP model or system by evaluating and verifying the outputs from different meteorological forecasting systems (i.e., the outputs or forecasts from their underlying NWP models); Objective 2 (O2) - To verify streamflow forecasts generated by forcing a distributed hydrological model with meteorological ensembles, and to develop and evaluate a statistical postprocessor to quantify the uncertainty and adjust biases in the streamflow forecasts; Objective 3 (O3) - To develop, implement and rigorously verify a multimodel approach for short- to medium-range streamflow forecasting. The overarching hypothesis of this dissertation is that the combination and configuration of the different system components in the streamflow forecasting system can have a significant influence on forecast uncertainty and that hydrological multimodeling is able to significantly enhance the quality of streamflow forecasts. The RHEPS is used to test this hypothesis.\n\tTo meet O1, precipitation ensemble forecasts from two different NWP models are verified. The two NWP models are the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) 11-member Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast version 2 (GEFSRv2) and the 21-member Short Range Ensemble Forecast (SREF) system. The verification results for O1 reveal the quality of the meteorological forcing and serve to inform the decision of selecting a NWP model for O2. As part of O2, the meteorological outputs from the GEFSRv2 are used to force the NOAA\u2019s Hydrology Laboratory-Research Distributed Hydrological Model (HL-RDHM) and generate short- to medium-range (1-7 days) ensemble streamflow forecasts for different basins in the MAR. The streamflow forecasts are postprocessed (bias-corrected) using a time series model. The verification results from O2 show that the ensemble streamflow forecasts remain skillful for the entire forecast cycle of 7 days. Additionally, postprocessing increases forecast skills across lead times and spatial scales, particularly for the high flow conditions. Lastly, with O3, a multimodel hydrological framework is tested for medium-range ensemble streamflow forecasts. The results show that the multimodel consistently improves short- to medium-range streamflow forecasts across different basin sizes compared to the single model forecasts. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14772], "author_name_tesi": "Siddique, Ridwan ", "last_name_ssi": "Siddique", "first_name_ssi": "Ridwan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alfonso Mejia", "Alfonso Mejia", "Christopher Duffy", "Xiaofeng Liu", "Fuqing Zhang", "Seann Reed"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alfonso Mejia, Dissertation Advisor", "Alfonso Mejia, Committee Chair", "Christopher Duffy, Committee Member", "Xiaofeng Liu, Committee Member", "Fuqing Zhang, Outside Member", "Seann Reed, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydrological modeling", "Hydrological forecasting", "Numerical weather prediction"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "HOW CAN A LEADER GUIDE OUR SEARCH FOR THE HOLY GRAIL?  \nTHE LONGITUDINAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SATISFACTION AND PERFORMANCE AND THE IMPACT OF LEADER BEHAVIORS \n", "id": "7186", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3712", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Coined the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of organizational behavior (Landy, 1989), researchers and laypeople alike have been fascinated with the link between employee satisfaction and performance.  While meta-analyses have in fact demonstrated a link between the two (e.g. Judge et al., 2001), the directionality of this relationship and the contextual factors that influence the relationship are still in question.  Therefore, the current paper revisits and extends this question by (1) investigating the causal direction between satisfaction and performance at the store level of analysis across multiple stores of a single organization, (2) looking at two specific performance measures that are practically important (store profitability and customer-related performance), and (3) examining the contextual factor of leadership to understand its impact on the satisfaction-performance relationship.  Data was collected from 328 stores within a large retail organization over the course of two years (2003 and 2004).  Results suggested a significant causal relationship between stores\u2019 employee satisfaction at time 1 and stores\u2019 customer-related performance dimensions at time 2.  However, no significant relationships were found between stores\u2019 financial performance at time 1 and stores\u2019 employee satisfaction at time 2.

Wild bees are unmanaged and live within the agroecosystem, thus the surrounding landscape, which provides floral and nesting resources, can have an effect on the wild bee abundance and community dynamics. Many previous studies have examined wild bee communities in agricultural-intensive landscapes, but few studies have focused on small farms within diverse landscapes. This dissertation examines the bee community on small, diversified farms within heterogeneous landscapes, and focuses on pollinators of a target crop, Cucurbits. \nThe first study was a baseline survey of the bee community on small, diversified farms in Pennsylvania. I found that although a diverse wild bee community was present at these farms, only a small subset of bees visited the target crops. The subset of Cucurbit pollinators is further divided among the crop genera, Cucumis and Cucurbita. Landscape did not have a large effect on the visitation rate of Cucurbit pollinators to the crop; visitation rate was affected more by farm-level effects. \nThe second study tested whether floral enhancements placed adjacent to the target crops improved pollination services and thus increased crop output. Floral provisioning is a management practice that is promoted in agricultural systems to support wild bee communities by providing additional floral resources to pollinators. I found that although a diverse community of bees visited the floral enhancement flowers, few bee species overlapped between communities visiting the floral enhancement plantings and the target crops. Plots treated with the floral enhancement flowers did not have significantly greater fruit weight, seed count or total fruit yield than the control plots. \nFor the third study I measured visitation duration of bees to different floral enhancement flowers and target crop flowers. I concluded that visitation duration varies by flower and by bee species. This third study supplements the first two studies by providing bee-behavior data that provides a \u201cbee-centric\u201d perspective that compliments the traditional \u201cplant-centric\u201d perspective that is commonly used for visitation observations. \nThe fourth study focused on a specific pollinator, Bombus impatiens. This native bee is a generalist, social pollinator that visits both Cucumis spp. and Cucubita spp, and likely provides pollination services to other crops within diversified vegetable farms. As social bees, the number of bumble bee present at a farm site does not reflect the number of colonies present at these sites. Here I determined that between 82 to 167 colonies were foraging in individual pumpkin fields. The number of colonies was related to proportion of land cover at different radii surrounding the farm site. Land cover at the shortest radius, which encompasses the farmscape, was significantly related to the number of colonies present at the farms, while the larger landscape had no significant effect. The conclusions from this study suggest that B. impatiens may have a short foraging range and high nest densities in the environment surrounding these small diversified farms. \nThe final chapter summarizes the results of these studies and provides recommendations for supporting and conserving wild bees. I also recommend directions for future research that build upon these studies and suggest future areas of exploration concerning wild bee research on diversified farms in Pennsylvania.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9121], "author_name_tesi": "Sidhu, Chanpreet Sheena", "last_name_ssi": "Sidhu", "middle_name_ssi": "Sheena", "first_name_ssi": "Chanpreet", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shelby Jay Fleischer", "Edwin George Rajotte", "David Biddinger", "David A Mortensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shelby Jay Fleischer, Dissertation Advisor", "Edwin George Rajotte, Committee Member", "David Biddinger, Committee Member", "David A Mortensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wild bees", "Cucurbit", "pollinators", "pollination services", "floral enhancement", "bumble bee"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Vacuum Frying to Eliminate the Need for Reconditioning After Long-term Cold Storage and to Retain Health-benefiting Compounds, Reduce Toxins, and Maintain Quality Attributes in White-, Red-, and Purple-fleshed Potato Chips", "id": "28864", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12353", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Potatoes are a leading vegetable crop in the world, providing an array of macro- and micronutrients as well as secondary metabolites. Due to their high consumption, potatoes are the greatest source of polyphenols in our diet. Color-fleshed potato consumption has increased by 17 % in the last decade likely due to their health-benefiting properties. Understanding the farm-to-fork operations of potatoes with goals of improvement are critical to maintain their nutritious value. After harvest, potatoes are stored in long-term cold storage (4 \u2013 10 \u00b0C) for 2 - 12 months. In order to combat the accumulation of reducing sugars brought upon by the degradation of starch during cold storage, potatoes are reconditioned at 12 \u2013 20 \u00b0C for two to three weeks. This process is costly due to the requirement of two different rooms and energy to temperature control both rooms at different temperatures. During reconditioning potatoes experience a break in dormancy leading to sprouting. While white-fleshed cultivars are bred to withstand this reconditioning process, color-fleshed cultivars have not and therefore undergo sprouting during reconditioning, resulting a costly produce-loss. \nAfter storage, potatoes are processed in to French fries and potato chips, which make up 51 % of the processed potato market. Potato chips account for 15 % of the total processed potato market (66 % of potatoes are processed). Deep-fat frying causes the formation of the neurotoxin acrylamide and a loss of health-benefiting anthocyanins.  To date, no systematic studies have considered processing mitigation strategies to eliminate reconditioning. We sought to utilize vacuum frying to eliminate the need for reconditioning while retaining health-benefiting compounds and reducing toxins. \nVacuum frying straight from cold storage yielded a less browned and more yellow, red, or blue potato chip with the same texture and moisture content as the typical reconditioned conventional countertop fried potato chips. Glycoalkaloids were reduced with both frying treatments, even straight from cold storage, but were further reduced with vacuum frying. The glycoalkaloids levels are similar to that of reconditioned conventional countertop fried chips. These results suggest even with prolonged time of frying at reduced temperatures, glycoalkaloids are reduced and have potential for health-benefiting properties. Though cold storage results in excess sugars, we report no differences in acrylamide content in cold stored vacuum fried chips and reconditioned conventional countertop fried chips. However, due to the limit of detection of HPLC, we suggest further confirmation of this data with a more sensitive technique, GC-MS.\nThe reconditioning process increases the risk of sprouting in color-fleshed cultivars which have not yet been bred to withstand this process. A leading factor to the use of color-fleshed potatoes is their health-benefiting anthocyanins. Anthocyanins were better retained in red- and purple-fleshed potato chips which underwent vacuum frying compared to conventional countertop frying, regardless of storage treatment. However, health-benefiting trigonelline was degraded, similar to the findings of the other compound in their family, glycoalkaloids. Together, these findings suggest vacuum frying can be utilized on potatoes straight from cold storage to create comparable quality chips with an improved bioactive profile compared to conventional countertop frying after reconditioning. \nThis research provides evidence vacuum frying can be used straight from cold storage to eliminate reconditioning, thus reducing costs associated with energy, space, and produce loss. Furthermore, vacuum frying could be used to introduce color-fleshed potato chips straight from cold storage both reducing produce loss due to sprouting and retaining health-benefiting compounds. Overall, our research enables improvements to the farm-to-fork process by eliminating reconditioning and with the potential for improved health-benefits in potato chips.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11727], "author_name_tesi": "Sido, Abigail Claire", "last_name_ssi": "Sido", "middle_name_ssi": "Claire", "first_name_ssi": "Abigail", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jairam Kp Vanamala", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jairam Kp Vanamala, Thesis Advisor", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["potatoes", "phytochemicals", "vacuum frying", "color-fleshed", "chips", "anthocyanins", "acrylamide", "toxins", "glycoalkaloids", "trigonelline"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Statistical Aspects Of Computerized Adaptive Testing", "id": "22715", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10030", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    In the past several decades, Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) has received much attention in educational and psychological research due to the efficiency in achieving the goal of assessment, whether it is to estimate the latent trait of test takers with high precision or to accurately classify them into one of several latent classes. In the latter case, the adaptive nature of CAT is used in educational testing to make inferences about the location of examinees' latent ability relative to one or more pre-specified cut-off points along the ability continuum. When there is only one cut-off point and two proficiency groups, this type of CAT is commonly referred to as Adaptive Mastery Testing (AMT).\n\n    A well-known approach in AMT is to combine the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) stopping rule with item selection to maximize Fisher information at the mastery threshold. In the first part of this dissertation, a new approach is proposed in which a time limit is defined for the test and examinees' response times are considered in both item selection and test termination. Item selection is performed by maximizing Fisher information per time unit, rather than Fisher information itself. The test is terminated once the SPRT makes a classification decision, the time limit is exceeded, or there is no remaining item that has a high enough probability of being answered before the time limit. In a simulation study, the new procedure showed a substantial reduction in average testing time while slightly improving classification accuracy compared to the original method. In addition, the new procedure reduced the percentage of examinees who exceeded the time limit.\n\n    Another well-known stopping rule in AMT is to terminate the assessment once the examinee's two-sided ability confidence interval lies entirely above or below the cut score. The second part of this dissertation proposes new procedures that seek to improve such a variable-length stopping rule by coupling it with curtailment and stochastic curtailment. Under the new procedures, test termination can occur earlier if the probability is high enough that the current classification decision remains the same should the test continue. Computation of this probability utilizes normality of an asymptotically equivalent version of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of ability. In two simulation studies, the new procedures showed a substantial reduction in average test length (ATL) while maintaining similar classification accuracy to the original stopping rule based on the ability confidence interval.\n\n    In the last part of this dissertation, generalization to multidimensional CAT (MCAT) is examined. Research has shown that MCAT improves the precision of both subscores and overall scores compared to its unidimensional counterpart. Several studies have investigated the performance of MCAT in recovering examinees\u2019 multiple abilities depending on the item selection methods. None of these studies, however, considered an item pool containing a mixture of multiple-choice (MC) and constructed-response (CR) items. With many assessments currently containing such a mixture of item types that measure more than one trait, there is an obvious need to understand how different item selection methods choose different types of items depending on their dimensional loadings (simple-structure versus complex-structured) and location of maximum information. In a simulation study, performance of five MCAT item selection methods were compared using an item pool consisting of a mixture between MC and CR items for mixed-format assessments. Ability recovery as well as item preferences of each method (simple- versus complex-structured items and location of maximum information) were examined.

Derived from somatic cell lines, these cells surpass the moral and political constraints of embryonic stem cell research, but are still not well understood. Previous studies into the de-differentiation of these cells from somatic lines to a pre-embryonic state have revealed particular transcriptional and genetic keys to their stasis in a pluripotent state, but generating and properly identifying these cells has proven to be inefficient. In light of this obstacle, a reliable and efficient system for the selection of induced pluripotent stem cells is necessary to enhance and further the progression of study and application of these cells. The purpose of this study was to develop and analyze a NANOG promoter driven selective gene lentivirus that would increase the selectivity of cells manipulated into pluripotent states. The NANOG promoter was first analyzed for its capability of promoting expression of select genes, particularly EGFP. Following positive results of promotion through EGFP expression in HEK 293FT cells, the promoter and the selection gene of interest (neomycin resistance) were used in the formation of entry vector plasmids capable of recombining into lentiviral expression constructs.

The functional versatility that would, in theory, be required of such a molecule represents a significant challenge to it and to our understanding of the origins of life.  In comparison to the variety of chemical side chains available to proteins, RNA (which bears only four, chemically similar side chains) seems to be woefully inadequate, so much so that the discovery of catalytic RNAs in 1982 came as a surprise to many and created a whole new field of study.   Since then, a steady stream of RNA-related discoveries have had profound impact on the fields of chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology.  Every new discovery furthers our understanding of RNA as a primary biomolecule and expands our understanding of both modern and ancient biology.\n     One particularly powerful catalytic strategy utilized by protein enzymes is general acid-base catalysis.  Proteins can utilize amino acid side chains like histidine and lysine which have pKa values at or above physiological pH (~7), to attain efficient proton transfer or electrostatic catalysis, respectively.  Nucleic acid bases, on the other hand, have no ionizing groups with pKas in this range and, to make matters worse, routinely experience pKa shifts further from this ideal range upon standard helix formation because the standard protonation state is required for Watson-Crick base pairing.  On the other hand, helix formation of non-Watson Crick pairs that require non-standard protonation states causes a pKa shift towards neutrality (or beyond).  We hypothesized that coupling many interactions to a protonation event through cooperative structure formation could shift nucleobases pKa values even further.  \n     Towards this end, I designed model systems to study folding cooperativity in RNA and DNA hairpins as a function of helical context.  Significant cooperativity was observed at the terminus of a helix; in fact, it is demonstrated that a terminal base pair will not form in the absence of a penultimate base pair in both RNA and DNA hairpins.  I also note that the thermodynamic impact of mutations at the terminus are small, particularly when compared to the same mutations performed on bases in the middle of the helix.  It is at this point where RNA and DNA trends differ: DNA does not exhibit strong cooperativity in the middle of a helix, while RNA does.  This difference is attributed to differences in helical structure and flexibility.\n     Experiments were then performed to determine the molecular basis for an unexpectedly large structural disruption observed in the study mentioned above.  It was demonstrated that unsatisfied hydrogen bond acceptors can play a surprising and major role in determining the stability (and therefore specificity) of base pair formation in the RNA bases studied.  An example of the impact of these interactions is provided in tRNA folding specificity, wherein removing an unsatisfied hydrogen bond acceptor using a base found in the anticodon (2-thiocytosine) increases specificity for canonical Watson Crick base pairing. \n     Having obtained interesting structural information, we turned to pH studies, beginning with a study that details sources of error in experimental pH measurements.  This study was instigated by collaboration with Dr. Andrea Cerrone-Szakal on hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme kinetics in high salt, with an ultimate desire examine pKa shifting under in vivo-like conditions of unusual salt and crowding.  A substantial ion- specific effect on pH measurements was found, causing meter readings that are almost 1 unit too low, particularly at high ionic strengths.  It was determined that the ionic strength of a solution will affect not only the pKa of the solution species themselves, but also the ability of a pH electrode to produce an accurate reading.  A two-step calibration method is presented to correct for this error, and this method is applied to a study of the pKa of C in a single stranded RNA (UUCUU) representing the unfolded state.  \n     Lastly, experiments are presented that examine the folded-state pKa of a dsDNA model system.  Effects of context, temperature, and ionic strength on the pKa of a non-canonical A+\u0081\u0153C wobble pair are presented.  This pair requires a protonated A to form, and hence meets the aforementioned criteria for pKa shifting; furthermore, by applying knowledge gained in the cooperativity studies, the effect of cooperativity on pKa shift is studied as well.  Conditions under which very large pKa shifts can be observed are identified, and pKa values at and beyond neutrality for this pair are reported, an observation that supports the potential for both general acid-base and electrostatic catalysis in nucleic acids.  We present significant pKa shifts in internally located base pairs only, suggesting that the folding free energy, rather than folding cooperativity, is the most important predictor of pKa shifting.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4586], "author_name_tesi": "Siegfried, Nathan A.", "last_name_ssi": "Siegfried", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Nathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

I draw on data from three different national surveys: The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1997 cohort), and the National Survey of Families and Households. I show that (1) young adult offenders receive more financial support from their parents than do their non-offending peers and even their own non-offending siblings, and this is not due to their financial need; (2) young adult offenders' financial need appears to be highly subjective, because they have higher incomes and earnings than do their non-offending peers but still incur more debt and experience more economic hardship; and (3) parents more often have conflicted, socially distant, and instrumentally imbalanced relationships with offending young adult offspring than they do with non-offending offspring, but most offender-parent relationships are not particularly troubled. These findings suggest that parental support may be more unconditional than social control theorists might expect. They also suggest that offenders are fully committed neither to crime nor to conformity, but rather show versatility in the means that they are willing to use to pursue their material goals.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5581], "author_name_tesi": "Siennick, Sonja Elayne", "last_name_ssi": "Siennick", "middle_name_ssi": "Elayne", "first_name_ssi": "Sonja", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["D Wayne Osgood", "D Wayne Osgood", "Eric Silver", "Glenn A Firebaugh", "Marion Kathryn Hood"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["D Wayne Osgood, Dissertation Advisor", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Chair", "Eric Silver, Committee Member", "Glenn A Firebaugh, Committee Member", "Marion Kathryn Hood, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["family relations", "young adulthood", "personal financial behavior", "crime and deviance"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "CONSTITUTING THE IDEAL AMERICAN: JESSE OWENS AND THE RHETORIC OF ATHLETIC ACHIEVEMENT\n\n\n", "id": "8972", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "705", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis argues that Jesse Owens, Olympic track star and hero of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, has been used as a symbolic figure to rhetorically constitute American ideals through his sporting achievements, and that such a constitution is beneficial in helping various rhetors to accomplish other rhetorical tasks.

Owens and his athletic achievements function as a particularly useful symbol because they allow speakers to accomplish a variety of significant rhetorical tasks: to reinforce American nationalism, to help citizens cope with the disparity between promised American ideals and reality, to re-imagine historical attitudes toward race, and to bolster the myth of the American Dream.      \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [699], "author_name_tesi": "Sierlecki, Bonnie J", "last_name_ssi": "Sierlecki", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Bonnie", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeremy Engels", "Jeremy Engels"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeremy Engels, Thesis Advisor", "Jeremy Engels, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["presidential rhetoric", "Jesse Owens", "sport", "American Dream rhetoric", "American ideals", "nationalism", "autobiography", "Jesse Owens Museum"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Fit for Democracy: Sport and Presidential Rhetoric", "id": "24827", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8105", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines some of the ways in which presidential rhetoric about sport and athleticism has functioned historically to constitute both our ideals of citizenship and the presidency itself.

This is especially true in francophone African literature.  The experience of the female immigrant did not appear in African literature in French until very recently, even though women are at the center of current debates in France on the issue of immigration and there are more female immigrants than male, according to the French national statistics agency. Today, French critics of immigration from Africa claim that the women have too many children and their adolescents suffer from a high rate of delinquency.  Some authorities in France have demanded that the women undergo DNA testing in order to determine the parentage of these children who are growing up in large families. Although female writers from francophone Africa began to appear on the literary scene in the last two decades, they are outnumbered by men and few focus on the theme of the immigrant woman. The contrast between the very limited presence of female immigrant characters in contemporary literature by francophone women writers and the centrality of women in the debate over immigration in France today raises a series of questions. Why is there such silence on immigration by females in African literature of French expression?  In those works on the subject that have appeared in recent years, how is the experience of women immigrant characters different from that of men?  How does the experience of women from North Africa differ from that of women from sub-Saharan Africa? Have the handful of female writers who do focus on the female immigrant experience created a distinct branch of literature on the theme of immigration? If so, what are the devices, subthemes, and motifs that distinguish the portrayal of immigration by women writers? Why is this emerging branch of literature so marginal not simply in the larger contexts of African literature and African literature in French, but most importantly literature by francophone African women writers? Drawing on postcolonial literary theory, I analyze five novels by francophone female writers from both North and Sub-Saharan Africa: Fawzia Zouari\u2019s La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9pouse, Ferrudja Kessas\u2019s Beur\u2019s story, Calixthe Beyala\u2019s L\u2019homme qui m\u2019offrait le ciel, Nathalie Etoke\u2019s Un amour sans papiers, and Bessora\u2019s  53 cm. these works convey the stories of different African women expatriate in France, in particular those of Beur or Harki descent, as well as those who are migrants or descended from migrants. This study reveals that the authors rely on a variety of devices to convey the sense of \u00ab otherness \u00bb that immigrants experience in France. Through the choice of characters who destroy the negative stereotypes of immigrants propagated by anti-immigrant segments of French society, through diverse styles often heavily charged with irony, and through narration that links the form of the traditional French novel and certain genres of African oral traditions, the authors attempt to portray the in-between cultural position of African immigrants. The characters and situations these authors create also suggest strategies for the integration into French society of immigrants coming from diverse cultural backgrounds.  In so doing, the authors attack the tendency in France to maintain a hierarchy between \u201cfran\u00e7ais de souche\u201d and \u201cfran\u00e7ais d\u2019origine.\u201dFinally, in my analysis I show how and where this growing branch of literature of immigration fits into the larger picture of literary and cultural relations between France and francophone Africa as well as francophone literature in general.             \n\n\n                   R\u00e9sum\u00e9\nDepuis l\u2019\u00e9mergence de la litt\u00e9rature africaine en langues europ\u00e9ennes au vingti\u00e8me si\u00e8cle, le th\u00e8me de l\u2019immigration a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit par les hommes et exprim\u00e9 \u00e0 travers l\u2019exp\u00e9rience du protagoniste masculin. Ceci est particuli\u00e8rement vrai dans la litt\u00e9rature francophone. L\u2019exp\u00e9rience de la femme immigr\u00e9e n\u2019a pas paru dans la litt\u00e9rature africaine en fran\u00e7ais jusqu\u2019\u00e0 r\u00e9cemment, bien que la femme soit au centre du d\u00e9bat en France sur l\u2019immigration et bien que, selon les statistiques fran\u00e7aises, il y ait plus d\u2019immigr\u00e9s f\u00e9minines que masculines. Aujourd\u2019hui, les critiques fran\u00e7ais de l\u2019immigration africaines soutiennent que les femmes ont trop d\u2019enfants et ceux-ci constituent un taux \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la d\u00e9linquance juv\u00e9nile.

Les \u00e9crivaines f\u00e9minines de l\u2019Afrique francophone ont fait leur apparition sur la sc\u00e8ne litt\u00e9raire au cours des trois derni\u00e8res d\u00e9cennies, cependant leur nombre reste restreint et bien peu d\u2019entre elles s\u2019int\u00e9ressent au th\u00e8me de la femme immigr\u00e9e. Le contraste entre le nombre limit\u00e9 des personnages immigr\u00e9s f\u00e9minins dans la litt\u00e9rature contemporaine par les \u00e9crivaines francophones et la place centrale de la femme dans le d\u00e9bat sur l\u2019immigration en France suscite une s\u00e9rie de questions. Entre autre, pourquoi y a-t-il un tel silence sur l\u2019immigration f\u00e9minine dans la litt\u00e9rature africaine d\u2019expression fran\u00e7aise ? Dans les \u0153uvres parues r\u00e9cemment \u00e0 ce sujet, en quoi l\u2019exp\u00e9rience du personnage f\u00e9minin est-elle diff\u00e9rente de celle du personnage masculin ? En quoi l\u2019exp\u00e9rience des immigr\u00e9es de l\u2019Afrique sub-saharienne diff\u00e8re-t-elle de celle des maghr\u00e9bines ?

Si oui, quels outils et quelles strat\u00e9gies distinguent la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019immigration par les auteurs f\u00e9minins ? Pourquoi cette branche \u00e9mergente de la litt\u00e9rature est-elle si marginale non seulement dans la litt\u00e9rature africaine et celle en fran\u00e7ais en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, mais surtout dans la litt\u00e9rature f\u00e9minine francophone ? En partant de la th\u00e9orie postcoloniale, j\u2019analyse cinq romans de femmes \u00e9crivaines francophones d\u2019Afrique du nord et d\u2019Afrique sub-saharienne : La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9pouse de Fawzia Zouari, Beur\u2019s story de  Ferrudja Kessas\u2019s,  L\u2019homme qui m\u2019offrait le ciel de Calixthe Beyala, Un amour sans papiers de Nathalie Etok\u00e9 et 53 centim\u00e8tres de Bessora. Ces \u0153uvres racontent l\u2019histoire de diff\u00e9rentes femmes africaines descendantes de Beurs et de Harki, aussi bien que d\u2019Africaines d\u00e9plac\u00e9es en France ou filles de parents expatri\u00e9s.

Les personnages et les situations cr\u00e9\u00e9s par ces auteures sugg\u00e8rent aussi des strat\u00e9gies d\u2019int\u00e9gration des immigr\u00e9s d\u2019origines culturelles diverses dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise.

Current ionic EAPs have limited practical application due to their slow response time and their low blocked force; furthermore, their ion transport-based mechanism necessitates the presence of an electrolyte, which complicates issues of packaging and device lifetime. On the other hand, despite the advantages of electronic EAPs such as their efficient electromechanical coupling and relatively rapid response time, there are major obstacles blocking their transition to application as well; most notably, they require high actuation voltages (threshold voltage needed to generate electroactive strain) and they have low blocked stress (the stress at which the actuator stops moving). Hence, the main objective of this study was to develop a new kind of polymer nanocomposite for actuator applications that would exhibit simultaneous improvement in both electromechanical response and strain energy density. To fulfill this objective, existing PVDF-based electroactive polymers were modified using different types of carbon nanofillers. An effort was made to observe the impact of these nanofillers on the microstructure of the polymer that would then lead to a better understanding of the maximum possible improvement of the electromechanical response. \nAs a first step, we investigated the impact of the 2-dimensional GO and reduced GO on the electromechanical response of PVDF, a polar polymer. The 1 wt % reduced-GO-PVDF nanocomposites showed a tremendous improvement in dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity. The dielectric permittivity at 1 KHz increased almost eight fold, while the electrical conductivity showed an increase of four orders of magnitude in comparison to the corresponding values for the unmodified PVDF. The reduced GO-PVDF polymer films showed a bending actuation response with a DC electric field, thus demonstrating its potential as EAP. The mechanism responsible for this bending actuation response is determined to be electrostriction, because the strain (S11) exhibited a quadratic response with the applied electric field while Joule heating and Maxwell stress effects were shown to be negligible. The coefficient of electrostriction value (M1133) for the 1 wt % reduced GO-PVDF was found to be 1.7 x 10-16 (m2/V2), which is higher than that for most of the existing electrostrictive polymers like polyurethane and PVDF TrFE CTFE terpolymer, whose values lie in the range of 14 x 10-18 (m2/V2) to 8 x 10-18 (m2/V2). \nAlthough coefficient of electrostriction of reduced GO-PVDF is higher than most of the existing electroactive polymers, the relatively high electrical conductivity and low breakdown limits their use for practical applications. So next step was to exploit the advantages of a conductive carbon nanostructure while controlling its network to better impact its electrical properties which could also lead to higher breakdown strength. To achieve this, the impact of the hybridization between SWNT and GO on the microstructure and the electrical properties of PVDF was studied. Increasing the content of insulative GO helped to disrupt the percolated network of the SWNT, lowering the electrical conductivity and dielectric loss. The synergistic effect of the hybrid nanofillers on the microstructure of PVDF was then analyzed. The hybrid nanofillers had a favorable influence on crystallization, leading to a higher degree of crystallinity. Enhancement in the ferroelectric strain for the stretched nanocomposite was observed. Due to the hybridization of SWNT and GO and subsequent stretching, a high dielectric breakdown strength of 140 MV/m was found for a nanocomposite with a 0.25 wt % SWNT and 0.25 wt % GO compared to 0.6 MV/m for  0.25wt% SWNT-PVDF.\nBased on the promising impact of hybrid nanofillers on the ferroelectric polymer PVDF, a similar polymer with a relaxor ferroelectric character is considered owing to its higher inherent electroactive response and higher breakdown strength. Given that it is not broadly studied, there was a need to understand structure-property relationship of the PVDF TrFE CTFE terpolymer. Hence, the effect of processing conditions (such as annealing times and isothermal crystallization temperatures) on the microstructure and the subsequent electromechanical properties were analyzed. This structure-property analysis helped to understand the relation between the different types of crystalline phases and the degrees of crystallinity as well as to observe crystal sizes as they relate to the electric field induced strain. It was found that a higher degree of crystallinity was required to achieve a higher strain; at the same time, if the average crystal sizes are high, then the crystals act as a hindrance to random dipole movement and thus detrimentally affect the electroactive strain. Next, with the better understanding about the structure-property of terpolymers, the effect of adding SWNTs was investigated. The dispersion of the SWNT terpolymer nanocomposites using both physical dispersion and chemical dispersion (APS modification) was studied. The APS modification helped to achieve a good dispersion in the nanocomposites, which delayed the percolation of the SWNT network, leading to a low dielectric loss and low electrical conductivity. The inclusion of SWNT-APS also changed the microstructure of terpolymers; these films showed a lower % crystallinity compared to that for pure terpolymer and low proportion of \u03b1-phase, especially at lower weight fractions of SWNT-APS. \nAs a final step, the effect of the hybrid SWNT/GO on both microstructure and electromechanical properties of the terpolymer were studied. The hybrid nanofillers were chemically modified to form a covalent bond between them to improve their interaction. The morphology of the hybrid nanofillers after the chemical modification was studied for two different chemical modification routes: one using thionyl chloride, other using NHS and EDAC as catalysts. Of the two methods, the NHS and EDAC catalyst method showed a strong uniform interaction, confirmed by SEM images and FTIR results, with a shift in the peak to 1630 cm-1. Finally, the effect of hybrid SWNT and GO on the electromechanical properties were studied and, interestingly, the hybrid terpolymer nanocomposite film showed a lower electroactive strain compared to pure terpolymer at the same applied electric field. WAXS and DSC results suggest that this reduction is partly due to the change in the crystallinity and to the SWNT hindrance effect on the crystalline phase transformation which is responsible for the electroactive strain. \n\tIn this dissertation, it was successfully shown that using hybrid SWNT-GO both high coefficient of electrostriction (increase by 60 %) and high breakdown strength (140 MV/m) can be achieved by exploiting the actuation capabilities of SWNT in PVDF while GO acted as insulative filler. Also, the type of the fillers in the nanocomposites route had a strong influence on the actuation mechanism of relaxor ferroelectric polymers. The microstructure-property study highlights the importance of choosing the right type of nanofillers for further advancement in the field of EAPs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10557], "author_name_tesi": "Sigamani, Nirmal Shankar", "last_name_ssi": "Sigamani", "middle_name_ssi": "Shankar", "first_name_ssi": "Nirmal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zoubeida Ounaies", "Zoubeida Ounaies", "Md Amanul Haque", "Donghai Wang", "Joshua Alexander Robinson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zoubeida Ounaies, Dissertation Advisor", "Zoubeida Ounaies, Committee Chair", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Member", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member", "Joshua Alexander Robinson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Graphene Oxide", "reduced graphene", "carbon nanotubes", "electroactive strain", "electromechanical", "hybrid SWNT-GO", "chemical modification"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Global Connections:  Panama City as a Relational City", "id": "11710", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6201", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since the handover of the Panama Canal in 1999, the Panama City, Panama metropolitan area has undergone a rapid physical transformation.  In the central city, high-end condominium construction briskly altered the character of older waterfront neighborhoods, while on the peri-urban fringe, the rapid fabrication of mass-produced single-family housing drew the city\u2019s working classes ever farther outward.  Driven by strong demand attributable to remarkable economic growth, the first decade of the 21st century was characterized by a construction boom unprecedented in both scope and scale.  Drawing theoretical inspiration from a wide body of literature interconnecting the urbanization process with global institutions and phenomena, this dissertation analyzes Panama City\u2019s recent physical transformation from a morphological perspective across a variety of scales, ranging from individual parcels and buildings to the metropolitan area.  Utilizing data from interviews, public archives, aerial imagery, and cadastral records, this study applies a unique, mixed-methods approach to investigate specifically how and why Panama City underwent such a rapid transformation, and how that was connected to global forces more broadly.  The city features a robust service economy deriving from its connection to the Panama Canal and the adjacent Canal Zone, which was occupied by the United States until 1999.  My analysis indicates that a concert of factors hinging upon the city\u2019s intermediary economic role were important in shaping its growth, including particularistic historical, institutional, and political elements that created the proper preconditions for the city to absorb the effects of a dynamic global economy.

However, these aerosol-cloud interactions are the least understood aspect of our understanding of the climate system. Mineral dust aerosol is the largest global source of ice nucleating particles. During atmospheric transport, mineral dust can be exposed to sulfuric acid, which has been shown to decrease the ice nucleation activity of these particles. Many explanations for this observation, such as chemical changes to the surface or product formation that blocks active sites, have been suggested. Our research focused on building a molecular picture of these surfaces to understand why sulfuric acid exposure reduces the ice nucleation activity of clay minerals such as kaolinite. We performed studies using X-ray diffraction and solid state NMR that investigate the changes that clay minerals undergo as a result of acid exposure. We are the first to show that the formation of a product on the surface of kaolinite was responsible for the decreased ice nucleation activity, not surface changes to the mineral itself. We continued to study aerosol-cloud interactions by using parcel models that explore the impact of ice growth surface kinetics on the competition between heterogeneous and homogeneous ice nucleation in clouds. We found that impaired growth of ice favors homogeneous freezing. The parcel models will be expanded to include our work on clay minerals to explore the impact of chemical aging of ice nuclei on overall cloud properties. \n\n     We also studied the effect of acidic-processing on coal fly ash samples. Coal fly ash has been found to have a similar atmospheric impact as mineral dust, but is studied to a lesser extent. Like mineral dust, coal fly ash can serve as a source of bioavailable iron to phytoplankton in nutrient limited regions of the ocean. Fly ash has also been found to serve as an ice nucleating material. We performed aqueous sulfuric acid-treatment on fly ash samples representative of the types produced in the United States. We found that a soluble salt, gypsum (hydrated calcium sulfate), formed on three out of four samples. The most iron rich sample did not react with sulfuric acid. However, acidic-processing was shown to increase the amount of soluble iron which has implications for the biogeochemical cycle. These results also demonstrate that further work investigating these fly ash systems is warranted. In addition to our work on ice nucleation, we constructed a photoacoustic spectrometer to measure the absorbance of aerosol particles to study the optical properties of atmospheric aerosol.

The Solanaceae, Schrophulariaceae, and Rosaceae all possess S-RNase-based gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI), which is controlled by two separate genes at the highly polymorphic S-locus: the S-RNase gene encodes the pistil determinant, and the previously unidentified pollen S-gene encodes the pollen determinant. \n\tAn S-locus F-box gene of Petunia inflata, named PiSLF, was identified after the sequence analysis of a 328-kb contig that contains the S-RNase gene. PiSLF was considered the prime candidate gene for encoding the pollen determinant of SI for the following reasons: 1) it is specifically expressed in pollen and anthers; 2) it shows allelic sequence polymorphism; and 3) it co-segregates with the S-RNase gene in an S-haplotype specific manner. \n\tThe major goal of this thesis research was to functionally characterize PiSLF in order to establish its potential role in controlling pollen behavior during the SI interaction. In Chapter 2, I describe the use of gain-of-function experiments to directly examine the hypothesis that PiSLF encodes the pollen determinant. The experimental design was based on the competitive interaction phenomenon, in which pollen carrying two different pollen S-alleles (heteroallelic pollen), but not pollen carrying two copies of the same pollen S-allele (homoalleleic pollen), fails to function during the SI response. I introduced the S2-allele of PiSLF into S1S1, S1S2, and S2S3 self-incompatible P. inflata plants and showed that the presence and expression of the PiSLF2 transgene specifically broke down the SI function of heteroallelic pollen but not that of homoallelic pollen. I concluded that PiSLF encodes the pollen self-incompatibility determinant. \n\tHaving established the role of PiSLF in SI, I next addressed a fundamental question about the biochemical mechanism of SI: how do the pollen and pistil determinants interact to elicit S-haplotype-specific rejection of pollen tubes? Specifically, the question for the S-RNase-based mechanism is: how does a PiSLF interact with its self and non-self S-RNases differently so that only self S-RNase is allowed to exert its cytotoxic action in a pollen tube? To explain the biochemical basis of this type of SI mechanism, a \u201csimple\u201d inhibitor model was first proposed, which postulates that pollen S-allele products are cytotoxic inhibitors of S-RNases and that they contain an S-allele-specificity domain and an RNase inhibitor domain. A \u201cmodified\u201d inhibitor model was subsequently proposed, which postulates that pollen S-allele products only contain the S-allele-specificity domain and that the inhibitor function resides in a general RNase inhibitor.\nTo ascertain whether PiSLF contains both specificity and inhibitor functions, as predicted by the simple inhibitor model, I carried out loss-of-function experiments by introducing antisense- and RNAi-PiSLF2 constructs into S2S2 plants of P. inflata to suppress the expression of the endogenous PiSLF2. If absence of PiSLF2 is lethal to transgenic pollen, the results would be consistent with the simple inhibitor model. If transgenic pollen becomes compatible with pistils of any S-genotypes, the results would be consistent with the modified inhibitor model. Since the results of the antisense and RNAi experiments, described in Chapter 3, are inconclusive, it remains to be determined whether one of the inhibitor models is valid or neither is.\nUsing in vitro binding and yeast two-hybrid assays, PiSLF was found to interact with two different proteins, S-RNases and PiSBP1 (a RING-finger protein), but, except for the N-terminal F-box domain, no other protein-protein interaction motifs could be recognized by conventional domain-prediction programs, such as SMART and Pfam. I used InterProScan and Gestalt domain detection algorithm (GDDA) programs to identify any motifs of PiSLF that could potentially be involved in interactions with S-RNases, PiSBP1 and other proteins. The results revealed the presence of an F-box-associated domain (amino acid residues 112 to 350) and a galactose oxidase central domain, which includes a kelch-like motif (amino acid residues 40 to 356) in the C-terminal region of PiSLF2. The results are included in Chapter 4. To determine whether these domains are indeed involved in interactions with S-RNases, I generated a number of truncated PiSLF2 constructs for another graduate student to test the interactions between these truncated PiSLF2 proteins and S3-RNase. The preliminary results from in vitro binding assays suggest that the region between amino acids 81 and 297 is important for the interaction with S3-RNase. These results are also reported in Chapter 4. Finally, I describe in Chapter 4 how all the results I have obtained in my thesis research have advanced our understanding and laid a foundation for future studies of the S-RNase-based SI mechanism. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4953], "author_name_tesi": "Sijacic, Paja ", "last_name_ssi": "Sijacic", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Paja", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Ma", "Sarah Mary Assmann", "Simon Gilroy", "Teh Hui Kao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Sarah Mary Assmann, Committee Member", "Simon Gilroy, Committee Member", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Self-incompatibility", "S-RNase", "Male determinant", "PiSLF"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Use of Adjoint Methods in Jet Nozzle Design\n", "id": "10377", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4746", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The use of adjoint methods for aerodynamic design has been a major topic of research because of its benefits over traditional aerodynamic design. Traditional aerodynamic design is performed by changing the geometry and solving the flow equations for many possible geometries to see which one is the \u201coptimum\u201d geometry. The geometry could be optimum on different bases. One is trying to minimize or maximize a given objective function. This objective function may be the drag or lift or some other property depending upon the problem. Adjoint methods are used to find the direction of steepest descent by finding the gradients of the objective function with respect to the design parameters. Direct calculation of these gradients requires massive computational power, whereas solving the adjoint equation costs the same computationally as solving the flow equation. Hence, the use of adjoint methods saves on computational cost. In this thesis the use of adjoint design methods is presented for the design of a jet nozzle contour. The design is performed in such a manner that it gives a desired pressure distribution on the nozzle centerline. Both supersonic and subsonic cases are considered to explain the use of the adjoint method for design. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4711], "author_name_tesi": "Sikarwar, Nidhi ", "last_name_ssi": "Sikarwar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nidhi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip John Morris", "Philip John Morris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Philip John Morris, Thesis Advisor", "Philip John Morris, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Noise Reduction", "Adjoint Method", "Computational Fluid Dynamics", "Nozzle Design"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Development of Three-dimensional Adjoint Method for Flow Control with Blowing in Convergent-Divergent Nozzle Flows", "id": "24885", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10703", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The noise produced by the low bypass ratio turbofan engines used to power\nfighter aircraft is a problem for communities near military bases and for\npersonnel working in close proximity to the aircraft. For example, carrier\ndeck personnel are subject to noise exposure that can result in Noise-Induced\nHearing Loss which in-turn results in over a billion dollars of disability payments by the Veterans Administration. Several methods have been proposed to reduce the jet noise at\nthe source. These methods include microjet injection of air  or\nwater downstream of the jet exit,\nchevrons, and corrugated nozzle\ninserts. The last method involves the insertion of\ncorrugated seals into the diverging section of a military-style\nconvergent-divergent jet nozzle (to replace the existing seals). This has\nbeen shown to reduce both the broadband shock-associated noise as well as the\nmixing noise in the peak noise radiation direction. However, the original\ninserts were designed to be effective for a take-off condition where the jet\nis over-expanded. The nozzle performance would be expected to degrade at\nother conditions, such as in cruise at altitude. A new method has been proposed to achieve the same effects as corrugated seals, but using fluidic\ninserts. This involves injection of air, at relatively low pressures and\ntotal mass flow rates, into the diverging section of the nozzle. These\n\"fluidic inserts\" deflect the flow in the same way as the mechanical inserts.\nThe fluidic inserts represent an active control method, since the\ninjectors can be modified or turned off depending on the jet operating\nconditions. Noise reductions in the peak noise direction of 5 to 6 dB have\nbeen achieved and broadband shock-associated noise is effectively suppressed. There are multiple parameters to be considered in the design of the fluidic\ninserts. This includes the number and location of the injectors and the\npressures and mass flow rates to be used.

An adjoint optimization method can be used to achieve\nthe optimum blowing rate. It is shown that the method works for both geometry optimization and active control of the flow in order to deflect the flow in desirable ways.\n\nAn adjoint optimization method is described. It is used to determine the blowing distribution in the diverging section of a convergent-divergent nozzle that gives a desired pressure distribution in the nozzle.

The adjoint method is\nused to determine the blowing distribution required to minimize the shock strength in the nozzle to achieve a known target pressure and to achieve close to an ideally expanded flow pressure.\n\nA multi-block structured solver is developed to calculate the flow solution and associated adjoint variables.

A modified Runge-Kutta scheme is used to accelerate the convergence to a steady state. Second order artificial dissipation has been added to stabilize the calculations. The steepest decent method has been used for the optimization of the blowing velocity after the gradients of the cost function with respect to the blowing velocity are calculated using adjoint method.
