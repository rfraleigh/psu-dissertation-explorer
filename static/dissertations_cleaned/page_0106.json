Marshall, Matthew E. Raiff, and Jean-Francois Richard.  Each summer milk processors around the country participate in sealed bid procurements for the right to provide public schools with milk throughout the subsequent academic year. School district contracts are an important part of vehicle routing problems that milk processors solve on an ongoing basis. There are allegedly substantial cost savings for a milk processor from servicing a district that is directly adjacent to one they already service. In this paper, following the work of Krishna and Rosenthal (1996), we construct a procurement model allowing for cost synergies. The equilibrium bid function maps directly into an empirical specification. Using data from a time period when bidders were allegedly acting non-cooperatively, our structural parametric estimation results give significant support for the presence of cost synergies in the bidding.  This essay demonstrates that a market outcome that is consistent with the division of the market among cartel members is also consistent non-cooperative behavior, indicating that a test for the presence of collusion in this market should consider these synergies or will risk \u201cover-detecting\u201d collusion.\n\nThe second chapter is titled \"Numerical Analysis of Asymmetric Auctions with Optimal Reserve Prices,\" co-authored with Robert C. Marshall.  We numerically calculate equilibrium bids and optimal seller reserve prices for first price auctions within the independent private values framework where two bidders draw their valuations from heterogeneous distributions. In particular, we consider a type of bidder asymmetry that may result from collusion.  In contrast to the case of a zero reserve price, once optimal reserve prices are introduced first price auctions no longer dominate second price auctions in terms of expected revenue for the seller. In fact, for the cases examined herein, the opposite is true.  There are two main conclusions that we draw from this.  First, most of the literature has focused on the case of a zero reserve price.  Our paper shows that results that hold with a zero reserve price may not also hold when optimal reserve prices are introduced.  Second, there may be situations where auctioneers facing collusive bidders will maximize revenue when using a second price auction.  This is contrary to the intuition that first price auctions are less susceptible to cartels than first price auctions, and are therefore preferable.\n\nThe third chapter is titled \"Optimal Reserve Prices at First and Second Price Auctions with Endogenous Coalition Formation.\"  This extends the second essay to consider two coalitions of bidders that form endogenously.  In general, the incentive to form a cartel given an auction type will change as the reserve price changes.  This essay first shows how the incentives to form a cartel change with the reserve price.  Then, it is shown that when coalitions of bidders form endogenously as predicted by the recursive-core, a more sophisticated choice of the reserve price by the auctioneer (relative to the choice in the second essay) can affect the coalitions that result in such a way to again make first price auctions revenue dominate second price auctions even when there is a relatively small number of bidders.\n\nThe fourth chapter is titled \"Improving the Corporate Leniency Policy.\"  The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has instituted the Corporate Leniency Policy, which allows a single member of a cartel to receive amnesty from criminal punishment in exchange for substantial evidence against the remainder of the cartel. This has been heralded as the most effective weapon against collusion, and has been involved with most recent antitrust litigation. Using the Davidson and Deneckere (1990) model and outcomes as a baseline, an antitrust policy without leniency results in more collusion. The addition of leniency still results in more collusion than in Davidson and Deneckere, but not as much as with just the antitrust policy. However, including a bounty with leniency can improve the situation (from the view of the DOJ) if the criminal fines are sufficiently large.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5741], "author_name_tesi": "Schulenberg, Steven P.", "last_name_ssi": "Schulenberg", "middle_name_ssi": "P.", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Clifford Marshall", "Herman J Bierens", "Ronald Lee Filippelli", "J Tomas Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Clifford Marshall, Committee Chair", "Herman J Bierens, Committee Member", "Ronald Lee Filippelli, Committee Member", "J Tomas Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Auctions", "Collusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "VISUAL ACUITY AND CONTRAST SENSITIVITY \nIN DIABETIC INS2AKITA MICE \n\n\n", "id": "10781", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3659", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Purpose: Diabetes causes a loss of retinal neurons in the Ins2Akita mouse.  The purpose of this study was to determine the affect diabetes has on photopic (daylight) visual function in mice. The hypothesis tested was that diabetes progressively reduces visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in Ins2Akita mice. \nMethods: Ins2Akita/+ diabetic and Ins2+/+ wild-type (non-diabetic) littermates were bred in the Penn State Hershey Comparative Medicine barrier facility. Only male mice were used because the females develop only mild diabetes. Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were measured using an optokinetic testing apparatus (Cerebral Mechanics, Inc) by recording the tracking response (optokinetic reflex) to a rotating visual stimulus displayed on LCD panels surrounding the mouse. Visual acuity was measured at 100% contrast, while contrast sensitivity was measured at spatial frequencies of either 0.064 c/d or 0.092 c/d. Thresholds were obtained once a day for three days and averaged. Statistical comparisons were made by ANOVA or unpaired t-test.\nResults: Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were decreased by 10% - 16% and 15% - 31%, respectively, after 5 - 18 weeks of diabetes in Ins2Akita/+ diabetic mice compared to wild-type litter-mates (p < 0.01).  In a second study visual acuity was decreased 9% - 21% in Ins2Akita/+ diabetic mice after 10 to 26 weeks of diabetes compared to controls (p < 0.01).  Contrast sensitivity was also reduced; however, a significant loss of 16% - 26% was found after 18 weeks of diabetes and continued to decrease up to 26 weeks. \nThe significant deficit in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in Ins2Akita/+ mice after 2 weeks of diabetes was reversed by treatment with subcutaneous insulin implants When the implants were exhausted (5 weeks post implantation), blood glucose returned to levels significantly higher than the wild-type controls, but acuity and contrast sensitivity were significantly better than Ins2Akita/+ diabetic animals.\nConclusions: Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in diabetic Ins2Akita/+ mice are decreased soon after the onset of diabetes. This reduction lasts for the entire duration of diabetes. Treatment with insulin restored visual function, which was maintained even when insulin was no longer being delivered.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3639], "author_name_tesi": "Schuller, Kimberley ", "last_name_ssi": "Schuller", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberley", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alistair J Barber", "Alistair J Barber"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alistair J Barber, Thesis Advisor", "Alistair J Barber, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ins2Akita mice", "contrast sensitivity", "optokinetics", "diabetes", "visual function", "visual acuity"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Being There and Becoming-unfaithful with Children Through Art: Deleuzoguattarian Embodiment, Subjectivity, and the Production of Difference", "id": "14690", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7506", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation research explores how prevailing perspectives related to the art practices of young children continue to facilitate, accentuate and reinforce developmental, curricular, pedagogical and inquisitive models of representation (i.e., representational forms) that, in turn, cultivate deterministic ways of knowing the artistic and conceptual work of young children.

Furthermore, I challenge these prevailing representational qualities and forms of research, theory and practice in (early childhood) art education, and in particular that which sequesters the discursively disparate practices of young children\u2019s artistic and conceptual play. \nThe particular challenge that is taken up in this dissertation does not seek to destroy or disband these forms, but rather it is a challenge that sweeps these and other representational configurations into the intensive and elusive writings of Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari, whose thinking and abstract-prose function as networks of conceptual and theoretical dispersion, as mechanisms of connection, and as technologies of multiplicity and mobility, which in turn potentiates unforeseen and unpredictable opportunities to think and live differently. I do this by asking the following question: What happens when the prevailing representational forms of (early childhood) art education research, theory and practice are plugged into the Deleuzoguattarian machine?\nI must admit from the onset, though, that my dissertation research does not put forth answers, nor is it interested in trying to do so.

Comparing observation reports to the perceptions of those directly involved in the environment can provide helpful insights into understanding staff-child interactions and program climate in after-school programs. \nHowever, organizations and practitioners may not have the capacity to conduct multiple assessments and often times can only select one measurement tool, if any at all.  \nAlthough independent observations are powerful tools, they can be very costly as well as time consuming.  Self-report measures may represent a workable solution to assessment for organizations faced with limited resources. Research has demonstrated the value of using evaluation tools such as child and staff self-report measures to assess the quality of staff-child interactions with in after-school programs (Hall & Dilworth, 2005; Rosenthal & Vandell, 1996), but it has not been determined if one is a better indicator or more important than the other in depicting the after-school program setting.\nIn this current investigation, both children\u2019s and staffs\u2019 perceptions of after-school staff-child interactions were compared to the direct observations completed by independent observers to examine alignment with observational ratings. The perceptions of staff and children on staff-child interactions were compared to each other to determine if a correlation exists between their perceptions of the interactions between staff and children in after-school programs. \n\tA moderate negative correlation between staff and child perceptions was found (r = - .527, p < .020). Thus, staff perception was found to be opposite that of children\u2019s perception.  Even after controlling for effect of treatment vs. \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d sites, the correlation between staff and child items was still moderately and negatively correlated (r= -.557, p < .016).  A moderate negative correlation was also found between the perceptions of staff and the independent observers (r = -.562, p < .01), however the results indicate that staff and the independent observers rated staff-child interactions in opposite directions of one another even after controlling for treatment vs. \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d sites (r= - .537, p < .05). There was not a significant correlation found between the perceptions of children and the independent observers (r =.237, p > .05), however after controlling for the effects of treatment vs. \u201cbusiness as usual,\u201d a low correlation was found between the perceptions of children and the independent observers (r= - .463, p < .05).  Therefore, in this current investigation the children were the better indicators of staff-child interactions in after-school programs when compared to the independent observers.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2528], "author_name_tesi": "Schulte, Jill Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Schulte", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Jill", "degree_name_ssi": "M Ed", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Francis Perkins", "Daniel Francis Perkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Francis Perkins, Thesis Advisor", "Daniel Francis Perkins, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["after-school programs", "staff perceptions", "child perceptions"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "New Methods In Wavelet Analysis And Their Application To The Understanding Of Hydroclimate Variability In The Mid-atlantic Region Of The United States", "id": "27337", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12055", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "New statistical and topological methods in wavelet analysis are developed to help fully understand historical hydroclimate variability. The methods improve upon existing methods and enhance confidence in results. In particular, a geometric significance test was found to produce results similar to an existing areawise significance test while being more computationally flexible and efficient. The geometric test determined that features in wavelet power of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are indistinguishable from a red-noise background, suggesting that the NAO is a stochastic, unpredictable process, which could render difficult the future projections of the NAO under a changing global system. The geometric test did, however, identify features in the wavelet power spectrum of an El Ni\u00f1o index (Ni\u00f1o 3.4) as distinguishable from a red-noise background. A topological analysis of pointwise significance patches determined that holes, deficits in pointwise significance embedded in significance patches, are capable of identifying important structures, some of which are undetected by the geometric and areawise tests. Ni\u00f1o 3.4 time series contains numerous phase-coherent oscillations that could be interacting nonlinearly. Another statistical test, the cumulative areawise test, was also developed and was found to have greater statistical power than the geometric test in most cases, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio is high. The new testing procedure was applied to the time series of the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), the NAO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index and determined that the NAO, PDO, and AMO are consistent with red-noise processes, whereas significant power was found in the 2-7 year period band for the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index. High-order wavelet methods were developed to understand nonlinear climate phenomenon. A local autobicoherence spectrum of the QBO time series showed that the QBO time series contained a mode with a period of 28 months that was phase-coupled to a harmonic with a period of 14 months. An additional nonlinearly interacting triad was found among modes with periods of 10, 16, and 26 months. The oscillations were found to be skewed so that negative QBO regimes were preferred, and also asymmetric in the sense that phase transitions between the easterly and westerly phases occurred more rapidly than those from westerly to easterly regimes. The developed methods were applied to Mid-Atlantic region hydroclimatic time series. The results from the wavelet analysis showed that 18- and 26-year periodicities were embedded in the streamflow time series of the Delaware, Hudson, and Susquehanna Rivers. Decadal variability of streamflow was coherent with the El-Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation and the PDO. The Southern Oscillation explained 37-54% of the 1960s drought, 33-49% of the 1970s pluvial, and 19-50% of the 2000s pluvial in the three river basins. A composite analysis with meteorological data determined that the anomalously high daily streamflow events during the recent pluvial were associated with Rossby waves emanating from the tropics and sea-level pressure (SLP) dipole pattern over eastern North America (ENA). A new ENA SLP dipole index was constructed, which could explain more daily streamflow variance than the existing climate indices.\niv\nThe ENA dipole index was also found to be phase-locked to the Gulf Stream Index at a period of 74 months so that salinity variability at that timescale may have resulted from ENA dipole-related changes in precipitation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11482], "author_name_tesi": "Schulte, Justin A", "last_name_ssi": "Schulte", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr.", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr.", "Sukyoung Lee", "Chris Eliot Forest", "Christopher J Duffy", "M Ing Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr., Committee Chair", "Sukyoung Lee, Committee Member", "Chris Eliot Forest, Committee Member", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member", "M Ing Li, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Climate", "Wavelet Analysis", "Hydrology", "Statistics", "Time Series Analysis", "Estuary", "Drought", "Pluvial"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "School Racial Segregation and Homeschooling", "id": "27329", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11720", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Homeschooling is an increasingly popular educational option, yet research linking this school choice to patterns of school racial segregation remains scarce.

The phase formation within the nickel manganite materials system was studied with respect to annealing conditions (air, argon, oxygen, and engineered low pO2 from residual organics) through the synthesis of chemical solution deposited (acetate and acetylacetonate-based solutions) thin films over a wide range of compositions (Mn/Mn+Ni = 0.14 to 0.9) and temperatures (300 to 1030\u00c2\u00b0C).  Thin films were structurally characterized using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis and electrically characterized through determination of the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), resistivity, and activation energy.  \n\nIt has been shown that reducing atmospheres favor the spinel phase at low temperatures, while oxygen is required to crystallize thermodynamically stable phases with higher oxidation states on the Mn.  The annealing atmospheres can be controlled either globally (via the furnace ambient) or locally (by leaving residual organics following the pyrolysis step) to control phase formation.\n\nLow temperature synthesis of the thermistor films is important to enable compatibility of the material with CMOS integration.  Single-phase metastable cubic spinel films (Mn/Mn+Ni = 0.5 to 0.8) annealed in argon at 400\u00c2\u00b0C for 5 hours exhibit TCR values ranging from -3.8 to -4.5 %/K and resistivity values on the order of 10,000 \u00ce\u00a9cm. Metastable spinel films show excellent stability when heat-treated at 400\u00c2\u00b0C for long times. \n\nCubic spinel was also formed above 730\u00c2\u00b0C with comparable properties to the bulk, including TCR values between -3.3 and -4.5 %/K and resistivities around 1000 \u00ce\u00a9cm.  The small lattice parameters of the films indicate a cation-deficient spinel structure.  Due to the low processing temperatures possible, dense films could be prepared within the spinel phase field.  Thus, decomposition into the NiO phase and a Mn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rich spinel, which is problematic in bulk ceramics, will not occur in such spinel thin films.  For films prepared outside of the single-phase field, phase separation cannot always be detected using X-ray diffraction (due to the possibility of coherent straining or to the very small crystallite size).  In such cases, transmission electron microscopy was useful in identifying decomposition.\n\nSingle-phase spinel films (TCR = -3.6 to -4.1 %/K) were compared to single-phase bixbyite films (TCR = -3.1 to -3.3 %/K) synthesized between 630\u00c2\u00b0C and 930\u00c2\u00b0C.  The bixbyite phase exhibits lower TCR and lower resistivity, 400-1600 \u00ce\u00a9cm, compared to spinel, 3500-21,000 \u00ce\u00a9cm.  Composite films (achieved by controlling the pyrolysis to create a low local pO2) during annealing exhibit intermediate values (TCR = -3.0 to -3.8 %/K and resistivity = 470-6600 \u00ce\u00a9cm).  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2220], "author_name_tesi": "Schulze, Heidi M", "last_name_ssi": "Schulze", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Heidi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CHEMICAL SOLUTION DEPOSITION", "MICROBOLOMETER", "THIN FILM", "SPINEL", "INFRARED DETECTION"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Ecology and behavior of nine timber species in Par\u00e1, Brazil: links between species life history and forest management and conservation", "id": "6191", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4062", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Under any definition of sustainability, forest management must maintain viable populations of timber species.  I studied population dynamics of nine timber tree species in both undisturbed and logged stands at five sites in the eastern Amazon.  In stands subjected to haphazard conventional logging and a reduced-impact harvest system, I investigated canopy tree mortality patterns, timber tree regeneration and recruitment in logging disturbance zones.  I conducted experiments to investigate the regeneration management potential of important timber species. \n\t\nAdult growth rates varied dramatically among species and among individuals of a given species.  Much of the individual variation in growth and mortality could be attributed to differences in crown damage, light availability and vine-loading.  However, even among subsets of stems that under favorable growth conditions growth was highly variable.  \n\t\nAll study species displayed limited dispersal ranges: logging gaps that were more than 100 m from adults were rarely found to contain seedlings.  High inter-annual variation in seed production poses challenges for management of timber species in logged stands through natural colonization of disturbed sites.  After three years of logging gap succession, the majority of stems of all study species displayed signs of suppression.  In eighteen-year-old gaps, suppression of juveniles was even more extreme.  Estimated recruitment times from seedling to adult size in logging gaps were well-above sixty years for all study species. \n\t\nPlanted seeds and seedlings of light-demanding study species performed well in medium to large (=250m\u00b2) logging gaps, as long as liberation thinning was conducted to reduce competition with pioneer species.  Enrichment planting and tending of plants in logging gaps could prove to be a successful and necessary silvicultural technique.\n\t \nVariation in timber species life history characteristics lead to varied responses to logging disturbance.  Populations of the three canopy-emergent study species were the most vulnerable to logging disturbance.  Shade tolerant species appear more resilient under logging pressure.  However, proposed rotation lengths of 30-40 years may be overly optimistic.  Under current logging regimes, including reduced-impact logging, we are likely to see a shift from high value species in the first harvest to low value species with light wood in second and third harvests. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4037], "author_name_tesi": "Schulze, Mark ", "last_name_ssi": "Schulze", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Uhl", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "Claude W De Pamphilis", "Jim C Finley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Uhl, Committee Chair", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Member", "Claude W De Pamphilis, Committee Member", "Jim C Finley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tropical forest dynamics", "population ecology", "tree life history", "Brazil", "Amazon", "logging", "tropical forest management"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT BY SCIENTISTS AND TEACHERS\u2019 UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF SCIENCE", "id": "6677", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1328", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The educational literature suggests that the success of professional development is contingent upon both a professional developer\u2019s presentation of the curriculum and his/her comprehension of the complex interactions that occur between instructor and the adult learner.

Analysis shows that teachers were more likely to experience change in their views about the nature of science in courses in which they were treated as professionals, compared to courses in which they were treated as technicians. It also shows that syllabi and participant reports tend to overstate the use of inquiry methods when reviewed in the light of close classroom observation.\nBy recognizing and defining professional development contexts that build teachers\u2019 knowledge, this study suggests how university-based professional development for science educators can be improved, helping to actualize the collaborative relationships that need to exist between staff developers and discipline specialists.  In conclusion, I use the findings from this study to expand the current literature and suggest how improved university-based professional development contexts can be created.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1317], "author_name_tesi": "Schuster, Dwight A", "last_name_ssi": "Schuster", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Dwight", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Carlsen", "Carla Zembal Saul", "James F Nolan Jr.", "William Boyd", "Patrick Willard Shannon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Carlsen, Committee Chair", "Carla Zembal Saul, Committee Member", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "William Boyd, Committee Member", "Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Professional Development", "Science Education", "Nature of Science", "Inservice Teachers"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Inferring the Specific Absorption and Concentration of Black Carbon from AERONET Aerosol Retrievals\n", "id": "6233", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2067", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Black carbon is ubiquitous in the atmosphere and the main anthropogenic absorbing particulate.\nAbsorption by black carbon is thought to be comparable to the cooling associated with\nsulfate aerosols, although present day satellites are incapable of obtaining this measurement and\nmodel estimates are highly uncertain.

However, aging undeniably not only results in an expanding time since birth, but also in a decreasing time remaining in life. Every year a person lives implies that this person\u2019s past has increased by one year, but also that this person\u2019s future has shrunk by one year. Research in developmental psychology has demonstrated that individuals become aware in their 50s that a finite amount of time is available in life and that the perception that one\u2019s future is limited affects individuals\u2019 goals and values (Carstensen & Frederickson, 1998). In I/O psychology a variety of theories rely on the concept of future. Specifically, motivational theories explicitly or implicitly require a cognitive representation of the future (Locke & Latham, 1990) during which the outcomes of a person\u2019s behavior may unfold. However, it has not been systematically researched how a limitation of a person\u2019s future affects human behavior and attitudes at work.\nIn this dissertation I proposed that there are two psychological mechanisms through which the perception of one\u2019s future (i.e., the time remaining in life) affects behavior in organizations and attitudes toward work. First, research in developmental psychology suggests that once individuals begin perceiving their remaining life time as limited, they increasingly value activities that are emotionally relevant and turn toward social contacts (e.g., spouses or children) that are meaningful and capable of generating immediate positive affect. In other words, the perceived time remaining in life may impact what kind of experiences individuals value. Second, building on expectancy value models (e.g., Vroom, 1964), individuals may be less motivated to engage in a particular activity if the valued outcome is likely to take place in the far future. If the future is perceived to be limited, activities with a pay-off in the future may not be instrumental to obtaining these outcomes, as the future may come to an end before the outcomes are realized.\nThis dissertation tests these two propositions and demonstrates the value of perceived time left in life using the results of four studies. First, reporting results of a qualitative study (N=28), it clarified how concretely the perceived time remaining in life affects behavior and attitudes of employees (as opposed to individuals in general, as usually done in developmental psychology). For example, a reoccurring theme described by interviewed employees was a decreasing preference for \u201cgetting ahead\u201d and an increasing preference for \u201cgetting along\u201d. Second, I have introduced a scale that is suitable to measure the perceived magnitude of the time remaining in life. Using survey data I have provided evidence that the new scale is internally consistent and unidimensional. Third, I provided evidence for the construct validity of the newly developed construct \u201cperceived time remaining in life\u201d and distinguish it from other competing constructs (e.g., age, tenure, time perspective, etc.). \nThird, I have provided evidence for the criterion validity of perceived time remaining in life and demonstrate a positive relation of perceived time remaining in life with work effort (e.g., job performance, personal initiative) and job involvement. This indicates that individuals who perceive their time remaining in life to be short are less involved in their jobs and spend generally less effort on work. A second finding of this dissertation was that especially individuals in unfavorable job conditions (low task variety and autonomy) showed a strong decrease in work effort and job involvement when time remaining in life was perceived to be limited. In contrast, individuals in favorable job conditions (high task variety and autonomy) showed no decrease of work effort and job involvement when time remaining in life was perceived to be short. This finding indicated that enriching jobs (e.g., providing job variety) may allow organizations to prevent individuals with perceived short time remaining in life from decreasing work efforts.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [354], "author_name_tesi": "Schwall, Alexander Roland", "last_name_ssi": "Schwall", "middle_name_ssi": "Roland", "first_name_ssi": "Alexander", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Lewis Farr", "James Lewis Farr", "David Harrison", "Rick R Jacobs", "Susan Mohammed"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Lewis Farr, Dissertation Advisor", "James Lewis Farr, Committee Chair", "David Harrison, Committee Member", "Rick R Jacobs, Committee Member", "Susan Mohammed, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aging in organizations", "aging workforce", "retirement"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Defining Difference in Early New Spain", "id": "10541", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5136", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the language of difference developed in New Spain during the sixteenth century. In particular, this work takes as its focus the terminology used to define individuals of mixed ancestry born from the unions of Africans, Native Americans, and Europeans. Using a wide variety of documentation including Inquisition cases, bureaucratic reports, royal decrees, ecclesiastical correspondence, and criminal cases, I argue that a number of socio-racial labels were developed within the colonial context. These labels collectively called \u2018generos de gente\u2019 were first used and gained currency among colonists and settlers. For these colonial subjects, specific categories such as \u2018mestizo\u2019 and \u2018mulato\u2019 served to define and circumscribe individuals of mixed ancestry within society. As these terms gained currency in the colony, the royal bureaucracy came to enshrine these categories of difference into the legal system. Nevertheless, these terms were never explicitly defined in law. Consequently, ascription of g\u00e9nero labels remained tied to social perception and subject to the vagaries of individual opinion.\n\nThe dissertation examines these issues along two major axes. The first part of the dissertation examines the intellectual and political history of these labels. The opening two chapters study the intellectual underpinnings of Iberian notions of difference and then track the ways in which Old World antecedents shaped the development of categories of difference in early Spanish America. The third chapter focuses on how royal policy helped shape, and was influenced by, evolving understandings of ethnic difference in the Americas. The second part, divided into four chapters, shifts the focus from elite, European constructions of difference to quotidian lived experience. Chapters four and five examine the term \u2018mestizo.\u2019 I explore the unique place of individuals I have termed \u2018elite mestizos\u2019 and how in the first several decades of the colonial period the children of conquistadors and early settlers avoided the stigmatizing label of mestizo. I then examine the place of individuals specifically labeled \u2018mestizo\u2019 and their ability to succeed economically and socially despite the application of a casta label. The sixth and seventh chapters explore the very wide range of individuals who could be termed mulatos. I argue that mulato was a catch-all term used to describe anyone with some perceived African ancestry and was used for both individuals of Afro-indigenous and Afro-Hispanic descent. Moreover, mulatos represented a highly exogamous group. Over the course of the colonial period, these interethnic unions would help forge a society so diverse that the limited terminology of racial difference could no longer be applied in a coherent manner. In the seventh chapter, I demonstrate that the Afro-indigenous mulatos probably represented the majority of individuals so named. In so doing, I highlight a lacuna in current scholarship and argue that the predominance of these individuals necessitates a re-evaluation of the analytical value of the term mulato in historical investigations and a greater emphasis on the interactions between Africans, their descendents and indigenous groups. Ultimately, this dissertation expands our understanding of the initial development of racial terminology in sixteenth century Mexico as well as furthering our understanding of race in the broader Atlantic World.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5109], "author_name_tesi": "Schwaller, Robert Clemens", "last_name_ssi": "Schwaller", "middle_name_ssi": "Clemens", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Bennett Restall", "Matthew Bennett Restall", "Kent Russell Lohse", "Anthony Edward Kaye", "Kenneth Gale Hirth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Bennett Restall, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Bennett Restall, Committee Chair", "Kent Russell Lohse, Committee Member", "Anthony Edward Kaye, Committee Member", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["race", "colonial mexico", "casta", "early modern iberia", "africans", "mestizos", "mulatos"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "The nature of cross-language lexical activation in sentence context: A pscyholinguistic analysis", "id": "6149", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "141", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-09-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of the present study was to examine the cognitive nature of second\nlanguage (L2) lexical processing in sentence context.

These features, as well as the labor-intensive nature of horticultural production, make the task of securing and retaining farm workers particularly challenging.  Recent sociological literature does not sufficiently address how farmers recruit and manage hired workers to meet the distinctive labor needs on small-scale, seasonal farms.  This study addresses this gap in the literature by investigating how small and mid-sized farm operators perceive and experience agricultural labor issues.  It specifically explores the various labor management practices small-scale growers have developed to meet their labor needs and how their prior experiences have shaped these strategies.  This study draws primarily on in-depth interviews conducted with fruit and vegetable growers on 15 central Pennsylvania farms.  Applying an actor-oriented theoretical approach, a qualitative analysis of the interviews contributes to a better understanding of how previous experiences and current farm contexts shape these farmers\u2019 perceptions of their labor management challenges and opportunities.  This thesis presents findings about the diverse configurations of farm labor arranged and experienced by participant farmers; the comparative influence of key social actors on farmers\u2019 labor management decisions; the range of practices farmers ultimately adopt to accomplish necessary farm tasks; and the ways in which farmers interact with workers in their particular employment situations.  Findings indicate that participant growers adopt both formal and informal labor management styles as they respond to various social actors including family, hired workers, local community, and regulatory organizations.  They also tend to exhibit more accepting or more resistant attitudes as they respond to particular challenges associated with their interactions with these actors.  An analysis of these findings suggests that participant growers enact varying levels and kinds of flexibility, trust, and work ethic in response to various risk factors associated with farm labor management.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [212], "author_name_tesi": "Schwartzberg, Audrey L.", "last_name_ssi": "Schwartzberg", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Audrey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia Clare Hinrichs", "Dr Clare Hinrichs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia Clare Hinrichs, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Clare Hinrichs, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["qualitative research", "small farms", "farm labor"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "APHID ATTENUATION OF INDUCED PLANT DEFENSES \nIN BROAD BEAN\n\n", "id": "11605", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1768", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When fed on by insect herbivores, plants respond dynamically, resulting in far-reaching ecological and economic consequences. For example, when an insect begins to damage leaf tissue, the plant initiates production of within plant signaling molecules (phytohormones) that regulate defenses, including the production of airborne volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  These VOCs are attractive to beneficial insects such as predators and parasitoids that feed on the insect pest, resulting in reduced damage to the plant. This specialized attraction of beneficial insects by VOCs released from damaged plants is a well-studied symbiosis and is the foundation for biological control of many economically important crop pests.  By utilizing several research tools, we have explored how plants respond to herbivore damage and how aphids affect plant defense responses.  First, we found that the pea aphid, Acyrthsiphon pisum, has the ability to attenuate plant defense responses. Pea aphids not only evaded plant defenses, and also inhibited VOCs induced by concurrent damage from caterpillar feeding, but increased emission of aphid alarm pheromone as a result of crowding conditions.  This increased emission of alarm pheromone was correlated with alate formation of nearby pea aphids.  Additional studies indicated that aphid feeding interfered with induction and accumulation of the defense-related phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA).  Lastly, we discovered that aphid honeydew directly interferes with damage-induced phytohormone accumulation. Analysis of pea aphid honeydew indicated high levels of the important defense-related phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) and confirmed the ability of SA to attenuate damage-induced JA.  While SA has long been known to interfere with defense-related JA signaling, and has been associated with aphid feeding, this is the first time it has been described as a potential direct mechanism that may be partially responsible for the observed attenuation of plant defense responses. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1753], "author_name_tesi": "Schwartzberg, Ezra ", "last_name_ssi": "Schwartzberg", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ezra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tumlinson", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "Frederick Eugene Gildow Jr.", "Katriona Shea", "Gary Felton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tumlinson, Dissertation Advisor", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Committee Chair", "Frederick Eugene Gildow Jr., Committee Member", "Katriona Shea, Committee Member", "Gary Felton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aphids", "Chemical Ecology", "Broad Beans"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "The Role of Habitat Heterogeneity in Population Dynamics: From Individual Behavior to Metapopulation Structure", "id": "7004", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "922", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As human activities continue to fragment natural habitats, the need grows to be able to quantify the impacts of isolation and subdivision on population dynamics and life history strategies.

These two sources of variation are (a) variation in spatial heterogeneity experienced by different populations of the same species and (b) the inherent variation that exists between individuals making up a population.  Using the forked fungus beetle, Bolitotherus cornutus, as my study organism, I looked at both empirically and theoretically the influence of habitat heterogeneity on forked fungus beetle populations from the level of life history evolution up to metapopulation dynamics.  Life history traits and the role of spatial heterogeneity in the evolution of life history traits has been generally ignored, especially the influence of life history evolution on population and metapopulation dynamics.\nThe role of habitat patch heterogeneity on diet breadth and dispersal decisions was addressed both theoretically through the development of a dynamic state variable model, as well as empirically through the large capture mark recapture study conducted in a single host species landscape and a two host species landscape.

These experiments suggest that, compared to host races and described sibling parent species, the Lonicera Fly shows an intermediate level of behavioral isolation from its parent taxa. At the same time, the Lonicera Fly's host selection behavior indicated a higher phenotypic variability when compared to R. mendax and R. zephyria.\nThis unique combination of host shift and hybridization suggests sympatric speciation via host shift as the mechanism by which the hybrid Lonicera Fly formed. I discuss how the increased phenotypic variability of hybrid origin populations could facilitate adaptive speciation. I further argue that hybrid speciation in parasitic animals could be common because the ecological conditions of the Lonicera Fly system are frequently encountered in nature.\nFinally I integrate the findings of this study with previous results on speciation and hybridization in the genus Rhagoletis and other animal taxa. I propose the term \u201cbiological metaspecies\u201d to describe the evolution of the Rhagoletis pomonella species group. A biological metaspecies is a group of ecologically differentiated sibling taxa that are linked by occasional hybridization. Each single taxon might lack the necessary variation to colonize a new niche, but such variation could be maintained on the metaspecies level and become mobilized by hybridization.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1651], "author_name_tesi": "Schwarz, Dietmar ", "last_name_ssi": "Schwarz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dietmar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce A Mc Pheron", "Ottar N Bjornstad", "Warren G Abrahamson Ii", "Thomas Charles Baker", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce A Mc Pheron, Committee Chair", "Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Member", "Warren G Abrahamson Ii, Committee Member", "Thomas Charles Baker, Committee Member", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["speciation via hybridization in a diploid and bise", "sympatric speciation", "introgressive hybridization", "population genetics", "host choice and acceptance behavior", "Rhagoletis pomonella species group"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Computational Design and Experimental Characterization of Proteins with Increased Stability and Solubility\n", "id": "9400", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3486", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ability to design proteins from first principles will provide an efficient way to develop stabilized proteins, which could have a profound impact on a variety of biotechnological industries. For example, a biosensor made out of stable proteins would be able to be functional in harsh environmental conditions, such as the desert, where sensors made from less stable proteins would not be effective. Another example is that life-saving vaccines made from stable proteins could be stored at ambient temperatures, making it possible to distribute them more effectively to developing nations where refrigeration is not always an option. In addition to addressing the question of what forces govern thermodynamic stability, the field of protein design can also provide insight into the intramolecular interactions that are important for kinetic stability and solubility.\n\nIn the first part of this dissertation, the SH3 domain of the Fyn tyrosine kinase (FynSH3) was stabilized by the rational design of surface charge-charge interactions.  Analysis of the computationally optimized distributions of surface charges showed that the increase in favorable energy per substitution begins to level off after five substitutions. One of the sequences with five substitutions (four charge reversals and one introduction of a new charge) was selected for experimental characterization. Nine additional variants were also characterized to explore the stepwise contributions of these substitutions to the stability of FynSH3. The designed sequence was found to have an increased thermostability of 12 \u00b0C and an increase in the free energy of unfolding (&#916;G) of 8 kJ/mol, relative to the wild-type protein.  These results suggest that a significant increase in stability can be achieved through a small number of amino acid substitutions, and argue for a seminal role of surface charge-charge interactions in modulating protein stability.\n\nThe second part of this dissertation addresses the question of how important the unfolded state of a protein is for determining its stability and whether it needs to be considered in the design approach. Some of the first attempts to address this issue tried to explain the pH-dependent changes in stability (&#916;G) for several different proteins, where it was found that, in order to reproduce experimental data, a statistical (Gaussian polymer chain, GPC) representation of the unfolded state needed to be included in the calculations of &#916;G. However, incorporation of this model into our design approach did not significantly improve our predictions. To determine whether this was due to an inability of the Gaussian model to accurately describe the distance distributions, and therefore the energies, observed in structural representations of the unfolded state, the distance distributions for a GPC were compared to those observed in the excluded volume limit (EV) structural libraries of two proteins: ubiquitin and NTL9. For residues that were close in sequence, where the unfolded state energies are the largest, it was found that these distributions were markedly different between the GPC and EV methods. A possible explanation for this observation is that the EV limit does not consider charge-charge interactions when creating the large-scale structural libraries. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the 2,000 structures in the EV libraries to model the unfolded state in the presence of charge-charge interactions, yet the Gaussian model was still unable to accurately reproduce the distance distributions of the structural library. However, very little difference was observed in the charge-charge interaction energies calculated by the Gaussian model versus directly calculating the energies in the post-MD unfolded state structural libraries, suggesting that the statistical model may be sufficient for describing the behavior of the unfolded state. Since (1) the overall charge-charge interaction energies in the unfolded state are small and (2) our design approach focuses on the differences in energies (&#916;&#916;G) rather than absolute energies (&#916;G) for selecting more stable variants, the overall effect of unfolded state can most likely be ignored without adversely affecting the predictive ability of the algorithm. The implication of these results for a protein that has previously been thought to have specific residual interactions in the unfolded state is discussed.\n\nIn the third part of this dissertation, the question of how the thermodynamic stabilization of proteins redesigned by our approach affects the kinetics of the folding and unfolding reactions is addressed. The folding and unfolding kinetics of the wild-type and designed variants of a bacterial cold shock protein (CspB), FynSH3, tenascin, and procarboxypeptidase were examined. Since the hydrophobic collapse of the protein core is the first step in protein folding, the rate of hydrophobic collapse should drive the folding rate.  All of the proteins designed in this study contain substitutions on the protein surface, while the core residues remain unchanged. Therefore, one would intuitively predict that the folding rates of the wild-type and designed variants of each protein should remain the same, so the observed increases in stability must come from much slower rates of unfolding. This is a logical conclusion because the designed proteins contain more favorable surface  charge-charge interactions than the wild-type proteins, meaning that it would take more energy to break these favorable interactions once they had been formed, thus decreasing the unfolding rate. For CspB, this was indeed shown to be the case. However, the increased stability of the FynSH3, tenascin, and procarboxypeptidase variants appears to be due to a faster folding rate, while the unfolding rate remains unchanged relative to the wild-type. Based on &#966;-value analysis data from the literature, it appears that this affect is due to the substitutions being made at positions that have native-like structure in the transition state. The results of these experiments show that while proteins can be thermodynamically stabilized by the same method, the kinetic mechanisms of stabilization can be vastly different. By incorporating the results of existing &#966;-value analyses into the design algorithm, it should be possible to select for residues that would decrease the unfolding rate, rather than increase the folding rate. This means that one could potentially design a protein that is not only thermostable, but also kinetically stable, which would have profound implications for the development of protein therapeutics.\n\nThe fourth part of the dissertation explores the role of surface charges in making proteins less susceptible to aggregation. A few recent reports suggest that adding a large number of charged moieties to proteins (supercharging) increases solubility and decreases aggregation due to thermal denaturation. While this approach seems to be an effective way to combat protein aggregation, nothing is known about the thermodynamic effects of supercharging. A supercharged variant of ubiquitin was designed by introducing charges at positions that were not predicted to have a significant impact on the thermodynamic stability.  Not only was the supercharged variant of ubiquitin more soluble than the wild-type at neutral pH, but it also showed reversible thermal denaturation under conditions where wild-type ubiquitin aggregates. Interestingly, this protein was destabilized relative to the wild-type protein. While the supercharged ubiquitin was predicted to have similar thermodynamic stability to the wild-type, it is possible that our design approach cannot accurately predict charge-charge interaction energies in a highly charged molecule. Further studies on more supercharged proteins should help develop a foundation by which we can further understand the thermodynamic mechanisms, and therefore, more accurately predict, the effects of supercharging on protein both protein stability and protein aggregation.\n\nIn the fifth, and final, part of the dissertation, the effects of pressure on protein denaturation are examined. Pressure perturbation calorimetry (PPC) is a new experimental method that is being used to study the volumetric properties of proteins. PPC measures the coefficient of thermal expansion (&#945;) of a protein in dilute solution when subjected to changes in pressure (&#916;P ~ 80 psi) under isothermal conditions. By measuring &#945; as a function of temperature, it is possible to measure the volumetric changes (&#916;V/V) in proteins upon unfolding.  A novel method for analyzing the data using a thermodynamic two-state model of unfolding was developed, and was used to analyze PPC data for five model proteins: lysozyme, ribonuclease A, ubiquitin, cytochrome c, and eglinC.  It was observed that the volumetric changes upon unfolding of all proteins, except cytochrome c, converged at high temperature.  The anomalous behavior of cytochrome c is most likely due to the imperfect packing of the protein around the heme group.  The results discussed in this chapter set a foundation for exploring how the alteration of intramolecular interactions such as packing interactions or surface charge-charge interactions will affect the volumetric properties of proteins.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3472], "author_name_tesi": "Schweiker, Katrina Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Schweiker", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Katrina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George Makhatadze", "George I Makhatadze", "Judith S Bond", "Thomas E Spratt", "Philip C.

AK affects approximately 7% of the United States (US) population. In 2004 the US health care spending for AK management was $1.2 billion. Some of the procedural treatments for AK were targeted by CMS for reduced reimbursement, potentially due to over-utilization. Alternative reimbursement models are being investigated in other therapeutic areas to reduce costs, but there is little investigation for dermatologic conditions. \n\nObjectives: To assess AK-specific healthcare utilization and costs and develop eight bundled payment models.  \n\nMethods:  A retrospective cohort was obtained from a large private insurer for the mid-Atlantic region (January 2010 to December 2012). This sample was used to describe utilization and cost, and served as a test and a validation sample for bundled payment development. A random sample from a nationally representative dataset, the Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae database, was used as a second validation sample.\n\nResults: The total cost of AK-related care was $40,719,495 for 95,294 patients with AK. Of this cost, prescriptions accounted for 8.6% and outpatient care for 91.4%, of which 44.9% was due to destructive procedures. The use of extensive destruction (CPT 17004), prescription medication therapy, male gender and age were associated with a higher mean three-year cost, although the cost data were right-skewed and had a large variance. Winsorization was applied at the 1st/99th and 5th/95th percentiles, which reduced the mean 3-year cost by $34 and $64, respectively. Several percentile- and mean-based bundled payments were developed, with and without adjustments, and most predicted savings over historical reimbursements. All of the models predicted that some patients and providers would have costs above the bundled payment.\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Bundled payments appear theoretically feasible for AK management, but further work is needed to determine the method that is most equitable for providers and patients. Gender and history of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) were used to adjust payments as these contributed importantly to variation in cost. More research is needed to establish the value of various treatment methods in order to guide practitioners\u2019 and patients\u2019 decisions. In addition, the utility of bundled payments for AK management needs to be implemented and compared to other reimbursement models. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10268], "author_name_tesi": "Sciacca Kirby, Joslyn R", "last_name_ssi": "Sciacca Kirby", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Joslyn", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas L Leslie"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas L Leslie, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Actinic keratosis", "utilization", "management", "treatment", "cost", "efficiency", "value", "alternative payment model", "bundled payment"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "IMPACTS OF VEGETATIVE BUFFERS AND WINTER CROPS ON WATER QUALITY AND PROFITABILITY OF SMALL TO MIDSIZE FARMS IN PENNSYLVANIA", "id": "15125kts13", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15125", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Substantial production of advanced and cellulosic biofuels is needed to achieve the biofuel blending mandates set by the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard. The success of increasing production of these fuels is hindered by many technological and logistical challenges including feedstock selection, availability and affordability. This research provides an analysis of the environmental and economic impacts of alternative feedstocks including winter rye, switchgrass, and willow on farms within the Mahantango Creek Watershed in Pennsylvania. This analysis can help develop a more complete picture of the tradeoffs between water quality and farm income. The agroecosystem model Cycles was used to establish the environmental impact of incorporating winter rye and perennial energy crops into the landscape, as well as the expected yields. This information, integrated into crop budgets, was used to determine the average profit of different row crop rotations and energy crops. Adding winter double crops to baseline summer-only crop rotations increased profits by $404 ha-1 year-1 due to an increase in corn grain and soybean grain yields, as well as the addition of winter rye biomass. Environmental metrics showed improvement when these crops were integrated in rotations, decreasing soil carbon loss without increasing nitrate leaching for most soils. From a financial perspective, annual crops were typically more profitable than perennial crops unless they were on land that frequently floods or has other high risks of annual crop failure. When risks of annual crop failure reduce the differential per hectare profit, perennial strips or streamside multi-functional buffers that produce biomass crops as well as ecosystem services can be the most profitable option. However, there can still be a minimum buffer width of harvested energy crop required to overcome the total loss of income from the 10.7-meter (35-foot) unharvested forest buffer typically required to provide shade and leaf litter for aquatic life including cold-water fisheries. These minimum widths are a function of feedstock selling price and flood frequency, and those variables had a large impact on the profitability of various width buffers. Considering environmental benefits, all buffer widths and vegetation composition would be more beneficial than annual crops in terms of water quality due to reduction in nitrate leaching. From a soil health perspective, simulations of soil characteristics found that the introduction of perennials or winter crops improved the net soil carbon accumulation for most soil types, with a positive correlation between both soil depth and soil organic matter content on increased crop yield. These results establish the costs associated with integrating energy crops as either perennial buffers or double crops within agricultural landscapes, and also estimate the supply of these crops that could be available as a feedstock for biofuels or other purposes. Overall, the results show that incorporating winter double crops on landscapes has the potential to increase farm income and decrease soil carbon loss for this watershed. For vegetative buffer strips, it was found that an ideal width for this watershed based on economic and environmental considerations varied based on flood frequency and feedstock selling price. For average floodplain sites in the Mahantango watershed, flood frequencies of 3 years or greater lose money with conventional corn-soybean annual crop rotations, and farmers would cut their losses by planting perennial buffers even without harvesting for biomass markets.  For perennial crop prices of $90 Mg-1 the breakeven flood frequency was about 5 years. For sites without flood risk, perennial crop prices had to be on the order of $135 Mg-1 to be more profitable than conventional annual crop rotations. Integrating this information with detailed flood zones and hydrologic mapping could fine-tune these recommendations for specific fields and farms in this watershed. This information will be important for local land-owner decisions, researchers interested in performing field-trials of vegetative buffer strips, and companies that are interested in establishing next generation biomass conversion facilities.

The results extend current knowledge and understanding of capture dynamics in the context of astrodynamics and celestial mechanics.\nManifold theory, fast Lyapunov indicator maps, and the classification of space structure facilitate an analysis of the transport of objects from the chaotic reaches of the solar system to the distant retrograde region in the sun-Jupiter system.  Apart from past studies this dissertation considers the role of the complex lobe structure encompassing stable regions in the circular restricted three-body problem.  These structures are shown to be responsible for the phenomenon of sticky orbits and the transport of objects among stable regions.  Since permanent capture can only be achieved through a change in energy, fast Lyapunov indicator maps and other methods which reveal the structure of the conservative system are used to discern capture regions and identify the underpinnings of the dynamics.  Fast Lyapunov indicator maps provide an accurate classification of orbits of permanent capture and escape, yet monopolize computational resources.  In anticipation of a fully three-dimensional analysis in the dissipative system a new mapping parameter is introduced based on energy degradation and averaged velocity.  Although the study specifically addresses the sun-Jupiter system, the qualitative results and devised techniques can be applied throughout the solar system and to capture about extrasolar planets.\nExtending the analysis beyond the exterior of the stable distant retrograde region fosters the construction of transfer orbits from low-Earth orbit to a stable periodic orbit at the center of the stable distant retrograde region.  Key to this analysis is the predictability of collision orbits within the highly chaotic region commonly recognized as a saddle point on the energy manifold.  The pragmatic techniques derived from this analysis solve a number of complications apparent in the literature.  Notably a reliable methodology for the construction of an arbitrary number of transfer orbits circumvents the requirement of computing specialized periodic orbits or extensive numerical sampling of the phase space.  The procedure provides a complete description of the design space accessing a wide range of distant retrograde orbits sizes, insertion points, and parking orbit altitudes in an automated manner.  The transfers are studied in a similar fashion to periodic orbits unveiling the intimate relationship among design parameters and phase space structure.  An arbitrary number of Earth return periodic orbits can be generated as a by-product.  These orbits may be useful for spacecraft that must make a number of passes near the second primary without a reduction in energy.\nFurther analysis of the lobe dynamics and a modification of the transfers to the center of the stable region yields sets of single impulse transfers to sticky distant retrograde orbits.  It is shown that the evolution of the phase space structures with energy corresponds to the variation of capture time and target size.  Capture phenomenon is related to the stability characteristics of the unstable periodic orbit and the geometry of the corresponding homoclinic tangle at various energies.  Future spacecraft with little or no propulsive means may take advantage of these natural trajectories for operations in the region.  \nTemporary capture along a sticky orbit may come before incremental stabilization of the spacecraft by way of a series of small impulsive or a low continuous thrust maneuvers.  The requirements of small stabilization maneuver are calculated and compared to a direct transfer to the center of stable region.  This mission design may be desirable as any failure in the classic set of maneuvers to the center of the stable region could result in the loss of the spacecraft.  A simple low-thrust stabilization method is analyzed in a similar manner to nebular drag.  It is shown that stabilization maneuvers initiated within the sticky region can be achieved via a simple control law.  Moreover, the sticky region can be used as a staging point for both spiral-in and spiral-out maneuvers.  For the spiral in maneuver this negates a large, initial maneuver required to reach the center of the stable region.

This dissertation project seeks to examine the dimensions of leadership that lead to perceptions of high performing leadership in marketing contrasted with other those in other business functions such as engineering, human resources, and R&D.  We then explore how these dimensions of leadership relate to perceptions of effectiveness importance.  The objective is to determine if heterogeneity exists in leadership perceptions across business functions in the organization.  We collect data from seven business functions (Marketing, Engineering, Human Resource, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Research & Development, and Sales).  The research uncovered eight dimensions of leadership across.  Marketing is significantly different from other business functions on three of these dimensions (Vision, Drive, and Charisma).  The results confirm that heterogeneity in leadership perceptions indeed differ across business function.

In the first essay, I theorize why truckload transportation carriers refuse service (i.e., reject load offers) when their service is requested at previously-negotiated prices.  Using a large database of truckload transactions from a U.S.-based shipper, I find that carriers often do not fully live up to their commitments.  They are most likely to reject load offers when the market is most in their favor and/or during spikes in a shipper\u2019s demand on a lane.  This suggests that, when the market is favorable for carriers, shippers may be better off incentivizing carriers for performance via flexible pricing mechanisms instead of using \u201cstrong-arm\u201d tactics.\n\tIn the second essay, I study the value to shippers and carriers to share load information in advance.  This question has been posed by researchers for some time, but industry data has never been used to answer the question.  I use a highly-credible dataset from truckload spot auctions to estimate the price increase associated with one, two, and three days of lead time.  I also propose a method to estimate market conditions in for-hire trucking in near-real-time using hedonic regression techniques.  Interestingly, market conditions are highly autocorrelated.\n\tThe third essay evaluates how shipper-enacted governance mechanisms \u2013 more explicit contracts, output monitoring, and commitment \u2013 affect carrier performance and restrain opportunism.

Many\nresearchers and practitioners have tried a variety of strategies in recent years to combat the physical inactivity problem with varying results, yet physical activity levels remain low. One promising strategy involves parental support as an avenue to increase physical activity. The purposes of this dissertation are (a) to examine the effect that adolescent perceptions of parental support may have on adolescent physical activity, and if there is a relationship, (b) to examine if\ntwo types of motivation, intrinsic and identified/task oriented, mediate the effects of parental support on adolescent physical activity. This study also examined gender differences, the time of week in which physical activity occurs, and the varying types of physical activity participation\nsuch as walking, running, and other physical activity among urban, minority youth. Gender\ndifferences found girls reported significantly lower amounts of physical activity compared to\nboys. Using Social Cognitive Theory and Self Determination Theory as the theoretical\nframeworks, perceptions of parental support and individual motivation significantly predicted\nadolescent physical activity. The results indicated that perceptions of parental encouragement and engagement significantly predicted total physical activity, time of week physical activity and type of physical activity. Structural equation modeling was used to test the direct and indirect paths that perceptions of parental support and motivation on total physical activity, time of week\nphysical activity, and type of physical activity.

While the literature presents several analyses of median filters optimized for a standard 3x3 pixel neighborhood configuration, a 5x5 neighborhood, useful for imagery exhibiting noise not conforming to the classic \u201csalt and pepper\u201d formation, has received little analysis.  Research efforts on hardware implementations of median filters have been devoted primarily toward implementations with low latency and high throughput.  A system is in development that utilizes intensified visible to near-infrared sensors and requires a 5x5 median filter to handle intensifier noise.  Since the system is a battery powered unit, optimal power usage is a critical requirement in addition to low latency and high throughput.  However, optimal power usage for median filtering has received little attention in the literature.\nThis research focuses on investigating five selected hardware implementations of a 5x5 median filter and comparing them on the basis of power dissipation.  The latency, maximum clock rates, and resource utilization for some of these implementations are also analyzed.  The designs considered include implementations of a radix sort-based elimination algorithm, a systolic sorting array, a Batcher sorting network, and two insertion sorting networks.  The two insertion sort networks have nearly identical sorting cores, but one utilizes a fundamentally different wrapper; this will be referred to as a row insertion sort network.  Also included in the analysis is a commercial off the shelf (COTS) intellectual property (IP) core.  The five custom filters were designed to be fully pipelined, accepting inputs and generating median output values every pixel clock pulse with a constant latency.  All five custom designs are integrated with a wrapper functions that provide buffering to handle the kernel based behavior of two dimensional filtering.  Initially, a merge sort implementation was also considered but was almost immediately eliminated because the power and resource usage was an order of magnitude greater than all other designs under review.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3083], "author_name_tesi": "Scott, Jesse ", "last_name_ssi": "Scott", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jesse", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Thesis Advisor", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Weavesort", "HDL", "systolic", "Batcher", "insertion", "median"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Nonresident Father Involvement on Offspring Well-being during the Transition to Adulthood\n\n", "id": "7607", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4108", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The majority of research on nonresident father involvement focuses on the effects of involvement on offspring\u2019s well-being during childhood or adolescence.  Findings from this body of research suggest that nonresident father involvement is positively related to a number of indicators of childhood and adolescent well-being.  What is less clear is how nonresident father involvement continues to influence offspring well-being during the transition to adulthood, and throughout offspring\u2019s adult years.  Research on the effects of nonresident father involvement and the nonresident father-child relationship during adolescence and young adulthood on offspring\u2019s experiences during young adulthood is virtually nonexistent.    \nUsing a sample of offspring with nonresident fathers (N = 2,785) from the first and third waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), this study extends current research on nonresident father involvement and child well-being by examining the consequences of nonresident father involvement during adolescence and young adulthood on young adult offspring well-being.  This study builds on previous research by examining the role of nonresident father involvement over-time, by analyzing the unique contributions to offspring\u2019s well-being of fathers and mothers, and by focusing on multiple dimensions of offspring\u2019s well-being during the transition to adulthood.  The effects of nonresident father-child relationship quality, father\u2019s financial contributions, and father involvement on offspring\u2019s educational attainment, depressive symptoms, self-esteem, criminal activity, violent behavior, and substance use are examined.  Measures of mother involvement and mother-offspring relationship quality are also included in the models.  \nI test the mediating and moderating effects of additional factors related to nonresident father involvement and offspring well-being, including characteristics of the offspring, fathers, mothers, and several different family structure variables.  As a final step in the analyses, I examine the effect of changes in father-offspring relationship quality over-time on changes in offspring\u2019s self-esteem and depressive symptoms.    \nResults from this study suggest that the current relationship between nonresident fathers and their young adult offspring has a direct and positive effect on offspring\u2019s well-being during young adulthood, net of the mother-offspring relationship.  Offspring who are close to their fathers during young adulthood have higher levels of self-esteem than those with lower quality relationships.  After accounting for the mother-offspring relationship, father-offspring closeness does not increase offspring\u2019s educational attainment or significantly reduce criminal behavior, violent activity, substance use, or depression, but fathers\u2019 payment of child support and financial contributions to their young adult offspring do improve offspring\u2019s chances of obtaining some level of post high school education, including going to and completing college.  Analyses also show that only about a quarter of the sample experienced an improvement in father-offspring closeness between the first and third waves of the study.  About 40% of the sample experienced no change in initial levels of closeness to their nonresident fathers.  However, increases in father-offspring closeness appear to benefit offspring by increasing self-esteem and decreasing their level of depressive symptoms during young adulthood.  An analysis of the interactions between father-offspring closeness and characteristics of the child, father and their family background suggest that these findings are generally similar for all groups of offspring.  The only consistent moderating effect was for mother-offspring closeness.  Children that are close to both their mothers and nonresident biological fathers experience added benefits from these close relationships.  \nFindings from this study represent the first step toward understanding the long-term influence of nonresident fathers on offspring\u2019s well-being during the transition to adulthood.  It shows that certain aspects of the nonresident father-child relationship are positively associated with multiple dimensions of offspring\u2019s well-being, even after accounting for the mother-child relationship.  The results also suggest that offspring benefit from improved relationships with their nonresident fathers as they move through the transition to adulthood.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4086], "author_name_tesi": "Scott, Mindy E", "last_name_ssi": "Scott", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Mindy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan Booth", "Valarie Elizabeth King", "David R Johnson", "David Eggebeen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan Booth, Committee Chair", "Valarie Elizabeth King, Committee Chair", "David R Johnson, Committee Member", "David Eggebeen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["father involvement", "transition to adulthood", "social capital", "lifecourse"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Measurements on Galfenol Material and Transducers\n", "id": "8325", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5331", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Magnetostriction can be described most generally as the deformation of a material in response to a change in its magnetization.

Previous research has demonstrated a critical role of iron in early-life brain development and function but few studies have examined this relation in WRA, despite continued reliance on neural processes shown to be impacted by iron supply such as dopaminergic signaling. Even less evidence exists regarding whether cognitive alterations manifest during mild ID without anemia. Similarly, though a strong link between exercise and brain health has been shown, little work has documented how physical fitness in WRA relates to cognition, a troubling fact given that 40-50% of WRA in the United States are physically inactive. We sought to explore interrelations between iron status, physical fitness, cognition, and academic performance in WRA within a university setting, where optimal cognitive functioning has direct implications for current livelihood and future wellbeing. \nThis observational study involved 127 generally healthy, non-anemic females aged 18-35 years (average 22 years). Each woman underwent a blood draw to assess iron status, a maximal exercise test to assess cardiorespiratory fitness, and five computerized cognitive tests of executive function\u2014Attentional Network Task, Berg\u2019s Card Sorting Task, Go/No-Go, Sternberg Memory Search, and Tower of London\u2014using the Psychology Experiment Building Language platform. The sample was selected for low ferritin levels, with 40% having Ft \u2264 12 \u00b5g/L. Fitness was generally high, with an average peak VO2 of 44.5 ml/min/kg, corresponding to the American College of Sports Medicine\u2019s 80th-85th percentile for females aged 20-29 years in the United States. \n\tAfter controlling for a set of potential covariates, results suggested that executive function remains largely intact in mild ID, with one exception being planning ability as measured using the Tower of London task. Positive associations were found between fitness and performance measures on four of the five cognitive tasks, suggesting that fitness widely benefits executive ability. No added cognitive benefit of concurrent high iron status and high physical fitness was found. However, grade point average (GPA) was positively associated with both iron status and fitness such that a group with concurrent ID and lower fitness had the lowest GPA, whereas a group with concurrent iron sufficiency and higher fitness had the highest GPA. Furthermore, better academic performance was found in women with higher scores on a latent factor representing high-level executive processes.\n\tIn conclusion, this study has expanded the knowledge base in two underexplored areas with public health relevance: how both mild ID and physical fitness impact cognition in healthy young adult females. Our findings support earlier work showing that most cognitive components remain intact during early ID, but that certain aspects may be negatively impacted. Additionally, the current study extends previous research by showing that cardiorespiratory fitness in WRA is related to multiple executive tasks known to recruit fronto-parietal circuits. We are the first to demonstrate that iron status in WRA is related to academic performance, and this observation alone deserves further consideration given the number of ID individuals worldwide. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11248], "author_name_tesi": "Scott, Samuel Pew", "last_name_ssi": "Scott", "middle_name_ssi": "Pew", "first_name_ssi": "Samuel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Laura E Murray Kolb", "Laura E Murray Kolb", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher", "A Catharine Ross", "Rick Owen Gilmore", "Jere Haas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Laura E Murray Kolb, Dissertation Advisor", "Laura E Murray Kolb, Committee Chair", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Committee Member", "A Catharine Ross, Committee Member", "Rick Owen Gilmore, Committee Member", "Jere Haas, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Iron", "nutrition", "cognition", "brain", "fitness", "physical performance"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Beyond National Trauma: Experiential Memory and Epistemic Practices in the Literature of Ireland and Irish-America's Minoritized Populations", "id": "13566sms6025", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13566", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project explores experiential memory and epistemic practices in contemporary Irish and Irish-American literary texts centering on minoritized populations. Historians, memory-studies scholars, and literary critics have sought to unearth how political, social, and cultural maneuvers, as well as twentieth-century literature, have facilitated the emergence of an Irish identity culled from memories of nationalist sacrifice and trauma. In conceptualizing memory as inherently retrogressive and paralyzing, however, scholars have overlooked memory\u2019s role in generating sociopolitical change. Looking to fiction, drama, poetry, archival materials, and journalistic texts, this project reveals how memory has enabled queer, rural, immigrant, and New Irish populations to combat the stereotyping that divests them of their epistemic agency, and to cohere group identities with which to advocate for themselves. Jamie O\u2019Neill and Emma Donoghue\u2019s fiction exposes how establishing archives of experience enables gay and lesbian communities to envision a queer assimilationist domesticity that affirms the communities\u2019 sense of national belonging. Edna O\u2019Brien and Tana French\u2019s bestselling novels reveal the importance of reclaiming the experiential knowledge-construction practices of rural Ireland that have been devalued in the wake of Ireland\u2019s science and technology revolution. Applied theatre insists upon the specificity of Dublin\u2019s pan-African community\u2019s experiences, impelling audience members to recognize their normative responsibility to create a more truly multicultural society. Finally, New Irish authors Greg Delanty and Nuala Archer resist the sentimental commodification of Irishness perpetuated in Irish-American periodicals, instead envisioning forms of intimacy related to the integration of Irish history, mythology, and language with experiential memory. In uncovering the diverse epistemic practices deployed by minoritized populations as they discover their pasts, as well as the normative responsibility of the dominant population to recognize these practices, this project contends that memory is able to help call into being a more just nation.

Traditional MOSFETS are fast approaching fundamental material limitations, but SiNWs can be theoretically scaled to smaller geometries, thereby increasing performance while reducing manufacturing costs.  Bottom-up methods are routinely employed to grow SiNWs.  One method commonly used is the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism, in which a metal nanoparticle acts as a catalyst and growth site for SiNW growth.  However, for device fabrication, the SiNWs typically have to be transferred from the growth substrates and precisely positioned onto another substrate where the devices are to be fabricated.  This post-growth assembly step not only makes the SiNW device fabrication process more complex, but may also lead to contamination issues during the Si NW removal/assembly steps.\n\nA method to grow precisely positioned Si NWs without the need for any post-growth assembly steps has been developed in our group.  This previous research has developed a template method to control initial dimensions and position of Si NW growth, but as the Si NW grows and exits the template in the \u201cextruded\u201d version of this approach, directionality of growth has been inconsistent.  This research attempted to influence the growth directionality for extruded wires by using established electric field lines created by embedding electrodes into the template.  The grown SiNWs can then be easily integrated into devices without need for further assembly steps.\n\nThis research determined that an electric-field of 2 V/\u00b5m was insufficient in our sample geometry to control directionality of SiNWs.  Samples had SiNW yields of 10 \u2013 16% regardless of application of electric-fields.  Raman scattering analysis proved that the grown SiNWs were single-crystalline.  An analysis of the SiNWs\u2019 electrical properties found similar results to data previously reported for samples without electric-field influences. One reason suggested for the ineffectiveness of the electric-field on SiNW growth is that interfacial energies overpowered any effects from the electric-field.  Additionally, dendritic formations which appeared on byproducts of the sample fabrication process suggest that electric-field shielding effects may be constraining directional influences on the SiNWs.  Possible solutions to this issue as well as suggestions for future work are discussed in this thesis.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1494], "author_name_tesi": "Scott III, Dana Malcolm", "last_name_ssi": "Scott III", "middle_name_ssi": "Malcolm", "first_name_ssi": "Dana", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash", "Stephen Joseph Fonash"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash, Thesis Advisor", "Stephen Joseph Fonash, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["silicon", "nanowire", "Fonash", "self-assembly", "electric-field", "grow-in-place"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Effects of a dairy-rich diet on modulating biomarkers of inflammation in weight-stable overweight and obese adults", "id": "18716", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8912", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Excess adiposity is associated with persistent low-grade inflammation, which may contribute to the development of obesity comorbidities.

Research suggests that, in particular, parenting is an important predictor of children\u2019s prosocial behavior (Cook, Schoppe-Sullivan, Buckley, & Davis, 2009; Hastings, McShane, Parker, & Ladha, 2007; Schoppe-Sullivan, Weldon, Cook, Davis, & Buckley, 2009).  In addition to parenting, research has suggested that the coparenting relationship interacts with parenting, as well as independently influences children\u2019s social development (Feinberg, 2003; Gable, Crnic, & Belsky, 1994; Van Egeren & Hawkins, 2004).  Children\u2019s temperament may be an important influence on the development of prosocial behavior (Hay & Cook, 2007; Rothbart, 2007; Rothbart & Bates, 2006; Young, Fox, & Zahn-Waxler, 1999).  Utilizing data from the Toddlers Into Kindergarteners Emotion Study (TIKES), the current study examined the effects of parenting, coparenting, and children\u2019s temperament on children\u2019s emerging prosocial behavior.  Results revealed a pattern in which coparenting cooperation was positively associated with children\u2019s prosocial behavior.  This pattern highlights the important role of a cooperative coparenting subsystem, above and beyond the parenting subsystem, in influencing children\u2019s emerging prosocial behavior within the family.  Significant interactions between positive parenting practices and cooperative coparenting behaviors also emerged.  These results highlight the importance of the association between positive parenting practices and children\u2019s prosocial development within the context of cooperative coparenting behaviors.  Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of understanding family processes, beyond the parenting relationship, that contribute to children\u2019s prosocial development.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3984], "author_name_tesi": "Scrimgeour, Meghan Brewer", "last_name_ssi": "Scrimgeour", "middle_name_ssi": "Brewer", "first_name_ssi": "Meghan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alysia Blandon", "Alysia Blandon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alysia Blandon, Thesis Advisor", "Alysia Blandon, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Prosocial behavior", "parenting", "coparenting", "temperament"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Role of Marital, Coparenting, and Sibling Relationships on the Development of Children's Prosocial Behaviors in Early Childhood", "id": "27315", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11923", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Children\u2019s ability to engage in prosocial behavior develops in the toddler and preschool years, and research has shown that children\u2019s early growth in prosocial behavior is important in promoting social competence and positive social relationships later in life (Eisenberg, Fabes, & Spinrad, 2006; Ensor, Spencer, & Hughes, 2011; Hay, Hudson, & Liang, 2010).  Occurring first within the family context, children\u2019s early development of prosocial behavior is potentially influenced by multiple family dynamics including marital, coparenting, and sibling relationships (Dunn & Munn, 1986; Eisenberg et al., 2006; Hastings, Utendale, & Sullivan, 2007; McCoy, Cummings, & Davies, 2009; Scrimgeour, Blandon, Stifter, & Buss, 2013; Svetlova, Nichols, & Brownell, 2010).

Emerging fields of optical communications, optical data storage, displays, biomedical devices, sensing, and defense applications will all rely heavily on such ferroelectrics as a versatile solid-state photonic platform.\nDiverse functionalities can be created in these materials simply through the patterning of the ferroelectric domains.  By creating specific domain features in these materials, it is possible to create new laser wavelengths from existing sources as well as active electro-optic structures that can dynamically focus, shape and steer light.  However, the process of domain shaping today is mostly empirical, based on trial-and-error rather than sound, predictive science.\nThe central focus of this thesis work is to develop a fundamental understanding of how to shape and control domain walls in ferroelectrics, specifically in lithium niobate and lithium tantalate, for photonic applications.  An understanding of the domain wall phenomena is being approached at two levels: the macroscale and the nanoscale.  On the macroscale, different electric field poling techniques are developed and used to create domain shapes of arbitrary orientation.  A theoretical framework based on Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire theory is developed to determine the preferred domain wall shapes.  Differences in the poling characteristics and domain wall shapes between the two materials as well as differences in material composition relates to nonstoichiometric defects in the crystal.  At the nanoscale, these defects influence the local electromechanical properties of the domain wall.  Understanding from both of these approaches has been used to design and create photonic devices through micro-patterned ferroelectrics.  Increased fundamental understanding of the poling kinetics and domain wall properties developed in this thesis can lead to a more predictive, scientific towards domain wall shaping.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1313], "author_name_tesi": "Scrymgeour, David A", "last_name_ssi": "Scrymgeour", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Venkatraman Gopalan", "Evangelos Manias", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Kenji Uchino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Chair", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Member", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Kenji Uchino, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["piezoelectric force microscopy", "optical devices", "lithium tantalate", "lithium niobate", "ferroelectrics", "scanner", "QPM"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Mechanical properties of the seismogenic zone", "id": "22440", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10192", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the processes that dictate the evolution of frictional strength during the seismic cycle is a central problem in characterizing the seismic potential of faults and in relating earthquake source parameters such as stress drop to recurrence interval and geologic and geodetic fault slip rates. Laboratory friction experiments provide insight into the mechanisms of fault healing, and results of these studies provide the fundamental underpinnings of the rate- and state-friction laws. Frictional healing is the mechanism(s) associated with fault restrengthening following failure, where time-, slip- and velocity- dependent processes dictate the evolution of real contact area at grain junctions within fault gouge. The objective of this work is to illuminate the micromechanics of frictional healing and the relation between mechanical and hydraulic properties of fault gouge. Four main dissertation chapters are combined with three additional collaborative works describing research on the fundamental processes that govern earthquakes and tectonic faulting.\n Chapter one is focused on the role of water during repetitive stick- slip frictional sliding, with particular emphasis on the grain scale mechanisms of frictional restrengthening. A micromechanical model for gouge deformation is developed, based on the interpretation of mechanical and microstructural observations.\nChapter two describes the role of pore fluid pressure during earthquake nucleation and dynamic rupture. Experiments were performed on synthetic granular fault gouge under a range of hydrological boundary conditions from drained to undrained. The experiments demonstrate that when gouge layers are deformed under undrained boundary conditions, time-dependent strengthening and the magnitude of stress drop increase, when compared with drained conditions. I conclude that under undrained conditions, a series of feedback processes between pore fluid depressurization and stress enhanced pressure solution creep control time-dependent elasto-plastic deformation at frictional contacts. These observations have important implications for models of earthquake recurrence and for theoretical models of granular deformation.\nChapter three was designed to investigate the relation between permeability and porosity across the brittle ductile transition in siliciclastic rocks, with implication for the up-dip limit of seismo-genesis along subduction zones. I find that permeability is dependent on the deformation style and strain localization. In the brittle regime shear localization along discrete bands can act as a barrier to fluid flow, modifying the hydrological properties and distribution of fluids. The possible generation of overpressures can lower the effective stress surrounding the shear plane and thus favor the nucleation/propagation of earthquake rupture.\nChapter four describes work to examine the frictional stability and hydrological properties of natural serpentinite samples from the San Andreas Fault in central California. The aim of this work was to shed light on the deformation mechanism(s) responsible for the spectrum of fault slip behaviors, including Low Frequency Earthquakes (LFE), slow earthquakes, and non volcanic tremor. I find that when serpentinite is associated with other weak phyllosilicates minerals (i.e. talc), for typical seismogenic depths, it can control the mode of fault failure showing the potential characteristics for generating LFE and other forms of transient slip.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9879], "author_name_tesi": "Scuderi, Marco Maria", "last_name_ssi": "Scuderi", "middle_name_ssi": "Maria", "first_name_ssi": "Marco", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chris J Marone", "Chris Marone", "Demian Saffer", "Derek Elsworth", "Peter Christopher Lafemina", "Eliza Richardson Marone"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chris J Marone, Dissertation Advisor", "Chris Marone, Committee Chair", "Demian Saffer, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Peter Christopher Lafemina, Committee Member", "Eliza Richardson Marone, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["earthquakes", "friction", "granular physics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Multitrophic Interactions Contribute to Wood Digestion and Nutritional Ecology in Larval Anoplophora glabripennis (asian Longhorned Beetle)\n", "id": "19890", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9348", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) is an exotic, wood-boring pest that was first detected in the northeastern United States in 1996. A. glabripennis has a broad host range and can feed and grow in the heartwood of about 25 different deciduous tree species in the US.  A. glabripennis\u2019 ability to thrive in a broad range of healthy host trees is particularly impressive considering that most other wood-boring insects with broad host ranges feed on stressed or dying trees whose woody, intractable components have been pre-digested by wood-degrading bacteria and fungi.  In contrast, A. glabripennis harbors a diverse gut microbial community hypothesized to provide key enzymes for lignocellulose digestion and nutrient acquisition that help this insect overcome challenges of survival in healthy host trees. To investigate the contribution of gut microbes to digestive physiology, we surveyed the inherent digestive capabilities of A. glabripennis through midgut transcriptome sequencing, inventoried the taxonomic identity and metabolic potential of gut microbial affiliates through metagenome and metatranscriptome profiling, and analyzed the wood-degrading potential of a filamentous fungal taxon (e.g. Fusarium solani) consistently found in association with the A. glabripennis midgut using multidimensional protein identification techniques.  While A. glabripennis endogenously produces a diverse array of cellulases belonging to three glycoside hydrolase families, xylanases, detoxification enzymes, and proteins involved in nitrogen and nutrient scavenging, its suite of digestive and nutrient scavenging abilities is greatly expanded through its affiliation with gut microbes.   Metagenome and metatranscriptome profiling revealed that the gut community has the capacity to produce cellulases, xylanases, and enzymes involved in nitrogen-fixation and recycling, vitamin and sterol synthesis, and lignin degradation. Moreover, secretome analysis of the beetle gut isolate of F. solani was cultivated on wood chips, revealing the production of several laccases, peroxidases, and accessory enzymes previously implicated in lignin depolymerization, suggesting that this isolate could have lignin-degrading capabilities in the beetle gut.  Both insect- and microbial- derived digestive enzymes represent novel targets that could be targeted for control of this invasive beetle.  Overall, this research lays the foundation for unraveling the complex interactions between cerambycids and their gut microbes that contribute to survival in an environment devoid of easily accessible nutrients, allowing us to mine for novel biochemical pathways that could be exploited to enhance industrial cellulosic ethanol production and to develop novel targets for pest management.

However, UNDE in such real world systems is a non-trivial task due in large to the high temperature environments involved with such systems.\nUtilization of a spray-on deposition technique of ferroelectric bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12) is investigated. The spray-on technique has several advantages compared to more standard methods of transducer fabrication, particularly for high temperature systems. The primary advantage of this technique is that transducers can be deposited directly onto the structure requiring investigation. Eliminates the need to develop a means of maintaining reliable high temperature mechanical coupling between the transducer and structure under evaluation. Additionally, the ability to analyze structures with complicated geometries with greater ease can potentially be achieved. Moreover, this method allows for fabrication of thick film transducer and therefore transducers with center frequencies typical to industrial UNDE (1-20 MHz) can be realized. Bismuth titanate has been chosen as the material to be investigated due to its high Curie temperature (685 oC) and because it has already been shown that fabrication of bismuth titanate based ultrasonic transducers via the spray-on deposition method is possible. \nSince initial results with conventional sintering methods were unsuccessful, microwave sintering was pursued and is capable of producing films with superior quality. Industrial partners showed strong interest for on-site deposition transducers. However, with on-site deposition, microwave sintering may not be a viable option. As a result, a crude, but very successful, method of sintering with a blow torch was developed and transducers fabricated in this fashion showed equivalent electromechanical strength.\n\tMoreover, the entire temperature range which bismuth titanate fabricated with the spray-on technique had yet to be explored. In this work it has been shown that spray-deposited bismuth titanate transducers are capable of generating ultrasonic signals with strengths equivalent to room temperature signals up to 650 oC for short periods of time. Above this temperature, thermal depoling of the sample occurs rapidly as temperature increases and signal strength diminishes. Furthermore, little has been done to date to characterize material properties bismuth titanate films deposited with the spray-on technique. Initial results indicated that higher electromechanical coupling could be achieved with films deposited in this fashion when compared to their bulk counterparts due to the fact larger field strengths can be employed during poling without breakdown. Typically, the electromechanical properties of substrate supported films are determined via curve fitting methods since the standards outlined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers are not valid for the boundary conditions inherent to substrate supported films. However, as it is demonstrated in this work with the Mason model, due to the loading on the transducer from the substrate and the porosity of the films, these techniques cannot be employed as no electromechanical resonance is observed in the impedance spectrum of the transducer. Values for the d33 of the films were approximated by using a commercial d33 meter and suggest d33 values within the range of 13-16 pC/N are being achieved. Extrapolation of field strengths applied to the films fabricated herein during poling to numbers reported for bulk bismuth titanate imply that these values for the d33 are fairly accurate. Conductivity measurements were made of the bismuth titanate films and were found to be equivalent to bulk bismuth titanate, thus eliminating lower conductivity as a possible reason as to why larger field strengths are attainable. It is well known that if thermal breakdown is the mechanism responsible for breakdown within a material, larger field strengths can be achieved in samples as thickness decrease due to the fact that localized heating can be dissipated more quickly in thinner materials. Therefore, thermal breakdown is posited here as the breakdown mechanism in bismuth titanate and it has been calculated that breakdown strength of the material increases inversely proportional roughly to the cube root of the thickness of the samples. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7406], "author_name_tesi": "Searfass, Clifford ", "last_name_ssi": "Searfass", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Clifford", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard R Tittmann", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Dinesh Kumar Agrawal", "Thomas R Shrout"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard R Tittmann, Dissertation Advisor", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Dinesh Kumar Agrawal, Committee Member", "Thomas R Shrout, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["high temperature ferroelectric", "high temperature piezoelectric", "high temperature ultrasound", "high temperature transducer"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Family and Center-Based Child Care Providers' Beliefs and Concerns About Professional Development Opportunities", "id": "12548", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "244", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to uncover family and center-based child care providers\u2019 beliefs about professional development opportunities available to them in the current environment of increasing expectations. As research has become available to spotlight the possibilities for young children, and the disparities between children who have quality early experiences and those who do not, more public figures are convinced that investments in early childhood programs are key to shrinking the divide between children before they enter school. The changing identity of the child care workforce that cares for and educates these children has prompted a need for specialized professional development approaches to help child care providers embrace this new role. Little is known about effective professional development in early childhood programs, especially home-based programs. \nThis study addresses two primary research questions: (1) What are family and center-based child care providers\u2019 concerns and beliefs about increasing professional development requirements? and (2) What factors contribute to the providers\u2019 decision to participate or not participate in professional development initiatives? The Maryland Child Care Credential, a professional development incentive program, provided a focused professional development model to explore. \nThirty-seven participants from child care centers and family child care homes in the three western counties of Maryland participated in the study. Data collection tools included three Concerns Based Adoption Model tools developed by Hall and Hord for public school teachers. Child care providers completed a 35-item Stages of Concern Questionnaire and an Open-Ended Statement. Child care providers also participated in follow-up interviews. The designer of the Maryland Child Care Credential, Liz Kelley, provided information in the creation of an Innovation Configuration Map to outline the intent of the Credential program. Use of Hall and Hord\u2019s Concerns-Based Adoption Model tools suggested an additional research question: Whether or not the CBAM in slightly modified form could be used with the child care population. \nThe exploratory study found that family and center-based child care providers are concerned about increasing professional development requirements of the voluntary Maryland Child Care Credential. Child care providers who are currently participating in the Credential program are either required to participate to receive college funds or to maintain employment, or they believe that the Credential will soon be required and want to be prepared for that time.\nChild care providers who are using participation incentives to receive a college education are most likely to believe that the Credential is relevant to their own professional goals. Child care providers who do not believe that a college education is relevant to their own goals or the goals of the parents they serve are least likely to begin or continue participation in the Credential program.\nAll child care providers, whether or not they are currently participating in the Credential program, are concerned about the time needed to complete requirements and the procedures that must be followed to receive and maintain the Maryland Child Care Credential. Child care providers reported long work hours, sometimes working second jobs, and family commitments that demand their time outside of work hours. \nChild care providers in child care centers who required Credential participation were more likely to have procedural supports in place to minimize the time needed to understand, complete, and maintain requirements of the professional development program. Family child care providers reported challenges in gaining support in understanding and maneuvering the Maryland Child Care Credential system.\nThese three Concerns Based Adoption Model tools, along with follow-up interviews of each consenting participant, allowed me to describe the concerns and beliefs of the individual child care providers. There was consistency in individual child care providers\u2019 responses between the Innovation Configuration Map, the Stages of Concern Questionnaire, and the Open-Ended Statement. The small sample size does not allow generalization to the larger child care population, but these initial findings do support engaging in a larger scale study to further explore the use of the modified Concern-Based Adoption Model with professional development innovations within the child care field. \n\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [242], "author_name_tesi": "Searfoss, Annette Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Searfoss", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Annette", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr James Johnson", "James Ewald Johnson", "James F Nolan Jr.", "Andrea Vujan Mccloskey", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr James Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "James Ewald Johnson, Committee Chair", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "Andrea Vujan Mccloskey, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["child care", "early childhood education", "beliefs", "concerns", "professional development", "Concerns-Based Adoption Model", "expectancy-value theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE HUMAN N-MYRISTOYLTRANSFERASES AS POTENTIAL PHARMACOTHERAPEUTIC TARGETS IN HIV-1 REPLICATION\n", "id": "10263", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3409", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus and consequent Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) remain pressing global epidemics. A tremendous need exists for new therapies and treatment paradigms due to viral diversity and the high rate of viral mutation and drug resistance. A major limitation of currently available anti-retroviral agents is that these drugs target viral proteins or viral enzymes, rather than host cell components involved in viral replication and pathogenesis. Targeting viral processes and enzymes leads to a high rate of drug resistance due to the rapid mutation of viral enzymes and lack of a proofreading mechanism during reverse transcription. Novel anti-retroviral treatments focusing on inhibiting host cell processes critical for retroviral replication would provide a more robust treatment strategy, as the virus is unlikely to achieve the significant evolution needed to bypass the lost or diminished host cell function.\n\nA key host cell process involved in retroviral replication is the N-myristoylation of HIV-Nef and HIV-Gag. This process involves the transfer of a 14-carbon myristate moiety from myristoyl-Coenzyme A to the N-terminus of substrate proteins through the catalytic activity of the N-myristoyltransferase isozymes (NMT1 and NMT2 in humans). The human NMTs share a sequence homology of approximately 75-77%; however, little is known about the unique substrate specificity or function of the NMTs in normal or disease states. Previous reports in the literature suggest that the NMTs exhibit unique substrate specificity in the context of cancer systems; however, little research has been reported to date in regard to the specificity of the NMTs for viral substrate proteins. Elucidation of the specific NMT responsible for HIV-Gag or HIV-Nef would be a significant step toward development of novel anti-retroviral treatments as myristoylation of these proteins plays a key role in retroviral budding and pathogenesis.\n\nOur laboratory examined the roles of the individual NMTs in regard to HIV-Gag and HIV-Nef myristoylation using a variety of biochemical and molecular approaches. Fluorescently labeled peptides corresponding to the N-terminal myristoylation sequence of Gag and Nef were synthesized and myristoylated by recombinant human NMT1 and NMT2. Kinetic analysis revealed that NMT1 and NMT2 have 30- and 130-fold lower KMs for Nef than Gag, respectively. Values for Kcat indicate that once Gag or Nef binds to the enzyme, myristoylation by NMT1 and NMT2 proceeds at comparable rates. Furthermore, the catalytic efficiencies for the processing of Gag by NMT1 and NMT2 were equivalent. In contrast, NMT2 had approximately 5-fold higher catalytic efficiency for the myristoylation of Nef than did NMT1. These experiments were confirmed by using full length recombinant Nef protein, which also indicated a lower KM for Nef myristoylation by NMT2 than by NMT1.\n\nWe then validated the results of the in vitro kinetic data via siRNA knockdown of the NMTs, followed by confocal microscopy to determine consequent effects on localization of a Nef-sgGFP fusion protein in HEK293T cells. Depletion of NMT1 had minimal affect on the intracellular distribution of Nef-sgGFP; whereas, ablation of NMT2 altered distribution to a diffuse, widespread pattern, mimicking that of a myristoylation-deficient mutant Nef-sgGFP. Together, these findings indicate that Gag is a poor substrate for the human NMTs, and that Nef is preferentially myristoylated vs. Gag when present in the same system. Results also indicate that Nef is a better substrate for human\nNMT2, suggesting that selectively inhibiting NMT2 activity may provide a novel means of reducing HIV virulence.\n\nOur laboratory performed a small molecule screen for novel inhibitors of recombinant human NMT1. Approximately 20 compounds selected from this screen were tested for their anti-HIV properties, including effects on production, release, and infectivity of viral particles released from the latently infected OM10.1 cell line. Compound 12 (4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-6-(4-methylphenyl)-2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrimidine) was selected as a lead compound due to its ability to decrease the number of viral particles (p24 capsid) released into the supernatant from infected cells. Treatment with this compound concurrently increased intracellular levels of p24, further supporting the importance of myristoylation in the retroviral life cycle. Ten structural analogs of Compound 12 were then selected and tested for anti-HIV activity. This work reports the discovery of two novel 2-(piperazin-1-yl)-4-phenyl-6-phenylpyrimidines (Compounds 103 and 104) which at non-cytotoxic doses decrease the number of infectious viral particles released from infected cells and simultaneously increase intracellular retention of p24. Parallel studies were performed to test the effects of Compounds 103, 104, and 109 on the subcellular localization of either Gag-eGFP or Nef-sgGFP constructs in HEK293T cells. All three compounds decreased Gag-eGFP localization to cellular membranes up to 70% vs. control, with a concomitant increase in cytosolic Gag-eGFP. Furthermore, Compound 104 abolished Nef-sgGFP localization to cellular membranes, making this an attractive compound for further characterization and optimization.\n\nTo date, this is the first report to describe the effects of small molecules targeted toward the NMTs in the context of a fully functional viral infection. These results, as well as the kinetic studies, indicate the possibility of future development of novel anti-HIV therapeutics specifically targeting the N-myristoyltransferases for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3397], "author_name_tesi": "Seaton, Kelly Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Seaton", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Kelly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles D Smith", "Charles D Smith", "Jong Kak Yun", "Kent Eugene Vrana", "Melvin Lee Billingsley", "John Warren Wills"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles D Smith, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles D Smith, Committee Chair", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Chair", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Member", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["human N-myristoyltransferases", "myristoylation", "HIV"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "CITIZEN\u2019S PERCEPTION AND USE OF GOVERNMENTAL TRANSPARENCY:  EFFECTS ON CITIZEN TRUST AND PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT", "id": "14982mls337", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14982", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Throughout the past few decades, governmental transparency has become a hot topic within public administration.

Ultimately, this dissertation\u2019s goal is to add to a very limited set of U.S. public administration transparency literature.\n     To achieve this goal, this dissertation first analyzes current governmental transparency publications and research focusing on specific relationships between a citizen\u2019s perception and use of governmental transparency, public trust in government, and public participation. To test these relationships, a 2009 survey conducted by the Princeton Survey Research Associates International for the Pew Internet and American Life Project is used. With this robust data set, this research study finds that a relationship between governmental transparency perception and a citizen\u2019s trust in government does exist, but the relationship is extremely weak in a negative direction (transparency pessimism). Furthermore, a relationship between governmental transparency perception and a citizen\u2019s participation in government also exists, but the relationship is also extremely weak in a negative direction. \n     The key finding in this research is that a statistical significant, positive relationship exists between governmental transparency use and citizen participation. Higher governmental transparency use leads to increases in citizen participation. Public administers should be aware of this relationship to enhance overall public participation in government.

The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is becoming more important world-wide.  Although  farmland can serve as a sink for carbon, agriculture is also an important source of emissions.  As a sector, agriculture is reported to be the greatest contributor of nitrous oxide and the third greatest contributor of methane.  As a result, various studies have attempted to answer the motivating questions.\n\nDespite the effort spent in answering these questions, most approaches have focused on one specific greenhouse gas, have used empirical relationships to quantify emissions, or have neglected important aspects an agricultural system.  This research extended these approaches in order to answer the motivating questions by quantifying total net GHG emissions and developing a computer module to predict emissions using primarily mechanistic relationships.  This module was incorporated into the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM), which was then used to analyze reduction strategies in the context of a whole-farm system. \n\nFirst, typical ranges of greenhouse gas emissions were identified from sources (i.e., animal housing facilities, croplands, and manure storages) on dairy farms.  The typical emission values were used to identify the major sources of greenhouse gases from dairy farms in order to guide the model development.  A computer model was then created to predict greenhouse gas emissions from sources on a dairy farm.  Process-based relationships were utilized for all of the major sources, and as many of the minor sources as was justified.  The refined version of IFSM was evaluated for both prediction accuracy and sensitivity, and was determined to adequately predict whole-farm emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nIFSM was then used to predict greenhouse gas emissions and net return from management scenarios in five categories: manure handling strategies, tillage systems, growth hormones, dietary forage concentration, and confined versus grazing production systems.  The scenarios that emitted the least amount of greenhouse gases were: covered manure storages with surface application, no-till, using rBST growth hormone, high forage:grain ratio with additional forage produced on-farm, and winter confinement with summer pasture.  Emissions of greenhouse gases need to be analyzed in the context of productivity (e.g., milk production) as well as profitability because farmers are unlikely to implement reduction practices that reduce their profit.  Based on this analysis, the practices that resulted in the least greenhouse gas emissions were not always the most profitable, although a full economic analysis was out of the scope of this dissertation.  All of these analyses were performed assuming no legislation regulating greenhouse gas emissions; future regulations restricting emissions would change the analysis by affecting the profitability of the scenarios.\n\nThis research has identified management scenarios that result in environmental benefits and, in some cases, increased profitability.  However, social factors and resistance to new practice will also influence whether the identified scenarios will actually be implemented.  As a result, the identified scenarios must also be considered in the context of society and farm traditions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1493], "author_name_tesi": "Sedorovich, Dawn ", "last_name_ssi": "Sedorovich", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dawn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clarence Alan Rotz", "Thomas Lehman Richard", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Paul Heinz Heinemann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clarence Alan Rotz, Committee Chair", "Thomas Lehman Richard, Committee Chair", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member", "Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["simulation", "agriculture", "greenhouse gas", "climate change"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Using Narrative-based design scaffolds within a mobile learning environment to support learning outdoors with young children", "id": "26776", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11906", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     This study aims to advance learning outdoors with mobile devices.

Smallpox is caused by variola virus (VARV) a pathogen that is responsible for causing approximately 300 \u2013 500 million deaths. Following a successful vaccination campaign, smallpox was eradicated and the last human case was reported in the late 1970s. Consequently, smallpox vaccinations were discontinued as per the recommendation of the World Health Organization. VARV stocks are currently secured in repositories at the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA, USA) and Vector Institute (Koltsovo, Russia). However, there is considerable fear that clandestine stocks of VARV are being held by terrorist groups or other rogue nations and that these groups may release the virus into the human population as a bio-weapon. In addition, an increasing number of humans have been infected with a related poxvirus known as monkeypox, which could also be engineered into a bio-weapon. Consequently, there has been renewed interest on how the immune system responds to poxviruses. Since we cannot investigate the host-pathogen interactions in humans due to obvious ethical issues, animal models have proved to be very useful. We investigate immune responses to Ectromelia virus (ECTV), which is a poxvirus that causes mousepox. Mice infected with ECTV present similar symptoms as smallpox. \nDuring the induction of an immune response against viral pathogens, macrophages, dendritic cells (DC) and natural killer (NK) cells are the first responders that function to inhibit dissemination of viruses from the site of infection. NK cells target virus-infected cells for lysis, while macrophages and DC produce type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines that stimulate other immune cells and induce an anti-viral state. In addition, macrophages and DC activate the adaptive immune system by presenting virus antigen to na\u00efve CD8+ T cells (TCD8+), which upon activation, proliferate and differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes that kill virus-infected cells. B cells also play a role in the production of antibodies that neutralize extracellular virus or that induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Interestingly, individual depletion of macrophages, NK cells, TCD8+, B cells, type I IFN, IL-6, TNF\u03b1 caused mice to succumb to mousepox infection, suggesting that these cells and cytokines are all required for immune responses against ECTV. Notably, no study had depleted DC from mice and therefore their role in vivo in response to ECTV had never been investigated. Additionally, the cell types that are responsible for the production of these cytokines needs further elucidation, with the likely candidates being macrophages and DC. Since TCD8+ are required for immune responses to ECTV, we hypothesized that professional antigen presenting cells (pAPC) play an important role in the stimulation of naive TCD8+. \nIn this dissertation, we demonstrate for the first time that depletion of DC causes mice to succumb to ECTV infection. We found that DC played a major role in the production of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines at early time points post infection and subsequently stimulated na\u00efve TCD8+ via direct and cross-priming pathways. Since DC can be classified into three major subsets, we determined their role in anti-ECTV immune responses. We found that plasmacytoid DC (pDC), CD8\u03b1+ DC and CD11b+ DC were all susceptible to ECTV infection and responded to infection in complementary ways. CD11b+ DC required a lack of virus replication for cytokine production, while both pDC and CD8\u03b1+ DC produced type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to replication-competent ECTV. Additionally, pDC and CD11b+ DC were able to stimulate anti-ECTV TCD8+ via direct-priming, whereas CD8\u03b1+ DC stimulated TCD8+ via both direct and cross-priming pathways. Macrophages did not play a role in the early production of inflammatory cytokines, but were shown to produce type I IFN at later times post infection. ECTV-infected macrophages and B cells presented antigen on MHC class I and stimulated naive TCD8+ via the direct presentation pathway.\nAltogether, our findings have implications in poxvirus research as they demonstrate that DC are critical for immune responses in vivo. DC play major roles in the rapid production of inflammatory cytokines and in the activation naive TCD8+ by utilizing both direct and cross presentation pathways. Macrophages and B cells also contribute in the elimination of virus-infected cells by directly presenting antigen to na\u00efve TCD8+. Therefore, by targeting vaccine antigen to pAPC, it would allow for the induction of antiviral immune responses against poxviruses.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7563], "author_name_tesi": "Sei, Janet Jepchirchir", "last_name_ssi": "Sei", "middle_name_ssi": "Jepchirchir", "first_name_ssi": "Janet", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Charles Norbury", "Christopher Charles Norbury", "Mary Ellen Truckenmiller", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang", "Neil David Christensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Charles Norbury, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Charles Norbury, Committee Chair", "Mary Ellen Truckenmiller, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dendritic Cell Subsets", "MHC class I Antigen Presentation", "Interferon Alpha", "Pro-inflammatory cytokines", "Ectromelia virus."]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "How Second Language Learners Process Argument Structure: The Effects of First Language and Individual Differences", "id": "15139", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7521", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research suggests that adult second language learners have difficulty processing certain argument structures in their L2.

The present dissertation aimed to determine the factors involved in how L2 learners process Spanish structures with preverbal object clitics and postverbal subjects. I considered three areas that possibly contribute: (1) the characteristics of the L1 (i.e. transfer), (2) the proficiency of the learners (previous studies typically tested only low proficiency learners), and (3) individual differences in cognitive abilities such as working memory capacity (WMC) and inhibitory control/executive attention.\n\nTesting (1), I compared the performance of L1 English speakers to L1 speakers of a language that is typologically like Spanish, Romanian, on two sentence processing tasks (one listening and one reading) in Spanish.

Testing (3), each participant performed the Letter-Number Sequencing test of working memory (Wechsler, 1997) and the Flanker Task, which assesses executive attentional abilities (Luk,\n2008). In all, 71 L1 Romanian and 65 L1 English L2 Spanish learners and 36 L1 Spanish monolingual controls participated in the two sentence processing experiments. \n\nWith the use of logistic regression with mixed-effects models, I was able to include both discrete (e.g. first language) and continuous (e.g. proficiency level) variables, include all trials and participants with missing trials, and thus, provide a more accurate picture than other more traditional methods (see Jaeger, 2008 for discussion) of the relative contributions of these factors on learners\u2019 L2 processing of this challenging structure. Specifically, I found main effects on accuracy for proficiency and condition in both tasks, indicating the strength of the role of these two factors, the importance of testing different proficiency levels, and the difficulty of the clitic structures for all L2 learners. Additionally, there was a main effect for L1 in the listening task, but not in the reading task, and a main effect for working memory in the reading task, but not in the listening task. These results suggest that the two modalities place differing demands on the participant, and that neither L1 nor working memory play a strong determining role in successful processing of the present structure. In addition, there were significant interactions between proficiency and condition in both tasks, such that the more proficient L2 learners were more accurate on the OVS condition, and between working memory and condition, such that the L2 learners with higher WMC were less accurate on the OVS condition, a vexing result that requires further research. Most provocative was the result that there was no interaction between L1 and condition, indicating that although the L1 Romanians were more accurate than the L1 English participants on the sentence processing tasks on the whole, this improved accuracy was not specific to clitic structures.

As a JA mimic coronatine could interfere with defense signaling during Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (P.s. pv tomato) infection.  We investigated possible effects of coronatine on defense signaling by measuring Salicylic Acid (SA), Jasmonic Acid (JA), and auxin (IAA) concentrations in Columbia wildtype (Col WT) Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) plants infected with virulent P.s. pv tomato DC3000; and mutant bacterial strains DC3000 AK87 and DC3000 DS29, which are incapable of synthesizing coronatine (COR-) or either of its subunits, coronafacic or coronamic acid.  Similarly, hormone concentrations were measured in Col WT and coronatine insensitive (coi1) mutant Arabidopsis plants infected with WT DC3000 bacteria.  Hormone measurements were conducted simultaneously with gas chromatography and subsequent detection with mass spectrometry (GC-MS).  Bacterial growth and decreasing leaf weight as a measure of disease progression at all sampling time points were also monitored.\n\nFrom the inoculation with COR- DC3000 bacteria I conclude that coronatine suppresses SA concentration increases, augments IAA concentration increases, and has no effect on JA concentration increases at later phases of infection.  From the inoculation of coi1 and Col WT plants with WT DC3000 bacteria I conclude that coronatine is not a JA mimic.  Coronatine suppresses SA concentration increases at least in part independently of functional COI1 because SA concentration increases during infection with COR- DC3000 strains were significantly larger than in coi1 mutants at the later time point measured in the infection.  Furthermore IAA concentration increases are not affected by COI1 signaling.  Therefore the augmenting effect of coronatine on IAA accumulation must happen in a COI1-signaling independent manner.\n\nWhile the interaction of SA and JA is well documented and studied, the role of IAA in defense responses has not received a lot of attention.  Knowing the origin of IAA concentration increases opens avenues to address the role and regulation during pathogen infection.  Therefore I investigated the origin of auxin during P.s. pv tomato infection.  I tested whether IAA concentration increases are due to synthesis from tryptophan via the action of CYP79B2/B3, hydrolysis from IAA-amido conjugates or transport into inoculated leaves.  IAA was at least in part newly synthesized via the action of CYP79B2 and/or CYP79B3; the contribution of hydrolysis from IAA-amido conjugates was inconclusive; and transport did not play a role in the accumulation of IAA.  Disease progression in the cyp79b2/b3 double mutants was altered, JA accumulation was significantly reduced, while SA accumulation was unaltered.  These findings suggest that IAA accumulation affects JA accumulation.  The cyp79b2/b3 double mutant should allow studying further the role of IAA on symptom development and pathogen growth.\n\nThe third section of this thesis is a theoretical treatise about the validity of real-ime PCR quantification methods commonly used.  The implicit and explicit assumptions of the standard curve model and two models using exponential or logistic functions to describe the progression of individual reactions were analysed, and tested whether they calculate relative differences between template concentrations accurately.  I developed an Excel Workbook-based method, which allows determining semi-automatically the range of exponential amplification in individual real-time PCRs.  I concluded that when high accuracy is necessary the standard curve method is still the method of choice to determine relative template concentrations.  Conditions under which the shortcomings of the considered methods become most pronounced are discussed.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2422], "author_name_tesi": "Seidl-Adams, Irmgard Helga", "last_name_ssi": "Seidl-Adams", "middle_name_ssi": "Helga", "first_name_ssi": "Irmgard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Charles Schultz", "John Edward Carlson", "Hong Ma", "Simon Gilroy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Charles Schultz, Committee Chair", "John Edward Carlson, Committee Member", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Simon Gilroy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato", "Salicylic acid", "Jasmonic acid", "auxin", "coronatine", "CYP79B2B3", "defense signaling"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Simplified Numerical Bridge Model Subject to Blast Loads", "id": "22107", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8183", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Damage to a pier column will take a bridge out-of-service, or worse, lead to a complete bridge failure. Besides the importance of civilian safety, maintaining bridge serviceability is imperative to civilian and military transport, while discontinuous transportation networks have rippling effects on economy and community.  With the increase of blast attacks on transportation networks and structures, researchers and design engineers are seeking understanding of the behavior of transportation structures subject to blast loading.\nIncreased numerical modeling capabilities allow researchers to consider material, structural, and load effects on structure response at limited expense.  However, researchers must carefully consider modeling parameters to appropriately represent the nonlinear material and geometric behavior inherent to a blast event.  Numerical model simulations vary vastly in complexity and are handicapped by programming assumptions. A balance of numerical model fidelity, simulation behavior accuracy and general applicability must be found to develop design criterion for blast loads on bridge components. \nThis study considers the effects of four modeling parameters: aspect ratio, boundary conditions, longitudinal reinforcement ratio and standoff distance in a simplified and a complex numerical simulation.  The simplified model considers several discrete mass elements connected by linear elements to model the subject column, whereas the complex model considers continuum elements, material models accounting for degradation and failure, and a built-in blast load application software.  The scope of the project was to evaluate the performance of the simplified model considering the complex model as the baseline for comparison.  It is believed that the differences in load application, material behavior, and stiffness have the largest impact on the simplified model.  Implementation of the load application and stiffness must be carefully considered in the development of a simplified model.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8116], "author_name_tesi": "Seifert, Corinne Meredith", "last_name_ssi": "Seifert", "middle_name_ssi": "Meredith", "first_name_ssi": "Corinne", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey A Laman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey A Laman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bridge", "Column", "Blast", "Numerical", "Model"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Effectiveness of Ailanthus altissima as a bioindicator of ozone pollution", "id": "15204", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7661", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ground-level ozone is one of the most significant air pollutants in the US; it is harmful to human health, vegetation, and ecosystems.

These MSTIDs have been identified and associated with various other phenomena such as plasma depletion bands, plasma bubbles, ionospheric slabs, and thermospheric waves. Using a combination of instruments to simultaneously observe these MSTIDs proves to be useful. In particular, allsky images provide the horizontal information complement to the narrow-beam Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) vertical and (nearly vertical) azimuth-scanned profiles.\n \nA new description of the 3D geometry of these structures is presented. This model-based description results from using a specific observational technique that is based on combined or fused ISR and allsky imager observations that define the horizontal and vertical features of night-time F-region MSTID structures over the Arecibo Observatory (AO) in Puerto Rico. This is the first application of the azimuth-scanning radar data combined with the imager data to develop the picture of the electrodynamic structures in the ionosphere. In particular, by using the azimuth-scanning ISR data and allsky images together, this research has shown for the first time that the southern part of an MSTID band reaches higher altitudes than its northern part implying that the MSTID bands are vertically tilted towards but not aligned with the orientation of the geomagnetic field lines. To confirm and further investigate these findings on the 3D structure of MSTID bands, a simple empirical 3D model of night-time MSTID bands is constructed. This empirical model is intended to show the bubble shape of MSTID bands in 3D and to replicate both the azimuth-scanning ISR and the allsky imager observations. \n\nFurthermore, the model is especially useful in explaining how these complex structures appear in azimuth-scanning ISR data. In particular, the causes of various complex features seen in the azimuth-scanning ISR data, such as the packets of thinner spikes, mirror-spikes, and high-altitude striations, are easily explained using the model. For example, it was found that MSTID bands are both uplifts and depletions and that the high-altitude striations seen in the azimuth-scanning ISR data can be caused either by the MSTIDs or the midnight collapse. Also, ISR and allsky imager results derived from the model are compared with the actual observations to confirm that the model is valid and to better understand various properties of MSTIDs. \n\nThe results of the empirical model provide clues on what to expect from the theoretical models of geomagnetically quiet, nighttime, mid-latitude, F-region electrodynamics. Finally, the technique described here is not limited to F-region or mid-latitudes only. It can be applied to any other ionospheric phenomenon which can be observed by both radar and imager.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2442], "author_name_tesi": "Seker, Ilgin ", "last_name_ssi": "Seker", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ilgin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John David Mathews", "John David Mathews", "C Russell Philbrick", "Julio Urbina", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John David Mathews, Dissertation Advisor", "John David Mathews, Committee Chair", "C Russell Philbrick, Committee Member", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["F-region", "ionosphere", "instabilities", "irregularities", "plasma depletion", "mid-latitude", "allsky imager", "radar", "ISR", "MSTID", "model", "Arecibo Observatory"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Applications of Asymmetric Nanotextured Parylene Surface Using its Wetting and Transport Properties", "id": "19896", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9575", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, basic digital fluidics devices were introduced using polymeric nanorods (nano-PPX) inspired from nature. Natural inspiration ignited this research by observing butterfly wings, water strider legs, rye grass leaves, and their asymmetric functions. Nano-PPX rods, manufactured by an oblique angle polymerization (OAP) method, are asymmetrically aligned structures that have unidirectional wetting properties. Nano-PPX demonstrates similar functions to the directional textured surfaces of animals and plants in terms of wetting, adhesion, and transport. The water pin-release mechanism on the asymmetric nano-PPX surface with adhesion function provides a great transport property. How the asymmetry causes transport is discussed in terms of hysteresis and interface contact of water droplets. In this study, the transport property of nano-PPX rods is used to guide droplets as well as transporting cargo such as microgels. With the addition of tracks on the nano-PPX rods, the surfaces were transformed into basic digital fluidics devices. The track-assisted nano-PPX has been employed to applications (i.e. sorting, mixing, and carrying cargo particles). Thus, digital fluidics devices fabricated on nano-PPX surface is a promising pathway to assemble microgels in the field of bioengineering. \n\tThe characterization of the nano textured surface was completed using methods such as Scanning Electron Microscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, Contact Angle Goniometry, and Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy. These methods helped to understand the physical and chemical properties of nano-PPX. Parameters such as advancing and receding contact angles, nanorod tilt angle, and critical drop volumes were utilized to investigate the anisotropic wetting properties of nano-PPX surface. This investigation explained the directional wetting behavior of the surface as well as approaching new design parameters for adjusting surface properties. The nanorod tilt angle was a key parameter, thus changing the angle provided the surface with essential wetting properties. This adjustment on the nano-PPX surface exhibited excellent control on water droplet transport as well as guided the droplets from desired points to targets. The results demonstrated that it is possible to create railroad-like paths to manipulate the droplet movements by deforming the nano-PPX surface. Controlling physical properties of the surface granted the inspiration for fabricating basic fluidic devices to sort and mix droplets. These devices are promising for assembly purposes in terms of using microgels in engineering applications (i.e. building blocks for bioengineering).

A unique feature of p1 is the allelic diversity; over 100 natural alleles and epialleles have been reported most of which produce distinct tissue-specific pigmentation patterns. Alleles of p1 are classified based on pigmentation accumulation patterns of pericarp and cob glumes; P1-rr conditions red pericarp and red cob, whereas P1-wr specifies white pericarp and red cob phenotype. Diverse tissue-specific patterns displayed by p1 alleles have been attributed to their gene structure, copy number, and epigenetic mechanisms. To elucidate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in p1 allelic diversity, we have previously characterized Unstable factor for orange1 (Ufo1), a dominant modifier that disrupts the tissue-specific patterns of P1-wr, a multicopy allele hypermethylated allele of p1. P1-wr; Ufo1 plants exhibit ectopic accumulation of phlobaphenes in pericarp and other organs, and such gain of pigmentation is associated with decreased DNA methylation at p1. Furthermore, Ufo1 shows incomplete penetrance and expressivity; only a subset of P1-wr Ufo1 plants show gain of pigmentation and the heritability of pigmentation phenotype is poor. In the current study, we show that Ufo1 induces progressive hypomethylation of the P1-wr repeat complex, leading to enhanced penetrance and expressivity of the gain of pigmentation phenotype. We have also characterized P1-wr*, a hypermethylated epiallele of P1-wr, which is highly silenced and shows a white pericarp and white cob phenotype. Surprisingly, Ufo1 reactivates P1-wr* in a tissue-specific manner such that the cobs become pigmented while the pericarps remain colorless. Using extensive Southern blot analysis and genomic bisulfite sequencing, we show that cob pigmentation in P1-wr is affected by DNA methylation of a 168 bp region in the second intron. Interestingly, P1-wr*; Ufo1 plants did not show any methylation change in a distal enhancer region that has previously been implicated in Ufo1-induced gain of pericarp pigmentation of the P1-wr allele. These results suggest that distinct regulatory sequences in the P1-wr promoter and intron regions can undergo independent epigenetic modifications to generate tissue-specific expression patterns. Furthermore, results from genomic bisulfite sequencing revealed that loss of DNA methylation in P1-wr and P1-wr* was observed in CG, CNG, and CHH contexts. Since maintenance of CG and non-CG methylation is under distinct enzymatic control, this result indicates that Ufo1 factors lies upstream of DNA methylation. To test if Ufo1 is also involved in other epigenetic phenomena, we tested its role in paramutation at the p1 locus. We studied interaction of Ufo1 with two suppressed, hypermethylated epialleles of P1-rr which differ in their paramutagenic ability: P1-rr\u2019 is paramutagenic and it heritably silences a functional P1-rr in trans while P1-prTP is a non-paramutagenic (neutral) allele. We show that Ufo1 interacts with, and reactivates both the suppressed alleles and that such reactivation is associated with DNA hypomethylation. This study indicates that DNA methylation is a shared mechanism between paramutation and epigenetic silencing, and that ufo1 is a common factor that seems to regulate these distinct epigenetic mechanisms.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5325], "author_name_tesi": "Sekhon, Rajandeep Singh", "last_name_ssi": "Sekhon", "middle_name_ssi": "Singh", "first_name_ssi": "Rajandeep", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Surinder Chopra", "David M Braun", "Majid R Foolad", "Timothy W Mcnellis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Surinder Chopra, Committee Chair", "David M Braun, Committee Member", "Majid R Foolad, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tandem repeat", "DNA methylation", "Epigenetics", "Gene regulation", "Maize", "Epiallele"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Relationships Between Perceptions Of Organizational Culture and Organizational Commitment Among College And University Counselors And Advisors Who Provide Educational Support To At-risk Students", "id": "23722", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10418", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this research was to investigate the relationship between perceptions of organizational culture and affective, continuance, and normative commitment among counselors and related administrators in higher education Comprehensive Support programs for at-risk students. The population under consideration was from colleges and universities primarily in the western United States (California) and the eastern United States (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania). Organizational Commitment has been a popular area of research for the past twenty-five to thirty years. In general, researchers have determined that a high level of organizational commitment contributed to behavior favorable to organizational effectiveness. Organizational commitment has been conceptualized and measured in a wide variety of ways.  This research utilized Meyer, Allen, and Smith\u2019s (1993) scales to measure three components of organizational commitment. According to Meyer and Allen (1991), organizational commitment consists of three basic themes: affective, continuance, and normative commitment. They defined affective commitment as an emotional attachment to the organization; continuance commitment as the perceived cost of leaving the organization; and normative commitment as a sense of loyalty or moral obligation to remain with the organization. Organizational culture was measured utilizing an instrument developed by Kalliath, Bluedorn and Strube (1999). The primary basis for their instrument was the Competing Values Framework, which was initially developed to measure organizational effectiveness but was later considered a viable instrument for analyzing various aspects of and levels in organizations, including organizational culture. Associated with the framework are labels that provide characteristics of four types of organizational culture. This study chose the labels so designated by Cameron and Quinn (1999, 2006): clan, adhocracy, hierarchy, and market. Briefly, they described the clan culture as consisting of collaboration, similar to a family unit; in the adhocracy culture, flexibility is a characteristic; the hierarchy culture is a structured environment with rules and regulations; and the market culture focuses on a strong presence in a competitive environment. Variables also included characteristics of the academic administrators such as age, gender, education level, experience in current role, and ethnicity. Educators at the community college, college, and university levels were selected. Three hundred and thirteen program directors were sent e-mails requesting their program participation in this study; ninety-six returned usable surveys. This study used a correlational research design and the data were analyzed using a hierarchical regression analysis. The data offered significant results for both affective and normative commitment. For affective commitment, the merging of culture and the demographic variables indicated that clan culture was a strong predictor of affective commitment. For normative commitment, the merging of culture and the demographic variables with normative commitment led culture\u2014again, particularly clan culture\u2014to emerge as a strong predictor of normative commitment.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10081], "author_name_tesi": "Selden, Shenetta Jean", "last_name_ssi": "Selden", "middle_name_ssi": "Jean", "first_name_ssi": "Shenetta", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counselor Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jerry G Trusty", "Catharina Johanna Cunning", "Robert M Hendrickson", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Richard Hazler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jerry G Trusty, Committee Chair", "Catharina Johanna Cunning, Committee Member", "Robert M Hendrickson, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Richard Hazler, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Organizational culture", "higher education", "counselors", "advisors", "at-risk students", "organizational commitment"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Microbial electrolysis cells: hydrogen production from glycerol and alternative cathode materials\n\n", "id": "10425", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4850", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) are promising systems for producing sustainable energy while treating organic waste. MECs contain exoelectrogenic bacteria that produce hydrogen from organic matter via electrohydrogenesis. Glycerol is a low cost commodity, major byproduct of biodiesel production and a potential source of organic matter for MECs. Glycerol was used for hydrogen production via anaerobic fermentation or electrohydrogenesis. MECs have to be affordable to be commercialized. Low cost transition metals were evaluated as alternatives to platinum catalysts for use in MEC cathodes.\nHydrogen was produced at 0.28 mol-H2/mol-glycerol from glycerol fermentation while 1.06 mol-H2/mol-glucose (0.53 mol-H2/mol-3C) was obtained from glucose fermentation. The main product of glycerol fermentation was 1,3-propanediol which adversely affects H2 gas yields. Higher hydrogen yields were achieved using MECs from glycerol (3.9 mol-H2/mol-glycerol) with efficiencies similar to those achieved with glucose (7.2 mol-H2/mol-glucose or 3.6 mol-H2/mol-3C, Eap=0.9V). 1,3-propanediol was produced in MEC but subsequently consumed, achieving better substrate utilization than fermentation. Hydrogen production from the glycerol byproduct from biodiesel was higher via electrohydrogenesis (1.8 mol-H2/mol-glycerol) than fermentation (0.31 mol-H2/mol-glycerol), but lower than pure glycerol due to the presence of methanol and soaps.\nStainless steel and nickel alloys were compared to platinum sheet metal for use as cathodes in MECs. SS A286 was superior to platinum in cathodic and energy recovery, and hydrogen production rate (1.5 m3/m3d SSA286, 0.68 m3/m3d Pt, Eap=0.9V). Performance was further increased by nickel oxide electrodeposition. Smaller particles reduce total mass of the material and material costs. Commercially available nickel and stainless steel powders were applied to cathodes and compared to typical Pt cathodes (0.002 \u00b5m). Cathodes made with Ni (0.5-1 \u00b5m) had similar Coulombic efficiencies, cathodic, hydrogen and energy recoveries in MECs compared to Pt-cathodes but slightly lower hydrogen production rates (1.2-1.3 m3/m3/d Ni; 1.6 m3/m3/d Pt, Eap=0.6V). Avoiding exposure of the Ni catalyst to air minimized Ni dissolution. Analysis of the anodic biofilms showed that G.sulfurreducens and P.propionicus were the most abundant bacteria. Non-precious metals can therefore achieve higher hydrogen production rates than those obtained with platinum and can be used in MEC cathodes allowing large scale production. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4826], "author_name_tesi": "Selembo, Priscilla A", "last_name_ssi": "Selembo", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Priscilla", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Joseph Manuel Perez Sr.", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "Wallis A Lloyd", "Douglas D Archibald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Manuel Perez Sr., Committee Chair", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Chair", "Wallis A Lloyd, Committee Member", "Douglas D Archibald, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metal catalyst", "electrohydrogenesis", "fermentation", "hydrogen production", "microbial electrolysis cells", "MEC", "glycerol"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Part 1.

This diradical cyclization produced thiophene dioxide intermediates, which underwent formal [1,7]-hydride shifts to the more thermodynamically stable naphthalene derivatives in preference to the desired intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction with a tethered alkyne.  \nLomaiviticins A and B have caught the attention of the synthesis community since their isolation in 2001 due to their interesting structural features coupled with promising anticancer activity.

The method presented utilizes range-frequency intensity striations, arising from multi-path interference in shallow water waveguides and measured across a horizontal line array, to estimate range between a source and a receiver array. This method is based upon the premise that the effects of waveguide geometry on multi-path interference may be represented by a single parameter, \u03b2, called the waveguide invariant, which relates striation slope to source range.\nMuch of the literature on striation-based passive range estimation is focused on range-independent environments or relies on the assumption that \u03b2\u22481 in shallow water waveguides in order to eliminate the requirement of knowing the specific values of propagation parameters a priori. However, prior work has shown that range-dependent effects from bathymetry or sound speed profiles can cause the value of \u03b2 to vary widely from its canonical shallow water value and introduce significant bias to range estimates. This work specifically focuses on the effects of range-dependent bathymetry in shallow water waveguides and discusses issues surrounding normal mode propagation and mode coupling. \nBeyond discussing range-dependent modal propagation, several signal, array, and image processing techniques are presented, which enable estimation of range-frequency intensity images from acoustic data and permit the images to be characterized in terms of striation angle and slope distributions. Using these techniques, a method for estimating range from striation patterns is developed and applied to simulated striation patterns and acoustic data from the CALOPS-07 experiment. To improve range estimates obtained from the application of this method, an analytical formulation of a waveguide invariant distribution is derived, which takes into account range-dependent propagation parameters using an assumption of adiabatic propagation. This generalized waveguide invariant distribution provides a more accurate estimate of \u03b2 for use in the range estimation algorithm. \nThe results of applying the improved range estimation method to simulated and real data are compared, and practical issues of applying this method to acoustic data, including potential performance limitations, such as signal to noise ratio and effective array aperture, are also discussed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9846], "author_name_tesi": "Sell, Alexander Wetherington", "last_name_ssi": "Sell", "middle_name_ssi": "Wetherington", "first_name_ssi": "Alexander", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Lee Culver", "Richard Lee Culver", "Anthony P Lyons", "Thomas B Gabrielson", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Lee Culver, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Lee Culver, Committee Chair", "Anthony P Lyons, Committee Member", "Thomas B Gabrielson, Committee Member", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["waveguide invariant", "passive range estimation", "shallow water acoustics", "ship-radiated noise"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Pollination-induced inhibition of maize silk elongation", "id": "7353", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4741", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In response to pollination maize silks undergo an accelerated process of senescence that includes an inhibition of elongation.  The inhibition of silk elongation became apparent beyond 12 h after pollination.  However, the possibility that the reduction in elongation begins earlier than this can not be ruled out.  Treatment with dead pollen indicated that the silk growth response requires interaction with viable pollen.  Moreover, pollination of some silks on an ear did not have a long distance systemic effect on the elongation of un-pollinated silks on the same ear at 32 h post-pollination.  Endogenous expansin activity, as evaluated by acid-induced extension and wall stress relaxation was not significantly reduced after pollination.  Immunoblot analyses indicated that the abundance of either &#945;- or &#946;-expansin protein was not considerably decreased in response to pollination.  In addition, extractable &#945;-expansin activity was similar in control and pollinated silk walls.  These findings suggest that the mechanism of pollination-induced inhibition of silk elongation is largely independent of changes in expansin abundance or activity.  On the other hand, pollinated silk walls were less susceptible to extension by pollen &#946;-expansin.  Additionally, stress/strain analysis indicated a significant reduction in the wall plastic extensibility 6 h post-pollination.  This reduction in the plastic extensibility only occurred after pollen tubes have traversed through a given region of silk.  Numerous pollen tubes were initiated at the silk tip.  This number gradually declined along the length of the silk and only 1-2 reached the ovary even after 24 h.      Based on the timing of the reduction in wall extensibility and the slowing of silk elongation, these two phenomena may be causally related.  In addition, it is possible that reduced wall extensibility is a mechanism to control the number of pollen tubes reaching the ovary.  Finally, compared to controls, pollinated silk walls had more carboxylic acid groups and phenolic substances.  Wall polymer cross-linking by the coupling of feruloyl groups attached to glucuronoarabinoxylan or the ionic bridging of carboxylic acid groups in pectin may be the basis of the reduction in wall extensibility.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4706], "author_name_tesi": "Sella Kapu, Nuwan Umantha", "last_name_ssi": "Sella Kapu", "middle_name_ssi": "Umantha", "first_name_ssi": "Nuwan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel J Cosgrove", "Teh Hui Kao", "Andrew George Stephenson", "David M Braun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel J Cosgrove, Committee Chair", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Member", "David M Braun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["maize silk", "pollination", "expansin", "cell wall"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Beauvoir's Moral Period Philosophy\n", "id": "11963", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1575", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation is about Simone de Beauvoir's moral period works, a series of works she wrote in the mid-1940's, including Pyrrhus and Cineas and The Ethics of Ambiguity, in which she tries to develop a workable version of existentialist ethics.  I argue that Beauvoir's moral period works exhibit a complex relation to the tradition of ethical philosophy beginning with Kant and continuing through Hegel.  On the one hand, Beauvoir, like Kant and Hegel, builds her ethics around the freedom and autonomy of the self, which in turn grounds the dignity of the self, and its demands for respect and recognition.  On the other hand, Beauvoir rejects Kantian and Hegelian metaphysics in favor of phenomenology, and this has consequences for her ethics.  For Beauvoir, we need to realize the ideals of dignity, respect, and recognition through action in the concrete world of particular and situated human beings.  This position creates a tension in her work.  Because people are heterogeneous, it is impossible to act for some without simultaneously acting against others, so that the ideal of universal respect and recognition in a kingdom of ends or a community of mutual recognition turns out to be impossible.  Beauvoir responds to this tension by offering a loose set of guidelines to help us navigate the complex ethical dilemmas we face in our everyday lives.  Beauvoir's project, if successful, would preserve the powerful normative ethics of Kant and Hegel, but without the need to accept problematic metaphysical positions such as the noumena/phenomena distinction or the completion of the system.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1559], "author_name_tesi": "Seltzer, David Saul", "last_name_ssi": "Seltzer", "middle_name_ssi": "Saul", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Emily Rolfe Grosholz", "Emily Rolfe Grosholz", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan", "Brady Lee Bowman", "Allan Inlow Stoekl"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Emily Rolfe Grosholz, Dissertation Advisor", "Emily Rolfe Grosholz, Committee Chair", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Committee Member", "Brady Lee Bowman, Committee Member", "Allan Inlow Stoekl, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pyrrhus and Cineas", "ethics", "Existentialism", "Phenomenology", "Hegel", "Kant", "Beauvoir", "The Ethics of Ambiguity", "freedom", "autonomy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Quest For Really Useful Knowledge: An Institutional Ethnography of Community Adult Education in the Digital Age", "id": "13535sas82", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13535", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     The purpose of this institutional ethnography was to explicate the social relations of broadband adoption through the public programs implemented by the Media Mobilizing Project (MMP) between 2009 and 2013, when they operated for the first time in alignment with federal regulations that orchestrated the practice of the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) trans-locally.

It is informed by a long tradition of adult educators who have practiced education as a vehicle for change in politically contested environments, especially within struggles for equity and justice. Data for the study included texts that circulated in print and digital media forms, interviews with MMP paid staff and DC-based consultants who evaluated Philadelphia\u2019s overall BTOP experience, and observations of educational programs in public computer centers.\n     Findings highlight the discovery of two competing forms of accountability that produced a growing bifurcation between the professional service provision spheres associated with accomplishing the grant and movement based spheres that advanced radical organizing and media production.

VE-cadherin breakdown due to endothelium stimulation from tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) for 24 hours resulted in increased gap formation when cultured with Jurkat cells, but not THP-1 cells.

This analysis finds that political motivations appear to be the dominant explanatory factor in administrative evaluations, suggesting that the apolitical quality of such oversight has been vastly overstated.\nThe second empirical chapter examines employee intent to remain employed with the federal government amongst agencies across the federal government, utilizing the Merit Principles Survey. The findings indicate that employees in agencies which have been targeted for political hostility appear to be markedly more likely to remain in their position even after controlling for other factors, suggesting that they may be aware that their departure in the face of hostility would allow politicians whose goals they oppose to remake their organization into something contrary to their vision for it. This stands in contrast to traditional expectations of government employees as interested only in their personal careers.\nOverall, these findings could have implications for transaction authority research, especially in the modern climate where American politicians across both parties discussing reducing or streamlining bureaucracy for nominally non-political concerns of administrative efficiency.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15158], "author_name_tesi": "Semat, Joshua Kenneth", "last_name_ssi": "Semat", "middle_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Lowery", "David Lowery", "Christopher Zorn", "Michael Nelson", "John Gastil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Lowery, Dissertation Advisor", "David Lowery, Committee Chair", "Christopher Zorn, Committee Member", "Michael Nelson, Committee Member", "John Gastil, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bureaucracy", "Congress", "Public Administration", "Oversight", "Public Management"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "STRUCTURAL DAMAGE DETECTION VIA\nNONLINEAR SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION AND \nSTRUCTURAL INTENSITY METHODS\n\n", "id": "9740", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1980", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "During the past decade, the development of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems has attracted considerable interest from several engineering fields. The possibility of monitoring the status (often referred to as \u201chealth\u201d) of a structure under operational conditions could result in a drastic change in the current maintenance approach. The introduction of SHM systems would allow transitioning the maintenance strategy from a scheduled (i.e. Time Based) basis to a Condition Based approach. The development of SHM systems relies on availability of reliable techniques to extract the characteristic features of damage from experimental measurements. The research presented in this dissertation consists of an investigation of two new SHM methodologies. \nThe first technique is based on the use of the Higher order Harmonic Response Signal (HHRS) typical of cracked structures. A theoretical formulation which exploits the nonlinear harmonics in cracked rods is presented. The HHRS provides an effective way to localize nonlinear fatigue cracks without requiring a baseline signal or a finite element model of the healthy structure.  The HHRS method is first evaluated through a series of numerical simulations. The HHRS method is then validated through laboratory experiments specifically designed to induce and measure the nonlinear harmonic response in a one-dimensional cracked rod. Experimental results proved that this technique can achieve high accuracy (error lower than 1%).  Useful guidelines for the selection of a proper sensory system for HHRS measurements are provided. Finally, the HHRS technique is extended to a two-dimensional plate structure. The characteristic dispersive nature of the dynamic response of plates increases the complexity in the post-processing phase. A new feature extraction approach, particularly suitable for dispersive system, is presented. Numerical results proved the theoretical approach and provided guidelines for the selection of an appropriate sensory system for data acquisition.\nThe second technique presented in this work is based on the use of Structural Intensity (SI) as a damage detection tool. Although SI has been used in the past for structural vibrations and noise control systems, applications to damage detection are still very limited.  A numerical study exploring the relationship between several structural (loss factors, damage size) and experimental (frequency resolution, sensor size and placements) parameters and the SI field is presented.  The changes in SI at discrete structural locations are used as the damage metric.  In order to improve performance and adaptability of the SI based system over a wide spectrum of structures, the concept of Active Energy Sink (AES) is introduced.  A feedback control system is used to realize the absorption device. The AES design is presented, and validated through experimental testing. An increase in the closed loop loss factors up to &#951;=29% was measured for the low frequency modes. Finally, the concept of Nonlinear Structural Surface Intensity (NSSI) is presented. The SI-based SHM was initially developed by relying on the availability of a baseline for the healthy structure. In order to develop a baseline-free technique, the HHRS is integrated into the SI concept. This approach results in a single technique which benefits from the localization capabilities from the HHRS approach and of the sizing capabilities proper of the SI approach.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1963], "author_name_tesi": "Semperlotti, Fabio ", "last_name_ssi": "Semperlotti", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fabio", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Smith", "Edward C Smith", "Kon Well Wang", "Stephen Clarke Conlon", "George A Lesieutre", "Martin Wesley Trethewey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Smith, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward C Smith, Committee Chair", "Kon Well Wang, Committee Chair", "Stephen Clarke Conlon, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member", "Martin Wesley Trethewey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Structural Surface Intensity", "Structural Intensity", "model free", "baseline free", "damage localization", "HHRS", "subharmonics", "superharmonics", "higher order harmonics", "Nonlinear Structural Surface Intensity", "Nonlinear Structural Intensity"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Community structure, physiological ecology and succession of deep=sea hydrothermal vent communities of the Lau Basin", "id": "19897", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9465", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hydrothermal vent communities of the Lau Basin display spatio-temporal patterns that are unique among deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Sulfide edifices contain two different types of communities. One type is very similar to the communities found on the surrounding lavas and is dominated by the symbiont-containing mollusks that are prevalent in this region. These mollusk even display similar patterns of spatial distribution on edifice walls that are linked to their different thermo-chemical niches. However, these niches appear to be compressed on edifices and biological interactions likely play an important role in determining distributional patterns of the dominant faunal groups on edifices. The other type of community found on edifices is largely avoided by the symbiont-containing mollusks and is habited by crab, shrimp and polynoid species. Sulfide to temperature ratios of fluids diffusing from edifices were significantly different from diffusing fluids in the southern Lau sites, but not in the northern sites. The nature of the substrate in the southern sites likely accounts for this phenomenon: andesitic lavas found in the south possibly host larger microbial populations which leads to reduced sulfide content in fluids that diffuse out at andesite hosted lava sites. On the scale of 3-4 years, Lau vent communities display a remarkable amount of stability which was unexpected for vents located at a fast spreading center. This stability was observed in all types of sites assessed: edifices, lavas and peripheral sites. The hypothesized model of succession, with Alviniconcha spp. as the pioneering group, I. nautilei a mid-successional species and B. brevior as a later successional species appears to be occurring at Lau vents. Zoanthids showed increases despite recorded cessation of vent activity and likely follow the mussels in the successional sequence in northern, basalt hosted sites. Peripheral communities, which host both vent and non-vent endemic fauna represent an even later stage in the successional sequence, although they can also form in the proximity of sites of active venting as well. Declines in venting were responsible for large scale changes and transitions to\niv\nlater successional stages. The symbiont containing mollusks tracked changes and moved in sync with hydrothermal venting, thereby maintaining themselves in favorable conditions. The spatio-temporal study of Lau vent communities revealed some insights into a number of different faunal groups. Anemones were seen to be immovably fixed over the course of three years, normally slow growing Cladorhizid sponges were seen to grow and die within a three year time period and a novel symbiotic association was observed between polynoid polycheates and anemones.

The premise of the tradeoff is that parents with healthier, better educated children face less uncertainty about the child\u2019s survival probability and success as an adult; hence they are satisfied with lower levels of childbearing which leads to smaller family sizes.  \n\nThe first essay of my dissertation, \u201cManaging Above Replacement Fertility: Simulating Incentives To Trigger The Quantity-Quality Tradeoff\u201d applies the Quantity-Quality model to speed up the demographic transition and investigates incentives for curbing high fertility behavior in developing nations to ease the burden of a rapidly growing population. This static model contributes to the existing research by actually testing the Q-Q hypothesis for various well-known functional forms, such as the Cobb Douglas function, the Leontief function and the Stone Geary function. Using simulations with data from India, I estimate the income and price elasticities for the different forms of household utility to demonstrate the change in fertility and schooling. I also run comparative static exercises to analyze the outcome of policy experiments and test the hypothesis that policy initiatives may not always yield anticipated results; one of the key findings is that simply subsidizing qualitative improvements in children (reducing cost of education alone without other investments in family planning etc.) may be insufficient to trigger the Q-Q tradeoff to curtail above replacement TFR. Reduction in parent\u2019s out-of-pocket childcare costs to increase quality may prompt greater childbearing as children are now cheaper to raise.\n\nThe second essay, \u201cModel Of Childbearing With 2-Sided Altruism: A Calibration Exercise For Developing Countries\u201d incorporates child labor and old age security into the dynamic Quantity-Quality framework of fertility, as revenue earned from children and lack of social safety nets for the elderly are important determinants of fertility behavior. The study extends earlier economic modeling to 3 time periods and 3 generations with bi-directional gifts and bequests and develops a OLG structural model with dynastic households to examine how inter-generational altruism affects the individual decision maker\u2019s choice of fertility and educational investment in their children. I calibrate the parameters to solve for the household decision variables after tracing the consumption, fertility, transfers to elderly, schooling and child labor behavior from 1967 to 2007 and conduct comparative statics exercises to test different policy implements like conditional cash transfers, mid-day meal schemes and fertility reduction subsidies. Empirical estimation results using incidence of child labor as well as old age dependency on monetary transfers from one\u2019s children suggest that increasing child quality may in the long run reduce the demand for quantity as income-earning potential and the probability of survival to adulthood for children increases, this in turn will offset the parent\u2019s propensity to have greater number of children to recompense for future uncertainty.\n\nThe third essay of the dissertation is entitled \u201cRaising Quality May Reduce Quantity: Testing The Tradeoff With Evidence From India\u201d. India is the second most populous country in the world and is currently undergoing its demographic transition with the average number of children per woman gradually declining. However the birth rate is still above replacement level and the current study uses an extension of the traditional Quantity-Quality model of fertility to understand childbearing behavior in the subcontinent. Earlier empirical studies on the Q-Q tradeoff just explore how greater number of children is usually associated with lower levels of child quality but this econometric analysis examines the reverse direction of causality using the nationally representative Demographic Health Survey (NFHS-3) for 2005-06. With number of children ever born as an indicator of fertility preference, I use ordered responses to examine the most important predictors of the target variable and find that parental quality is one of the crucial determinants of child quantity within a household. This indicates that greater investment in quality for a certain generation affects their childbearing choices once they become parental decision makers, so the Q-Q hypothesis can be augmented beyond a single generational perspective that in the long run may lead to smaller family sizes. \n\nMy dissertation research provides a significant contribution to the field of economic and demographic study of fertility behavior. I conduct a static analysis, a dynamic modeling exercise as well as an empirical testing of the Quantity-Quality model with regards to childbearing and the policy implications from the findings will hopefully help motivate further work in this area.

This field of research has been long dominated by ABO3 perovskites. The inversion symmetry in these perovskites are removed by atomic displacements caused by the second order Jahn Teller effect (SOJT). However, there are few SOJT active cations like Ti4+ and Zr4+ with empty 3d and 4d orbitals, and Pb2+ and Bi3+ cations with 6s lone-pair electrons. This confines the selection of chemical species for designing non-centrosymmetric compounds. Also, the most pervasive distortions in ABO3 compounds are the BO6 octahedral rotation and tilting enclosing the B-site cations, which do not break inversion symmetry in these simple perovskites due to the nature of BO6 connectivity.\nThe main motivation of this work is to perform a comprehensive study of new perovskite-base structures in which octahedral rotations and chemical ordering removes inversion symmetry, based on recent predictions. This thesis focuses on n = 1 Ruddlesden-Popper A2[A\u2019n-1BnO2n+1] layered perovskites like NaRTiO4 (R = rare earth), LiRTiO4 and HRTiO4. A combination of tools like density functional theory, synchrotron x-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, second harmonic generation and piezoresponse force microscopy have been used to understand the mechanism by which inversion symmetry is removed in such layered materials.\n\tIt has been established that a-boco/boa-co type of OOR in combination with A-site cation ordering make these compounds noncetrosymmetric (space group: P-421m) at room temperature. Rietveld refinement was used to quantify the degree of OOR. First of all, it has been observed that the OOR occurs due to the under-bonded A-sites. In addition, a clear trend of increasing OOR angle with decreasing rare earth ion size has been observed, which indicates that the coordination environment of the rare earth ions determine the degree of rotation. Temperature dependent SHG measurements have shown that the RP compounds undergo phase transition from low temperature noncentrosymmetric (P-421m) to high temperature centrosymmetric (P4/nmm) phase. As the order parameter (displacement of the rare earth ion) decreases with increasing temperature, it is observed that the SHG signal also monotonically decreases with increasing temperature for the noncentrosymmetric members of the RP families. This also means that the degree of noncentrosymmetry decreases with increasing temperature, culminating into a second order like phase transition at high temperature (Tac) to a P4/nmm phase. The Tac is also observed to be higher for the compounds with smaller rare-earth ions, supporting the fact that smaller rare earth ions lead to larger magnitude of OOR and hence need higher temperature to become centrosymmetric.\n\tOverall, the family of Ruddlesden Popper layered perovskites presents rich properties and phase transitions, which in single crystals could be useful for applications in the field of piezoelectric transducers and actuators.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11832], "author_name_tesi": "Sen Gupta, Arnab ", "last_name_ssi": "Sen Gupta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Arnab", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Venkatraman Gopalan", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Long Qing Chen", "Zhiwen Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Venkatraman Gopalan, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Dissertation Advisor", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Chair", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["noncentrosymmetry", "octahedral rotations", "perovskites", "second harmonic generation"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Effects of Embedded Math-in-CTE Teaching Model on Automotive Youth Education Systems (AYES) Assessment Scores\n", "id": "7362", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "792", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the passage of the No Child Left Behind act of 2001(NCLB), all students need to be proficient on high-stakes standardized testing by the year 2014. However, currently, career and technical education curricula, which lack the rigorous academic standards noted in NLCB, exist in numerous CTE centers nationwide. If standardized tests touted by NCLB emphasize rigorous academic standards, and all students, including CTE students, need to pass these high-stakes tests, how is it possible to provide instruction in order that the CTE student masters both the necessary academics and skill development concurrently? Specifically, this research investigates whether mathematics taught in content areas may enhance rather than detract from skill development for CTE students.\n\tThis study uses data from the National Research Center for Career and Technical Education national study of Math in CTE. The NRC model study had 5 replications with 149 teachers and over 2000 students, and utilized The Pennsylvania State University\u2019s replication, which included 28 teachers and 550 students.

It may be important to note that students who scored well on the AYES end-of-year tests had taken 3 or more math classes previous to taking the AYES test; yet, teaching math concepts of the NRC Model study in the auto technology class did not increase nor decrease scores in three out of the four AYES exit tests, the Steering and Suspension, Electrical/Electronics Systems, and Engine Performance auto tests of students participating in the NRC model and the control group and one test, the Brakes test, yielded a negative relationship for the students who participated in the NRC model study. Furthermore, a strong positive relationship was found between high scores on the math pretest and high post test scores on all four AYES exit tests.\n\tTherefore this concludes that students wanting to enroll in the Automotive Technology curriculum be proficient in mathematics before enrolling. Young students, 15 years of age, and/or students with 0-1 math classes were the ones to do poorly. Also the Brakes test was given to younger students so this could be why the math instruction intervention did not help those students.

The design MWE irrigation rate is usually limited by the capacity of the soil to transmit water and nitrate (NO3-N) concentration in the percolate water. Nitrogen (N)-based irrigation depths (Ln) are often determined from an N mass balance, which requires estimation of the fractional N loss (f) due to atmospheric N losses through denitrification and ammonia (NH3) volatilization. \nDesign f values are often chosen from the 0.15 to 0.25 range for secondary-treated effluents (C:N ratio = 0.9 to1.5) and 0.1 is suggested for tertiary-treated effluents (C:N ratio <0.9).  A temperature-based guideline suggests an f value of 0.2 for \"cold\" climates and 0.25 for \"warm\" climates. However, no scientific investigations have verified these values. Design procedures could be improved if f estimates were replaced by empirically determined values. The overall goal of this research study was, therefore, to quantify f values over the growing season in an effluent-irrigated crop field. The f values were estimated using atmospheric N losses quantified using three approaches: measurements, model simulations, and \u201csource-sink\u201d N mass balances.  \nThe field study was completed in 2011 and 2012 at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) Living Filter (LF) in a tall fescue grass field (8.4 ha) in Central Pennsylvania. The bulk density for the 0 to 12-cm depth of the surface soil horizon is 1.25 g cm-3, and the predominant soil series in the grass field is Hagerstown (fine, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Hapludalf) with loam and clay loam soil in the 0 to 30-cm depth of the surface soil horizon. The field is irrigated with secondary-treated effluent (including biological nitrogen removal) at a rate of 5 cm wk-1. Annual application of effluent N was 220 kg N ha-1 in 2011 and 153 kg N ha-1 in 2012, and on average, the effluent contained 70% and 87% NO3-N in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Supplemental N fertilizer was added as urea-ammonium nitrate (30% N) (122 kg N ha-1 (2011) and 112 kg N ha-1 (2012)). In accordance with the 2006 USEPA design procedures for land treatment of municipal wastewater effluents, change in soil N storage was assumed to be negligible.\nEmissions of NH3 (gas) were measured in the field and laboratory with a photoacoustic field gas monitor immediately after effluent application.  The maximum measured NH3 emission rate of 10-4 kg NH3-N ha-1 h-1 was roughly equivalent to 1 kg N ha-1 yr-1, which was insignificant relative to the effluent N applied during the study period.  Thus, atmospheric N losses were mainly due to denitrification. \nThe f values were estimated based on measured denitrification (fmd), simulated denitrification (fsd) and a monthly N mass balance (fnb). The fmd and fsd were estimated for twelve 7-day irrigation cycles. Denitrification gaseous fluxes (kg N ha-1 h-1) were measured from intact soil cores, collected from the surface soil horizon using 4.8 cm i.d. and 10.2 cm long aluminum cylinders, 6 to 7 h before irrigation (BI) began and 4 to 5 h after irrigation (AI) ceased. The cores were incubated in the laboratory for 6 h. Nitrous oxide concentrations in the core headspace were determined by gas chromatography.  Daily denitrification fluxes were extrapolated from the hourly fluxes and the denitrification N loss per irrigation cycle (y) was estimated with the exponential equation y = ae-bx where x is the number of days after irrigation ceased. The constants a and b were determined using the AI and BI estimated daily denitrification fluxes. \nDenitrification was also simulated using the DeNitrificationDeComposition (DNDC) crop model. The model was parameterized in the site mode for four categories of simulations, namely: LD (DNDC default clay fraction = 0.19 and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) = 0.025 m h-1  for loam soil), CLD (DNDC default clay fraction = 0.4 and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) = 0.009 m h-1  for clay loam soil), LM (measured clay fraction = 0.26 and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) = 0.017 m h-1), and CLM (measured clay fraction = 0.31 and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) = 0.017 m h-1). \nEquation [1] was used to express fnb in terms of the measured and calculated monthly system parameters from April to September. \n\nfnb = (LnCn \u2013 Cp (Ln + Pr \u2013 ETc -R) - 10U)/(LnCn)   \t\t\t\t                                                     [1]\n\nEffluent N was quantified from the irrigation depth (Ln) and effluent total N, Cn (mg L-1).  The N leaching term was calculated from the NO3-N levels (mean of 8 composite samples per month), Cp (mg L-1) in soil water collected from 0.35 m-deep suction cup lysimeters and the monthly water balance (Ln + Pr - ETc - R). Rainfall, Pr (cm), was recorded at the boundary of a non-irrigated field near (< 2 km) the study site. Crop evapotranspiration, ETc (cm) was estimated as a product of the monthly crop factor (Kc) and monthly reference ETo (cm). The Kc factors used were: 0.85 (April), 0.9 (May), 0.92 (June), 0.92 (July), 0.91 (August), and 0.87 (September). The monthly ETo was summed from the daily values calculated using the Penman-Monteith method. Runoff, R (cm), was estimated using the curve number method. The crop removal due to N originating solely from the effluent, U (kg N ha-1), was estimated as the difference between the measured monthly N removals and estimated monthly crop N removal due to fertilizer.

If the difference was greater than the applied effluent N, U in Eq. [1] was assumed to equal effluent N. \nThe denitrification fluxes and f estimates in July and November were likely least affected by UAN-30 fertilizer applications that occurred in April and August in both years. The measured and simulated denitrification fluxes followed similar trends and the AI fluxes were generally greater than the BI fluxes unless rainfall occurred within 2 days of the BI date. The model simulated denitrification in 2012 better than in 2011 and the BI denitrification rates better than the AI rates.  The mean absolute error (MAE) values, for the BI denitrification rates were equal (for all the four simulation types), 0.3 in 2011 and 0.15 in 2012, and were smaller than the MAE values for the AI denitrification rates, which were all 0.98 in 2012 and 5.2 (LD simulations), 5.13 (LM simulations), 4.97 (CLD simulations), and 5.0 (CLM simulations) in 2011. \n\nThe average fsd (LM and CLM simulations)/ fmd values were:  0.03/0.4 (2 to 6 June 2011), 0.01/0.98 (12 to 18 July 2011), 0.08/3.25 (12 to 15 August 2011), 0.16/3.45 (16 to 22 August 2011), 0.02/0.50 (21 to 27 September 2011), 0.01/0.21 (27 September to 3 October), 0.004/1.10 (25 to 31 October 2011), 0.02/0.70 (15 to 21 November 2011), 0.05/0.03 (15 to 21 May 2012), 0.03/0.74 (21 to 25 June 2012), 0.01/0.19 (10 to 16 July 2012), and 0.14/2.87 (7 to 13 August 2012).  The high fmd estimates in August (\u22653) were probably due to UAN-30 fertilizer application and the fmd estimate of 0.7 in November was probably due to lack of plant N removal. The average (n=24) fsd for the LM and CLM simulation for 12 irrigations in both years was 0.05. The fsd estimates were all smaller than the fmd estimates except for the irrigation cycle between 15 and 21 May 2012 when the fsd (0.05) and fmd (0.03) were similar.  The fsd estimates were also smaller than the design f values apart  from August when they were near the lower boundary for design f values for secondary-treated effluent (0.15 - 0.25).  \nThe fnb estimates were 0.13 (April and May 2011), 0.22 (July 2011), 0.09 (August 2011), 0.23 (April 2012), 0.05 (June 2012), 0.13 (July 2012), and 0.72 (September 2012). Negative fnb estimates obtained in June 2011 (-1.35), September 2011 (-0.40), May 2012 (-0.13), and August 2012 (-0.44) were due to the sum of the crop N removal and leaching exceeding the applied effluent N in these months . Apart from September 2012, the fnb values were less than or within the range of the design f values. The fnb values generally decreased with increase in crop N removal.\nThe fmd estimates linearly decreased with the ratio of the BI to AI denitrification rates (R2= 0.69 and R2=0.63 for AI and BI rates that were significantly different and those that were not (\u03b1=0.05)) and the positive fnb estimates were negatively correlated to the logarithm of the monthly crop N removal, with better correlation (R2=0.99) in the warm months (July and August-monthly mean temperature \u2265 200C) than in the cooler months, R2=0.2 (April, May, June, and September-monthly mean temperature < 200C). Also three of the four fnb estimates in July and August were similar to the design f values.  Despite the difficulty and complexity of quantifying atmospheric nitrogen losses from soil both in the field and laboratory, the study results suggests f values in MWE irrigation could be refined especially during months with mean air temperatures of  \u2265 200C.\nIn conclusion, empirically-determined f values contribute to improved nitrogen planning and management in municipal wastewater effluent irrigation systems with crop removal.  At the study site, an f value of 0.2 was deemed appropriate for the month of July and f values in the range of 0 - 0.1 for the months of May and June and 0.1 - 0.2 for August and September. The research study results suggest that for highly nitrified effluents (C:N ratios of <1) smaller f values than those suggested by USEPA could be used for designing municipal wastewater effluent irrigation depths in humid climates.  The small f values, also suggest that the Cp value (see Eqn. 1) of 10 NO3-N mg L-1 (maximum contaminant level for drinking water) commonly used for design purposes should be revised downward.  The small f values are likely due to the addition of nitrification and denitrification treatment processes in the past two decades by many of the wastewater treatment plants in order to comply with the increasing stringent regulations to meet effluent N limits. Thus, more studies to determine empirical f values are needed to refine f values used in designing municipal wastewater effluent irrigation systems with crop removal.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14311], "author_name_tesi": "Sendagi, Stella Maris", "last_name_ssi": "Sendagi", "middle_name_ssi": "Maris", "first_name_ssi": "Stella", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Agricultural wastewater reuse", "water reuse", "nitrogen-based wastewater irrigation rates", "nitrogen balance", "DNDC modeling", "tall fescue hay.", "design nitrogen-based wastewater irrigation rates", "atmospheric nitrogen loss", "wastewater irrigation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Phospholipid Head Groups and Interactions with Transition Metal Ions", "id": "14398ams5827", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14398", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Herein, the biophysical properties of lipid head groups is explored, with a focus on the effects of specific binding of transition metal ions Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+. First, we incorporate high amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) into supported lipid bilayers (SLBs), which has proven historically difficult. Under certain conditions, interesting phase behavior such as domains formed from two-component systems or three-dimensional tubules are observed. Then, binding of Ni2+ and Cu2+ to deprotonated amines in the PE head groups is measured in microfluidic devices by fluorescence quenching. As copper is redox active, the effect of Cu2+-PE on the oxidation of membrane species is explored, which could be important for neurodegenerative diseases. Next, we hypothesized that metal ion complexes with phosphatidylserine (PS) would disrupt domain formation. PS is a negatively charged lipid and has been shown to have tight binding with Cu2+ that does not change the net charge on the membrane, while Zn2+ interacts electrostatically with the phosphate and carboxylate moieties. While binding of Cu2+ seems to have no effect on PS domains, high concentration of Zn2+ appears to stabilize the domains. Another objective of this work was to clarify the mechanism of molecular chemotaxis to direct the motion of bulk lipid vesicles. These results suggest the roles of lipid head groups are diverse and varied, and are compounded by interactions with divalent transition metal ions.

Because of maize\u2019s extensive demand, it is important to improve its nutrient use and biomass yield by elucidating the effect of genetic and environmental perturbations on its metabolism. In this dissertation, a suite of genome-scale metabolic models of maize was developed. This began with a cell-type specific maize leaf model, was followed by models representing specific maize lines, and culminated in a whole-plant model of maize. These models were used to study the effects of varying nitrogen conditions, metabolic variations between maize lines, and the progression of metabolism throughout plant development. Using the maize leaf model, which highlights C4 metabolism by including distinct Bundle Sheath and Mesophyll cells, we compared the metabolic changes from a wild-type nitrogen replete condition to low nitrogen, gln1-3 mutant, and gln1-4 mutant conditions. The leaf model revealed that a much larger metabolic workaround was required due to glutamine synthetase (i.e. gln1-3 and gln1-4) mutants compared to the low nitrogen condition. Line-specific leaf models were developed for 19 genetically distant maize lines, which displayed no clear trend between the genome structure and metabolic variations\u2014indicating that future metabolic models must be tailored to a specific line. Finally, a whole-plant model was developed by creating and combining models specific to the root, stalk, leaf, tassel, and kernel. The whole-plant model was used to examine metabolism, nutrient use, and flow through the vascular tissue throughout plant development and senescence. With this model we found that increased carbon uptake during early growth stages delayed organ senescence, increased root production, and lead to the largest increases in kernel biomass production. These results demonstrate that metabolic models can provide an avenue for examining the metabolic response to a single genetic or environmental change. Based on our understanding of a single variation, we hope to further our understanding of metabolic responses by parsing through complex metabolic changes that result from multiple environmental or genetic adjustments.

Both experimental and computational investigations in the literature suggest that unique Pd-O-Ce surface formations yield highly reactive sites on the catalyst surface. However, structural details and the corresponding reaction mechanisms governing the behavior of such sites are not well understood. As such, this dissertation employs Density Functional Theory (DFT) in tandem with classical ReaxFF modeling to determine the stability and activity of methane activation sites at the Pd/ceria interface. \nThe ReaxFF interaction potential is used to investigate cluster-support interactions at length and time scales inaccessible to quantum methods. In particular, this dissertation develops a hybrid grand canonical Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (GC-MC/MD) approach that is suited to assess oxide formation in regions where the Pd cluster contacts the underlying ceria support. When coupled with DFT, this multi-scale approach demonstrates that Pd atoms incorporated in the fluorite lattice structure of ceria alternate between Pd4+ and Pd2+ oxidation states during operation. In general, Pd4+ states are effective hydrocarbon activation sites, as the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon reduces Pd4+ to its thermodynamically preferred Pd2+ state. Therefore, maximizing the number of transient Pd4+ states under operating conditions is essential for achieving optimal catalytic performance. The multi-scale simulation methodology developed and applied in this dissertation can evaluate the trade-off between stability and activity exhibited by Pd/CeO2, and can be readily extended to other catalytic systems.    \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10979], "author_name_tesi": "Senftle, Thomas Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Senftle", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael John Janik", "Michael John Janik", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr.", "Scott Thomas Milner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael John Janik, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael John Janik, Committee Chair", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Chair", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Member", "Scott Thomas Milner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Catalysis", "DFT", "ReaxFF", "Palladium", "Ceria"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Development of artificial neural networks for steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) recovery method in heavy oil reservoirs", "id": "19189", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9105", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As no alternative energy source has been introduced to efficiently replace fossil fuels yet, the demand for oil and gas is still increasing in the world. Conventional hydrocarbon reservoirs have been depleted rapidly to meet the demand; in doing so, the amount of conventional resources has declined. This has led to the interest of methods to enhance hydrocarbon recovery in unconventional resources such as heavy oil, bitumen and oil shale.\nAs a result of its high viscosity, economic recovery of heavy oil and bitumen is a great challenge. Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is a commercial in-situ recovery technology used to reduce oil viscosity by increasing the temperature of the reservoir to enhance the recovery of heavy oil and bitumen. Two parallel horizontal wells are employed in the SAGD process. The upper horizontal well is employed for continuous steam injection into the reservoir, while the lower horizontal well is used to produce reservoir fluids.\nNumerical simulation of SAGD is a complex task. Instead of struggling with high complex problems, simple models are used to substitute reservoir simulations over a given range of input parameters. Usage of neural-network based proxy models for the solution of non-linear relationships has been increasingly popular in recent years in the oil and gas industry. Artificial neural network (ANN) methodology is used to avoid excessive time consumption of computer simulations. The objective of this study is to develop neural-network based proxy models that can provide instant and reasonably accurate preliminary estimations for SAGD applications.\nThe variables used in this study include reservoir rock/fluid properties, such as reservoir thickness, porosity, horizontal permeability, horizontal-vertical permeability ratio, initial reservoir pressure, reservoir temperature, rock thermal conductivity, initial oil saturation and oil density, together with operational variables including vertical spacing, spacing between the producer and the base of the reservoir, inter-well (well pattern) spacing, sub-cooling temperature, steam quality, well length, maximum injector bottom-hole pressure and minimum producer bottom-hole pressure.\nThe present study aims at developing neural-network based proxies for SAGD recovery method in heavy oil reservoirs. A two-stage approach was used. In stage I, a total of 904 reservoir specific samples have been trained. The forward-looking artificial neural network is used to predict performance indicators such as cumulative oil production, cumulative steam oil ratio and cumulative water production profiles over a period of 10 years for a given set of operational (design) parameters. On the other hand, the inverse-looking artificial neural network is used to predict operational parameters for a given set of desired 10-year cumulative oil production and cumulative steam-oil ratio profiles.\nIn stage II, reservoir properties are varied as well. ANN methodology is extended to a range of homogeneous reservoirs. A total of 1590 samples were generated. This stage provides a forward-looking artificial neural network that predicts performance indicators over a period of 10 years and two inverse-looking artificial neural networks: one that predicts operational parameters and another that predicts reservoir properties.\nCMG CMOST Studio automation tool was used to generate SAGD numerical simulation samples over a given input data range. Numerical simulations were performed using the CMG STARS thermal simulator (version 2011.10). Numerical simulations were utilized to feed the training of the artificial neural network using MATLAB neural network toolbox (version R2011a).\nThe results of this study show that artificial neural networks are able to recognize complex relationships between input data and corresponding output data for SAGD simulations.

MECs, together with microbial fuel cells (MFCs) that directly produce electricity, are speculated to offer an energy-neutral or -positive wastewater treatment technology. In this context, MECs have advantages over MFCs since theoretically there are fewer losses in MEC systems and the hydrogen recovered has wider uses than electricity. However, large-scale implementation of this technology has been delayed due in part to low hydrogen production rates compared to existing hydrogen-production technologies. Reducing the distance between the electrodes in bioelectrochemical systems offers a strategy to increase the current in these systems by reducing the internal resistance.\n\tIn this study, MECs with separator electrode assembly (SEA) and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configurations were used to test the performance of MECs with minimal electrode separation. All MECs were constructed using carbon cloth as the anode and stainless steel (SS) mesh of pore size 60 with Pt coating (0.5 mg/cm2) as the cathode. The electrodes were electrically insulated from each other in the system using 46% cellulose-54% polyester textile separators (SEA MECs) or CMI7000 cation exchange membrane (MEA MECs), with a standard two-chamber MEC having a 2-cm electrode spacing used as a benchmark. The adjacent electrode configurations resulted in higher current densities (187 \u00b1 44 A m-3 for the SEA MECs with 50 mM buffer  and 121 \u00b1 16 A m-3 for the MEA MECs with 100 mM buffer) as compared to the benchmark design (103 \u00b1 7 A m-3 with 100 mM buffer). \n\tA problem of hydrogen recycling was anticipated due to the electrodes being placed close together. The reduced electrode spacing facilitates hydrogen crossover from cathode to anode, which can support current from recycled hydrogen as well as the growth of hydrogen-consuming methanogens, thereby reducing the hydrogen gas recovery. This was observed in the SEA MECs, which had negligible production of hydrogen in later cycles and coulombic efficiencies (CEs) of over 100%, as well as high CH4 production. This problem was operably arrested by using the membrane instead of the textile-type separator in the MECs. However, the use of a membrane resulted in high pH imbalances, which necessitated a higher buffer capacity. Using 100 mM phosphate buffer, cathodic efficiencies of 121 \u00b1 26% and an overall energy efficiency of 92 \u00b1 10% were achieved. The pH imbalance of the MEA MECs was still not fully addressed with this buffer strength, resulting in reduced batch times and residual acetate in the effluent.\n\tThe MECs were further studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to obtain the internal resistances of the MECs. The CV results suggested that the anodic biofilm in both the benchmark and MEA MECs were similar.  EIS results showed that at the operational applied potential of 0.7 V the total internal resistance of the MEA MECs was 25.2 \u00b1 4.0 \u03a9 as compared to 41.4 \u00b1 6.8 \u03a9 for the benchmark MECs. The ohmic resistances were of the order MEA MEC (8.8 \u00b1 4.1 \u03a9, 100 mM buffer) < SEA MECs (9.8 \u00b1 0.0 \u03a9, 50 mM buffer) < benchmark system MECs (25.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u03a9, 100 mM buffer).  Collectively these results show that the SEA and MEA configurations decrease the system ohmic resistance and can yield higher currents than an MEC design with an electrode spacing of 2 cm, but the proximity of cathodic hydrogen production in these alternate designs increases the potential for hydrogen recycling to the anode and losses. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8164], "author_name_tesi": "Sengupta, Arupananda ", "last_name_ssi": "Sengupta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Arupananda", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Regan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["MEC", "separator electrode assembly", "membrane electrode assembly", "EIS", "buffer strength", "internal resistance"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "MULTIAXIAL EXPERIMENTATION ON \nCREEP-FATIGUE-RATCHETING BEHAVIOR OF INCONEL 617\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12129", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4545", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Materials play an important role in human society and find uses in diverse areas like load\u2013bearing structures, semiconductors and biological applications. High-temperature nuclear\u2013power reactors are one of these applications that require novel materials for extreme environments.

Inconel 617 is one of the candidate materials for constructing components of high-temperature reactors. Considerable time and effort must be spent in order to understand the viscoplastic behavior of the material before it can be put into use. Material behavior depends on temperature, loading rate, loading paths and other factors. This thesis presents multiaxial experimental results for Inconel 617 specimens using an axial-torsion test machine. Multiaxial experiments were conducted on Inconel 617 tubular specimens for two non-proportional loading paths, MR1 and MR2, at two different temperatures, 950&#8451; and 850&#8451;, and at two different strain rates, 0.1%/s and 0.04%/s. The MR1 experiment was controlled in steady axial stress and cyclic shear strain. The MR2 experiment was a bow-tie path controlled in cyclic axial stress with holds at maximum and minimum stress and cyclic shear strain. These tests simulated creep-fatigue-ratcheting behavior in Inconel 617. These results will aid in the development of unified constitutive models, so that nuclear components can be designed for longer operational lives. The higher temperature tests led to more plastic strain accumulation and lower stress levels in the specimen. The higher loading rates led to higher stress levels and lower plastic strain for the MR1 experiments. The behavior of Inconel 617 for the MR1 and MR2 loading paths is significantly different. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4513], "author_name_tesi": "Sengupta, Mainak ", "last_name_ssi": "Sengupta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mainak", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Charles E Bakis", "Reginald Felix Hamilton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor", "Charles E Bakis, Thesis Advisor", "Reginald Felix Hamilton, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["creep", "multiaxial experimentation", "fatigue", "ratcheting"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "RADIATIVE IMPACT OF CONTINENTAL STRATUS AT THE SOUTHERN GREAT PLAINS: A CLIMATOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE", "id": "5971", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4539", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A four-year climatology of the radiatively important parameters of warm boundary layer clouds, including cloud liquid water path, cloud base height and normalized cloud forcing, was developed for the Southern Great Plains, Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Cloud and Radiation Testbed, site.

The use of one-dimensional radiative transfer was demonstrated to be appropriate for the study, as the independent column approximation held for the overcast cases.\n\nA cloud liquid water path retrieval using infrared emission measurements was developed, as uncertainties in microwave radiometer retrieved liquid water paths were comparable to the mode of the observations. Independent verification of the results, which are unbiased on some days, but not others, with respect to the microwave radiometer derived values, is not straightforward and was not attempted in the study. Ultimately, this retrieval is valuable for estimating liquid water paths of clouds with low emissivities, thereby acting as a complement to microwave radiometer retrieved liquid water paths.\n\nA parameterization of normalized cloud forcing based on liquid water path and solar zenith angle was developed and tested against observations, yielding results comparable to the best set of explicit surface flux calculations. The parameterization provides a fast and accurate way of estimating either surface flux or liquid water path given the other. This parameterization is useful for research requiring solar energy estimates in the presence of clouds as well as evaluation of cloud-radiation interactions in weather prediction and climate models.\n\nIt is also concluded from this study that measurement of the indirect aerosol effect will be problematic at the site, as variations in cloud liquid water path will most likely mask effects of variations in particle size. Furthermore, the absence of any bias relative to observations in the computed surface broadband fluxes based on effective radii derived from narrowband (415 nm) transmission indicates the absence of anomalous absorption in the clouds analyzed in this study.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4507], "author_name_tesi": "Sengupta, Manajit ", "last_name_ssi": "Sengupta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Manajit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas L Ackerman Jr.", "Johannes Verlinde", "Dennis Lamb", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux", "Timothy Joseph Kane"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas L Ackerman Jr., Committee Member", "Johannes Verlinde, Committee Member", "Dennis Lamb, Committee Member", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Committee Chair", "Timothy Joseph Kane, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["clouds", "boundary layer clouds", "radiation", "liquid water path", "effective radius", "climatology", "stratus"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "IMMIGRANT INDIAN MOTHERS\u2019 PERCEPTIONS OF PLAY AND PLAY\u2019S RELATIONSHIP TO CHILDREARING GOALS: A CASE STUDY", "id": "13178nzs154", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13178", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\tThis study investigates how traditional Indian culture manifests itself in the social setting of the United States (U.S.), paying particular attention to play activities, as well as understandings of play, from Indian immigrant mothers\u2019 perspectives. More specifically, this study considers how Indian immigrant mothers describe their parenting goals and practices, as well as how play in its various forms may relate to the mothers\u2019 childrearing goals. The data were generated through the qualitative method of the case study. The study\u2019s findings suggest that, three immigrant Indian mothers recognize the restrictive view of play\u2019s value in their children\u2019s lives: they value school and life success and see play as a way to help with this. The participating mothers primarily consider play as a tool to stimulate their children\u2019s learning and development. The mothers actively engage in their children\u2019s play practices as facilitators, and they continuously try to improve their children\u2019s skills through play and play-like activities. Equally importantly, the mothers see play as integrated with learning via specific play activities. The mothers accordingly tend to focus on their children\u2019s learning outcomes rather than play itself. For this reason, the three immigrant mothers value play and offer a variety of ways to support and enhance their children\u2019s playful learning.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13149], "author_name_tesi": "Sengupta, Nandini ", "last_name_ssi": "Sengupta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nandini", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. James E.

Enzyme-based biological motors perform specific cellular functions, such as DNA synthesis and vesicular transport, with great precision and efficiency. In all cases, the movement arises from the harnessing of chemical free energy released through enzymatic turnover of substrates. A fundamental question that arises is whether a single enzyme molecule can generate sufficient mechanical force through substrate turnover to cause its own movement and, more significantly, whether the movement can become directional through the imposition of a gradient in substrate concentration, a situation that parallels the chemotaxis of whole cells. Positive answers to these questions have important implications in areas ranging from biological transport to the design of \u201cintelligent,\u201d enzyme-powered, autonomous nano- and micromotors, which are expected to find applications in bottom-up assembly of structures, pattern formation, cargo delivery at specific locations, roving sensors, and related functions.\nThe dissertation starts by discussing the evolution of catalytic nano/micromotors and micropumps. The physics involved in powering objects at the nanoscale has been briefly reviewed. A detailed survey on the existing artificial micromotors and micropumps has been given, starting from the preliminary nanomotor design to the present day design modifications and their applications in the field of microscale delivery vehicles and assembly. The limitations of these artificial systems have been discussed with emphasis on how they can be improved using biocatalysts to power miniature devices. \nUsing fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, it was shown that the diffusive movement of single enzyme molecules of urease and catalase increases in the presence of their respective substrates, urea and hydrogen peroxide, in a concentration-dependent manner. The increase in diffusion of both the enzymes is highly attenuated in the presence of the respective enzyme inhibitors, thereby, suggesting the role of catalysis in enhanced diffusive behavior of enzyme molecules. The mechanisms involved in the anomalously high diffusion were explored. The impulse force generated during single enzymatic turnover was also estimated.\nThis dissertation highlights the chemotactic behavior of enzyme molecules, a phenomenon observed in biological systems like bacteria and cells. By employing a microfluidic device to generate substrate concentration gradient, it was demonstrated that ensembles of catalase and urease enzyme molecules spread towards areas of higher substrate concentration, a form of chemotaxis at the single molecule scale. Using glucose oxidase and glucose to generate a hydrogen peroxide gradient, the migration of catalase towards glucose oxidase was induced.\nThe potential of DNA polymerase to function as a nanomotor and micropump has been explored. The DNA polymerase is responsible for synthesizing DNA, a key component for running the biological machinery. The diffusive movement of a molecular complex of DNA template and DNA polymerase was enhanced during nucleotide incorporation into the growing DNA template. The molecular complex also exhibits collective migration towards areas of higher nucleotide and cofactor concentrations. Further, by immobilizing the molecular complex on a patterned surface, it was demonstrated that fluid and tracer particles could be pumped in a directional manner with the pumping speed increasing in the presence of cofactor in the surrounding fluid. The role of DNA polymerase as a micropump opens up an entirely new avenue of designing miniature fluid pumps using enzymes as engines.\nAn enzyme that moves by generating a continuous surface force in a fluid should, when fixed in place, function as a micropump moving fluid and colloids in a directed manner. It was established that by immobilizing enzymes on a patterned gold surface, ATP-independent, non-mechanical enzyme-powered micropumps can be fabricated that function in the presence of their substrates. The pumping velocity increases in a substrate-concentration-dependent manner. These pumps demonstrate both spatial and temporal regulation of fluid and colloid transport. Further, these pumps can be triggered by the presence of specific analytes in solution, opening up the possibility of designing enzyme based smart devices that act both as a sensor and a pump. Finally, a proof-of-concept device, powered by enzymes, was designed that acts as a scaffold for stimuli responsive autonomous delivery of small molecules.\nThis dissertation concludes with an outlook on the field of artificial nano/micromotors and micropumps. It also highlights how the research findings emphasized in this dissertation aid in making a big leap towards improvising this field both from a fundamental and an application standpoint. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8746], "author_name_tesi": "Sengupta, Samudra ", "last_name_ssi": "Sengupta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Samudra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen", "Thomas E Mallouk", "John V Badding", "Peter J Butler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["enzyme", "single-molecule", "diffusion", "nanomotor", "chemotaxis", "micropump"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Skin Color and Its Relationship to Hispanics' Acculturation\n\n\n\n", "id": "7310", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2723", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-12-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current study sought to examine Hispanics experience in the United States by investigating how skin color relates with Hispanics\u2019 acculturation process.

Based on X-ray data, the relative stereochemistry of the two quaternary carbon centers of the allyl lactones 82 and 156 was revised to be cis, opposite to the assignment made in the previous work from our group. This revision of stereochemistry led us to discontinue further work on the synthesis of perophoramidine (10) via this strategy. \nFor the communesins, a similar strategy utilizing a tandem Heck/carbonylation and an intramolecular lactone enolate C-alkylation was first investigated. In spite of the successful synthesis of tricyclic lactones 219 and 226, further manipulation of the hydroxyethyl group to form an alkylation precursor was unsuccessful due to the instability of the highly strained tricyclic ring structures.\nA second generation strategy utilizing an alkylation of spirolactones 228 and 262 provided allyl lactones 231 and 264 with moderate diastereoselectivities. These alkylations proceed through initial O-allylation and subsequent thermal Claisen rearrangement of the resulting O-allylketene acetal intermediates 230 and 263.\nIn a third generation strategy, the Heck/carbonylation step was replaced by an intramolecular Heck reaction of a tetrasubstituted alkene substrate, which efficiently led to the oxindole intermediate 307.

However, manipulation of the allyl group of 371 and 391 was problematic, with the unexpected formation of the rearranged aldehyde 378.\nTo eliminate the possibility of this undesired rearrangement, a bromo substituent was used at the C12a position. The bromide substrate underwent a similar intramolecular Heck reaction, reductive cyclization and metalloenamine allylation to afford the allylic pentacycle 412, which was transformed to the hexacyclic hemiacetal 418. Using advanced intermediate 418, a total synthesis of the communesins might be completed through \u201cnorthern\u201d aminal formation and azepine ring installation, followed by several functional group transformations.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3277], "author_name_tesi": "Seo, Jae Hong ", "last_name_ssi": "Seo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jae Hong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven M Weinreb", "Raymond Lee Funk", "Scott Trent Feldman", "Joel B Haight"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven M Weinreb, Committee Chair", "Raymond Lee Funk, Committee Member", "Scott Trent Feldman, Committee Member", "Joel B Haight, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Perophoramidine", "Communesin", "Total Synthesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "polymer swelling effects on mechanical and electrochemical properties for battery adhesives and ion exchange membranes", "id": "28230", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12652", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents two main research thrusts based on polymer swelling effects in different\nenvironments.

In recent decades, earthquake hazards have been viewed as extremely important among the natural hazards impacting civil infrastructure systems across certain regions in the United States.  The occurrence of three major earthquakes during that period (San Fernando in 1971, Loma Prieta in 1989, and Northridge in 1994) demonstrated the possible seismic vulnerabilities that existing bridges may contain.  These major seismic events also have provided the impetus for significant improvements in engineering practices for bridge seismic design, analysis, and vulnerability assessment.\n\nBridge seismic risk assessment tools have been proposed and utilized by many engineers and researchers since the inception of earthquake engineering in the 1970\u2019s.  These tools have predominately used fragility curves, which are conditional probability statements that give the probability of a bridge reaching or exceeding a particular damage level for an earthquake of a given intensity level, for examining straight bridge structures.  Fragility curves for the bridge components and system are essential inputs into the final damage estimation algorithm for a given earthquake event.\n\nSince these tools were developed for evaluating the seismic vulnerability of straight bridges, they cannot be applied to curved bridges.  There has been a steady growth in the use of horizontally curved steel bridges since approximately 1970, which coincides with the initiation period of the earthquake engineering field.  Effects of various curved bridge parameters, including radius of curvature, on the fragility of bridges across geographic regions must be investigated for their seismic assessment.\n\nIn this study the characteristics of structures in a target inventory were used to estimate fragilities for a family of horizontally curved steel bridges.  Consideration was restricted to the class of bridge structures consisting of horizontally curved steel I-girder bridges.  Statistically significant predictors for seismic vulnerability assessment were identified using Design of Experiments (DOE) and other statistical tools, and appropriate seismic response surface metamodels (RSMs) were developed to rapidly predict seismic response for a family of horizontally curved steel bridges.  Fragility curves for horizontally curved steel I-girder bridges were estimated using the metamodels with Monte Carlo simulation.  The use of metamodels reduced the required computations and made it practical to carry out probabilistic response calculations in an efficient manner.  Various sources of structural uncertainty were considered and tracked throughout the study, including radius of curvature, number of spans, cross-frame spacing, girder spacing, span length.  This approach allowed for the direct implementation of findings into existing seismic risk assessment packages (e.g., FEMA Hazards U.S. Multi-Hazard loss assessment package, etc.).  Findings from the study show that this approach provides reliable fragility curves for a family of horizontally curved steel I-girder bridges in the target region.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3091], "author_name_tesi": "Seo, Junwon ", "last_name_ssi": "Seo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Junwon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Linzell", "Daniel G Linzell", "Jeffrey A Laman", "Andrew Scanlon", "Linda Morley Hanagan", "Peggy Ann Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Linzell, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel G Linzell, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey A Laman, Committee Member", "Andrew Scanlon, Committee Member", "Linda Morley Hanagan, Committee Member", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bridge", "Metamodels", "Fragility Curves", "Seismic Vulnerability Assessment"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Effects of visual images in health message framing\n", "id": "8704", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3688", "abstract_tesi": "This study examined the effectiveness of visual images and message frames in communicating health risks.
