The share of agricultural employment, compared to other employment sectors, declined sharply, along with the production of traditional labor-intensive crops. In the same period, industrial maize production, as a crop supported by government incentives, nearly doubled, due to the increase in productivity and cultivation area. Through a commodity system analysis, this dissertation investigates the change in agricultural policies, social relations of commodity production and capital accumulation in the agricultural sector. First I examine the national regulatory framework and its interactions with actors at various levels that prepared the foundation for aforementioned developments. I show that actors influencing national regulatory framework are international organizations, agri-food industry, and maize farmers. Albeit national regulation in Turkey responds to maize producers\u2019 demands, the main trajectory remains within the limits of a Post-Fordist mode of regulation, gearing the maize market to the needs of the agri-food industry. The combination of longitudinal and spatial statistics and qualitative in-depth interviews enables the dissertation to measure the impacts of the agri-food industry, commercialization in maize farming, state intervention, and the regional farming structure on the changing relations of production in the Turkish rural landscape. Although large maize farmers possess advantages in financing production and in securing profits, the importance of small-scale maize farmers continues within the agricultural system driven by agri-food businesses. The weak bargaining position of a large number of smallholders within the commodity chain renders them ideal raw material suppliers from the perspective of the maize processing agri-industries. The changing relations of production in industrial maize production in Turkey highlight the need for nuanced perspectives on accumulation and exploitation. This dissertation develops the concept of \u201centrepreneurial exploitation\u201d to redirect critical political economy studies from the analysis of absolute material benefit/loss through small investments at the household level to the subtle, yet exploitative, relationships between small investments and the larger sector in which the former are embedded.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9534], "author_name_tesi": "Borlu, Yetkin ", "last_name_ssi": "Borlu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yetkin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leland Luther Glenna", "Anouk Patel", "Anouk Patel", "Leland Luther Glenna", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "Stephen Matthews"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leland Luther Glenna, Dissertation Advisor", "Anouk Patel, Dissertation Advisor", "Anouk Patel, Committee Chair", "Leland Luther Glenna, Committee Chair", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member", "Stephen Matthews, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Industrial Agriculture", "Commodity Systems", "Post-Fordism", "Turkey", "Rural Development", "International Development"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "{001} Textured Growth of Doped, Gradient Free, Lead Zirconate Titanate Thin Films by Chemical Solution Deposition", "id": "13318tmb1028", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "13318", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work studied means of enhancing the performance of PbZrxTi1\u2013xO3 (PZT) thin films via {001} textured growth, doping, and reduction of Zr/Ti compositional gradients. The direct seeding of {001} PZT on platinized silicon substrates was studied in relation to the platinum characteristics, doping, solution Pb stoichiometry and layer thickness. High temperature platinum was observed to enhance PZT grain size and reduce surface coverage of the pyrochlore secondary phase when compared to room temperature platinum. Generally, no significant crystallographic difference was observed between seed layers deposited on high temperature or room temperature platinum. Increases in solution lead excess reduced surface pyrochlore significantly. Niobium doping was found to increase grain size and pyrochlore coverage while Mn doping exhibited a rosette microstructure with poor crystallization on High Temperature (HT) Pt (via XRD). A thickness regime of 30 \u2013 70 nm was found to yield strongly {001} oriented PZT seed layers. Degradation of {001} orientation as a function of film thickness was attributed to surface pyrochlore converting to misoriented perovskite grains. Use of lead rich solutions (particularly at the top surface of each crystallization) provided a means of preventing pyrochlore formation. Niobium doped films with Lotgering factors in excess of 0.99 were attainable with solutions ranging from 10-20 at.% Pb excess in various stacking sequences. In addition to films with low, medium and high lead contents, a film with thin layers of manganese doping was deposited.\nNo significant trend was observed in the dielectric or piezoelectric properties as a consequence of lead content. The film with Mn doped layers exhibited reduced dielectric properties (including Rayleigh coefficients) and small signal piezoelectric properties while exhibiting similar large signal piezoelectric performance (d33;f of ~120 pm/V). Films with higher lead contents were found to undergo dielectric breakdown in a tighter distribution at lower electric fields than films with a low lead content, which exhibited a larger spread of failures at a higher average field. All films tended to microcrack prior to dielectric breakdown events and material ejection occurring.

Inter-molecular and intra-molecular forces are incorporated using the Lennard-Jones 12-6 and a torsional potential.  During each integration step the structure of the molecule is maintained by constraining bond lengths and bond angles iteratively.  The RATTLE method, a variation of the Velocity Verlet algorithm, is implemented to maintain the constraints and advance the system through time.  The system is initialized in a BCC lattice with each molecule in a helical structure and is allowed to evolve into a random arrangement, using velocity rescaling to ensure that the kinetic and internal temperature are maintained in this initial period.  This rescaling is continued until the simulation has reached thermal equilibrium, then it is free to evolve.  Due to the high computational costs of vaporization a polyatomic molecule using MD, a parallel implementation of the system has been developed. Ten simulations were done on systems of approximately 1500 molecules under pressures ranging from one to twenty-five atmospheres. The droplet was evaporated for a time ranging from one to two nanoseconds depending on the pressure. In all cases the droplet was initialized at 293.15 K and the vapor was initialized at either 471 K or 550 K. The latter case is above the supercritical temperature of n-Heptane. Cross-sectional contour plots looking at the kinetic and internal energy as well as the average force acting within the droplets are presented. Results show that the droplet loses its spherical shape very fast, especially when the pressure is increased. The Amsterdam method was used to analyze the evaporation rate for each case. It was found out that all cases adhere to the D\u00b2 fairly well and that increasing the pressure accelerates the droplet vaporization. Finally, the evaporation constant was calculated and this study shows that it increases linearly with the reduced pressure. This work provides a foundation on which future polyatomic, in particular hydrocarbon, droplet vaporization studies can be done. The next step is to also increase the pressure above its critical value for n-Heptane, as well as increasing the size of the system.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [322], "author_name_tesi": "Borner, Arnaud ", "last_name_ssi": "Borner", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Arnaud", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Matthew Micci", "Michael Matthew Micci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Matthew Micci, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Matthew Micci, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["n-heptane", "vaporization", "Droplets", "molecular dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Use of Advanced Particle Methods in Modeling Space Propulsion and its Supersonic Expansions", "id": "22611", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10167", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research discusses the use of advanced kinetic particle methods such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) and direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) to model space propulsion systems such as electrospray thrusters and their supersonic expansions. MD simulations are performed to model an  electrospray thruster for the ionic liquid EMIM-BF4 using coarse-grained potentials. Two coarse-grained potentials are compared, and the effective-force coarse-grained potential is found to predict the formation of the Taylor cone, the cone-jet, and other extrusion modes for similar electric fields and mass flow rates observed in experiments of a IL fed capillary-tip-extractor system better than the simple CG potential. Later, a fully transient three-dimensional electric field, solving Poisson's equation to take into account the electric field due to space charge at each timestep, is computed by coupling the MD model to a Poisson solver. The boundary conditions (BCs) are found to have a substantial impact on the potential and electric field, and the \"tip\" BC is introduced and compared to\nthe two previous BCs, named \"plate\" and \"needle\", showing good improvement by reducing unrealistically high radial electric fields generated in the vicinity\nof the capillary tip. The influence of the different boundary condition models on charged species currents as a function of the mass flow rate is studied, and\nit is found that a constant electric field model gives similar agreement to the more rigorous and computationally expensive tip boundary condition at lower flow rates.\nSupersonic expansions to vacuum produce clusters of sufficiently small size that properties such as heat capacities and latent heat of evaporation cannot be described by bulk vapor thermodynamic values. Therefore, MD simulations are performed to compute the evaporation rate of small water clusters as a function of temperature and size and the rates are found to agree with Unimolecular Dissociation Theory and Classical Nucleation Theory. The heat capacities and latent heat of vaporization obtained from Monte-Carlo Canonical-Ensemble simulations are used in DSMC simulations of two experiments that measured Rayleigh scattering and terminal dimer mole fraction of supersonic water-jet expansions. Water-cluster temperature and size are found to be influenced by the use of kinetic rather than thermodynamic heat-capacity\nand latent-heat values as well as the nucleation model. Additionally, MD simulations of water condensation in a one-dimensional free expansion are performed to simulate the conditions in the core of a plume. We find that the internal structure of the clusters formed depends on the stagnation temperature\nconditions.

Although prior research has recognized the interindividual variability in rate of cognitive change, identification of distinct groups of cognitive trajectories and profiles for these trajectories are needed.  This study investigated the distinct cognitive trajectories present in three samples with varying levels of participation in structured cognitive activity.   The association of health behaviors, chronic diseases, cognitive reserve and cognitive style with distinct cognitive change trajectories was also examined.  Finally, the long-term outcomes for health severity, mental status, everyday problem solving, and mortality were investigated as a function of trajectory group, training group and training gain. \n\nA sample of 422 individuals who participated in the Seattle Longitudinal Study for a minimum of 14 years and were at least 57 years of age at the baseline assessment were used in the current study.  At baseline, participants had a mean age of 63.54 years and a mean education level of 14.42 years.  The total sample was analyzed as three subsamples: nontrained (N=181), reasoning trained (N=118), and space trained (N=123).  Nagin Mixture Modeling was employed to determine the optimal number and shape of the trajectories for the three subsamples, as well as the impact of the covariates.  Analysis of covariance, Chi-square, and logistic regression analyses were utilized to investigate the clinically meaningful outcomes.  Results indicated that there was significantly variability in reasoning ability over the 14-year period in each of the three samples.  Those trained on inductive reasoning ability performed at comparable levels throughout the entire 14-year period, while those trained on spatial orientation ability demonstrated linear decline trajectories differing as a function of level.  The nontrained sample showed the most variability in terms of trajectory shape.  Thus, these findings suggest that structured cognitive activity is helpful for the maintenance of inductive reasoning ability in older adults exhibiting normative age-related decline.  \n\nInvestigation of the covariates revealed that cognitive style, particularly psychomotor speed and motor-cognitive flexibility, were consistently associated with trajectory group membership in each of the three samples.  Individuals demonstrating higher levels of inductive reasoning ability throughout the 14-year period had higher levels of cognitive style at the final occasion of measurement compared to their lower functioning peers.  In addition, cognitive reserve, specifically level of education and occupational status, were associated with trajectory group membership in the nontrained and reasoning trained samples.  Individuals with higher levels of inductive reasoning ability had higher levels of educational and occupational attainment.  These findings suggest that individuals with higher levels of inductive reasoning ability are able to adapt and respond to changes in the environment more readily, and have higher levels of cognitive reserve (as evidenced by educational and occupational levels).\n\nFinally, everyday problem solving was the outcome most consistently associated with trajectory group membership and training group.  Individuals with higher levels of inductive reasoning ability, both through trajectory group membership, and training on inductive reasoning ability, demonstrated higher levels of everyday problem solving ability.  This suggests that inductive reasoning is a particularly salient cognitive ability to consider in the study of everyday problem solving. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2472], "author_name_tesi": "Boron, Julie Blaskewicz", "last_name_ssi": "Boron", "middle_name_ssi": "Blaskewicz", "first_name_ssi": "Julie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sherry Lynn Willis", "K Warner Schaie", "Duane Francis Alwin", "Bonnie J Meyer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sherry Lynn Willis, Committee Chair", "K Warner Schaie, Committee Member", "Duane Francis Alwin, Committee Member", "Bonnie J Meyer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Inductive Reasoning", "Cognitive Trajectories", "Nagin Modeling", "Cognitive ability", "Cognitive Training", "Older Adults"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "CRUSTAL STRUCTURE OF THE RUNGWE VOLCANIC PROVINCE AND REGION SURROUNDING THE NORTHERN LAKE MALAWI RIFT BASIN", "id": "13207djb453", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13207", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The crustal structure around the northern end of the Lake Malawi rift and beneath the Rungwe\nVolcanic Province (RVP) in southern Tanzania has been investigated using teleseismic receiver functions\nfrom SEGMeNT broadband seismic stations to determine the extent to which the Precambrian crust has\nbeen modified by the Cenozoic rifting and magmatism.

The non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtype adenocarcinoma is the leading histological type clinically diagnosed in the United States, accounting for over 30% of all cases.  The primary risk factor associated with lung cancer is related to cigarette smoking; approximately 87% of lung cancer deaths in the United States are attributed to cigarette smoking.  Existing approaches using conventional treatment strategies, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, have generated minimally significant results for lung cancer survival; 5-year survival for all stages combined is 16%.  Furthermore, the disease is often diagnosed at advanced stages of development, beyond the benefit of current treatment.  Therefore, alternative approaches in the management of lung cancer, such as early detection and prevention, are urgently needed.  In the present investigation we embark upon two strategies with promising clinical implications: identification of (informative) molecular biomarkers related to the development of tobacco-induced lung cancer and the discovery of novel chemopreventive agents.   \nHypotheses:  Current clinical protein biomarkers for detection of lung cancer lack sensitivity and specificity.  The proteomics field can contribute greatly to the understanding of mechanisms in cancer progression and treatment response.  Therefore, in Chapter 2 we hypothesized that by using proteomic approaches in a well-defined preclinical mouse lung tumorigenesis model induced using the tobacco carcinogen NNK, protein biomarkers could be obtained to provide an accurate view of molecular alterations during lung cancer development.  Such biomarkers can provide utility for early detection, but also in the validation of chemoprevention strategies.  Smokers are at risk for a variety of health concerns including lung cancer.  Non-invasive biological fluids such as blood plasma contains molecular profiles related to current health status.  Therefore, in Chapter 3 taking advantage of proteomic techniques and proteins identified in Chapter 2, we hypothesized that dynamic changes in protein expression profiles in the blood plasma of smokers characterized by a proteomics approach would assist in identifying early molecular changes related to tobacco-induced diseases such as lung cancer.  Selenium-containing compounds are promising chemopreventive agents against lung cancer development.  Developments of agents that can target molecular pathways that are critical in lung carcinogenesis, such as nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide production, known to be involved in the promotion/progression phases of lung carcinogenesis, are needed and may be beneficial in chemoprevention of lung cancer in both smokers and former smokers.  Therefore, in Chapter 4 we hypothesized that substitution of sulfur for selenium in an inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, S,S\u00a1\u00a6-(1,4-phenylenebis[1,2-ethanediyl])bisisothiourea (PBIT), would enhance its chemopreventive activity.  \nMethods:  (Chapter 2) The proteomic techniques two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) were employed to achieve a global protein expression profile of the lung during the progression of disease development in the NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis A/J mouse model.  Furthermore, the synthetic organoselenium chemopreventive agent 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)selenocyanate (p-XSC) was administered to validate potential protein biomarkers.  (Chapter 3) In order to gain an understanding of some of the dynamic protein changes in human plasma as a result of chronic exposure to mainstream tobacco smoke, we used iTRAQ and immunoblot analyses in blood plasma samples derived from healthy male smokers and non-smokers.  (Chapter 4) To compare the efficacy of the novel selenium analog of PBIT (Se-PBIT) with PBIT and p-XSC, various in vitro molecular assays were performed in NSCLC cells including detection of nitric oxide production, cellular proliferation and apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, and protein expression related to important cellular activities.         \nResults:  (Chapter 2) We discovered proteins, including the 14-3-3 protein isoforms (\u0192\u00e1, \u0192\u00d5, \u00a3m, and \u0192\u00ea), annexin A5, Clara cell 10 kDa protein (CC10), high mobility group box 1, and carbonyl reductase 2 that were differentially expressed in the lungs of mice treated with the tobacco carcinogen NNK versus vehicle (control)-treated mice during the progression of adenocarcinoma development; some of these changes were further modulated by p-XSC.  These proteins are involved in a variety of biological functions that are critical in lung carcinogenesis, as well as in its prevention.  (Chapter 3) We identified differentially expressed plasma proteins in healthy chronic cigarette smokers compared to healthy non-smokers.  Several of the proteins identified, including ITI-HC3 and VDBP, associated with immunity and inflammatory responses, and 14-3-3 \u00a3m and \u00a3a, identified in Chapter 2, have been shown to be associated with tobacco-related diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer.  (Chapter 4) We found Se-PBIT to be superior to both PBIT and p-XSC as an inducer of apoptosis and inhibitor of cell growth in NSCLC cells, as determined by analysis of its effects on important molecular targets involved in cell growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation.    \nConclusions:  (Chapter 2) Based on our results, we were able to demonstrate the utility of a well-defined animal model in developing candidate protein biomarkers for lung cancer.  Such biomarkers may be useful in early detection of the disease, as well as in the efficacy of chemopreventive agents.  (Chapter 3) Our clinical pilot study results demonstrated for the first time that chronic cigarette smoking can influence the expression profile of the human plasma proteome and these changes may be indicative of future health concerns.  (Chapter 4) We demonstrated that selenium in the form of Se-PBIT is a promising candidate for chemoprevention of NSCLC and appears superior to PBIT and p-XSC.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2600], "author_name_tesi": "Bortner Jr, James ", "last_name_ssi": "Bortner Jr", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Karam El Bayoumy", "Karam E El Bayoumy", "Arunangshu Das", "Gail Lynn Matters", "David Spencer Phelps", "John Peter Richie Jr.", "Cara Lynne Schengrund"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Karam El Bayoumy, Dissertation Advisor", "Karam E El Bayoumy, Committee Chair", "Arunangshu Das, Committee Member", "Gail Lynn Matters, Committee Member", "David Spencer Phelps, Committee Member", "John Peter Richie Jr., Committee Member", "Cara Lynne Schengrund, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biomarkers", "proteomics", "2D-DIGE", "iTRAQ", "NNK", "mouse model", "cigarette smoking", "plasma", "NSCLC", "adenocarcinoma", "chemoprevention", "selenium"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Cysteine Biosynthesis and Sulfur Fixation in the Archaea", "id": "5842", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "846", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-02-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cysteine plays a critical role in the structure, stability and catalytic function of many proteins in all domains of life.  Cysteine is also the major source of sulfur for the synthesis of sulfur-containing compounds in organisms of the Bacteria and Eukarya domains.  Two routes for cysteine biosynthesis in nature have been documented, pathways I and II.  Plants and members of the Bacteria domain synthesize cysteine and fix sulfur via pathway I.  Fungi fix sulfide and synthesize cysteine using pathway I or II.  Although the genomes of seven members of the archaea have been sequenced to date, the data offer little understanding of cysteine biosynthesis in this domain.  \n\t\nPresented here is the purification and characterization of the first archaeal enzyme catalyzing sulfur fixation and cysteine biosynthesis, O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, from the methanoarchaeon Methanosarcina thermophila.  Evidence was obtained for the involvement of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase in cysteine biosynthesis by pathway I through biochemical, physiological and genetic means.  O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase from M. thermophila exhibits positive co-operativity indicative of involvement in a biosynthetic pathway.  O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase expression is elevated under growth conditions where the organism must synthesize cysteine, compared to expression levels where cysteine is provided in the media.  The two genes involved in pathway I are transcribed in the same direction and possibly form an operon in M. thermophila.  Activities of enzymes of pathway II are not detected in cell free extract, indicating that the only other pathway known for the synthesis of cysteine is not operable in M. thermophila under the conditions tested.\n\nEvidence is presented implicating an additional function for O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase.  Over 90% of cysteine desulfurase activity in cell extracts of cells grown with cysteine as the sole sulfur source is due to O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, suggesting the possibility that O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase provides the primary source of sulfide for biosynthesis.  Patterns of expression levels in the presence and absence of sulfide, growth patterns with trimethylamine, inhibition by ammonia of the desulfurase activity, and changes in sulfide concentration of the media during growth support this interpretation.\n\nExperimental advances were made to obtain genetic knock-out mutants in M. thermophila deficient in the genes of pathway I to determine if an additional, novel pathway exists for cysteine biosynthesis in the archaea, and to test the hypothesis for the role of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase in the desulfuration of cysteine to supply sulfur for biosynthesis.  In addition a novel assay was developed for sulfide detection in cell extracts that is less prone to high background absorbances than published methods.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [839], "author_name_tesi": "Borup, Birthe ", "last_name_ssi": "Borup", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Birthe", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Gregory Ferry", "Philip C.

The large design space for injection schedules makes choosing the optimal schedule for an engine particularly challenging. Additionally, experimental in-engine studies of advanced injection schedules are time-consuming and costly. Gas jet experiments can provide a good approximation for the behavior of diesel jets and more tests can be conducted in a shorter period of time without incurring the costs of an engine research facility. The goal of this work is to gain a further understanding of some of the fundamental fluid mechanics of multiple injections, jet-jet interactions, and jets impinging on surfaces.\nGas jet experiments are conducted using z-schlieren and acetone tracer planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF). Three studies are conducted focusing on free jets, multiple jet interactions, jet-jet interaction, and bowl geometry effects. The first study is a comparison of penetration results for helium gas jets with penetration results for vaporizing and non-vaporizing sprays, which shows that by non-dimensionalizing the results of gas jet experiments, the penetration curve follows a similar trend to the non-dimensionalized penetration curve for vaporizing and non-vaporizing liquid sprays.\nThe second study explores the fluid mechanic interactions between multiple injections and the effects of injection duration and dwell. The schlieren results of the multiple-injection studies showed that before the end of injection (EOI) the non-dimensional jet-tip penetration was not significantly different for the first and second injection, however, the average dispersion half angle during the quasi-steady portion of injection was higher for the first injection than for the second injection. There are two multiple-injection cases where the average dispersion half angle of the second injection is higher than that of the first injection by a statistically significant amount. These differences in jet dispersion angle are indicative of differences in mixing and entrainment during the first and second injections. Future studies with acetone-PLIF will allow the concentration to be quantified and differences in the jet composition for the first and second injections in multiple-injection schemes to be compared.\nThe last study focuses on the effects of piston bowl geometry and the angle between interacting jets. The effects of the geometry on fluid recirculation and mixing are studied using schlieren and PLIF with jets of acetone vapor and air and two different piston bowl designs.

Due to the use of cruciform control blades in the HOLTEC SMR-160 assembly design for controlling reactivity, a non-uniform pin enrichment distribution must be implemented.  A non-uniform pin enrichment distribution helps mitigate the heterogeneity in the moderator distribution, allowing the lattice to have a flatter pin power shape.  The optimization of the enrichment distribution within a lattice is a tedious yet important task to reduce high pin peak powers in full core simulations.\n\tThe Standard Lattice Optimization Tool with Heuristics (SLOTH) was developed to automate the lattice enrichment optimization process while still allowing the user to have full control over the desired properties of the lattice (e.g. lattice average enrichment and burnable absorber distribution).  It utilizes a local search algorithm in which the enrichment is incremented to minimize the pin peak power.  Sensitivity studies indicate that the number of pins incremented at each iteration can be increased to five to ten pins without negatively impacting results.  This allows SLOTH to optimize a lattice in approximately 90-150 minutes.  Time is a key component in order for SLOTH to be an effective tool to assist in LP optimization.    \n\tA heuristic biasing feature was included in SLOTH which allows the user to control the location of the pin peak power.

Some of these defenses, such as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are airborne and can be perceived by other plants.  Priming is a strategy for plants to capitalize on their perception of HIPVs.  The steps by which an undamaged plant becomes primed after perception of HIPVs are poorly understood, but the effects of priming are distinctive.  Once an herbivore starts to feed, the primed plant displays a faster and stronger defense response.  In maize, whether caterpillar feeding induces a primed defense response and how feeding on primed maize impacts the caterpillar remains relatively unknown.  The defense profile consists of direct and indirect defenses.  To characterize these defense categories, I assessed volatile production as a measure of indirect defenses, transcript levels of proteinase inhibitors as an estimate of direct defenses, and jasmonic acid (JA) levels as a general indicator of a plant defense response.  To evaluate this, I performed a developmental comparison of two seedling stages, v1 with three leaves and v3 with five leaves.  Here, I report that simulated and actual herbivory differentially elicit volatile production and proteinase inhibitor transcript accumulation in two maize seedling stages.  Once the defense profiles from each developmental stage had been characterized, I proceeded to compare primed and non-primed defense profiles in v1 and v3 plants.  To establish that the plants responded to the priming agent, a HIPV, I measured JA levels shortly after exposure to the HIPV.  Both developmental stages contained elevated JA levels, which indicated that the plants responded to the priming treatment.  Caterpillars feeding on primed v1 and v3 maize compared to non-primed maize did not elicit faster or higher amounts of volatiles within twenty four hours.   In addition, JA levels were not higher in primed versus non-primed plants at several points during four hours of caterpillar feeding.  However, bioassays indicated that the youngest-v1- primed maize plants reduced larval weights.  In addition, primed v1 maize plants experienced less leaf damage. Since the bioassays indicated that the primed v1 maize plants reduced caterpillar growth, I then assessed at a molecular level, whether transcripts of proteinase inhibitors were higher in primed plants.  However, the transcripts at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours were not higher in primed versus non-primed plants.  These results suggest that priming in maize may be most effective at certain developmental stages.  My findings provoke a re-assessment of defense characterization in primed maize.  The ontogenic comparison reveals that different life stages of maize may prioritize different defense strategies and therefore early stages such as v1 can be expected to exhibit a stronger primed direct defense response.  Later life stages such as v3 may shift their emphasis to indirect defenses.  These findings deepen our knowledge of an agronomically important crop and are essential for the development of sustainable pest management strategies, which may act in concert with maize\u2019s own manifold defense system.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1762], "author_name_tesi": "Bosak, Elizabeth James", "last_name_ssi": "Bosak", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "Consuelo M De Moraes", "Dawn S Luthe", "Gary Felton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Committee Chair", "Consuelo M De Moraes, Committee Member", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member", "Gary Felton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spodoptera exigua", "Zea mays", "priming", "ontogeny", "induced defenses", "herbivore-induced plant volatiles"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Lithofacies and Transport of Clastic Sediments in Kartsic Aquifers", "id": "26234", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11326", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Karst aquifers require transport of clastic sediments for the conduit system to remain open and thus to continue to be an eligible route for ongoing speleogenesis.

We consider both a thin and a thick viscoelastic layer bonded to a metallic plate and use a guided wave ultrasonic signal to assess bond integrity in hidden regions. This work applies to relatively low-curvature pressurized pipe and vessels. Analytical and finite element models are developed to describe wave propagation at high frequencies relative to the plate thickness, where the plate can be approximated as a half space. Finite element models are used to visualize wave propagation. Experiments are performed on a 25 mm thick steel plate with both relatively thin (3 mm) and thick (25 mm) coatings of various stiffnesses bonded to the surface. Physically based wave features, such as amplitude ratio, energy ratio, frequency ratio, pulse width, and arrival time are identified which may be used to assess bond integrity in hidden regions.\n\nWith a thorough understanding of guided wave mechanics, researchers can predict which guided wave modes will have a high probability of success in a particular nondestructive evaluation application. However, work continues to find optimal mode and frequency selection for a given application. This \"optimal\" mode could give the highest sensitivity to defects or the greatest penetration power, increasing inspection efficiency. Since material properties used for modeling work may be estimates, in many cases guided wave mode and frequency selection can be adjusted for increased inspection efficiency in the field. In this work, a novel mode sweep technique is described and used to identify optimal mode points based on quantifiable wave characteristics. The technique uses an ultrasonic phased array comb transducer to sweep in phase velocity-frequency space and is demonstrated using interface waves to inspect thick bonded structures. After sweeping through nearby mode points, an optimal mode and frequency can be selected which has the highest sensitivity to a defect, or gives the greatest penetration power.

The purpose of the dissertation is to determine the effects of using technology outside the classroom to improve abilities in the second language learner's L2 phonological system.  It is hypothesized that by completing speech perception exercises outside the classroom with the use of technology, and also by manipulating the variables of metalinguistic explanation and type of feedback in class, the second language learner will be able to improve his/her L2 phonological abilities without having to commit much class time to pronunciation training.  \nThis dissertation is based on two studies carried out at Pennsylvania State University.  Study 1 took place during Spring semester 2008.  All participants were  students of Spanish 110 (Intermediate Spanish Conversation).  Participants (n=12)  were randomly placed into one of three groups; the first group (Group A) received audible examples and metalinguistic explanation of the target sound (the nonvelarization of the Spanish segment [l] in the syllable final position).  These examples were provided in tasks that the participants completed online, outside of class.  The second group (Group B) received only metalinguistic explanation via the online activity.  The third group (Group C) served as the control.  Results from both speech perception and production abilities during the posttest indicate an improvement in both abilities.  \nStudy 2 consists of 30 participants.  Again, all were students of Spanish 110 (Fall 2008 semester), and  all were randomly divided into three groups; those who received explicit training, audible examples and metalinguistic explanation (A), those who received explicit training and metalinguistic explanation (B), and a control group (C).\nDuring the course of the semester participants in both studies completed weekly exercises in Spanish perception via the internet (using ANGEL, the online course management system at Penn State).  The groups in Study 2 received short (approximately ten minutes) periods of explicit instruction (one per week in class, for eight weeks).  At the end of the semester the students returned to complete the 'post-treatment' word-naming task.   All \u2018pre-treatments\u2019 and \u2018post-treatments\u2019 were digitally recorded and phonetic analysis was done using Praat Software. \nData from both studies show that the groups receiving both metalinguistic explanation and audible input not only improved the ability to discriminate between L1 and L2 sounds, they also improve production of L2 phones.  However, it was noted in both studies that exposure to audible examples alone, via \u2018at-home\u2019 treatments does not seem to play a role in improvement of Spanish L2 phonology.  Most significantly, all groups improved their L2 phonological production when compared to the control groups, supporting the notion that phonology can be introduced at lower levels of language learning without disruption to the curriculum.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [976], "author_name_tesi": "Botero, Christopher G", "last_name_ssi": "Botero", "middle_name_ssi": "G", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chip Gerfen", "Chip Gerfen", "Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "John Andres Ochoa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chip Gerfen, Dissertation Advisor", "Chip Gerfen, Committee Chair", "Paola Eulalia Dussias, Committee Chair", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member", "John Andres Ochoa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["teaching with technology", "second-language acquisition", "phonetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Role of Orthography to Phonology Mapping in Bilingual Word Reading: An Electrophysiological Investigation", "id": "17401", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8348", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-01-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "English monolinguals and highly proficient L1-dominant Spanish-English, Chinese- English and Dutch-English bilinguals made rhyme judgments of semantically unrelated English word pairs presented sequentially in the visual modality, while behavioral and EEG measures were recorded.

The selection of this region was done after considering the fact that this region is covered under the government TB Control program for the past one year and availability of health worker resources from the District Tuberculosis Officer to conduct the survey. A mix of quantitative and qualitative survey questionnaire was designed to understand the relationship between accessibility and various factors such as socioeconomic status, educational level and working status. Sample of 1000 Tribal people spread across 10 villages of the Agency area were pre-selected from the Census data available using multi-stage sampling. The sample quota for each village was allocated based on the higher proportion of tribal population within the village to ensure a cost-effective way of achieving a better representation of core Tribal areas. The villages were then visited by a health worker after getting briefed on the details of the survey objectives and procedures to conduct interviews using the provided survey questionnaire. A response rate of 63.1% was achieved as in some instances, the census data was outdated and/or the person pre-selected was not accessible. Detailed accounts of all the 631 persons interviewed were recorded and analyzed in the study to identify key factors that influence utilization and accessibility of TB control services.\n\nThe results from the survey showed that the occurrence of TB symptoms increased with age up to 50 years and people living in tribal areas of Visakha agency region in between 25-50 years of age are found at a higher risk of being infected by TB than their younger counterparts. Possible indication of higher levels of transmission risk was observed among unskilled/daily wage labor workers as primary occupation of over half of symptomatic persons surveyed was unskilled/daily wage labor compared to only 28% of non-symptomatic population. In-spite of the free treatment services and travel reimbursement provided by the government, symptomatic persons, who were advised to seek diagnosis/treatment but did not seek any treatment, was overwhelmingly high (37%). The primary reason for not seeking treatment reported was under par financial situation of the population in this region. Recommendations are provided taking into account various significant observations made from the study to improve the treatment seeking behavior of the Tribal persons in this region.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3654], "author_name_tesi": "Botla, Krishna Chaitanya ", "last_name_ssi": "Botla", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Krishna Chaitanya", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Paul Griffin", "Dr Paul Griffin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Paul Griffin, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Paul Griffin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Barriers for Tribal People", "Incentive plan"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Computational Fluid Dynamics / Flight Dynamics Simulations of an Autonomous Helicopter using Actuator Disk Couplings for Main and Tail Rotors", "id": "15326apb5479", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15326", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to develop a coupled flight dynamics/Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation tool of a helicopter.

In my thesis, I show that what has been considered a single species in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), Porites lobata, includes a morphologically similar yet ecologically distinct species, Porites evermanni. Porites lobata is replaced by P. evermanni at continental sites and towards higher latitudes along the continental coast, indicating that the two species occupy different ecological niches. Further, rates of asexual fragmentation differed significantly (p=0.01) between the two species as ascertained by genotyping at 11 microsatellite loci from sampling using a spatially explicit random method. Although P. evermanni reproduces extensively via fragmentation, P. lobata does so rarely. This crucial difference in population maintenance may be a driver of population structuring especially in the face of extreme El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) disturbance events which are frequent in the ETP. At some coastal sites, larger, asexually-produced fragments rather than smaller, sexually-produced larvae appear to have the advantage. Asexual fragmentation in these corals is thought to be facilitated by presence of endolithic Lithophaga mussels. Where both Porites species occur, the number of mussels/cm2 is significantly higher in P. evermanni based on field (p<0.001) and photographic (p=0.011) evidence. Additionally, we show that both corals associate primarily with Symbiodinium clade C15 (identified by DGGE of the ITS2 region); however, P. lobata was found to bleach more readily then P. evermanni when growing in close proximity (p<0.001). Differential bleaching frequency of the coral holobionts thus could be explained by host physiology differences, or by as yet undetected, host-specific Symbiodinium lineages below the C15 resolution level, or a combination of both. To explore the importance of abiotic factors in determining the geographical distribution differences between P. lobata and P. evermanni holobionts, a maximum entropy model was constructed, and indicated that temperature was indeed important in determining Porites/Symbiodinium species distribution. Thus, niche differentiation in these two closely related coral hosts and their symbionts is likely driven by preferences of the holobionts to abiotic factors explaining the divergent ecological response to thermal stress. Hidden diversity within the coral-Symbiodinium association has until now obscured differences in trophic interactions, reproductive dynamics and bleaching susceptibility, related to differential response to local temperature regimes. Including biotic factors that facilitate asexual reproduction with environmental abiotic factors in a multiple linear regression model to predict the distribution of Porites species revealed that biotic interactions are valuable for explaining differences in species distributions. Therefore, the variation in biotic interactions crucial to population maintenance across species\u2019 ranges should be considered in light of future climate change. \nWhen confronted with large-scale disturbances brought on by climate change, population maintenance is often dependent on supply of larval recruits from unimpacted locations. In the case of Eastern Pacific Porites, reefs were well connected across the region, likely due to the long-lived, symbiont containing larval stage of the Porites species. In contrast, reef-building Acropora species have shorter lived larvae and their fragile, branching growth form make them susceptible to physical fragmentation sometimes resulting in large clonal patches.  By applying high resolution genetic markers, gene flow and the importance of asexual versus sexual reproduction in population maintenance were investigated in dominant staghorn corals, Acropora cf. pulchra of Guam.  High levels of asexual fragmentation were observed at considerable spatial scales and a possible barrier to larval dispersal was identified where strong eddies serve to return larvae to their natal reef. Thus maintenance of coral communities in Guam depends on asexual recruitment by fragmentation possibly perpetuating locally well adapted genotypes while reducing diversity. Management efforts should thus operate on small scales and focus on preserving clonal diversity in this system. \nOverall the work presented in this thesis shows how genetic markers allow for investigations of coral population dynamics operating at multiple spatial scales and reveals how population processes impact coral communities locally and regionally.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10034], "author_name_tesi": "Boulay, Jennifer Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Boulay", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Iliana Brigitta Baums", "Katriona Shea", "Todd C Lajeunesse", "George H Perry", "Dr Jorge Cort\u00e9s"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Iliana Brigitta Baums, Dissertation Advisor", "Katriona Shea, Committee Chair", "Todd C Lajeunesse, Committee Member", "George H Perry, Committee Member", "Dr Jorge Cort\u00e9s, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dispersal", "connectivity", "niche", "Porites", "Eastern Tropical Pacific", "Guam", "Acropora", "cryptic species"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Tree ring responses to climate and disturbance across a topographic gradient in the Ridge and Valley of Central Pennsylvania", "id": "23080", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10604", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Global climate has changed dramatically in the last century, much of which occurred in the last four decades. One result of this has been a change in the physiological response of biota. While some organisms adjust to this variation in climate by shifting their range, established trees must endure the new conditions imposed upon them. Recent findings indicate recent warming has resulted in increased radial growth throughout much of the eastern United States.  However, this increase may not be ubiquitous across all locations or site types and growth patterns may vary across topographic positions. I measured the dendrochronology (annual tree rings) of two co-occurring yet contrasting tree species, the mesic red oak (Quercus rubra) and the more xeric chestnut oak (Quercus montana). The study sites were located across replicated topographic gradients (lower slope, southeast aspect, northwest aspect, and ridge top) in the Ridge and Valley province of central Pennsylvania. I evaluated radial growth as a function of site type, tree age and diameter, disturbance events, and climate (temperature, precipitation, and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)). Prior to the 1980s, growth rates on most sites were statistically similar. By the end of the 20th century, however, both species experienced significantly higher basal area increment (BAI) on southeast aspects than northwest sites. Increased growth rate was significantly correlated with increasing tree size. However, this relationship was disproportional across site types indicating other factors influenced growth.  Throughout the study period, frequent disturbances from severe storms in the mid-1950s, 1966, and mid-1990s and gypsy moth outbreaks in the 1980s were also noted. Many stand-wide disturbances corresponded with significant climatic events, particularly on southeast aspect sites. Both species exhibited the highest tree ring release frequency on southeast aspects. Red oak and chestnut oak growth was also affected by temperature and precipitation as a function of topographic position, potentially facilitated by differences in disturbance. Red oak was negatively correlated with current year temperatures throughout the study period, particularly on northwest and ridge top sites. In contrast, chestnut oak on southeast and lower slope sites had a positive response to increasing temperature. Moreover, red oak BAI on northwest and ridge top locations were negatively correlated with winter temperatures while chestnut oak BAI was positively correlated with winter temperatures on lower slope and southeast sites. Chestnut oak growth on lower slope and southeast sites was also positively correlated with current year spring temperatures. Previous year precipitation was positively correlated with radial growth for both species on several sites types. Despite some predominant trends, differences in climate correlation did exist among similar sites.

Two prophylactic virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines that protect against the two most common \u201chigh risk\u201d types, HPV16 and HPV18, are currently commercially available.  However, the protection provided by each vaccine is type specific and neither vaccine can induce clearance of pre-existing HPV infections or established HPV disease.  Moreover, approximately 30% of all cervical cancers are caused by other HPV types and at least 5 other cancers have been linked to HPV infection.  Consequently, additional protective and therapeutic vaccine strategies are needed.  The focus of this thesis was to investigate the protective vaccine generated immunity to HLA-A2.1 restricted HPV16 E7 epitopes using two preclinical animal models.  The protective immunity generated after DNA vaccination against the well-known HLA-A2.1 restricted HPV16 E7 82-90 epitope was first examined using the CRPV/HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbit model.  Infectious CRPV genomes were developed by embedding the epitope within the E7 gene or the L2 gene using two alternative strategies.  Protective vaccination studies carried out with these two genomes indicated that this epitope was processed and presented from its position within either the E7 protein or the L2 protein, as epitope vaccinated HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbits were protected against viral DNA challenge.  These studies also revealed that the CRPV genome contains areas of plasticity within both the E7 and the L2 genes that are amenable to PCR induced modification and suggested that while an epitope expressed during a late time point of a natural papillomavirus infection could be targeted by cell mediated immunity, early expressed epitopes are more readily targeted by cellular immunity.    \nIt has long been known that route of delivery can have an impact on the immune-stimulating capacity of vaccines.  In head to head experiments comparing two vaccination strategies, rabbit groups were vaccinated three times at three-week intervals using the tattoo gun or gene gun followed by challenge with the wild type CRPV genome or an epitope-modified CRPV genome.  These protective vaccination studies indicated that DNA vaccination through tattooing or with a gene gun yielded similar levels of protection.  Thus the tattoo gun is a simple, useful, and cost-effective alternative to the gene gun and produces comparable results in the CRPV/HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbit model.  The focus of the third data chapter was the validation of new HLA-A2.1 restricted HPV16 E7 epitopes identified by bioinformatics.  To examine the binding affinity and stability of the peptide/MHC complex, various in vitro assays were performed.  The immunogenicity of these potential HPV16E7 epitopes was determined in vivo through peptide and DNA vaccination of HHD mice.  HLA-A2-restricted HPV16 E7 epitopes that stimulated epitope-specific CTLs in the HHD mice after peptide vaccination were considered potential epitopes for continued testing.  Of the seven candidate epitopes tested, four were immunogenic in vivo.  Additional studies to examine the vaccine-induced epitope-specific protective immune responses generated to two of these epitopes were performed using the CRPV/HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbit model.  DNA vaccination was followed by challenge with modified CRPV genomes containing each epitope embedded in the E6 or E7 genes.  The data collected from these studies suggested that the C-terminus region of the E7 gene has plasticity and is more amenable to PCR modification than the tested regions within the E6 gene.  Additionally, HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbits vaccinated against a newly discovered HPV16 E7 epitope were partially protected from challenge with the epitope-modified CRPV genome containing this epitope embedded in the E7 gene.  \nSupplementary projects demonstrated that both the CRPV E6 and CRPV E7 genes are permissive for epitope-modification and that genome position, as well as epitope sequence, affect the stimulating capacity of individual epitopes.  Moreover, the CRPV/HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbit model is a useful and versatile tool for exploring the vaccine generated immunity in a model of natural papillomavirus infection and the use of both HHD mice and HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbits to evaluate predicted epitopes overcomes the individual limitations of each HPV preclinical animal model.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [960], "author_name_tesi": "Bounds, Callie E", "last_name_ssi": "Bounds", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Callie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil David Christensen", "Neil David Christensen", "Todd Schell", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "David Joseph Spector", "Laura Carrel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Neil David Christensen, Dissertation Advisor", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Chair", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gene Gun", "HLA-A2.1 Rabbits", "DNA Vaccines", "CRPV", "HPV", "HHD mice"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Antecedents Associated With Mentor Functions Received and Career Outcomes Reported by Proteges and Non-Mentored Employees", "id": "6260", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1696", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-02-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examined the associations between personal and organizational antecedents and mentor functions received and intrinsic and extrinsic career outcomes for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and for non-mentored individuals.

However, the mechanisms by which ceramide induces these cellular phenotypes are unclear at this time.  Our studies establish a new paradigm for actions of lipid-derived second messengers: coordinating assembly of multi-factoral signaling complexes.\n\n\n     The Stress-Activated Protein Kinase (SAPK) pathway has been implicated in cell growth arrest and/or apoptosis.  In addition, studies have linked ceramide with activation of the SAPK cascade.  However, the mechanism by which ceramide leads to activation of this cascade is unclear at this time.  Our studies demonstrate that ceramide activates the SAPK cascade via direct activation of Protein Kinase C zeta (PKCz) in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293).  Upon activation by ceramide, PKCz forms a signaling complex with upstream components of the SAPK cascade, including MEKK1 and SEK1.

We and others have shown that the inhibitory action of ceramide on cell growth involves inhibition of the ERK pathway.  Therefore, we investigated the mechanism by which ceramide inhibits this pathway.  Our studies demonstrate that ceramide inhibits PKC epsilon activity and subsequent interaction with upstream components of the ERK cascade.

Thousands of companies are increasingly realizing the tremendous capability of the World Wide Web as a selling channel and, consequently, integrating e-business into their business models. Like businesses across all industries, hotels are adapting to this new environment and working vigorously to use web sites to communicate directly with travelers and offer customers the ability to search information and book an entire trip online. Recent research suggests that one of the key elements in a successful commercial web site is its design; the success or failure of any particular business is based in large part on the quality of the design of the company\u2019s web site. One of the most important design elements in commercial web sites may be their interactivity. As a critical concept in computer-mediated communications, the interactivity of a web site is known to be a key motivation of consumers\u2019 use of the Internet, an important determinant of web site quality, and one that leads to a positive attitude toward the site. Despite its value, little is understood about the nature and role of interactivity on hotel web sites and its impact on travelers\u2019 attitudes and behaviors. However, studies that provide insight into the strengths, facets, potential, and influences of the interactivity of hotel web sites were not found.\nIn the present study, the researcher examined if the increased level of interactivity of a web site had positive effects on the web users\u2019 attitudes, behaviors, and experience online in the context of hotel web sites, a crucial point of debate among researchers and an assumption that is inconclusive, contradictory, and inconsistent in the extant literature. The researcher also examined the consequences of actual user-site interactivity, specifically how actual user-site interactivity, i.e., from a behavioral perspective rather than an intentional perspective, influences web users\u2019 attitudes and behaviors toward web sites. Last, the researcher examined if there was an interaction effect of the level of feature-based interactivity and actual user-site interactivity on the users\u2019 perceived quality of the site, attitude toward the site, attitude toward the brand, perceived interactivity of the site, intention to revisit and recommend the site to others, and overall experience online. While building on and maintaining sustainability with extant work, a conceptual model was developed to examine feature-based interactivity and actual user-site interactivity as two important determinants of Web users\u2019 perceptions, attitudes, behavioral intentions, and overall experience online in the context of hotel web sites. \nA computer-based experimental study was conducted with nine Jamaican hotel web sites in which feature-based interactivity varied at three levels: low, medium, and high. These web sites were evaluated by 137 participants in order to identify how the level of feature-based interactivity of a web site impacts actual user-site interactivity, and how both variables influence web participants\u2019 attitudes, behaviors, and experiences online. The techniques for the data analysis included descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, independent-samples, t tests, one-way ANOVA, and multiple regression analysis.\nThe results of these analyses indicated that the higher the level of feature-based interactivity of a web site, the greater the participants\u2019 perceived quality of the site, attitude toward the site, attitude toward the brand, perceived interactivity of the site, intention to revisit and recommend the site to others, and overall experience online was supported.  Additionally, results indicated that a high degree of user interactivity with a site did yield a more favorable attitude and behavior online. Last, there was a significant main effect of perceived quality of the web site, attitude toward the web site, brand attitude, and perceived interactivity of the web site on the participants\u2019 overall experience online, intention to revisit the web site, and intention to recommend the web site to others.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4426], "author_name_tesi": "Boushra, Manal ", "last_name_ssi": "Boushra", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Manal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Hotel, Restaurant, and Institutional Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Allen Cranage", "Carolyn U Lambert", "Elwood Lewis Shafer", "William L Harkness"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Allen Cranage, Committee Chair", "Carolyn U Lambert, Committee Chair", "Elwood Lewis Shafer, Committee Member", "William L Harkness, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["level of interactivity", "interactivity of web site", "web site", "web users attitudes"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Effectiveness of the State Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Program for Consumers with Hearing Impairments\n", "id": "7065", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1462", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of the state federal vocational rehabilitation (VR) program is to assist consumers with disabilities to secure and maintain competitive employment.

However, there is no consensus among political scientists and economists about whether aid is actually a productive means of achieving either of these ends, nor on what political and strategic factors may lead aid to have beneficial or deleterious effects.  My dissertation examines several factors that condition the effectiveness of foreign aid (U.S. foreign aid in particular) in gaining cooperation from and boosting the capacity of recipient states in the realm of counterterrorism.  Specifically, I am interested in what factors may cause foreign aid to have perverse effects on cooperation, and in what contexts those factors operate.  For instance, I argue that recipients of U.S. assistance who are also involved in an interstate rivalry have incentive to play-up the level of terrorist activity in order to continue receiving assistance to finance their rivalry.  Similarly, I find that the effect of foreign aid on counterterrorism cooperation varies across domestic political structures, with foreign aid leading to the opposite of its intended effect in regimes characterized by personalist political institutions. Finally, in the latter part of the dissertation, I attempt to move toward a more direct test of the relationship between foreign aid and terrorism. The current state of knowledge is simply a consensus that some  association exists, though there is even disagreement over the true direction of that relationship.  In my view, the reason for this is that a critical link in this process has been overlooked: the changes that occur in host states' behavior as a result of them receiving aid.  To address this shortcoming, I conduct detailed case comparisons of two pairs of cases. The first pair of cases is selected based on the presence or absence of interstate rivalry (Pakistan and Bangladesh), while the second set contains variation on regime type (Indonesia and Yemen). This case selection strategy provides some inferential leverage to determine whether differential counterterrorism outcomes are attributable to this variation between cases. Furthermore, case comparisons allow me to explore in greater detail counterterrorism effort in a variety of contexts, a concept that has yet to be measured quantitatively.

Of particular interest in the field of origami engineering is self-folding, in which an origami-inspired design is capable of folding (and unfolding) into a specified target shape using one or more active materials. While several modeling methods have been utilized previously to simulate origami-inspired designs, none have the capacity to quickly simulate an entire self-folding model. In this work, a dynamic model of self-folding origami structures is developed to enable a simulation-based approach to the design of these novel structures.\nIn the dynamic model, the flat panels in an origami structure are modeled as rigid links and the creases as joints with torsional stiffness and damping. These approximations are qualitatively validated through the modeling and investigation of a bistable origami waterbomb base and a deployable optical shield planned for use in a future NASA mission. In both cases, the dynamic model allows for investigation of the kinematics as well as the forces developed in the joints, yielding interesting new insights into both designs. These insights include a quantitative exploration of how the energy stored in the waterbomb as it is displaced from its stable equilibrium position leads to its bistable nature and a distinct, oscillatory pattern found in both the deployment motion and joint forces of the deployable optical shield. \nTo enable the dynamic simulation of self-folding, approximations of two active materials used previously for self-folding, namely, magneto-active elastomer (MAE) and electroactive polymer (EAP), are developed for use in the dynamic model. Each approximation is validated through the comparison of a self-folding experiment with a corresponding dynamic model, resulting in good correlation between simulated and experimental results. A multi-field structure that uses both active materials is then designed, and, upon fabrication and experimentation, is found to correlate well with simulated results. With the self-folding model validated, it can be used in the design of new self-folding structures.\nIn order to better determine active material placement and minimize the amount of material required for a given design, the dynamic model is integrated with a trade space exploration software: the ARL Trade Space Visualizer. Using this software, the entire trade space of a self-folding structure can be readily explored, and the optimal designs determined. This process is utilized to optimize magneto-active material orientations and placements for two different origami structures. This same process can also be used to determine EAP amounts and placements.\nFinally, a generalized optimization framework for the design of self-folding origami structures is presented that incorporates many of the concepts developed in this work into a sequential series of tasks, with each specific task described in detail along with associated inputs and outputs. This framework is meant to streamline the complicated and multidisciplinary nature of self-folding design optimization. A specific implementation of the framework utilizing the dynamic model and trade space exploration is then detailed and used to successfully design a self-folding origami-inspired carton. The developed dynamic model, trade space exploration method, and associated self-folding design optimization framework can be used as tools for the development of future origami-inspired designs and structures.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12409], "author_name_tesi": "Bowen, Landen Albert", "last_name_ssi": "Bowen", "middle_name_ssi": "Albert", "first_name_ssi": "Landen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker", "Timothy William Simpson", "Paris R Vonlockette", "Zoubeida Ounaies", "Namiko Yamamoto"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker, Dissertation Advisor", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Chair", "Paris R Vonlockette, Committee Member", "Zoubeida Ounaies, Committee Member", "Namiko Yamamoto, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["origami", "compliant mechanisms", "dynamic modeling", "self-folding"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "AN INVESTIGATION OF TRABECULAR BONE MORPHOLOGY\n", "id": "10466", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "205", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Osteoporosis and other age-associated diseases are proving to have complex etiologies stemming from the fact that most are multifactorial in nature and are largely attributed to the combined effects of many genes and gene-environment interactions.  Osteoporosis results in low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, especially of trabecular bone.  In this work we located quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with many properties of tibial trabecular bone in two ages of laboratory mice.  Interesting trends were evident in the QTL identified at 500 and 800 days of age.  Some QTL were found in both age groups.  These QTL may prove to be important across the lifespan in building and maintaining bone tissue.  Other QTL were only identified at one age point.  These may indicate genetic influences that occur at specific times in development. Several loci were identified in both sexes while others appear to be sex-specific. \n\nThrough examination of recombinant inbred strains of mice, we have also been able to measure age-related changes in the microarchitecture of trabecular bone and identify QTL related to the age-related changes. Analyzing the QTL specifically related to the changes seen with age has provided several additional sites likely harbouring important genes effecting how bone is lost or gained with age.   \n\nAccurate research results of the architecture and density of trabecular bone depend on reliable, consistent data collection.

Astronomy is thought to be especially spatially-complex because it requires using a space-based perspective to explain phenomena we see from an Earth-based perspective. For example, it requires using a physical model of the Earth and Sun to explain Sun\u2019s apparent motion. Thus, spatial perspective-taking skills (i.e., recognizing a scene or an array of objects from various vantage points) are hypothesized to be particularly important to learn astronomy. It is not until around 8- to 9-years that children are able to infer the view from complex perspectives other than their own \u2018self\u2019 perspective (Piaget & Inhelder, 1957). Children\u2019s perspective-taking skills positively correlate to their understanding of celestial motion; however, it is unclear whether having high perspective-taking skills causally facilitates understanding. \n\nThe current study provided 8- to 9-year-olds with perspective-taking activities prior to teaching about celestial motion to see if the training would facilitate children's understanding of astronomical phenomena. An experimental group participated in relative position and motion activities in large, outdoor and in-room-size environments (devoid of astronomy content). A control group participated in other activities in the same space for the same amount of time without explicit perspective-taking instruction. Before and after training and astronomy instruction, all children were given a general perspective-taking task (\u201ccircles\u201d) and a multiple-choice astronomy test along with an astronomy interview at post-test. Three transfer perspective-taking tasks were given at immediate post-test to examine the impact of training on perspective-taking skills. The circles task and astronomy test were given one-week later.\n\nResults indicate that the experimental group demonstrated better understanding of celestial motion as assessed by the astronomy interview, but not by the multiple-choice astronomy test. The training also significantly increased performance on the circles task at both immediate and one-week sessions. There was, however, no main effect of training on success on the other three perspective-taking tasks.

Native tissues present a range of fiber diameters from 10\u2019s of nanometers to several microns during homeostasis and natural tissue reconstruction. The purpose of this dissertation was to understand cell migration through mechanosensitive signaling pathways that respond to \u2018out-of-plane\u2019 curvature. AIM 1 was to characterize the cellular morphology on nanofibers and to develop direct diameter control. A non-degradable high molecular weight poly(methyl methacrylate), was used to electrospin fibers of 5 diameters and to spin coat a flat surface control. Cell area was significantly smaller on all fibers compared to the flat surface control, arising from a smaller short axis on fibers. Serial block face electron microscopy and nanoComputed Tomography have demonstrated that the cell membrane conforms to the fiber shape. AIM 2 was to measure the cellular velocity dependence on nanofiber diameter. Human mesenchymal stem cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed increased migration velocity on the middle range fiber diameters (250 to 500 nm). When exploring a larger range there was a relative velocity peak at ~500 nm in diameter, with another at about 1500 nm. Interestingly, the velocity decreased to a value similar to the flat surface control when the diameter reached ~2000 nm. Finally in AIM 3, the mechanotransduction pathways regulated by \u2018our-of-plane\u2019 curvature were investigated. The effect of inhibiting ROCK and cdc42 followed the trend of the flat surface when cells were on the ~2000nm fibers. Differential activation states of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) and signaling partner Src followed trends seen in the migration velocity. Since the length of focal adhesions did not match velocity trends, the size of focal adhesions may be decoupled from activation on 3D substrates. We find that nanofiber based migration is a plastic process in which a cell can display lobopodial and mesenchymal migration modes. When considered alongside stem cell differentiation dependence on diameter, we are building a framework from which we can rationally design bioinstructive scaffolds for tissue regeneration.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16207], "author_name_tesi": "Bowers, Daniel Thorn", "last_name_ssi": "Bowers", "middle_name_ssi": "Thorn", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Justin L.

The immobilization and remediation of strontium from the environment and the remaining stored waste are issues of great importance to the US DOE and populations surrounding the storage facilities: a portion of any strontium-90 ingested from contaminated food or drinking water will be incorporated into bone mass, leading to bone defects in minors and cancer in adults.  In order to design appropriate waste remediation strategies and predict the mobility of strontium in the environment, it is necessary to understand the interactions of strontium with soil minerals and remediation materials on the molecular level.  This dissertation seeks to enhance our grasp of strontium-mineral interactions through solid-state strontium-87 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  The first series of studies examines the effectiveness of magic angle spinning (MAS) at improving the sensitivity and resolution of strontium-87 NMR spectra.  While this technique is effective for materials with a negligible electric field gradient, both experimental and theoretical results show that MAS is not effective at improving sensitivity or the interpretability of strontium-87 resonances with quadrupolar couplings larger than 10 MHz.  The remaining studies probe the effectiveness of more complex pulse sequences at enhancing sensitivity and characterizing the strontium binding structure.  The quadrupolar Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (QCPMG) pulse sequence combined with a double frequency sweep (DFS) preparatory pulse at a 21.14 T static field is shown to provide significant sensitivity enhancement, enabling strontium detection in complex materials.  The QCPMG and DFS-QCPMG sequences are used at 21.14 T to characterize the strontium binding structure in a number of inorganic and organic crystalline systems where the structure is known, establishing the relationship between the local strontium binding structure and strontium quadrupolar parameters.  These relationships are used along with fluorine-19 MAS NMR and x-ray diffraction to analyze the strontium binding site in a number of synthetic and natural strontium-sorbing phyllosilicate minerals and other environmentally relevant materials in the remainder of the dissertation.

Despite their potential to reduce the negative effects of incarceration and provide increased supervision to offenders in the community, scholars agree that intermediate punishments are substantially underused.  Furthermore, jurisdictions display wide variation in their imposition of intermediate punishments.  Although a long line of research has investigated the effects of individual-, court-, and community-level factors on the outcomes of criminal sentencing proceedings, these studies have largely focused on traditional in/out decisions and neglected the imposition of intermediate punishments.  Given that intermediate punishments are relatively newer than traditional probation or incarceration and require access to substantial amounts of community-level resources, it is likely that their imposition is particularly dependent on the effects of community-level variables.  In particular, the imposition of intermediate punishments may be contingent on the availability of necessary resources in the community, such as drug treatment capacity and access to state and federal criminal justice funding.  \n     \n     This thesis extends previous research by examining the multilevel predictors of the imposition of intermediate punishments.  Using 2004-2008 data from the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing (PCS), I examined the effects of individual- and county-level variables on the imposition of intermediate punishments.  Analyses revealed that the best predictors of the imposition of intermediate punishments were individual-level variables.  Novice drug offenders who were convicted of relatively serious drug offenses composed the majority of IP recipients.  Offense severity, prior record, gender, race, and trial disposition significantly affected the odds of receiving IP.  At the county-level, a county\u2019s receipt of CIP funding significantly increased the odds that offenders would receive IP.  In addition, a county\u2019s poverty rate significantly and positively affected the odds of receiving IP.  \n    \n     Several cross-level interaction effects, between offender characteristics and county-level resources, were identified.  Although many of these interaction effects were largely due to the effects of Philadelphia County, three interaction effects were consistent across models:  (1) the interaction between offense type and a county\u2019s receipt of CIP funding; (2) the interaction between offenders\u2019 simultaneous, lesser drug conviction status and the presence of county-jail based substance abuse treatment; and (3) the interaction between offenders\u2019 race and the percentage of a county\u2019s residents who were black. \n\n     Among offenders sentenced in counties that received CIP funding, drug offenders had the highest odds of receiving IP.  In contrast, among offenders sentenced in counties that did not receive CIP funding, other types of offenders had the highest odds of receiving IP.  The presence of CIP funding had the largest effect on the odds of receiving IP among property offenders.  Among offenders sentenced in counties with jail-based substance abuse treatment, the odds of receiving IP were higher among offenders with simultaneous, lesser drug convictions than among offenders without similar convictions.  The reverse was true among offenders sentenced in counties without jail-based substance abuse treatment.  The black-white disparity in the odds of receiving IP was highest in counties with the lowest percentages of residents who were black.  As the percentage of a county\u2019s residents neared its maximum, the odds of receiving IP among black and white offenders converged.  \n\n     Offense type and the presence of a day reporting center within the county also significantly interacted to affect the odds of receiving IP, though this interaction was significant only when Philadelphia was excluded from the analyses.  The odds of receiving IP were higher among drug offenders who were sentenced in counties with day reporting centers relative to those who were sentenced in counties without day reporting centers.  In contrast, the odds of receiving IP were lower among personal, property, and other types of offenders who were sentenced in counties with day reporting centers relative to those who were sentenced in counties without day reporting centers.\n\n     The present findings indicate that, although IP was considerably underused, judges were imposing IP in a relatively consistent and appropriate manner.  Drug-involved offenders, who, relative to other offenders, were most likely in greater need of the intensive treatment opportunities offered to IP recipients, had the highest odds of receiving IP.   Sentencing offenders to IP not only offered them the opportunity to  receive intensive treatment, but also likely relieved pressure on counties\u2019, as well as the state\u2019s, correctional systems.  Hesitancy on the part of judges may account for the considerable underuse of IP.  IP-specific guidelines may be one way in which to increase the use of IP and reduce the significant racial bias in its imposition.     \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5553], "author_name_tesi": "Bowles, Sarah  Elizabeth ", "last_name_ssi": "Bowles", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth ", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah ", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback", "Richard Barry Ruback"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback, Thesis Advisor", "Richard Barry Ruback, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["drug offenders", "intermediate punishments", "sentencing"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "PERCEPTUAL PATTERNS OF INVOLVEMENT  MANAGEMENT AND EFFECTIVENESS IN PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION", "id": "7051", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1215", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The limitations of the traditional hierarchical method of organizing have been documented in the public administration literature.

Recalling studied information to facilitate rejection of new items at retrieval has been termed \u2018recollection rejection\u2019 and is an excellent strategy for suppressing false memories.

Results demonstrated that recollection rejection engaged a fronto-parietal network that has been posited to support retrieval monitoring processes.

Further, no neuroimaging study has done so. In particular, given age deficits in true recollection processing, it is possible that difficulties engaging recollection represent a common cause of age-related deficits in true memories and age-related increases in false memories. However, while the present study revealed a behavioral age deficit that was specific to rejecting related lures using recollection rejection, very few neural differences between age groups were identified. While there was some evidence of age-related increases in neural activity associated with recollection rejection, there was far more neural activity that was common across age groups.

Furthermore, operational use of a large class of the highly utilized axisymmetric undersea vehicle design sometimes requires unplanned and unforeseen mission payload weight and mass distribution changes. This research aims to provide the vehicle designer with a platform that enables faster implementation of confident design changes from an assessment while suppressing the level of uncertainty in resulting undersea vehicle flight performance and maneuverability. Unlike the narrow focus of many current undersea vehicle design assessments, this research simultaneously evaluates the broader impacts and benefits of changeability to common mechanical system design parameters and autopilot design. Two non-dimensional parameters that encompass the common changes to undersea vehicle weight configurations are defined. Additionally, the robustness of a well-tuned fixed weight configuration autopilot for an undersea vehicle is assessed against perturbed vehicle weight configuration models. Results are presented through evaluations of steady level flight, steady turn, and steady depth change flight performance simulations. The results suggest that a baseline autopilot is robust to changes in weight configuration but at the cost of steady state depth errors. The observed steady state depth errors are an outcome of the new trim characteristics of the perturbed weight configuration vehicle for which the baseline autopilot was not designed to accommodate.

Upon initial infection in B cells, EBV expresses a repertoire of 9 latency-associated proteins (EBNA1, -2, -3A, -3B, -3C, -LP, LMP1, -2A, and -2B) to modulate host cellular pathways, promoting survival and proliferation of EBV-infected B cells.  Lifelong infection is achieved by expressing a series of latency programs in which latency genes are progressively downregulated to avoid immune surveillance and ensure persistent infection.  EBV contributes to both lymphoid and epithelial cell malignancies, and is notably linked to the development of Burkitt lymphoma (BL).  This dissertation investigates contributions of EBV latency-associated proteins to the pathogenesis of EBV infection.  Our studies focused on the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3A (EBNA3A), and in particular, the mechanisms by which EBNA3A drives proliferation of a unique and aggressive subset of BL tumors that exhibit a W promoter-restricted form of latency (Wp-R).  Using shRNA-mediated knock-down, we determined that EBNA3A is essential for growth of Wp-R, as EBNA3A knock-down results in abrupt G0/G1 cell cycle arrest followed by induction of apoptosis.  Increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 was detected, correlating with the onset of cell cycle arrest.  EBNA3A-mediated repression of p21 was required to maintain hyperphosphorylation of Rb and promote cell cycle progression.  Additionally, EBNA3A repressed p53-dependent transcriptional activation of p21.  Whereas typical BL (Latency I) displays mutant p53, Wp-R BL contains wild-type p53.  EBNA3A counteracted the wild-type status of p53 in Wp-R and inhibited induction of p53-responsive gene products.  EBNA3A did not alter p53 transcription, but rather protein expression of p53 was elevated following EBNA3A knock-down.  EBNA3A likely regulates p53 protein stability via interactions with HDM2.  Both EBNA3A and the related family member, EBNA3C, were required for proliferation of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), but we found EBNA3C was dispensable for proliferation of Wp-R and did not affect p21 levels.  Additionally, EBNA3A, but not EBNA3C, activated expression of the oncogenic microRNA, microRNA-155 (miR-155), which may contribute to p21 repression.  Here we identify a unique role for EBNA3A in repressing transcriptional activation of p53 target genes, including p21, to promote cell cycle progression.

Ni-coated Al particles are of particular interest for two reasons.   The Ni-coating prevents the particles from forming agglomerates due to the protective nickel layer.  Intermetallic reactions between the nickel and aluminum are exothermic, giving an additional energy feedback to start the Al particle ignition.  Two particle sizes (nominally 32 &#956;m and 9 &#956;m in diameter) were examined in this study.  Since the coated and uncoated particles are from the same batch any differences between the ignition and combustion behaviors can be directly attributed to the effect of the Ni-coating.  The ignition and combustion properties of the aluminum particles were examined in the post-flame zone of a multi-diffusion flat-flame (a modified Hencken burner) at atmospheric pressure.  Isolated, single particles are burned in this experimental setup so the exothermic heating from the Ni-Al intermetallic reaction is of particular interest.  This study shows that the applied nickel coating decreased the ignition temperature of the Al particles by 750 K on average for 32 &#61549;m particles and by 300 K for smaller 9 &#61549;m particles.  These results are plotted against an effective oxidizer factor that takes into account the strength of O2, H2O, and CO2 in the oxidation reaction of aluminum.   Combustion times were measured by optical techniques to determine how the applied nickel coating would affect the combustion time.

The New York Times, in particular, has about eight front-page stories a day.  The policy issues captured in these stories send critical cues to politicians and citizens alike about which issues are important and, by exclusion, which are not. We know media attention can influence opinion and policy, but we know relatively little about the mechanisms by which this attention is distributed.  How do issues become front-page news? \nI develop a theory of media dynamics to explain patterns of front-page attention.  With too much information, limited agenda space, and complex institutional constraints, the media processes information disproportionately.  That is, the media does not attend to issues in proportion with their severity, nor does it keep pace with real-world changes over time.  Instead, the agenda tends to get stuck in equilibrium, centered on the same few issues day after day.  Meanwhile, information continues to unfold in all issue areas.  When the information build-up about a non-agenda issue becomes too large to ignore, attention lurches to that issue, overhauling the previous status quo.  The result: Front-page attention is skewed across issues; a few issues get the vast majority of coverage.  Additionally, changes in attention are disproportionately distributed; rather than shifting incrementally, the agenda displays periods of stasis punctuated by dramatic upheaval.  \nAgainst this foundation of media information-processing dynamics, I identify eight key variables that shape the content of front-page news: real-world events, prior attention, front-page congestion, scope of discussion, journalistic obligations and norms, entrepreneurial activity, public opinion, and political context.  I test my theory of how policy issues become front-page news using an original dataset of all New York Times front-page stories, 2000\u20132005, coded by issue (some 18,000 stories in all).  I document the skewed distribution of attention across issues and the disproportionate changes in the agenda over time.  And I develop a statistical model of front-page attention that confirms my expectations about the effects of specific variables on the news-selection process.  \nI give special examination to the scope of discussion\u2014that is, the degree to which media coverage of a policy issue is concentrated on a small number of dimensions or spread across a wide range of dimensions.  My analysis suggests that scope and attention have a mutually reinforcing influence on one another.  An increase in media attention to an issue offers more \u201croom\u201d for the scope of discussion about the issue to expand.  At the same time, when the scope of a debate widens the additional perspectives make the issue more salient, thereby attracting more attention to the issue.   Under the right conditions, the reinforcing link between scope and attention can lead to an attention cascade.  \nThis study shows how front-page news, while impossible to forecast on a daily basis, exhibits strong and predictable patterns over time.  Usually, institutional constraints leave the media in a holding pattern, fixating on current hot issues.  But this equilibrium will always be disrupted\u2014it\u2019s just a matter of when, and by what issue.  And when the agenda changes, it does so explosively, fueled by shifts in specific event and non-event variables, including the scope of discussion.  The result is that front-page attention is very difficult to control.  Policy entrepreneurs hoping to manage the spin of an issue will be sorely disappointed.  But for advocates wanting to raise awareness of an issue, the best strategy is clear: Instead of saying the message louder, diversify the message itself.

CH4 and NO were the most important intermediate species, with smaller percentages of CH2O, N2O, HNO, and HONO present. The first stage was marked by decomposition of nitromethane, the second by consumption of all intermediate species except CH4 and NO, and final by rise to final temperature and\nspecies concentrations. Sensitivity analysis identified the importance of HNO reactions\nto the temperature profile, and therefore burning rate. Although the absolute levels of NH and HCO were low, they served as an important intermediate species transporting nitrogen and carbon, respectively, between other higher-concentration species.\n\nAlthough chemically nitromethane should be simpler than energetic molecules such as nitramines, the combustion characteristics (no stable combustion at low pressure and very thin reaction zone) made it more difficult to study. Many of the techniques that have been applied to nitramines cannot be used with nitromethane because of its nature as\na clear liquid. Future refinement of the current model can be aided by the development of higher-resolution measurement techniques or methods to stretch the nitromethane reaction zone so that current techniques can more easily resolve species and temperature profiles.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2640], "author_name_tesi": "Boyer, J.

Cross-correlation functions of ambient seismic noise recorded from 2007-2011 were calculated between 77 seismic stations located in Tanzania, Zambia, Kenya, and Uganda. Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves were obtained from the cross-correlation functions, as well as from over 200 earthquakes recorded between 1990 and 2009 at 23 stations. The group velocities at periods of 8 to 30 seconds were inverted to create group velocity maps for the study area. Using these maps, group velocity dispersion curves were obtained for equally spaced grid nodes across the region and then inverted with phase velocity dispersion curves from Adams et al.

Experimental results from other studies show that velocities in siltstones and sandstones (sediments comprising much of the Karoo basin) reach velocities as high as 2.8-3.0 km/s and shear wave velocities of clays and marls (sediments comprising much of the coastal basins) reach velocities as high as 2.5-2.7 km/s. Using upper limits of 3.0 km/s and 2.7 km/s for the average shear wave velocities for the Karoo and coastal sediments, the thicknesses of the basins were estimated.

Although research has been conducted regarding stigma associated with stuttering, no research to date has analyzed different theoretical levels of stigma and how these relate to aspects of psychological well-being among adults who stutter. The purpose of this study was to create a psychometrically sound scale that measured different levels of internalized stigma (i.e., self-stigma) and analyze their relationships to self-esteem, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction. It was hypothesized that the experimental scale would demonstrate acceptable psychometric properties and that stigma self-concurrence would be negatively related to self-esteem, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with life among adults who stutter. Participants were 291 adults who stutter (ages 18 or older) recruited from the National Stuttering Association, as well as Board Recognized Specialists in Fluency Disorders. A Web-based survey including the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Satisfaction With Life Scale, and the Perceived Stuttering Severity Scale was given to participants along with an experimental scale called the Self-Stigma of Stuttering Scale, or 4S, intended to measure self-stigma of people who stutter. The 4S demonstrated adequate reliability and signs of initial construct validity. Factor analysis revealed underlying components supportive of the hypothesized multidimensional model of stigma. Stigma self-concurrence, and to a lesser extent stereotype agreement, were negatively correlated with self-esteem, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, even beyond perceived stuttering severity. Stigma self-concurrence was a significant predictor of self-esteem, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction among people who stutter, above and beyond demographic and stuttering-related variables. It is concluded that many people who stutter are resilient and can buffer self-esteem, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction even in the face of public stigma. However, those who internalize stigma and apply stigmatizing attitudes to themselves experience lower levels of psychological well-being.

Of equal importance is the availability of test methods that can provide an accurate and reliable measure of the required engineering properties of the material. For routine applications in material characterization, selected test methods should be reliable, simple, quick, repeatable, and cost e\ufb00ective. The use of nondestructive test (NDT) methods has proven to provide such characterization capabilities. Among those methods, the impact resonance (IR) test is a vibration based NDT method, and has been increasingly used for asphalt concrete evaluation and characterization in the past two decades. The majority of studies regarding the IR test in asphalt concrete applications have been focused on comparison of the IR test moduli with the moduli obtained from conventional asphalt concrete dynamic modulus tests and the predictive equations. In this dissertation, the IR test was utilized to characterize the properties of asphalt concrete mixtures and recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) binder through mixture testing at a range of temperatures. To this e\ufb00ect, several independent studies were conducted.\nThe second order equation of motion assumption in rheological modeling of the IR test response was evaluated for asphalt concrete testing. A set of asphalt concrete specimens was tested with the IR test, and the obtained signals at a range of temperatures were evaluated by means of the Hankel matrix method. The results showed that the assumption is violated for asphalt concrete testing, especially at high temperatures, mainly due to the presence of noise in the obtained response. However, the Hankel method was employed to filter out the noise. It was seen that the assumption could be employed for asphalt concrete at a range of temperatures including high temperatures, provided that the filtering is performed on the obtained signal. The results also showed that the employed filtering procedure produced improvements for the IR test material dependent responses, resonant frequency and especially damping ratio calculations.\nThe IR test results are influenced by specimen size and testing configurations. A study was conducted to investigate the influence of aspect ratio (length/diameter) of laboratory specimens on the frequency response of asphalt concrete when tested with the IR. The IR test, performed in a longitudinal mode, demonstrated that the test is repeatable and reproducible. The test results indicated that the frequency response increased as the aspect ratio increased approximately up to 0.7, and then it decreased with a nonlinear trend as the aspect ratio increased beyond 0.7, indicating that the tendency of the frequency response reached a plateau as the aspect ratio increased. It was inferred from the test results that there was a threshold aspect ratio at which the fundamental longitudinal frequency mode was not the dominant frequency mode. Velocity calculations from measured resonant frequencies indicated that the true material properties for the longitudinal mode could be attained at an aspect ratio of as low as 1.\nIn another study, the sensitivity of the resonant frequency response of the IR testing of asphalt concrete to asphalt concrete mixture parameters was investigated. The IR tests were performed on disk-shaped asphalt concrete specimens at the transverse (flexural) mode of vibration at a temperature range of approximately -10 to 50oC. Test results revealed that the relationship between the resonant frequency and temperature was described by a polynomial fit, and it was shown through statistical analysis that the slopes of the fit were significantly a\ufb00ected by mixture parameters such as air void content and binder content. Also, the statistical formulation (predictive model) between the resonant frequency and the asphalt concrete mixture parameters were established for a given aggregate gradation of nominal maximum size and an aggregate specific gravity. The prediction accuracy of the model was evaluated by independent data sets, and the test results indicated that the maximum error between the measured and predicted resonant frequencies was not more than 9 percent.\nIn an e\ufb00ort to characterize the properties of recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) binder with the IR test through asphalt concrete mixture testing, two approaches were utilized. An approach is proposed for determination of binder properties through the IR testing of mixtures with RAP and binders with known engineering properties. The IR tests were performed in the longitudinal mode at a range of temperatures between 3 and 35oC. Also, RAP binder and virgin binders were tested using dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) at the same temperature range as the IR testing. It was seen that the IR test ranked the expected trend of binder sti\ufb00ness with respect to the resonant frequency of mixtures. The results indicate the potential of the proposed concept and feasibility of the approach in determining binder properties, including properties of the RAP binder. A practical method is proposed for determination of binder properties based on mixture testing.\nIn the second approach, the IR test potential to characterize the low-temperature properties of an RAP binder that incorporated a rejuvenating agent was investigated. This approach included testing of mixes with virgin binders and pure RAP mixes treated with a rejuvenating agent at di\ufb00erent levels using the IR, as well as testing of blends of recovered RAP binder, rejuvenator, and virgin binder using bending beam rheometer (BBR). The results showed that the IR test can properly rank the expected sti\ufb00ness of binders through mixture testing. The results also indicated high linear correlations between mixture properties obtained from the IR test (modulus and phase angle) and binder properties obtained from the BBR test (sti\ufb00ness and m-value, a relaxation index). The results clearly demonstrate the potential of IR to be used for grading and optimization for the asphalt binder of RAP and rejuvenator content in lieu of the binder recovery method.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13665], "author_name_tesi": "Boz, Ilker ", "last_name_ssi": "Boz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ilker", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mansour Solaimanian", "Mansour Solaimanian", "Shelley Marie Stoffels", "Tong Qiu", "Durland Laurence Shumway", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden III"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mansour Solaimanian, Dissertation Advisor", "Mansour Solaimanian, Committee Chair", "Shelley Marie Stoffels, Committee Member", "Tong Qiu, Committee Member", "Durland Laurence Shumway, Outside Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden III, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Impact Resonance Test", "Resonant Frequency", "Asphalt Concrete", "RAP", "Modulus", "Characterization"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE ROLE OF ACCOUNTING-BASED FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN PREVENTING SUBSTANTIVE DEFAULTS OF PUBLIC DEBT ", "id": "12405", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6968", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This paper hypothesizes that the presence of accounting-based financial (ABF) covenants in public debt will have an impact on a lender's ability to monitor and the borrower's response to enhanced monitoring, leading to a reduced likelihood of substantive defaults.  Because of the relative ease of their monitoring, ABF covenants may serve to increase the frequency of technical defaults.  It is hypothesized, however, that this same characteristic of ABF covenants would reduce the likelihood of substantive default since the presence of ABF covenants provides an incentive mechanism for managers of firms to take actions ahead of technical default to prevent acceleration and bankruptcy.  The evidence presented is consistent with this hypothesis:  the presence of ABF covenants increases the probability of renegotiation and thus reduces the probabilities of substantive default and credit rating downgrade in below investment grade debt.  Further, this reduction is positively associated with the extent of the quality of the firm's information environment and financial reporting.  Additional evidence provided shows that the presence of ABF covenants reduces initial offering yields.

Its recurring, identifiable traits provide a trope that informs later depictions of problematic queens and their rule.  \nThe destructive queens who appear in William of Malmesbury\u2019s Gesta Regum Anglorum (1135), the 12th-century Liber Eliensis, Thomas of Britain\u2019s mid-12th-century Tristran, Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s Man of Law\u2019s Tale (1380s), and William Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth (ca. 1606), while serving varying textual functions, all operate within the features of the strix figuration.  The power of these queens appears in symbolic ways that reverse or distort their expected maternal and royal duties into metaphorical images of usurpation and division.  Resonating with imagery associated with the Old Irish horse goddess Macha and the Germanic valkyries, the Liber Eliensis\u2019 representation of \u00c6lfthryth constructs the queen according to hagiographical conventions as a locally pagan figure who persecutes and martyrs Ely\u2019s first abbot.  Through contrasting depictions and the Anglo-Saxon tradition of portraying individuals according to the etymology of their names, the narrative simultaneously frames the lustful witch, Queen \u00c6lfthryth, the founder of Wherwell convent, as a reciprocal or paired figure with the saintly Queen \u00c6thelthryth, the founder of Ely monastery.  Through Queen Ysolt\u2019s lai about a lady who eats her lover\u2019s heart and Cariado\u2019s comment that she herself is a \u201cfresaie,\u201d Thomas\u2019 Tristran frames the queen as a strix figure.  The reflecting images in the lai and Cariado\u2019s comment structure the poem to include a mise-en-abyme that foreshadows the similarly thematic manner in which Tristan will meet his death.  Chaucer\u2019s Man of Law\u2019s Tale casts the Sultaness as a lamia (literally a \u201cserpent under femynynytee\u201d) and a strix figure and highlights the monstrous maternity associated both with her and her counterpart, Queen Donegild.  Their interferences into the succession are figured as violent ruptures, contrasting with Queen Custance, whose productivity and symbolic absence provide a continuity that connects the ruling men in the royal family.  This figuration also informs the characterization of Macbeth\u2019s Lady Macbeth in order to provide a fragmentary monster, representative of a type of queenship that can be rejected in favor of King James\u2019 new, masculine rule, imaginatively (if not in reality) free from the threats of queenly power.\nThis literary figuration of destructive strong women, initially unrelated to queens, reemerges in these narratives, illustrating its unique utility to later monarchical societies in expressing fears about the stability of political identity, time, and kingly power.  The recurrence of this figure across time gestures toward a trans-historical typology and establishes the queen\u2019s alien threat to dynastic succession as a perpetual condition.  The queen\u2019s potential as a source of rupture in the monarchy causes her to endure and recur as a site for cultural fears about succession and concepts of monarchical time.  Thus, the figure of the destructive queen, in offering a crucial example of continuity across multiple eras, challenges conventional periodization.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10606], "author_name_tesi": "Bozick, Morgan Michelle", "last_name_ssi": "Bozick", "middle_name_ssi": "Michelle", "first_name_ssi": "Morgan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Caroline Davis Eckhardt", "Dr Robert R Edwards", "Norris Joiner Lacy", "Scott Thompson Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Caroline Davis Eckhardt, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Robert R Edwards, Committee Member", "Norris Joiner Lacy, Committee Member", "Scott Thompson Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["queens", "periodization", "Shakespeare", "Chaucer", "Ovid", "strix", "succession", "monstrosity", "Morrigan", "lamia", "Lilith"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Geochemistry and Depositional Environment of the Union Springs Member of the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania\n\n", "id": "11202", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5293", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High resolution geochemical and lithologic analysis of the Union Springs Member of the Marcellus Shale in two cores from central and southwest Pennsylvania indicate that during the onset of deposition of organic-carbon rich sediments the clastic fraction of the sediments was relatively minor.

This phenomenon can be time-consuming and expensive, particularly when physical prototypes are involved. As time and money are frequently the limiting factors for systems engineering prototyping projects, engineers wish to avoid significant design overhauls in the middle of a product\u2019s development cycle. However, because it is difficult for engineers to anticipate project-specific design issues leading to high-level redesigns, and because high-level redesigns can result from seemingly minor changes in components, avoidance of unexpected and catastrophic design change can be challenging. This thesis categorizes these changes and explores new methods for approaching product design and prototyping that avoid major mid-development redesigns of a product.\nIn order to identify the impact of prototype changes, this thesis employs Design Structure Matrices (DSMs) to examine the changes in an on-going real-world design project involving repeated design, fabrication, and testing of physical prototypes. Changes to the prototypes during the development cycle are analyzed in DSM form before and after changes were made to the system. These are presented to show change propagation to other component connections. These DSMs are completed using both a standard method and a proposed new method, called the C+C DSM Method. This new method includes constraints and components in one matrix, with the goal of eliminating the need to examine secondary and tertiary connections to predict change propagation. Compared to conventional DSM methods, the C+C DSM method is intended to offer a fast and flexible method specifically for an evolving prototype project, where time can be a limiting factor. By presenting this method, this thesis intends to provide a decision-making tool for prototyping so that implementation of a change can be made with full awareness of its impact.\nThe project examples motivating this thesis work are taken from a systems design prototyping project that involved several universities and industry partners, including Penn State, Michigan State, University of South Carolina, the US Department of Energy, and Holtec International. This project involved the design and prototyping of a robot to inspect nuclear dry waste storage casks. This robot carries experimental sensors through vents and up and down the sides of the storage casks. The robot and its delivery system went through a number of different prototype iterations, both as individual subsystems and as a final system. The prototype iterations discussed in this thesis were chosen for analysis because they were thought to be minor at the concept state and in the analysis of conventional DSMs, but resulted in major design changes once implemented. Had these major changes been identified earlier, the design process would have been far more efficient. The results show that the C+C DSM method developed in this thesis could have predicted the large number of \u201cknock-on\u201d changes associated with each change that spurred an iteration.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16519], "author_name_tesi": "Bracken, Jennifer Elaine", "last_name_ssi": "Bracken", "middle_name_ssi": "Elaine", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sean N Brennan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sean N Brennan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["design", "change propagation", "nuclear storage cask", "robotic inspection system", "prototyping"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Below Replacement Fertility in Eastern Europe: A Case Study", "id": "6374", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "966", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Below replacement level fertility currently characterizes most of the European countries.

Of course, there are many possible answers to this question. But, one view suggests that narratives may play an especially important role in changing the beliefs, attitudes, and intentions that are precursors to terrorism. There are at least three important implications of this position. First, it is necessary to determine what is meant by terrorism and related terms. Establishing the conceptual boundaries of these terms is a prerequisite to understanding the relationships among them and with narrative communication. Second, it must be established empirically that narrative has the persuasive potency that has been attributed to it. Although narrative has been compared to other forms of evidence, the impact of narrative communication (vs. none) on beliefs, attitudes, intentions, or behavior, has not been determined. Finally, it is important to directly assess the content of narratives that are intended to radicalize. A close examination of the content within terrorist narratives is needed to reveal the targets of belief and attitude change. By determining the persuasive efficacy of narratives and exploring the radicalizing potential of a specific set of extremist narratives, this project advances our knowledge of narrative persuasion processes and helps address the problem of terrorism by approaching it from a communication-based perspective.\n\nChapters 1 and 2 are dedicated to the explication of key terms. Chapter 1 explores the notions of terrorism and extremism, two contested concepts within the literature. Terrorism is defined as the use of violence or threat of violence against civilians to achieve ideological goals. Extremism is defined as a psychological state in which an individual rigidly adheres to an ideology that is characterized by behaviors that marginalize other-minded individuals through a variety of means, up and including the use of physical violence. A model is proposed that suggests that extremism is a risk factor for engaging in terrorism.\n\nAs Chapter 1 explored the psychological origins of terrorism, Chapter 2 investigates the psychological origins of extremism. This chapter argues that extremism results from a process referred to as radicalization. Radicalization is defined as an incremental social and psychological process prompted by and inextricably bound in communication, whereby an individual develops increased commitment to an extremist ideology resulting in the full or partial assimilation of beliefs and attitudes consistent with that ideology. Thus, it is proposed that those who undergo radicalization are at risk for extremism, and in turn, at risk for engaging in terrorism.\n\nAfter demonstrating radicalization to be a contributing factor for engaging in terrorism in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 illustrates the efficacy of one source with which radicalization can be promoted, narratives. In Chapter 3, meta-analytic techniques are employed to demonstrate that narrative communication positively affects beliefs (N = 4,510; r = .20), attitudes (N = 5,861; r = .21), and behavioral intentions (N = 4,218; r = .19), suggesting that extremist narratives have the potential to contribute to fundamental changes in beliefs, attitudes, and intentions in the direction of those promoted by a terrorist group.\n\nGiven these results, a close examination of a terrorist group\u2019s narratives would illustrate the beliefs, attitudes, and intentions that might be affected by exposure to those narratives. Thus, Chapter 4 features a theme analysis of the narratives of a terrorist organization, The Animal Liberation Front (ALF). This analysis reveals 10 distinct content themes that are geared towards radicalization. Taken together, the findings of Chapter 3\u2019s meta-analysis and Chapter 4\u2019s theme analysis show how the ALF\u2019s narratives work to promote extremism.\n\nChapter 5 summarizes the findings from the previous chapters and discusses the implications of them. Specifically, this chapter briefly details the ways in which this dissertation may inform future research on narrative communication and strategies to mitigate the impact of extremist narratives on the radicalization process. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7610], "author_name_tesi": "Braddock, Kurt Howard", "last_name_ssi": "Braddock", "middle_name_ssi": "Howard", "first_name_ssi": "Kurt", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Dillard", "James Hogan", "S.

Although there is a growing number of materials and applications associated with these unique types of particles, new synthetic methods must be investigated in order to realize the full potential of this new class of particles.  To address this need, we demonstrate that the concepts used in total synthesis of complex organic molecules, can be applied to the synthesis of colloidal hybrid nanoparticles.  Site selective growth, conversion chemistry, condensation chemistry, and protection/deprotection reactions are examined as ways to add complexity to colloidal hybrid nanoparticles.\nFirst, we will discuss the synthesis of PtPb-Fe3O4 and Pt3Sn-Fe3O4 heterodimer particles via a solution mediated conversion chemistry process.  These types of reactions are known to be useful for nanoparticle systems but had not been explored as a method for adding complexity to colloidal heterodimers. Pt\u2212Fe3O4 heterodimers react with Pb(acac)2 and Sn(acac)2 at 180\u2212200 \u00b0C in a mixture of benzyl ether, oleylamine, oleic acid, and tert-butylamine borane to form PtPb\u2212Fe3O4 and Pt3Sn\u2212Fe3O4 heterodimers, respectively. This chemical transformation reaction introduces intermetallic and alloy components into the heterodimers, proceeds with morphological retention, and preserves the solid\u2212solid interface that characterizes these hybrid nanoparticle systems. In addition, the PtPb\u2212Fe3O4 heterodimers spontaneously aggregate to form colloidally stable (PtPb\u2212Fe3O4)n nanoflowers via a process that is conceptually analogous to a molecular condensation reaction.\nNext, we will discuss the methanol oxidation activity of PtPb-Fe3O4 and Pt3Sn-Fe3O4 heterodimers as well as examine the role of ligand exchange in this process.  Before ligand exchange was performed, surfactant molecules on the surface of the colloidal hybrid nanoparticles inhibited catalytic activity.  We therefore used NOBF4 to remove the surfactant molecules and found that once removed, Pt nanoparticles showed much higher activity than before the exchange took place.  It was also observed that the solvent the ligand exchange reaction takes place in has an impact on the catalytic activity. Unfortunately, the colloidal hybrid nanoparticles did not show any catalytic activity after the exchange reaction.\nFinally, in an attempt to determine the driving forces behind site selective growth, we grew PbS, CuxSy, and CdS off of Pt-Au heterodimers.  Pt-Au heterodimers are an interesting model system for studying chemoselectivity because Pt and Au have very similar lattice constants but different chemical preferences.  First, we studied the thermal stability of Pt-Au heterodimers and determined that they begin to thermally degrade in solution around 210 \u00b0C.  We then grew the three metal sulfide domains off the Pt-Au heterodimers and synthesized Pt-Au-PbS heterotrimers, Pt-Au-CuxSy heterotrimers, and (Pt@Au)-CdS heterostructures.  We concluded that the strong nature of the Au-S bond was the primary driving force for chemoselectvity in these systems.  We also studied the growth of Fe3O4 off of Pt-Au heterodimers, and Au off of Pt-CdS heterodimers, as well as developed a method for SnS based heterodimers with Au and Pt domains. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10860], "author_name_tesi": "Bradley, Matthew Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Bradley", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "Tom Mallouk", "Benjamin James Lear", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "Tom Mallouk, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hybrid Nanoparticles", "Conversion Chemistry", "Chemoselectivity", "Nanoparticle Synthesis", "Heterodimers"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "FACILITATING YOUTH CIVIC ENGAGEMENT: CLIMBING THE LADDER OF COMMUNITY AWARENESS & CIVIC ACTION\n", "id": "21846", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9994", "abstract_tesi": "Youth civic engagement has emerged as a subset of educational research increasing in importance, both in the United States and abroad.

The objectives of this study were first, to determine diet overlap among sympatric darter species at a site with high darter diversity (French Creek at Venango) and a site with low diversity of darters (Woodcock Creek).   The hypothesis for this objective is that darters living sympatrically in French Creek at Venango will partition their diet due to increased competition and therefore become more specialized in their food choices.  The second objective was to compare diet of both common species of darters and currently listed species from historic collections in French Creek to contemporary collections and determine if diet has changed over time.  The hypothesis is that diet will be similar from both collections given the French Creek watershed has remained relatively unaltered throughout history.   I approached this objective by including currently listed species which were collected in the 1980's and early 1990's; before they were deemed either threatened or endangered.  Those specimens were able to be dissected and food items analyzed.  By comparing diets among common species from historic and present collections inferences were made about the diet of threatened and endangered species of darter in French Creek currently.   Summary of major findings include dietary trends for historic to current darter collections have remained similar, indicating species under current conservation protection have a diet that has also remained relatively unchanged. There were obvious seasonal trends in dietary components for darters and differences in diet between Woodcock Creek and French Creek.  Lastly, darters found in French Creek, especially in late summer, had a broader diet than those from earlier seasons and from Woodcock Creek, which indicates food is probably not a limited resource and therefore both intraspecific and interspecific competition is low.  French Creek remains one of the few streams in the United States that holds such a high abundance and diversity of fish species, including many under conservation protection.

It takes an interdisciplinary approach to inform the study of culture, media/communications, museums, cultural policy, and American Indian issues.  The study situates the NMAI in terms of the emergence of ethnic museums starting in the latter half of the twentieth century and engages the shift in the museological self-understanding from static transmission of knowledge to dialogic, democratic participation in the midst of neo-liberal funding pressures. The museum positions itself as a reaction to the iconographic noble and ignoble savage constructs prevalent in the popular media and museums and understands itself as a communications technology, using a variety of media and high-technology devices to enter into public discourse about American Indian identity, emphasizing collaboration with American Indian people in the process of \u201cgiving voice.\u201d  Its position within the national museum complex as a site of power and policy prescribing the repatriation of human remains and other forms of cultural patrimony suggest the new participants have been taken seriously.  However, this project argues the NMAI, while acting as a technology of the self for both American Indian people and its mostly non-Native audience, has been shaped by its socio/economic/historical circumstances and stakeholders, from its American Indian constituency to non-Native tourists, benefactors, and partnering corporations.  The museum has been charged with avoiding polemical issues in its attempt to meet expectations.  I argue the construction of the pan-Indian within the museum still acts as a generalized identity discourse and is productive for the overarching goal of nation-building.  The project explores the intersection between the national museum\u2019s new dialogic self-understanding and neo-liberal formation.  \nThe following chapters introduce the project and lay out the theoretical and methodological approaches taken (Chapters I and II).  They then describe the construction of American Indian identity in popular consciousness and its role in nation building (Chapter III), the museum\u2019s situatedness within cultural policy debates (Chapter IV), the various stakeholders with vested interest in the museum (Chapter V), and the use of media/technology devices, architecture, and semiotics to create \u201ca Native Place\u201d (Chapter VI).

Typically, wholesalers do not consider the individual retail establishment\u2019s ordering policies when setting and computing their service levels.  This research looked at whether there was a negative impact on retailers due to interactions between ordering policies.  \nCurrent research has focused on serial relationships in multi-echelon inventory problems.  This research extends existing research by assessing the impacts of differing ordering policies upon service level performance for each retail level establishment in a parallel multi-echelon inventory environment, for slow-demand items.  \n\nConducted through the use of simulation, one model was developed representing three ordering policies: Periodic Review, Continuous Review, and an Instantaneous Reorder Policy.  Each policy was isolated, and the models run to get a baseline of performance.  Finally, the complete model was run, and comparisons were made between the performance of the policies alone, and interacting.  Runs were conducted over a range of customer demand rates and target service levels.  Lead times and customer demand rates were exponentially distributed.  Of interest is whether the achieved service level at least meets the target service level for the individual run.\n\nThis research focused on four research questions.  This research concluded that the three reordering policies generally performed as well as, or better, than the theoretical target service levels, both for when they were run independently, and for when the policies were allowed to interact. There was generally no statistical difference between the performance of identical policies when isolated and when run concurrently. Additionally, it was found that there exists a statistical difference between the policies when interacting.  Typically, the periodic review policy\u2019s achieved service levels was lower in comparison to the other two policies under conditions of slow demand, and was higher than the other policies as demand approached one per day.\n\nWhile some policies outperform others, each policy meets or exceeds the target service level, suggesting that other considerations may be more appropriate to decision makers. This research concludes that inventory reordering decisions should continue to be made using economic and other factors.\n\nFurther research should look at other ranges and distributions of demand, as well as lead-time.  Additionally, other influences on the supply chain may be integrated into the model.  Finally, analysis of the cycle stock for each ordering policy may be of greater value in assessing costs reductions available through alternative ordering policies.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5727], "author_name_tesi": "Brady, Stephan Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Brady", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Stephan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph L Cavinato", "Lisa Williams", "Alan J Stenger", "Jose Antonio Ventura"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph L Cavinato, Committee Member", "Lisa Williams, Committee Chair", "Alan J Stenger, Committee Member", "Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supply Chain", "Simulation", "Ordering Policies", "Inventory Control"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Prior CEO Job Experience: An Investigation of its Effects on Subsequent CEO Jobs", "id": "17538", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8442", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Past research suggests that prior experience as a CEO should make an executive more valuable in the market place.

These experiences form the basis of an executive's skill set and distinctive worldviews (Hambrick & Fukutomi, 1991), which guide the executive's decision-making and strategic choices (Hambrick & Mason, 1984). Effective managerial capabilities are valuable to the firm to the extent that the executive is able to leverage his or her prior experiences to better negotiate the environmental contingencies in which the company operates (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978) or to develop firm-specific capabilities that form the basis of the company's competitive advantage (Castanias & Helfat, 1991, 2001). \nIn my dissertation I explore the value of prior CEO experience, both to the CEO and the firm. To do this I examine CEO succession events and measure the time a new CEO has spent as chief executive in earlier firms. I review the literature to date on CEOs, their capabilities, and the role of prior experience in the development of capabilities. Because the hiring of CEOs with prior CEO experience is a recent phenomenon, I provide descriptive statistics for the sample that I collect in order to compare and contrast them with the more general population of CEOs, based on recently collected data and with traditional views from the literature.

As a consequence, the newly developed method is highly accurate in force prediction and numerically extremely robust, even when using a relaxed wake model.  The accurate prediction is accomplished using lower panel densities than other methods require.  The numerical robustness is achieved without compromising the irrotationality assumption, unlike other potential flow methods do that use discrete vortices with solid core models in the wake.\nThe distributed vorticity element of the newly developed method consists of a vortex sheet that holds streamwise vorticity that varies linearly over the element span.  Transverse vorticity is concentrated in two vortex filaments that are located along the leading and trailing edge of the element.  Their spanwise circulation distributions vary in a parabolic fashion.  The circulation of the leading and trailing edge filaments are equal in magnitude, but opposite in orientations.  By introducing additional singularities along the edges of the distributed vorticity elements, any extreme velocities associated with the edge singularities of the vortex sheets are removed.  The velocity induced by a distributed vorticity element is determined with an analytical expression.  \nOne or several spanwise systems of distributed vorticity elements are used to model the lifting surface and the wake that is relaxed using a time-stepping method.  There, the shed vorticity forms an essentially continuous vortex sheet.  Thus, because of the elimination of point or line singularities, many of the numerical problems are avoided that are encountered with conventional vortex-lattice and panel methods.  In addition, the continuous vorticity distribution across the lifting surface yields an accurate load prediction that is relatively insensitive to panel density changes on the lifting surface and in the wake.  Consequently, significantly fewer singularity elements are needed to achieve accuracies comparable to other potential flow methods.\nThe subsequent method is a relatively fast tool for determining the location of the free wake and its interaction with complex wing geometries, especially when accurate load predictions are required.  The potential of the method is demonstrated with two sample applications.  Especially in the case of the formation flight of two aircraft, the relaxed wake model yields performance results that differ to those that are obtained with a fixed wake model.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2106], "author_name_tesi": "Bramesfeld, Goetz ", "last_name_ssi": "Bramesfeld", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Goetz", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark David Maughmer", "Barnes Warnock Mccormick Jr.", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Farhan Gandhi", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark David Maughmer, Committee Chair", "Barnes Warnock Mccormick Jr., Committee Member", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Farhan Gandhi, Committee Member", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vortex sheet", "wakes", "wings", "potential flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Generative versus Cautious Processing: Shared Moods and Group-Level Information Processing", "id": "6964", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3381", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this paper, I propose a Mood-as-Strategy Framework for understanding the effects of mood on group-level information processing.

In contrast, group members who share a negative mood develop a cautious processing strategy, characterized by a focus on the common information, but not on the unique information that each group member can provide. When group members do not share the same mood state (i.e. they experience diverse moods), group members fail to develop a common focus on the information, and instead engage in satisficing, characterized by a low focus on all of the information, and a heavy reliance on initial preferences. As a consequence of these different strategies, group members in positive moods, as compared to those in negative or diverse moods, perform well on tasks that require generating unique information. These experiments are important as they establish that (1) moods influence group processing independent of the effects of mood on individual information processing, (2) differences in processing strategies explain the effects of mood on performance, and (3) the experience of shared moods is just as important as the valence of the mood when considering the effect of mood on group-level information processing.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3369], "author_name_tesi": "Bramesfeld, Kosha Darlington-Sabin", "last_name_ssi": "Bramesfeld", "middle_name_ssi": "Darlington-Sabin", "first_name_ssi": "Kosha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Gasper", "Melvin Michael Mark", "Susan Mohammed", "D Wayne Osgood"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Gasper, Committee Chair", "Melvin Michael Mark, Committee Member", "Susan Mohammed, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mood", "affect", "groups", "information processing", "problem-solving", "decision-making"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Supercritical Fluids", "id": "6657", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5144", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Axisymmetric injectors appear in a multitude of applications ranging from rocket engines to biotechnology.  While experimentation is limited to larger injectors, much interest has been shown in the micro- and nano-scales as well.  Experimentation at these scales can be cost prohibitive if even possible.  Often, the operating regime involves supercritical fluids or complex geometries.  Molecular dynamics modeling provides a unique way to explore these flow regimes, calculate hard to measure flow parameters accurately, and determine the value of potential improvements before investing in costly experiments or manufacturing.  This research effort modeled sub- and supercritical fluid flow in a cylindrical tube being injected into a quiescent chamber. \nThe ability of four wall models to provide an accurate simulation was compared.  The simplest model, the diffuse wall, proved useful in getting results quickly but the results for the higher density cases are questionable, especially with respect to velocity profiles and density distributions.  The one zone model, three layers of an fcc solid tethered to the lattice sites with a spring, proved very useful for this research primarily because it did not need as many CPU hours to equilibrate.  The two zone wall uses springs as a two body potential and has a second stationary zone to hold the wall in place.  The most complicated, the three zone wall, employed a reactionary zone, a stochastic zone and a stationary zone using a Lennard-Jones two body potential.  Jet simulations were conducted on argon and nitrogen for liquid tube diameters from 20 to 65 \u00c5 at both sub and supercritical temperatures (Ar:  130 K and 160 K, N2:  120 K and 130 K).  The simulations focused on pressures above the critical pressure (Ar:  6 MPa, N2:  4 MPa).\nThe diffusive wall showed some variation from the analytical velocity profile in the tube while the atomistically modeled walls performed very well.  The walls were all able to maintain system temperature to reach the desired simulation conditions.  The most dramatic differences between the models were evident in the jet flow into the chamber.  The simulation results were strongly influenced by the size of the tube and the wall-fluid interactions.  The diffuse wall and the explicitly modeled walls show the ability to compare with macroscaled systems for an issuing jet near the injector region when the flow is outside the Knudsen regime.  The diffuse wall failed to capture the nanoscale behavior of the flow, in particular at the fluid-wall interface.  The explicitly modeled walls performed very well for these locations but determining the appropriate fluid-wall interactions is critical.  This interaction is the largest source of error for this research.\nComparing the jet results to the available experimental data showed evidence these simulations accurately represent injection flow.  Both the diffuse and one zone walls showed good agreement with the density profiles for the larger injection systems.  The mass distribution into the chamber compares very well with experimental shadowgraphs.  This evidence validates this simulation and suggests further work is possible and appropriate.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5117], "author_name_tesi": "Branam, Richard ", "last_name_ssi": "Branam", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Richard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Matthew Micci", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Deborah A Levin", "Robert Graham Melton", "Barbara Jane Garrison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Matthew Micci, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Deborah A Levin, Committee Member", "Robert Graham Melton, Committee Member", "Barbara Jane Garrison, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["molecular dynamics poiseuille flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Individual Variability in the Relationship among Stress, Coping, and Hemodynamics in African American Adults", "id": "6175", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1580", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\nThe objective of this study was to examine sources of individual differences in\nmeasures of stress, coping, and hemodynamics, and the relationship among these\nfactors in adult African Americans.

There are many mechanisms that affect\nhow much radiation is reflected back in the receiver direction, such as reflectivity,\nphysical contours and dimensions, attenuation properties of the materials, projected\ncross sectional area and so on. All of these characteristics are lumped together in a\nsingle value of \u001b, which has units of m2. Stealth aircrafts for example are designed\nto minimize its radar cross section and return the smallest amount of radiation\npossible in the receiver direction.\nA new concept has been introduced called quantum radar, that uses correlated\nquantum states of photons as well as the unique properties of quantum mechanics\nto ascertain information on a target at a distance. At the time of writing this\ndissertation, quantum radar is very much in its infancy. There still exist fundamental\nquestions about the feasibility of its implementation, especially in the microwave\nspectrum. However, what has been theoretically determined, is that quantum radar\nhas a fundamental advantage over classical radar in terms of resolution and returns\nin certain regimes.\nAnalogous to the classical radar cross section (CRCS), the concept of the\nquantum radar cross section (QRCS) has been introduced. This quantity measures\nhow \u201clarge\u201d an object looks to a quantum radar be describing how a single photon, or\nsmall cluster of photons scatter off of a macroscopic target. Preliminary simulations\nof the basic quantum radar cross section equation have yielded promising results\nshowing an advantage in sidelobe response in comparison to the classical RCS. This\ndocument expands upon this idea by providing insight as to where this advantage expanding upon the theory.\nThe expanded theory presented in this document includes re-deriving the QRCS\nformula to be a general bistatic formula, as the current equation is only valid for\nmonostatic radar geometries. This re-derivation process also leads to the addition of\nterms that capture the effect of photon polarization, something that is not properly\ntaken into account in the current literature. Most importantly, a new formulation\nof the QRCS formula will be derived that includes writing the equation in terms\nof Fourier transforms. This has a profound impact on the analysis of the theory\nof the QRCS as it allows for the derivation of closed form solutions of certain\ngeometries, something that has never been possible due to the form of the current\nQRCS equation. All together, this document will provide a complete and general\ntheory of the QRCS.\nAfter deriving the necessary equations, there will be extensive work in the\nutilization of these equations in deriving geometry dependent responses and comparing\nthe closed form solutions to the classical solutions as well as comparing the\nsolutions to the numerical simulations.\nThe current literature relies exclusively on numerical simulations to analyze\nthe behavior of the QRCS. The simulations done do not take into account the\nmacroscopic nature of the target. Because the atoms are so numerous, and because\nof the underlying Fourier transform relationship, there are many issues of sampling\nthat must be taken into account when performing simulations. Simulating an\nobject with too few samples results in an aliased and incorrect version of the\nQRCS response.

At thousands of meters under the surface and decoupled from the photic zone, the deep marine world is a hostile environment. However, the discovery of life thriving around deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems revolutionized our perception of the extent and tenacity of life on Earth and set in motion a movement to understand life at the seafloor and its significant in global biogeochemical and nutrient cycling. Seafloor sediments host an incredible diversity of microbial life, and much interest has sought to understand the spatial and stratigraphic extent of the biosphere, and also taxonomic and functional capacities of such resilient organisms. This dissertation represents a series of studies centered around these concepts \u2013 I analyze samples from a sediment profile exposed to a hydrothermal gradient as a scaled-down proxy for how microbial life may exist and/or adapt to conditions as they become buried deeper into the subsurface.\n\nI have focused on the application of culture-independent, molecular methods to understand whether the taxonomic and functional data reflect changes through this temperature gradient in support of a more temperature-adapted microbial community. In chapter 2, I examined the microbial community composition at approximately meter intervals by analyzing the taxonomically specific 16S rRNA marker gene. We presumed the biosphere to be restricted to only the upper 15 m, based on phylotype vetting and decreased sequencing recovery below. However, we observed a significant proportion of archaeal sequences throughout the 15 m, with a particularly high abundance in the deepest 15 m horizon. An in-depth look at the taxa at 15 m indicates an appearance of an uncultured, high-temperature taxon here, and an abundance of a thermophilic, methane-oxidizing archaeon, which suggests thermophilic niche at this particular temperature/depth regime. The exciting results from Chapter 2 were the motivation for a continued metagenomics analysis of select samples in the same sediment profile for Chapter 3. Probing through total genomic DNA from six samples, I found evidence for temperature-dependent trends through the detection of genes of specific proteins involved in thermal processes, and attempted to correlate these genes with a taxonomic identity. I found that the deepest, hottest sample encompassed organisms from both thermophilic and hyperthermophilic temperature regimes. The dichotomy reflected between the existence of two temperature-specific niches implies that, due to the dynamic nature of the hydrothermal vent system, the deepest horizon may be undergoing a transition in temperature, thus, microbial community. Lastly, Chapter 4 was intended to provide a dataset from extractable RNA in order to distinguish representatives of the active microbial population from those represented from extant DNA; however, many challenges encountered in extraction and sequencing yield have restricted the dataset and ability to make reliable interpretations.\n\nConsidering the current state of knowledge in the marine subsurface due to its challenges in sampling, low biomass yield, and diversity distantly related to what is known from surface life, this work herein contributes greatly to our understanding of microbial biogeography in terms of temperature constraints in marine subsurface sediments. The challenges in phylotype vetting and need for quality controls speak to the degree of complexities in performing and interpreting molecular analyses from subseafloor sediments. Moreover, I have also produced significant datasets, both 16S rRNA gene and metagenomics, that can continue to be used for future investigations and comparisons of microbial life in the marine seafloor.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13327], "author_name_tesi": "Brandt, Leah Danielle", "last_name_ssi": "Brandt", "middle_name_ssi": "Danielle", "first_name_ssi": "Leah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Howard House"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Howard House, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["subsurface", "hydrothermal", "diversity", "sequencing", "microbial"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Role of Luteal Cell-derived Exosomes in Communication with Immune Cells", "id": "24939", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11160", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The corpus luteum (CL) is a vital organ for the production of progesterone (P4) which maintains pregnancy in ruminants. Immune cells infiltrate the CL and increase in number during luteal regression. These immune cells communicate with luteal cells to either sustain the CL for maintenance of pregnancy or promote regression of the CL, resulting in progression to the next estrous cycle. Luteal cell communication with T lymphocytes (T cells) can program the T cell responses, and luteal cells from fully functional CL can activate T cells through paracrine mediators. The mediators of this communication are not well understood. To investigate these interactions, we hypothesized that luteal cells secrete extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, and that these exosomes serve as a means of communication from luteal steroidogenic cells to resident immune cells. Exosomes are 15-100 nm vesicles released from cells that contain protein, miRNA, and mRNA, which can later function of target cells. Currently, there is no research on the role of exosomes in the CL or the interaction between luteal cell-derived exosomes and the immune system. Thus, the objective of the first study was to determine an optimal method for the isolation of exosomes from luteal cell-conditioned media. Luteal cells were isolated and cultured for 48 hours. Media was collected, concentrated and exosomes were isolated by three methods: ultracentrifugation and two commercial exosome isolation reagents. Analysis of exosomes using electron microscopy revealed the expected cup-shaped morphology. Concentration of exosomes isolated from regressing luteal cell-conditioned media was less than from midcycle luteal cell-conditioned media. An experiment was conducted to determine if luteal cell-derived exosomes affected T cell function by interacting with surface markers on T cells or internalization. To determine if T cells can internalize luteal cell-derived exosomes, luteal cell-derived exosomes were co-cultured with T cells and analyzed using FlowSight imaging cytometry and confocal microscopy. This experiment revealed that the majority of T cells internalized exosomes. \nNext, a study was conducted to determine the effect of exosomes on T cell function.  The maximum T cell proliferation achieved was 23%. T cells were also collected and their phenotype was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for expression of TH1 (T helper cell 1) and TH2 (T helper cell 2) mRNA expression. Midcycle luteal cell-derived exosomes increased TNF and decreased IL10 mRNA expression while regressing luteal cell-derived exosomes decreased TNF, IFNG, IL4 and IL10 mRNA expression. Finally, an experiment was conducted to determine if luteal-derived exosomes affect monocyte differentiation and if so, determine the characteristics of the macrophages that arise. Midcycle or regressing luteal cell-derived exosomes were added to PBMCs along with GMCSF or MCSF and mRNA expression for macrophage cell type-specific genes was determined. Midcycle luteal cell-derived exosomes drove monocyte differentiation into macrophages that were characterized by highly significant expression of TNF, IL1B, NOS2, CD36, IL10 and TGFB while regressing luteal cell-derived exosomes induced greater expression of TNF, NOS2, CCL24 and IL10.\nIn summary, bovine luteal cells from both physiological states released exosomes into culture media with luteal cells from regressing CL releasing fewer exosomes than midcycle luteal cells. Exosomes were internalized into T cells, and midcycle luteal cell-derived exosomes induced T cell proliferation. Also, midcycle luteal cell-derived exosomes were able induce a TH1 phenotype while regressing exosomes down regulated all T cell markers measured. Finally, midcycle and regressing luteal cell-derived exosomes drove monocyte differentiation that was dependent on both prior priming toward M1 or M2 and on source of the exosomes. In conclusion, bovine luteal cells release exosomes that may facilitate communication with immune cells and provide an alternative method to direct cell-cell contact by which luteal cells communicate with immune cells to control the luteal microenvironment.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10721], "author_name_tesi": "Branham, Katie L", "last_name_ssi": "Branham", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Katie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joy Lee Pate", "Troy Ott", "Francisco Javier Diaz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joy Lee Pate, Thesis Advisor", "Troy Ott, Thesis Advisor", "Francisco Javier Diaz, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["bovine", "corpus luteum", "exosomes", "macrophages", "T cells", "immune cells"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Analysis, Design and Implementation of a Charge-Equalization Circuit for use in Automotive Battery Management Systems\n\n", "id": "8771", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4657", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A charge-equalization circuit for an automotive battery management system has been designed and implemented.

A methodology is developed which quantifies the significance of input parameter uncertainties and modeling decisions on isotopic prediction by comparing to isotopic measurement uncertainties. The SCALE Sampler model of the D047 assembly incorporates input parameter uncertainties for key input data such as multigroup cross sections, decay constants, fission product yields, the cladding thickness, and the power history for fuel rod MKP109. The effects of each set of input parameter uncertainty on the uncertainty of isotopic predictions have been quantified. In this work, isotopic prediction biases are identified and an investigation into their sources is proposed; namely, biases have been identified for certain plutonium, europium, and gadolinium isotopes for all three axial locations. Moreover, isotopic prediction uncertainty resulting from only nuclear data is found to be greatest for Eu-154, Gd-154, and Gd-160.\nThe discharge rod internal pressure (RIP) and cladding hoop stress (CHS) distributions are quantified for Watts Bar Nuclear Unit 1 (WBN1) fuel rods by modeling core cycle design data, operation data (including modeling significant trips and downpowers), and as-built fuel enrichments and densities of each fuel rod in FRAPCON-3.5. A methodology is developed which tracks inter-cycle assembly movements and assembly batch fabrication information to build individual FRAPCON inputs for each considered WBN1 fuel rod. An alternate model for the amount of helium released from zirconium diboride (ZrB2) integral fuel burnable absorber (IFBA) layers is derived and applied to FRAPCON output data to quantify the RIP and CHS for these fuel rods. SCALE/Polaris is used to quantify fuel rod-specific spectral quantities and the amount of gaseous fission products produced in the fuel for use in FRAPCON inputs. Fuel rods with ZrB2 IFBA layers (i.e., IFBA rods) are determined to have RIP predictions that are elevated when compared to fuel rod without IFBA layers (i.e., standard rods) despite the fact that IFBA rods often have reduced fill pressures and annular fuel blankets. The primary contributor to elevated RIP predictions at burnups less than and greater than 30 GWd/MTU is determined to be the total fuel rod void volume and the amount of released fission gas in the fuel rod, respectively. Cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) are prepared from the distribution of RIP and CHS predictions for all standard and IFBA rods. The provided CDFs allow for the determination of the portion of WBN1 fuel rods that exceed a specified RIP or CHS limit.

FRAPCON results are provided in sufficient detail to enable the recalculation of the RIP while considering any desired plenum gas temperature, total void volume, or total amount of gas present in the void volume.

The remainder will be landfilled.  Yet, CCPs are an ideal fill material due to their abundance and their desirable engineering characteristics.  The main disadvantage of utilizing CCPs is the variability in material properties seen between differing CCP sources and the change in material behavior over time.  This variability makes predicting CCP behavior as an engineered fill difficult.  One approach for minimizing the risk associated with CCP variability is to catalog all available data on CCPs, including formation processes, chemical properties, material characteristics, and mechanical behavior. Once this catalog of data has been developed, common trends in material characteristics and mechanical behavior between CCP sources may be identified.  Therefore, the purposes of this study are to collect and organize all existing data on Pennsylvania CCPs into an electronic database as well as contribute to the database by obtaining properties of two additional CCPs.  An attempt was made to use this data gathered in the database and the results from additional CCP testing to identify trends in material properties and behavior.  The testing of the additional CCPs followed a CCP testing framework developed in a previous study.  This work focuses on the creation and utilization of this database along with the findings of this additional CCP testing.  \nThe sources of the collected CCP data included published literature and results from years of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) regulatory testing.  The collected data was organized into a database designed in Filemaker Pro 11 and then launched as a website.  For the additional CCP testing, two fly ash materials from two different power plants were selected for this study:  a class F fly ash and an FBC fly ash.  The testing methodology for the additional CCPs included general material characterization, such as compaction characteristics, particle size distribution, and specific surface area.  Other tests focused on the mechanical behavior of these CCPs over time and included unconfined compression (UC) strength and hydraulic conductivity testing.  The tests used to classify CCP mechanical behavior showed that the UC strength and hydraulic conductivity of the material may change, depending on the type of CCP tested.  The results of quantitative x-ray diffraction and PHREEQCI modeling show that the formation of ettringite dictates CCP behavior.  That is, as the amount of ettringite formed in FBC-PC increases, the strength of the CCP also increases.  The lack of strength gain observed for the class F fly ash was due to the lack of formation of hydration products.  In addition, ettringite formation over time reduced the void ratio of the FBC ash, and thus reduced the hydraulic conductivity.\nOne important finding of this study is that the UC strength trend observed in FBC-PC is very similar to the UC strength trend for another FBC ash investigated in a previous study.  Both FBC ashes experienced the most significant increase in UC strength in the first 7 to 14 days of curing.  \nAnother important finding of this study is the variability in the compaction characteristics of CCPs collected from the DEP.  This variability prevents the identification of trends in maximum dry density and optimum moisture content based on CCP type.\nOne critical finding of this study is that the hydraulic conductivity data collected by the DEP are not reliable for comparison purposes.  The methods and procedures followed by different laboratories contracted for this testing were found to be inconsistent.  The most significant inconsistency is the time that laboratories allow test specimens to cure before testing.  It is possible that through eliminating these inconsistencies, the regulatory hydraulic conductivity testing can be standardized and the resulting data will be more meaningful.  \nCCPs are a variable material and understanding how the mechanical behavior of the material changes, based on type and time, is essential for use in large volume applications such as mine land reclamation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7489], "author_name_tesi": "Braun, Gregory David", "last_name_ssi": "Braun", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Angelica M Palomino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Angelica M Palomino, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CCPs", "Coal Ash", "Ettringite", "Database"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Inversion Scheme for Predicting Petrophysical Properties in the Blake Ridge Methane Hydrates Field from 3d Seismic Survey Data", "id": "29000", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12628", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Accurately predicting petrophysical properties in a reservoir can be a very challenging process.

Furthermore, since the downhole measurement of rock and fluid properties in a reservoir requires a large initial investment, it may be a total bust if the values collected prove the reservoir to be economically infeasible.

In each of the studies, the Disablement Process model (Verbrugge & Jette, 1994) provided the theoretical basis for selecting demographic, physiological, and psychosocial variables as predictors of disablement.  The first study in the series included participants from the NONA study who were aged 86, 90, or 94 (N= 149) living in one Swedish municipality in 1999.  Participants were interviewed in their places of residence (homes or nursing homes) by trained nurses and they responded to questions about their demographic characteristics, health, social networks, and psychological well-being, and also completed tests of physical functioning, such as grip strength and chair stands.  This cross-sectional analysis examined the structure of the Disablement Process model by testing the direct and mediating relationships between the risk factors, psychosocial factors, functional limitations, functional impairments, and disability outcomes as defined by the Disablement Process model.  Results yielded support for the overall structure of Verbrugge and Jette\u2019s model; for example there was evidence that functional limitations accounted for between 31 to 46% of the direct effects between functional impairments and disability.  This study also found that certain psychosocial variables, in particular mastery, mediated the relationships between functional impairments and functional limitations, and also relationships between functional limitations and disability.  \nThe second study in this series used the Disablement Process model to predict the onset of disability in the OCTO-Twin sample.  OCTO-Twin is a sample of Swedish monozygotic and dizygotic same-sex twins aged 79 and older who were followed longitudinally for eight years.  Similar to the procedures used in NONA, these participants were interviewed in their places of residence by trained nurses and they responded to oral questions as well as performed tests of physical ability.  The current analyses used only one twin randomly selected from each twin pair and excluded anyone with disability at baseline (N = 260).  The sample was then divided into two groups:  those that transitioned into a disabled state over the course of the study (N = 93), and those that did not develop disability in activities of daily living (N = 167).  Utilizing a synthetic cohort design and a series of logistic regression models, this study used risk factors, functional impairments, functional limitations, and psychosocial variables from waves of data prior to the onset of disability to predict whether the participant transitioned into a state of disability at subsequent waves.  Results from the analysis demonstrated that visual ability, lower body functioning, cognitive ability, and depressive symptoms were all significant predictors of subsequent transition into disability.  \nFinally, in the third study of the series, the NONA sample from study one was followed longitudinally over four years, and variables from the Disablement Process model at baseline were used to predict group membership into three different groups of longitudinal disability outcomes.  Based on work by Johnson and Barer (1997), these groups were defined as:  Functional Survivors (those with no disability at all waves), Increasingly Disabled (those that transitioned into a disabled state over time), and Chronically Disabled (those that were disabled at all waves).   Results from this study indicated that Functional Survivors had better physical functioning, as well as greater psychosocial resources at baseline, for example they reported greater feelings of mastery and subjective support, and reported less loneliness. \nSeveral conclusions can be drawn based on the results of these three studies.  First, the studies provide support that the Disablement Process model is an effective way to describe and predict levels of disability, the transition into disability, and the patterns of change in disability over time in samples of people most at-risk for disablement, namely the oldest-old.  Secondly, although all predictors were not the same across the three studies, in general it appeared that psychosocial variables played an important role in predicting disability outcomes.  For example, in addition to physical functioning and cognitive functioning being consistent predictors of disability outcomes, so too were variables such as mastery, depression, subjective social support, and loneliness.  Psychosocial variables may be important risk or protective factors in the disablement process, buffering the negative impact of the loss of physical or cognitive function.        \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1823], "author_name_tesi": "Braungart, Elizabeth Ruth", "last_name_ssi": "Braungart", "middle_name_ssi": "Ruth", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit", "Dr Scott Hofer", "Michael J Rovine", "David Nathan Proctor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Chair", "Dr Scott Hofer, Committee Member", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member", "David Nathan Proctor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Disability", "Disablement Process", "Oldest-old", "Activities of Daily Living"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Diffusion of Instability in Authoritarian Regimes", "id": "13680twb5171", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13680", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Spatial models of political instability typically constrain the trigger events of interest to lagged values of the dependent variable, and such a lag is often intended to capture positive diffusion of the event.

Expanding the set of spatiotemporal lags allows for more precise directional hypotheses of transnational learning. The results indicate that lags of autocratic transitions, for example, may inhibit the realization democratic transition, while lags of democratic transition may facilitate it. The dissertation is also inspired by a methodological concern for model generalizability, and therefore the importance of model validation and regularization is given extensive treatment. These principles are applied to descriptive models, in which the primary objective is to explain, and to predictive models, in which the primary objective is to predict unseen data. Moreover, these principles are applied to linear models commonly employed in political science and to more flexible machine learning models that are less commonly used in the field.

The first empirical study used latent class analysis (LCA) and LCA with covariates to identify and predict types of college-student gamblers using data from a large northeastern university.  Four types of gamblers were identified: non-gamblers, cards and lotto players, cards and games of skill players, and multi-game players.  Significant predictors of gambling latent class membership included: gender, school year, living in off-campus housing, Greek membership, and past-year alcohol use.  There were substantial gender differences in the probabilities of latent class membership and in the predictive effects of the covariates.  The second empirical study used LCA to identify types of adolescent and young adult gamblers and used LCA for repeated measures to identify types of drinking trajectories using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.  Multivariable LCA was used to examine the relation between gambling and drinking by linking specific types of gambling to specific types of drinking trajectories.  Gambling and drinking were shown to be highly related in general, and drinking frequency appeared to be more predictive of gambling than was drinking quantity.  The third empirical study used latent transition analysis to identify types of adolescent smokers and types of drinkers, and to describe smoking and drinking development over time using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997.  Multiprocess modeling was used to examine the relation between smoking and drinking by modeling the development of the two processes simultaneously.  Three types of smokers and three types of drinkers were identified: non-smokers, light smokers, heavy smokers, non-drinkers, light drinkers, and heavy drinkers.  The behavior of non-smokers, non-drinkers, heavy smokers, and heavy drinkers was relatively stable across time whereas the behavior of light smokers and light drinkers was variable.

Theoretically, then, dyadic interaction patterns should change over time as infants develop regulatory autonomy and capabilities for mobility, social engagement, and independence (Kopp, 1982), and vary depending on caregivers\u2019 interactive styles (Feldman, 2007). Although research has examined links between early dyadic interaction patterns, measured as dyadic synchrony between parents\u2019 and infants\u2019 behaviors, and later child outcomes, relatively little is known about the specific types of parents\u2019 and infants\u2019 behaviors that typically co-occur at different ages. \nTo address this gap, the current study provided detailed descriptive data about dyadic interaction patterns across infancy and early toddlerhood for mother-child dyads. Following advances in time-series data analytic methods for modeling dyadic data (e.g., Stifter & Rovine, 2015), the current study used Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM; Visser & Speekenbrink, 2010) to identify patterns of moment-to-moment behaviors co-occurring between mothers and their children (latent dyadic states) and to compute probabilities of transitions among those states at three ages: 9-, 18-, and 27-months.\nThe current study used microcoded observations of adoptive mothers\u2019 and infants\u2019 behaviors collected as part of the Early Growth and Development Study (Leve et al., 2013) during an observational Teaching Task at child ages 9-, 18-, and 27-months (N = 551). The Teaching Task elicits maternal support for infant autonomy and exploration, therefore relevant behaviors that were coded included, for example, maternal scaffolding, praise, and social bids, and child attention to task, compliance, and toy exploration. Separately at each age, HMM was used to compute the probabilities of all possible latent dyadic states (i.e., all possible co-occurring mother-child behaviors) and to determine the number of dyadic states that resulted in best model fit. In other words, HMM quantified specific patterns of dyadic interaction that were most likely to occur at 9-, 18-, and 27-months. Then, separately at each age, HMM was used to compute a set of transition probabilities (i.e., the probability of dyads\u2019 moving from one latent state to any other latent state).  Thus, HMM provided a rich description of the content of dyadic interactions (i.e., the most likely types of co-occurring behaviors) and the process of dyadic interactions (most likely patterns of movement among dyadic states) at each age. The dyadic interaction patterns at each age were discussed in terms of similarities and differences at the different ages. HMM can be used in future research to examine individual differences in dyadic interaction patterns, explore genetic and environmental contributions to the development of dyadic interaction patterns, and predict child outcomes in relation to early dyadic interaction patterns.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16112], "author_name_tesi": "Bray, Brandon A", "last_name_ssi": "Bray", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Brandon", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ginger A Moore", "Pamela Marie Cole", "Jenae Marie Neiderhiser"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ginger A Moore, Thesis Advisor", "Pamela Marie Cole, Committee Member", "Jenae Marie Neiderhiser, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dyadic interaction", "parenting", "dyadic regulation", "Hidden Markov Model"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "FINITE-DIFFERENCE TIME-DOMAIN SIMULATION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC BANDGAP AND BI-ANISOTROPIC METAMATERIALS\n", "id": "6855", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4126", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The term \"Metamaterial\" has been introduced into the electromagnetic lexicon in recent years to describe new artificial materials with electromagnetic properties that are not found in naturally occurring materials.  Metamaterials exhibit electromagnetic properties that are not observed in its constituent materials, and/or not observed in nature.  This thesis will analyze two different classes of metamaterials through the use of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique.  The first class of metamaterials are artificial magnetic conductors (AMC) which approximate the behavior of a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) over a finite frequency range.  The AMC metamaterials are created through the use of an electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure.  A periodic FDTD code is used to simulate a full-wave model of the metallodielectric EBG structures.  The AMCs developed with the aid of the FDTD tool are then used to create low-profile antenna systems consisting of a dipole antenna in close proximity to an AMC surface.  Through the use of this FDTD tool, several original contributions were made to the electromagnetic community.  These include the first dual-band independently tunable EBG AMC ground plane and the first linearly polarized single-band and dual-band tunable antenna/EBG systems.\n\nThe second class of materials analyzed are bi-anisotropic metamaterials.  Bi-anisotropic media are the largest class of linear media which is able to describe the macroscopic material properties of artificial dielectrics, artificial magnetics, artificial chiral materials, left-handed materials, and other composite materials.  The dispersive properties of these materials can be approximated by the oscillator model.  This model assumes a Lorentzian frequency profile for the permittivity and permeability and a Condon model for chirality.  A new FDTD formulation is introduced which can simulate this type of bi-anisotropic media.  This FDTD method incorporates the dispersive material properties through a Z-transform technique derived from the constitutive relations for bi-anisotropic media.  This is the first FDTD formulation to be able to simulate dispersive chiral media on a single FDTD grid.  This tool was also used to perform the first simulations of dispersive chiral frequency selective surfaces.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4104], "author_name_tesi": "Bray, Matthew George", "last_name_ssi": "Bray", "middle_name_ssi": "George", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner", "Anthony J Ferraro", "Kultegin Aydin", "Lyle Norman Long"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Chair", "Anthony J Ferraro, Committee Member", "Kultegin Aydin, Committee Member", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chiral", "electromagnetic bandgap", "FDTD", "bi-anisotropic", "artifical magnetic conductor"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SPACE, ECONOMICS, AND THE POETIC IMAGINATION IN ENGLAND\u2019S LITERARY LANDSCAPES, 1125-1590\n\n", "id": "12270", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5542", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Post-conquest English writing focused in significant measure on historical and geographical accounts that identified and legitimated a new political order. Twelfth-century historical writers used the techniques of chronicle and genealogy to argue simultaneously for the continuity and distinctness of post-conquest national identity. A significant body of critical writing has shown the importance of these historical documents. Less apparent but equally important are the techniques of religious writing to the project of reformulating English identity. Religious writers give an extraordinary prominence to landscape as a foundation on which to build institutions, narratives, and national memories.\n\nThis dissertation investigates the strategies and techniques of representing landscape in texts from the twelfth through the sixteenth century. I examine a series of texts that provide key moments in which the portrayal of landscape does both elegiac and political work. The landscape is an object of attention and even celebration, but it also serves ideological aims in establishing continuities over time, framing exemplary narratives, and structuring social memory. William of Malmesbury\u2019s Gesta Pontificum Anglorum appropriates the funerary landscape of Anglo-Saxon England in order to establish and regulate a national memory that combines native and foreign conceits. The South English Legendary uses the language of cartography to resituate Worcester as the center of Christian geographical consciousness. The landscape of Chaucer\u2019s pilgrims in the Canterbury Tales represents a new sphere of civic and economic movement within established space. And finally, Langland and Spenser devise new ways of turning political landscapes back into the imagination. Without losing political resonance, they emphasize landscape as a domain of exploration and discovery that serves at the same time as a figure for art and authorship.\n\nMy approach combines the formal and historical methods of literary analysis with the interpretive tools of cultural geography. Each text is a carefully crafted artifact fully conscious of its tradition, rhetorical claims, and literary genre. Each is specifically situated in a historical context as propaganda, devotion, satire, or allegory. The uses made of space across these works become fully visible, however, through the interpretive resources of modern cultural geography. Landscape is not simply local or topical but invested with social, political, and imaginative significance. It is the medium on which memory is recorded and recovered in narrative, ceremony, and lived experience. It is also the domain in which imagination can push back against history in order to forge new possibilities for understanding identity.\n\nThe primary texts in the dissertation represent key moments in a narrative of English identity, sustained through religious writing rather than secular history or panegyric. Together, these texts outline a narrative of landscape\u2019s use in early religious writing. From the twelfth to the sixteenth century, physical landscapes functioned as spaces on which to consolidate national and regional identity, spheres of political and economic movement, and finally domains for the poetic imagination. My examination of this narrative reverses the traditional claim that history dictates how people read the landscape, and suggests instead that poetic manifestations of physical landscapes dictate how people read and write identity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5533], "author_name_tesi": "Breckenridge, Sarah Dee", "last_name_ssi": "Breckenridge", "middle_name_ssi": "Dee", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Robert R Edwards", "Robert R Edwards", "Patrick G Cheney", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt", "Scott Thompson Smith", "Lorraine Dowler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Robert R Edwards, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert R Edwards, Committee Chair", "Patrick G Cheney, Committee Member", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt, Committee Member", "Scott Thompson Smith, Committee Member", "Lorraine Dowler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["William of Malmesbury", "early modern", "medieval", "religious literature", "mobility", "economics", "poetry", "memory", "imagination", "space/place", "landscape", "South English Legendary", "Chaucer", "Langland", "Spenser"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Keeping Up With Technology: Understanding the Evidence-Base of Coping-Related Content on Pinterest", "id": "14211ncb142", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14211", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Coping-related material has been found to be a popular form of content shared by followers of the National Association of School Psychologists\u2019 (NASP) Pinterest account.

Particle size and particle size distribution (PSD) are fundamental characteristics of food products which can have a large influence on texture. For example, in chocolate, a semi-solid suspension of fine particles from cocoa and sugar that are dispersed in a continuous fat phase, the PSD directly influences the overall viscosity and mouthfeel. Orofacial somatosensation arises from multiple afferent nerves which are essential for achieving rapid and accurate motor outputs, like speech and swallowing, and may play a role in texture detection mechanisms. To date, no work has been done to measure human somatosensory function on lingual (tongue) surfaces as they relate to the detection of particle size in a food product. Here, I measured the just noticeable difference (JND) for particle size in melted dark chocolate and assessed two conceptually distinct measures of oral somatosensory function \u2013 oral point pressure sensitivity and surface roughness discrimination \u2013 and tested the relationship between these phenotypes. Cocoa liquor and sugar mixtures were refined to twelve different particle sizes and combined with cocoa butter and soy lecithin to create dark chocolate samples with a fat content of ~32%. To estimate JND values for particle size in four series of samples, na\u00efve participants evaluated pairs of samples in a 2-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) task. Detection and discrimination threshold estimates for oral pressure point sensitivity were measured with Von Frey Hair (VFH) monofilaments (8mg to 10g) and discrimination threshold estimates for surface roughness were measured with stainless steel blanks ground to different levels of roughness (Ra; 0.535-0.722 m), both by using staircase procedures. Two commercial samples of dark chocolate differing in mean particle size (19 and 26 m) were evaluated for differences in grittiness via a 2-AFC task. The JND for D90 (90% of particles smaller than) particle size was fairly constant for the first three series (~5m) but increased with increasing particle size to ~10m. The Weber Fraction (K) was roughly constant: approximately K = 0.2 for the particle size range (~20-80 m) studied here. Consistent with prior work, the responses of participants were characterized by high (RHi) and low (RLo) sensitivity groups for roughness; observed variation in point pressure sensitivity allowed participants to be grouped into high (PPHi) and low (PPLo) sensitivity groups. However, there was no significant relationship between the two oral phenotypes. Across all participants, the group successfully discriminated between two chocolates differing in particle size (i.e. 19 versus 26 m), but this effect was driven almost entirely by those more sensitive to pressure from VFH: 17 out of 20 of the PPHi group significantly identified the grittier chocolate, versus chance performance (12/24) for PPLo. No effect was seen for roughness sensitivity on perception of chocolate particle size. This work suggests differences in oral somatosensory function may influence perception of food texture. Additional research is needed to further characterize texture detection mechanisms in the mouth and their relationship to food texture.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16710], "author_name_tesi": "Breen, Scott Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Breen", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John E Hayes", "Nicole Michele Etter", "Gregory Ray Ziegler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John E Hayes, Thesis Advisor", "Nicole Michele Etter, Committee Member", "Gregory Ray Ziegler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chocolate", "Oral Somatosensation", "Psychophysics", "Particle Size"]}]
