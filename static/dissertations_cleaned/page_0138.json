Recently, a large multi-center, randomized trial, the Polyp Prevention Trial, with 1905 subjects who had recently removed colorectal adenomas showed that high legume consumption, independent of fruit and vegetable intake, was associated with significantly lower risk for adenoma recurrence. We employed a randomized crossover controlled-feeding study (The Legume Inflammation Feeding Experiment) to evaluate the effects a legume enriched, high fiber, low glycemic index diet (LG) on biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation in men with high risk for colorectal cancer. Very important objectives were to evaluate the effects on lipids and lipoproteins, cholecystokinin, leptin, and ghrelin. Serum total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyerides (TG), and plasma leptin levels significantly decreased after the LG diet (P<0.0001 for TC, LDL-C, and leptin, and P=0.0028 for TG). In addition, we also found that insulin-resistant individuals did not achieve the full benefit of the LG diet on the HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) related ratios. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that high legume consumption elicit beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and weight management. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7008], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Zhiying ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhiying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Mosuk Chow", "A Catharine Ross", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Jan Ulbrecht"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Terryl Johnson Hartman, Dissertation Advisor", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Chair", "Mosuk Chow, Committee Member", "A Catharine Ross, Committee Member", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "Jan Ulbrecht, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ghrelin", "leptin", "lipids", "LIFE study"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Managing Knowledge Assets within Organizations: Role of Incentives and Information Systems\n\n", "id": "6524", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6962", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Incentives and information systems are two major enablers for managing organizational knowledge assets. Prior research in knowledge management focuses either on managerial or technical perspectives, independently. On the one hand, various studies investigate the knowledge management strategies and influential factors for knowledge diffusion. On the other hand, research is abundant in the construction and mechanisms of knowledge management systems.  Our research studies the joint role of incentives and information systems in facilitating knowledge sharing and learning within organizations in three closely related essays. The first study demonstrates that incentive rewards for knowledge sharing and learning can be offered in linear proportion to the sharing and learning amounts to achieve knowledge-sharing(learning) alignment, full-knowledge sharing, and truthful reporting of knowledge levels. In addition, the adoption of appropriate knowledge-transfer policies, either mandatory learning(ML) or voluntary learning(VL), depends on the level of information systems. This framework is then extended to the analysis about how to properly allocate internal knowledge assets so that knowledge discoveries can be successfully created, retained, and disseminated to improve organizational productivity, maximizing profits. The equilibria among knowledge pioneers who engage in knowledge innovation are investigated under two incentive policies: individual winner reward(IWR) and aggregate team reward(ATR). Information systems are found to assume the critical role of facilitating knowledge innovation and increasing organizational profitability in the knowledge creation, retention, and diffusion processes. The third model examines the design of reward structures for participants in the internal knowledge market as well as its IT support in diffusing organizational knowledge. The knowledge providers' signalling strategy and the firm's optimal design of reward structures are shown based on different types of knowledge recipients.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6959], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Zuopeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zuopeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Xu", "Shankar Sundaresan", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Moti Levi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Xu, Committee Chair", "Shankar Sundaresan, Committee Chair", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Member", "Moti Levi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["information systems", "incentives", "knowledge management"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Identifying Private Data Leakage Threats in Web Browsers", "id": "26496", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11693", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Modern web browsers now provide more customizations to improve the usability and their competitiveness. Browser extensions and private browsing mode (PBM) are arguably two most popular customizations. With billions of downloads, browser extensions enhance user experience by providing additional features. PBM enables users to browse the Internet while protecting their private browsing data. However, private data leakage threats still exist in browser extensions, even if under PBM.\n\nIn this dissertation, we first investigate two aspects of private data leakage threats associated with browser extensions: (1), aspect-level behavior clustering on browser extensions and its security implications, and (2), identifying privacy breaches caused by extensions under PBM.\n\nFirst, many extensions can be downloaded from webstores without sufficient trust or safety scrutiny, which poses threats on user's private data. In this dissertation, we propose an aspect-level behavior clustering approach to enhancing the safety management of extensions. We decompose an extension's runtime behavior into several pieces, denoted as AEBs (Aspects of Extension Behavior). Similar AEBs of different extensions are grouped into an \"AEB cluster\" based on subgraph isomorphism. We then build profiles of AEB clusters for both extensions and categories (of extensions) to detect suspicious extensions.\n\nSecond, browser extensions can greatly undermine PBM, mostly due to the fact that browsers let extensions handle the private data themselves even if under PBM. We propose an approach to comprehensively identify and stop privacy breaches caused by browser extensions under PBM. We combine dynamic analysis and symbolic execution to represent extensions' behavior. Our analysis shows that many extensions have not fulfilled PBM's guidelines on handling private browsing data. The evaluation results on 1,912 Firefox extensions show that our approach can effectively identify and stop privacy breaches under PBM caused by extensions, with almost negligible performance impact.\n\nFinally, we extend system-level behavior analysis on Android platform.

These applications extend the functionalities of smartphones and make them more convenient for users to be connected. However, these processes generate heavy workload and traffic which negatively affect both smartphones and 3G networks. For smartphones, heavy workload and traffic quickly drain the battery. For 3G networks, traffic increase demands more investment on networks for bandwidth expansion. An additional problem is that the security of 3G networks and their new services have not been fully examined.\n\nThis dissertation contributes to comprehensive solutions that attempt to improve the power efficiency and provide security support for new services in 3G networks. We find that the key reason for the long delay and high power consumption in web browsing is not due to bandwidth limitation in 3G networks. Instead, the local computation limitation and the wireless protocol of the smartphone are the actual limitations which hamper webpage loading rates. To address this issue we design and evaluate an architecture called Virtual-Machine based Proxy (VMP). The argument is that if we can shift the computing from smartphones to the VMP we can enhance speed of access to complex webpages. Second, we design and evaluate an energy-aware approach for web browsing in 3G based smartphones without a remote proxy. When loading a webpage, we reorganize the computation sequence of the web browser so that the web browser can first run the computations that will generate new data transmissions and retrieve these data from the web server. The web browser can then put the 3G radio interface into low power state, release the radio resource and run the remaining computations. After a webpage is downloaded, we introduce a practical data mining based method to predict the user reading time of webpages. This information is used by the smartphone to switch to a low power state when reading time is longer than a threshold. Third, we design and evaluate a new framework which uses Cloud Computing and VM techniques to shift the workload of various services from smartphones to a computational infrastructure in telecom networks. This shift can greatly reduce the workload and expand the resources of smartphones. Finally, we present a novel DoS attack against the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). By congesting the presence service, a core service of IMS, a malicious attack can cause chained automatic reaction of the system, thus blocking all the services of IMS. Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users. To address this DoS attack, we propose an online early defense mechanism, which aims to first detect the attack, then identify the malicious clients, and finally block them.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [819], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Bo ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Guohong Cao", "Thomas F Laporta", "Sencun Zhu", "Heng Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Dissertation Advisor", "Guohong Cao, Committee Chair", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Member", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Heng Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Web Browsing", "3G Networks", "Energy", "Smartphone", "Power", "Security", "Service", "Cloud Computing"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Understanding Human Spatial Navigation Behaviors: A Cognitive Modeling Approach", "id": "28590", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12284", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Spatial navigation behavior is a basic ability for humans and animals to survive on the earth, as it allows us to seek food, return home, and localize friends. It is widely accepted that human navigation relies on some solid representations of space. Previous studies also show that there are two basic spatial representations: 1) the configurational (map) representation that consists of distances, Cartesian (absolute) directions, and geometric relations; 2) the sequential (route) presentation that involves landmarks and orientation sequences. However, how humans apply the two representations in their daily activities and the key factor of navigation process is still under debate. Two contradictory understandings are: 1) that configurational representation is a solid representation that could lead to accurate navigation behavior; 2) humans basically rely on the sequential representation, and the configurational representation can only lead to inaccurate navigation results. \nThis dissertation explored these issues with a new empirical scenario and a novel cognitive modeling approach. First, I conducted an empirical study using NavMaze to examine three new influence factors of navigation process: spatial retention, navigation preference, and mental rotation ability. The empirical results suggest that spatial retention is not a key factor or human navigation process, and the navigation performance is more correlated to navigation preference and mental rotation ability. This result reveals that human navigation process more replies on procedural skills. Second, I implemented a comprehensive cognitive model named NavModel in ACT-R to replicate empirical data. NavModel consists of a text-based testing platform for ACT-R, a mental rotation model based on an extended imaginal module of ACT-R, and an implementation of spatial representations and navigation strategies in ACT-R. The model fits the empirical data well; the mental rotation model, especially, can generate a very accurate prediction. In the modeling and data fitting process there are three new understandings of human navigation process: 1) humans might rely on the sequential representation during navigation; 2) mental rotation ability is a key procedural skill in navigation; 3) humans use object separation and visual matching in the mental rotation process rather than rotating the entire object in their imagination. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11665], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Changkun ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Changkun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Frank Edward Ritter", "Xiaolong Zhang", "John Yen", "Richard Alan Carlson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Frank Edward Ritter, Committee Chair", "Xiaolong Zhang, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Carlson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cognitive Modeling", "ACT-R", "Navigation", "Spatial", "Cognitive Model."]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PLASMA-ENHANCED ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION ZINC OIXDE FLEXIBLE THIN FILM ELECTRONICS", "id": "11467", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1695", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis demonstrates high performance flexible thin film electronics fabricated by low temperature process.  A novel process for forming high quality stable oxide films using weak oxidant plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) has been used to achieve fastest flexible oxide integrated circuits reported to date.  In addition, a unique approach based on plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) silicon nitride for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) encapsulation at low temperature (<70 \u00b0C) is also reported.\n\nAmong several low temperature deposition approaches PEALD process provides highly crystalline and dense ZnO thin films which are uniform and conformal at 200 \u00baC.  Crossover measurement results also demonstrate the advantage of PEALD process in thin film deposition on flexible substrates.  PEALD ZnO flexible TFTs have high field-effect mobility (~ 20 cm2/V&#8729;s) and excellent bias stress stability with ALD Al2O3 passivation.  15-stage ring oscillators with propagation delay of <20 nsec/stage have been successfully fabricated on flexible substrates.  To the best of our knowledge, these are the fastest oxide-semiconductor circuits on flexible substrates reported to date, and they are about 20 times faster than the best previous report.\n\nThis thesis also presents the investigation of ZnO device physics by modeling.  Non-ideal ZnO device characteristics, including passivation, contacts, and output conductance, have been well modeled and verified with experimental results.  Two different approaches were also proposed to extract device parameters for compact models and form the foundation for later circuit design and simulations.  A TCAD ZnO model is established and can well describe the operation physics from single transistor to simple circuits.  This model is verified by reasonable agreement with experimental data.  \n\nBuilding on the results of ZnO TFTs and circuits, several ZnO based applications have been demonstrated.  Microsensors with ZnO pyroFETs have been fabricated on flexible substrates for implantable application, and temperature sensitivity of 7 mV/\u00b0C has been obtained.  Moreover, PEALD ZnO also exhibits excellent low noise characteristics.  A Hooge parameter of less than 10-4 was extracted from low frequency noise measurements.  Based on the radiation hardness of PEALD ZnO, TFTs with Gadolinium as the floating gate have been also demonstrated in neutron detection. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1681], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Dalong ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dalong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Suman Datta", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Chair", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Suman Datta, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Oxide semiconductor", "plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition", "thin film transistor", "flexible electronics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Informal Workplace Communication \u2013 What Roles Can Microblogging Play in It?\n", "id": "16270", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8132", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Informal communication, e.g., unplanned \u201cwater-cooler\u201d conversations, has been suggested to play important roles in collaborative work and organizational innovation.

Without damping, distributed flexible structures are not stable due to the infinite number of resonances at natural frequencies. Bounded sinusoidal inputs at these frequencies can cause unbounded response.  This thesis shows that Passive Control, Iterative Learning Control (ILC), and Repetitive Learning Control (RLC) can be designed to reduce tracking or regulation errors in response to bounded, periodic inputs. Distributed flexible strings, beams, membranes, plates, axially moving materials, electrostatic microbridges, and flexible whisker contact imagers are studied.\n\nPassive control using distributed or boundary damping is proven to stabilize the response of strings, beams, membranes, and plates. Damping ensures bounded response to bounded distributed and boundary inputs.  Distributed viscous or Kelvin-Voigt material damping can guarantee pointwise or strong boundedness for strings and beams and weak boundedness for membranes and plates. Translational damping on one boundary stabilizes strings and beams.  Damping on part of the boundary can also weakly stabilize the forced response of membranes and plates, provided the damped and undamped boundary normals satisfy certain conditions. For example, damping on half and one side of the boundary is sufficient for circular and rectangular domains, respectively.\n\nIterative Learning Control provides precise tension and speed control of axially moving material systems to enable high speed processing of paper, plastics, fibers, and films. PD  tension/speed control is proven to ensure strong and weak boundedness of distributed displacement and tension, respectively, in a single span axially moving material system. ILC provides the same theoretical result with half the speed error and 30% of the tension error of PD control using the same control effort.\n\nRepetitive Learning Control is applied to an electrostatic microbridge and a repetitive contact imager.  Electrostatic microactuators are used extensively in MEMS sensors, RF switches, and microfluidic pumps.  Due to high bandwidth operation, however, reduction of residual vibration using feedback control is difficult to implement. Feedforward RLC is designed, proven stable, and simulated for an electrostatic microbridge under a periodic desired spatial/time trajectory. High residual stresses in the microbridge mean that bending stiffness can be neglected and a pinned string model with uniform loading is appropriate. Squeeze film damping ensures boundedness of the distributed transverse displacement. Offline RLC processing of the average displacement as measured by capacitive sensing updates a waveform generator's parameters. Simulations show a 36% reduction in midspan overshoot under repetitive control.\n\nRepetitive contact imaging uses a flexible whisker attached to a two axis robot through a load cell. Assuming small deformations and rotations, the pitch axis decouples from yaw. The yaw axis, under PD control, sweeps periodically back and forth across the object while the pitch axis, under RLC, maintains a uniform contact force. Once the RLC converges, the 3D contact points can be determined using an elastica algorithm.

This study focuses on a series of education policies on spreading nine-year compulsory education by Soeharto\u00a1\u00afs New Order government.  They include: (1) 1973-1978 School Building Program, (2) 1979-1984 Open Junior High School Program, (3) 1984 compulsory initiative for six-year elementary education, (4) 1989 Education Law on nine-year compulsory education, and (5) 1994 emphasis on three-year lower secondary education.\nCan social engineering like education policies in particular eliminate educational stratification or as Pitirim Sorokin proposes that there is no trend toward either an increase or decrease of social mobility?  The purpose of this study is to provide an insight into this question by examining the effects of a series Indonesian basic education policies on reducing education inequality based on an individual\u00a1\u00afs social origins using the data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey 1997.  In addition, this study is also interested in exploring the gender disparities in basic educational attainment for such an Islam-dominant country.  Are Muslim girls backward in schooling as commonly perceived?\nThe results show that over forty-three years period of time, Indonesian children\u00a1\u00afs basic educational attainment in terms of primary school attendance, primary school completion given primary school attendance and junior high school attendance given primary school completion increased.  The relatively outstanding changes were consistent with the goals of the state\u00a1\u00afs educational policies accompanied with government direct financial investment or corresponded to the country\u00a1\u00afs economic change.  The effects of family background (except number of rooms and mother\u00a1\u00afs education) on the child\u00a1\u00afs educational attainment at the primary level had disappeared for the most recent cohort but its effects on the transition to junior high school demonstrated no trend of either increase or decrease.  The gender disparities in educational attainment at the primary level had disappeared but the advantage of boys at the transition to junior high school was remarkable constancy.  Once the girls had attended the junior high school, they were even more likely than the boys to complete the school for the most recent cohorts because of more competitive for girls at the entrance to junior high school and more working opportunities for boys in the labor market.  Sometimes Islamic girls were most disadvantageous at certain level of basic education and for certain cohort compared with non-Islamic girls, Islamic boys and non-Islamic boys but it was not always the case. \nThe findings suggest that the state education policies with real financial investment on the purpose of expanding educational opportunities would increase people\u00a1\u00afs educational attainment.  However, even if the expansion of an educational system generally decreases inequalities at particular points of school transition, inequality persists at the other points of transition.  The government\u00a1\u00afs efforts on expanding the educational system have not eliminated educational stratification but virtually result in no real change in the structured inequality inherent in differences in family backgrounds.  Gender disparities in basic education did not differ for Islam and non-Islam in most cases.  Even in the few cases when Islamic girls were assured to be backward, the reasons for the backward cannot be simply attributed to the belief of Islam.

Designers are permitted by Moore\u2019s Law to integrate a large number of cores in a single chip. Processors containing close to a hundred of cores will appear in the near future. Using multiple cores on a single\nchip can significantly boost the performance of microprocessors. However, as the semiconductor industry has evolved into the deep sub-micron era, power consumption becomes the constraining factor to the further enhancement of the processor\u2019s performance. Meanwhile, reliability has become an issue when various power management techniques are applied to reduce the power consumption. These have led to the need for designs that carefully balance the trade-offs of all design options in order to achieve high reliability and power-efficiency without harming performance.\nThis dissertation is a step towards developing many-core multiprocessors that address reliability and power-efficiency issues.\nIn this thesis, we address two important multiprocessor characteristics - reliability\nand power-efficiency. Given that caches and interconnection networks in multicores are two structures playing important roles in storing and transmitting program data, their reliability directly affects the correctness of program executions.\nWe first provide a microarchitectural solution that is based on control theory to protect a multicore\u2019s caches against transient errors. Transient errors are caused by particle strikes such as neurons or alpha particles. Caches are particularly susceptible to transient errors due to their large sizes. Our scheme takes two input parameters into account: performance Quality of Service (QoS) requirement and\nreliability Quality of Service requirement. The performance QoS indicates the minimum cache hit rate value acceptable, whereas the reliability QoS represents the desired reliability assurance. By balancing the partitioned cache spaces allocated to data and their replicas, our proposed scheme is able to provide both\nperformance and reliability guarantees.\nTo ensure correct data transmission, on-chip networks usually employ error correction codes to protect the data. However, prior work has mostly employed fixed data retransmission schemes when an error is detected. We propose a flexible scheme that dynamically chooses the time for error checking and retransmission\nand takes advantage of both the end-to-end retransmission and the hop-by-hop\nretransmission in a many-core multiprocessor. Our scheme not only meets the NoC reliability requirements but also improves the power-efficiency.\nBesides their reliability design requirements, caches and networks also need careful consideration with respect to their power characteristics. On-chip networks\nand caches are two major power consumers in many-core multiprocessors aside from the cores. To reduce the power and area costs of on-chip networks, schemes have been proposed to design networks with bufferless routers. However,\nbufferless routers only bring benefits when network utilization is low. We provide a solution with a heterogeneous NoC design that employs both buffered and bufferless routers in the same network. We explore the design space by evaluating different router placements in order to achieve optimal performance with\nmaximum power-efficiency. In order to fully take advantage of the heterogeneous\nNoC architecture, we also design algorithms for application mapping and packet\nrouting.\nThrough our evaluation of parallel programs, we observe that program performances exhibit different scalability characteristics with the number of cores and the size of the caches. Running programs with more cores or larger caches does not always result in better performance but incur larger power overheads. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic scheme to allocate power to cores and\ncaches. Our scheme first predicts the scalability of parallel programs. Then some\ncores or caches are selectively gated off in order to save power. By taking advantage\nof the program scalability, our scheme can achieve near optimal performance with the power available.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10275], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Hui ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Kandemir, Mary Jane Irwin", "Mahmut Kandemir, Mary Jane Irwin", "Padma Raghavan", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Lee David Coraor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Kandemir, Mary Jane Irwin, Dissertation Advisor", "Mahmut Kandemir, Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Chair", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Lee David Coraor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chip Multiprocessors", "reliability", "power efficiency", "program scalability", "NoC design"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Dynamical Gauge Effects and Holographic Scaling of Non-Equilibrium Motion in a Disordered and Dissipative Atomic Gas", "id": "13936jwz5122", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13936", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-01-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, we describe both an experimental implementation and a theoretical investigation of gauge field effects in cold atom systems. The experimental part focuses on the motion of atoms in a disordered potential with dissipation. The atomic system under consideration utilizes a generalization of a dark state cooling mechanism, known as Ramman sideband cooling. By coupling near-resonant laser modes, we create an open system which exhibits a non-equilibrium phase transition between two steady-state behaviors, and shows scale-invariant behavior near the transition. This behavior is loosely analogous to dynamical gauge effects in quantum chromodynamics, and can be mapped onto generalized open problems in theoretical understanding of quantized non-Abelian gauge theories. Additionally, the scaling behavior can be understood from the geometric structure of the gauge potential and linked to a measure of information in the local disordered potential, reflecting an underlying holographic principle.\n\nAs an extension toward developing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems, we consider an experimental strategy of creating many FQH samples along a chain of lattice sites, and coupling them together via tunneling. We calculate a mean-field phase diagram and derive an effective field theory to describe this system and find that such a system support novel insulator and superfluid states. Close to the centrifugal limit with small tunneling strength, 1/2-Laughlin states with N atoms are localized on each lattice site, analogous to Mott-Insulator state. As the tunneling strength increases, the system transitions from the Laughlin-insulator states to superfluid states, whose order parameter reflects the insulator states through momentum and atom number conservation. The transport properties near the phase transition reveal the fractional 'charge' nature of the insulator states, in such that the effective mass of the tunneling quasi-particle is fractionalized. We demonstrate an experimentally feasible pathway to a state describable as a Mott-insulator of 1/2-Laughlin states, and also interrogate the coherence properties of the superfluid phase.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13917], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Jianshi ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jianshi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nathan Gemelke", "Nathan Gemelke", "David Weiss", "Jainendra Jain", "Venkatraman Gopalan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nathan Gemelke, Dissertation Advisor", "Nathan Gemelke, Committee Chair", "David Weiss, Committee Member", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Member", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gauge Field", "Laser Cooling", "Disordered Potential", "Raman Sideband Cooling", "Fractional Quantum Hall", "Non-equilibrium", "Optial Lattice"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Data Dissemination in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks\n", "id": "8624", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3119", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) have been envisioned to be useful in\nroad safety and many commercial applications.\nAlthough VANET is a kind of mobile ad hoc network, many unique\ncharacteristics of VANET bring out new research challenges.\nFor example, due to fast vehicle movement, the\nlink topology changes rapidly.

As of 2005, approximately half of S&P 500 CEOs had employment contracts. A typical contract protects the CEO by decreasing the probability he will be replaced due to poor performance. In this study, I examine whether the presence of a contract ex ante impacts CEO investment decisions. Two competing hypotheses are developed. The incentive effect hypothesis predicts that employment contracts may alleviate managerial concern regarding short-term profits and encourage CEOs to make investments that maximize shareholder value in the long run. Alternatively, the entrenchment effect hypothesis states that contracts may entrench poor-performing CEOs by insulating them from the discipline of the corporate control market and internal governance mechanisms, thereby leading CEOs to pursue private benefits at shareholder expense. An examination of the impact of CEO contracts on acquisition decisions provides support for the incentive effect hypothesis. Specifically, acquirers with CEO contracts pay lower premiums for their targets and experience higher long-run post-acquisition abnormal returns than acquirers without such contracts. Moreover, CEOs with contracts tend to engage in riskier deals. Further, the investigation of the determinants of the use of CEO contracts demonstrates that the probability of a CEO contract is positively related to the magnitude of managerial myopia and the expected costs to shareholders of managerial myopia, consistent with the incentive effect hypothesis. These findings are robust to a variety of model specifications, different event windows and control variables, industry effect and Heckman (1979) self-selection adjustment.

To avoid interference with licensed users, unlicensed users must vacate the spectrum when it is accessed by the primary users who are licensed to access the spectrum. Since it takes some time for the unlicensed users to detect and switch to other available spectrums, the ongoing data transmission may have to be interrupted. This becomes worse in multi-hop cognitive radio networks. Since data has to travel a long path to reach the destination, the data transmission is more likely to be affected by primary user appearance, leading to poor data access performance.\n\nThe specific goal of this dissertation is to support resilient and efficient data access in cognitive radio networks. We achieve this goal by devising techniques to mitigate the effects of primary user appearance. First, to maintain network connectivity, we propose robust topology control approaches in which channels are carefully assigned such that the network will not be partitioned, even when primary users appear. Since the network performance is affected by the interference caused by simultaneous transmissions on the same channel, the proposed approaches also aim to minimize the channel interference. Since the probability for a channel to be affected by the primary user differs, some links may be assigned with low availability channels and hence have low link availability, and then the data transmission on these links can be easily interrupted. Thus, we also propose robust topology control approaches to minimize the channel interference, subject to the requirement on link availability. Second, for the applications which have delay constraints, we propose delay-constrained caching in which data is cached/replicated at appropriate nodes to statistically limit the data access delay. We formulate the cache placement problem in cognitive radio networks as an optimization problem, in which the goal is to minimize the total cost, subject to some delay constraint; i.e., the data access delay can be statistically bounded. To solve this problem, we propose various approaches to balance the tradeoffs between total cost and delay constraint. Finally, we design spectrum-aware data replication schemes to consider both node mobility and primary user appearance. We formulate spectrum-aware data replication as an optimization problem which aims to maximize the average data retrieval probability subject to storage and time constraints. Then we calculate the data transmission capacity upon node contact and further design a distributed replication scheme based on the chance that the replicated data will be retrieved by other nodes.

Negative refractive index is achieved through negative values of the permittivity and permeability in a certain range of frequency. Currently, the metamaterials work well in the range of microwave. In this range, the negative permeability can be readily achieved by using a structure of split-ring resonator (SRR). At the same time, plasma at the gap of SRR is a novel method to provide the negative permittivity. \nIt is straightforward to fabricate SRRs in the laboratory by conventional processes. In this work, silver ring patterns were painted onto the alumina followed by firing at 850\u00b0C in a belt furnace. The geometry of the SRR was designed by the analytical equations and corroborated by the simulation software from CST Corporation. Plasmas in the ring gap were created by exposing the SRR to high power (300W) at the frequency of 2.45GHz in air atmosphere. However, the plasma only lasted for five minutes with serious silver erosion at the gap. Therefore, a protective dielectric layer is proposed in this thesis for SRR working in a harsh plasma environment. \nThe development path begins with evaluating the reliability of the dielectric substrate in a plasma environment. Several oxide substrates were investigated including alumina, silica and a commercial low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC). The effect of plasma treatment on surface morphology and chemistry was characterized by optical profilometry, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A network analyzer with a split-cavity resonator was used to monitor the microware dielectric properties before and after plasma treatment. It has found that small amounts of carbon residues will reduce the Q-factor. Commercial 96%Al2O3 is proven to be a suitable substrate for the SRR.\nSince most serious erosion occurs at the gap of the silver section in SRR, a protective dielectric layer was investigated to prevent degradation of the resonator performance. Several approaches were tried to protect the silver ring resonator including thin coatings made through thick film deposition. All of the SRR structures were tested in a high power microwave chamber which had a 1kW power supply at 2.45GHz. All of the tests were carried out in air and it was found that a plasma could not be ignited for thick dielectric protective coatings. To support the experimental result, simulations by CST software were carried out and the results show that the electric field intensity is substantially lower for thick dielectric coatings. These results suggest that substantially higher microwave power are needed to generate sufficient electric fields to ignite and sustain a plasma as the dielectric layer thickness increases. Comparisons between the uniform dielectric coating and a protective layer with a gap show that the partially protected SRR should work much better. Experimental results show that the SRR sample with partial protection works in a microwave environment for at least 5 hours with no evidence of failure. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12473], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Jing ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jing", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clive A Randall", "Michael T Lanagan", "Dinesh K Agrawal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clive A Randall, Thesis Advisor", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Dinesh K Agrawal, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metamaterials", "split ring resonator", "CST simulation", "plasma", "negative permittivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Rethinking the memory hierarchy design with nonvolatile memory technologies", "id": "21345", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9823", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The memory hierarchy, including processor caches and the main memory, is an important component of various computer systems. The memory hierarchy is becoming a fundamental performance and energy bottleneck, due to the widening gap between the increasing bandwidth and energy demands of modern applications and the limited performance and energy efficiency provided by traditional memory technologies. As a result, computer architects are facing significant challenges in developing high-performance, energy-efficient, and reliable memory hierarchies. New byte-addressable nonvolatile memories (NVRAMs) are emerging with unique properties that are likely to open doors to novel memory hierarchy designs to tackle the challenges. However, substantial advancements in redesigning the existing memory hierarchy organizations are needed to realize their full potential. This dissertation focuses on re-architecting the current memory hierarchy design with NVRAMs, producing high-performance, energy-efficient memory designs for both CPU and graphics processor (GPU) systems.\n\nThe first contribution of this dissertation is to devise a novel bandwidth-aware reconfigurable cache hierarchy with hybrid memory technologies to enhance system performance of chip-multiprocessors (CMPs). In CMP designs, limited memory bandwidth is a potential bottleneck of the system performance. NVRAMs promise high-bandwidth cache solutions for CMPs. We propose a bandwidth-aware reconfigurable cache hierarchy with hybrid memory technologies. With different memory technologies, our hybrid cache hierarchy design optimizes the peak bandwidth at each level of caches. Furthermore, we develop a reconfiguration mechanism to dynamically adapt the cache capacity of each level based on the predicted bandwidth demands of different applications.\n\nThis dissertation also explores energy-efficient graphics memory design for GPU systems. We develop a hybrid graphics memory architecture, employing NVRAMs and the traditional memory technology used in graphics memories, to improve the overall memory bandwidth and reduce the power dissipation of GPU systems. In addition, we design an adaptive data migration mechanism to further reduce graphics memory power dissipation without hurting GPU system performance.\nThe data migration mechanism exploits various memory access patterns of workloads running on GPUs.\n\nFinally, this dissertation discusses how to re-architect the current memory/storage stack with a persistent memory system to achieve efficient and reliable data movements. First, we propose a hardware-based, high-performance persistent memory design. Persistent memory allows in-memory persistent data objects to be updated at much higher throughput than using disks as persistent storage. Most previous persistent memory designs root from software perspective, and unfortunately reduce the system performance to roughly half that of a traditional memory system with no persistence support. One of the great challenges in this application class is therefore how to efficiently enable data persistence in memory. This dissertation proposes a persistent memory design that roots from hardware perspective, offering numerous practical advantages: a simple and intuitive abstract interface, microarchitecture-level optimizations, fast recovery from failures, and eliminating redundant writes to nonvolatile storage media. In addition, this dissertation presents a fair and high-performance memory scheduling for persistent memory systems. This dissertation tackles the problem raised by shared memory interface between memory accesses with and without the persistence requirement. This dissertation proposes a memory scheduling scheme that achieves both fair memory accesses and high system throughput for the co-running applications. Our key observation is that the write operations are also on the critical execution path for persistent applications.

Previously identified best ventilation strategies (fan and outlet locations) for confined-space manure storages with three floor cover types (i.e., solid, fully-slotted, and partially-slotted) and experimentally measured H2S emission rates from this study were key CFD model inputs. The CFD-predicted and experimentally measured Tpel values throughout the entire storage were compared to validate the CFD modeling protocols. An extended validation of the CFD modeling protocols was conducted using an independent on-farm confined-space manure pit. The validated CFD modeling protocols were used to study the effect of air exchange rate and manure storage size on H2S removal. \n\n H2S emission rates from manure in a confined-space manure storage facility were identified for incorporation as a boundary condition for the CFD modeling. In this research, the H2S emission rates were measured experimentally under typical forced ventilation airflow conditions in a prismatic manure storage facility for three weather regimes (Cold: t < 13 oC, Mild: 13 oC < t < 18 oC, Hot: t > 18 oC) for two air exchange rates (Low: 3 AC/min, High: 5 AC/min). The measurements were conducted using the same confined-space manure storages used in previously reported research to measured the decay of H2S and Tpel\u00a1\u00afs from fan ventilated, rectangular prismatic manure storages. An exponential regression model of the form, y =   was identified to express the H2S emission rate from the manure. The emission rates were obtained for six combinations of three weather regimes and two air exchange rates. Air temperature and air velocity above the manure surface significantly (P < 0.05) affect H2S emissions from the stored manure surface.\n\nThe PHOENICS (version 3.6, CHAM, 2005) CFD code was used to simulate H2S decay during forced ventilation in the 5.49 m \u00a1\u00c1 2.74 m \u00a1\u00c1 1.83 m rectangular prismatic confined-space manure storage during forced ventilation. Simulations were conducted for storages with solid, partially-slotted and fully-slotted floor covers. Based on the PHOENICS CFD code performance verification, the CFD code satisfactorily described the flow feature of jet flow near the ventilation fan and successfully simulated H2S concentration decay in a fan ventilated confined-space manure storage facility. In addition, computational grid-dependence and time-step sensitivity studies ensured the accuracy of the CFD simulations. \n\nStatistical criteria for validation of the CFD modeling protocols for controlled laboratory type studies were used for application to the confined-space manure storage field studies. The validation criteria selected were: (1) Predicted and measured times to reduce gas concentration to OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (10 ppm for H2S) agreed to within 10 %; (2) The correlation coefficient of regression of simulated versus measured results is 0.9 or greater; (3) The slope of regression of simulated versus measured results is between 0.75 and 1.25; and (4) The intercept of regression of simulated versus measured results is less than or equal to 25 % of the average measured results. \n\nThe simulated results compared were the time to reduce H2S concentration to 10 ppm (Tpel) and times to reduce H2S concentration to 50% (T50), 25% (T25), and 10% (T10) of initial concentration. The comparisons for the simulated and measured Tpel, T50, T25, and T10 values showed that the CFD model and selected protocols were adequate to simulate H2S concentration decay during forced ventilation in the confined-space manure storages. The selected modeling protocols included incorporation of appropriate inter-contamination ratios in the incoming ventilation air. The inter-contamination ratios used as CFD model inputs were based on field measurements at the prismatic confined-space manure storage facility. Most measured and simulated Tpel\u00a1\u00afs agreed to within 10 %. In addition, all simulations satisfied the statistical criteria for satisfactory performance of the CFD model and protocols for the three floor cover types considered. Thus, the CFD modeling protocols were successfully validated.\n\nThe validated CFD modeling protocols were used to perform simulations of H2S decay during forced ventilation for an independent on-farm confined-space manure storage facility located adjacent to a Nebraska-type barn at the Pennsylvania State University Swine Research Center. H2S decay during the selected forced ventilation strategy was measured and recorded during field experiments to identify corresponding Tpel, T50, T25, and T10 values for H2S evacuation. Measured and simulated times were compared at three locations within the confined-space storage. Most simulated and measured Tpel values agreed to within 10 % and all agreed to within 15 %. Comparisons of all the simulated and measured times satisfied the statistical criteria for acceptance of the CFD model and the modeling protocols. Therefore, the CFD modeling protocols were further validated using a different on-farm manure pit.\n\nThe validated CFD modeling protocols were used to perform simulations for several typical on-farm rectangular and circular confined-space manure storages for several floor cover types (fully-slotted and partially-slotted floor types for rectangular footprint; solid floor type for storages with a circular footprint). Three air exchange rates (1 AC/min, 3 AC/min, and 5 AC/min) were investigated to identify the effect of the air exchange rate on the gas removal. \nFor the rectangular geometry with the two floor cover types, three different lengths were used (5.49m, 12.2m, and 18.3m), while holding the width and depth constant. At the same air exchange rate (i.e., 3 AC/min), the rate of evacuation of H2S from the confined space decreased as the length of the rectangular manure storage increased. As the length of the storage increased to 12.2 m, zones of higher gas concentration (less effectively ventilated zones) developed in the regions closest to the end-walls. The most effectively ventilated zones identified for three lengths for the two floor cover types extended approximately 2.25 m (L = 5.49 m), 3 m (L = 12.2 m), and 5 m (L = 18.3 m) on either side of the centrally located fan. Therefore, a single ventilation fan effectively ventilated the entire confined space for the 5.49 m long manure storage at the air exchange rate of 3 AC/min. However, at storage length of 12.2 m and longer, the most effectively ventilated portion of the confined space extended approximate 50 % of the storage length at the air exchange rate of 3 AC/min. As the AC rates increased in the rectangular confined-space manure storages with the two floor cover types, the rate of evacuation of H2S in the least effectively ventilated region of the storage increased. The relationship between maximum Tpel and AC rate was non-linear and of the form  . However, maximum Tpel values decreased at a decreasing rate with AC rate. At AC rates above 3 to 4 AC/min, maximum Tpel values decreased by less than 20 % for each 1.0 change in AC rate. In addition, the effects of gas emission rate and the inter-contamination strength on gas decay in one of the rectangular manure storages were identified. The inter-contamination strength had a more pronounced effect on the time to reduce H2S concentration to OSHA PEL levels than did the gas emission rate from the manure. Decreasing H2S emission rate from ER(t)=0.65  \u00a1\u00c1 exp (-0.009  \u00a1\u00c1 t) (mg/s) to 0 mg/s reduced maximum Tpel by only 7%. Decreasing inter-contamination strength from 28% to 0% reduced maximum Tpel by 19%. Including non-zero gas emission rates and non-zero inter-contamination ratios in the CFD modeling protocols always yield conservative times to reduce gas concentration to OSHA PEL\u00a1\u00afs in the confined-space manure storage. \n\n\nFor the circular geometry, two diameters were used (4.4m and 6.5m), while holding the depth constant.  The rate of evacuation of H2S from the storage decreased as the diameter of the storage increased for the same air exchange rate (i.e., 3 AC/min).  As the AC rates increased in the circular confined-space manure storages, the rate of evacuation of H2S increased. The relationship between air exchange rate and Tpel was nearly linear for the forced ventilation configuration and circular confined-space manure storages considered.\nThe key findings of this research are: (1) Measured H2S emission rates from stored and agitated manure in forced ventilated manure storage, (2) Validated CFD code and modeling protocols for simulating H2S concentration decay within fan ventilated confined-space manure storages, (3) Identification of relationships between evacuation times (i.e., Tpel) of H2S and air exchange rate for rectangular (non-linear) and circular (nearly linear) confined-space manure storages, (4) Identification of the effect of manure storage length on gas evacuation, and (5) Identification of the effects of gas emission rate from the stored manure and inter-contamination strength in incoming ventilation air on the gas evacuation time from the confined-space manure storages. Based on these findings, a useful simulation protocol was developed to replace measurements of noxious gas concentration decay in fan ventilated confined-space manure storages. These protocols are now available to develop engineering design aids and recommendations for effectively ventilating a wide range of confined-space manure storages.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3236], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Juan ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Juan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harvey Bright Manbeck", "Dennis J Murphy", "Virendra Puri", "Jelena Srebric"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harvey Bright Manbeck, Committee Chair", "Dennis J Murphy, Committee Chair", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member", "Jelena Srebric, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Confined-space manure storages", "ventilation", "hydrogen sulfide", "CFD modeling protocols", "validation", "air exchange rate"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Regulatory role of NKT cells on effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in mice with EAE", "id": "15368", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7308", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vitamin D is an immune regulator and has been shown to be involved in the\ndevelopment and treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS).

Probiotic bacteria of different genera, species, or even different strains may have distinct health benefits. In the past few years, probiotic-containing products, including yogurts and dietary supplements, have gained popularity among consumers. Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BAL) is widely used in yogurt and studies have suggested that it may possess anti-inflammatory activities in the context of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), which refers to conditions of recurring gastrointestinal tract inflammation including Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s Disease (Cdis). In the U.S. alone, about 3 million people were affected by IBD as of 2015 and the total annual cost has been estimated to be $31 billion. The objective of my current study was to compare the potential anti-inflammatory efficacy of a panel of genetically distinct BAL strains in two in vitro models relevant to IBD: tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\uf061-stimulated HT-29 human colon cancer cells and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cells. The former is a model of epithelial inflammation, whereas the latter is a model of innate immune system-mediated inflammation.  I hypothesize that different strains of BAL will differentially reduce pro-inflammatory markers in vitro. \nHT-29 cells were co-incubated with one of 5 of BAL strains (Bl-04, Bi-07, DSM 10140, ATCC 27673, BB-12) for 12 h and then stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 for 6h. Changes in cell culture medium pH, HT-29 cell viability, secreted interleukin (IL)-8 levels, mRNA levels of IL8 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) were examined. Stimulation with TNF-\u03b1 significantly increased secretion of IL-8 by HT-29 cells. Co-incubation with BAL strains reduced the production of IL-8 in a strain-specific manner. Bl-04, Bi-07, ATCC 27673, DSM 10140 and BB-12 reduced IL-8 by 19%, 24%, 39%, 43%, 61% respectively. These reductions occurred in the absence of significant changes in HT-29 cell viability. The BAL strains decreased the pH of the cell culture media in a strain-specific manner and a positive correlation between lower medium pH and decreased IL-8 levels was observed. The mRNA levels of IL8 were not significantly changed by BAL treatment. \nRAW 264.7 cells were co-incubated with one of 5 of BAL strains (Bl-04, Bi-07, DSM 10140, ATCC 27673, BB-12) for 12 h and then stimulated with or without LPS for 8h. Changes in the cell culture medium pH, RAW 264.7 cell viability, secreted TNF-\u03b1 and nitric oxide (NO) levels, and mRNA levels of Tnfa, nitric oxide synthase (Nos)2 and Il6 were examined. The BAL strains, in the absence of LPS treatment, increased production of TNF-\u03b1 (67 \u2013 158-fold) and NO (8-fold). Stimulation with LPS significantly increased secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and NO by RAW 264.7 cells. Compared to the stimulated control, Bl-04 (18% decrease), DSM 10140 (18% decrease), ATCC 27673 (37% decrease) and BB-12 (44% decrease) significantly reduced TNF-\u03b1 production by stimulated RAW 264.7 cell. ATCC 27673 (25% decrease) and BB-12 (30% decrease) significantly mitigated the stimulatory effects of LPS on NO production. Positive correlations between lower medium pH and decreased levels of TNF-\u03b1 or NO were observed. BAL increased mRNA levels of Tnfa (4 \u2013 13-fold), Nos2 (42-fold) but not Il6. In LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, treatment with BB-12 significantly reduced Tnfa (50% reduction) and Il6 (57% reduction) mRNA level while Bi-07 increased Il6 mRNA level by 50%; other strains did not have obvious effects on mRNA levels. These results are somewhat confounded, however, because BAL treatment significantly reduced the viability of RAW264.7 cells, and thus we are unable to determine whether the effect of BAL in this model are due to direct anti-inflammatory effects or are secondary to BAL-induced cytotoxicity.  \nBased on SNP analysis comparing Bi-07 and BB-12, we speculate that differences in genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism may contribute to the strain-specific differences in immune effects of BAL. Specifically, the SNP located in the gene of putative glucose uptake permease (glcU) was shown in a previous study to be associated with different glucose uptake rates observed in BB-12 (higher rate) and Bi-07 (lower rate). The SNP in the gene of thiamin precursor transporter (THMP) may influence the metabolism of thiamin, which is an important co-factor for key enzymes in bifid shunt. In addition, other SNPs fall into gene sequences with unidentified function. It cannot be discounted that these SNPs play a role in the strain-specific effects observed, as such further investigation is needed to directly examine the impact of these SNPs on the immunomodulatory effects of BAL. \nThe present research represents an initial systematic study on strain-level differences in the anti-inflammatory effects of BAL. Understanding the impact of strain-level differences will provide a rationale for selection of a specific strain to maximize anti-inflammatory efficacy.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15695], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Kuier ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "first_name_ssi": "Kuier", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert", "Robert F Roberts", "Connie Jo Rogers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert, Thesis Advisor", "Robert F Roberts, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bifidobacterium animalis. lactis", "Strain-specificity", "Intestinal inflammation", "Intestinal epithelial cells", "Macrophage cells", "Cytokines", "SNPs analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONAL STUDY OF POLLEN-EXPRESSED EXPANSINS IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA", "id": "8973", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3940", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Expansins are wall proteins that are capable of promoting plant cell wall extension.  They are encoded by a gene superfamily, which consists of four distinct families, EXPA, EXPB, EXLA, and EXLB.  EXPA and EXPB were discovered as they reconstitute wall extension of the heat-inactivated cucumber hypocotyls whereas EXLA and EXLB were identified based on the sequence similarity to the first two families.  The mechanism of expansin function is proposed as weakening the hydrogen bonds between cellulose microfibrils to facilitate wall loosening.  Large numbers of expansins have been identified in plants from mosses to angiosperms, and in non-plants as well.  However, in vivo functional study of expansins is very limited.  \nIn this dissertation, a group of pollen-expressed Arabidopsis expansins were selected for functional study in both vegetative and reproductive growth.  EXPA13 expression was observed in microsporogenesis and in the differentiating vessel elements.  Reverse genetic studies were performed in three expa13 mutants.  Atexpa13-1, a qrt1 background mutant with increased gene expression, produces half-collapsed tetrads in the heterozygous mutant, in which wild-type pollen tends to break.  It is proposed that imbalanced microspore expansion in heterozygous tetrad leads to the phenotype.  No significant change in pollen size was observed in two other knockout mutants, atexpa13-2 and atexpa13-3.  The attempts to obtain expa13 qrt1 double mutant by crossing atexpa13-2 and qrt1-1 plants have failed.  \nDeficient vegetative growth has been observed in EXPA13 knockout mutant with differential severities on different ecotypes.  Transcript analysis and mutant observation suggest that EXPA13 controls cell elongation as well as wall thickening during xylem element development.  Combining the phenotypic changes in microsporogenesis and stem development, I conclude that EXPA13 facilitates microspore expansion and xylem element elongation.\nEXPA4, EXPA24, and EXPB5 are expressed in Arabidopsis mature pollen grains and elongating pollen tubes.

Due to benefits to the environment and energy savings, green roof technology is rapidly gaining popularity in North America as a sustainable design option for buildings. Many previous studies have demonstrated that the addition of green roofs could save energy for space cooling during the summer. However, there are limited studies focused on the performance of green roofs during the heating season, especially under snow. In order to contribute to green roof buildings in regions with cold winter and snow, this current thesis presents an on-site experimental investigation and focuses on the assessment of snow effects on heating loads calculation for green roof buildings during the winter.\n This field experiment took place during the winter of 2010-2011, monitored three green roof buildings, two roof reference buildings and one bare soil roof building. The six buildings were constructed identically and instrumented with a network of sensors. To describe the indoor and outdoor environment of the buildings, a weather station collected meteorological data; the sensor network was able to collect the data related to the building parameters. Manual measurements were conducted during the snow period to obtain snow properties. The manual data of three types of buildings were compared to each other. In addition, a heat balance model for roofs with snow layer was set based on the collected data. In order to calculate the heating loads and roof resistance better, a list of equations for snow conductivity calculation was given. \n By regarding the measured heat flux through the roofing system as the main indicator to show the roofs performance, an analysis was made to compare the different types of roof. The comparison was made for one continuous week-time when there was snow on the roofs, and for another continuous week-time during the no-snow period. The measured heat flux data were analyzed statically by setting three null hypotheses; the results showed all the calculated p-values were less than 0.05 and the hypotheses were rejected, indicating that the roof type was a significant factor affecting the heat loss through the roof from the building interior. The comparison of mean heat flux showed the green roof building had the least heat loss among the three types of buildings, regardless of the accumulated snow layer. In addition, the results indicated that the green roof buildings had larger heat loss reduction when there was no snow on the roofs. This may be because the existence of the snow layer affected the R-value of the entire roofing system and the heat transfer process through the roofs, thus reducing the thermal performance of the green roof.   \nFinally, the relationship between snow properties and heat loss was presented for each type of buildings. The changes of daily snow properties, including snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow density were presented with the change of heat loss during the snow period. The results indicated that the green roof buildings had different relationships compared with other buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4531], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Mingjie ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mingjie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric", "Jelena Srebric", "Robert Berghage Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric, Thesis Advisor", "Jelena Srebric, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Berghage Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["HEATING LOADS", "GREEN ROOFS", "HVAC SYSTEMS", "SNOW EFFECTS"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Influence of Interactions among Adjacent Buildings on Their Energy Consumption for Sustainable Neighborhood Design", "id": "23523", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10659", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sustainable neighborhood and building design has become a popular research interest in recent years. Most current building design processes do not involve the consideration of the urban neighborhood where the building is located. Although few previous studies investigated the interactions between buildings, studies based on realistic neighborhoods and utility data are limited. \nUniversity campuses can be taken as a neighborhood case study with reach data sets available through the campus facility management offices. This thesis project has studied a campus neighborhood to evaluate how interactions among adjacent buildings affect the infiltration and shading of individual buildings in this environment. The thesis research objectives include (1) quantification of the effects of surrounding buildings and urban neighborhood patterns on the infiltration and energy consumption of a building, and (2) development of a workflow to promote design of sustainable neighborhood with the LEED Neighborhood Development (ND) guidelines.\nBy performing case studies using the utility data measured for buildings in this selected neighborhood, results of the paired T tests show that the neighborhood patterns had statistically significant effects on the building energy consumption. In order to quantitatively evaluate the effects of interactions between surrounding buildings, one building in this neighborhood was also chosen for detailed simulations. The simulation aimed to estimate the infiltration rates and energy consumption by using three simulation tools: CFD0 (Computational Fluid Dynamic simulation tool), CONTAM (multi-zone simulation tool), and EnergyPlus (energy simulation tool). The results show that with different layouts of surrounding buildings, the monthly percentage difference of infiltration loads can be as high as 14%, which confirms the findings in the case study.\nBased on the model established for this neighborhood, sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of two neighborhood variables including heights of surrounding buildings and site orientation. The results show that the monthly infiltration rates decrease with the increased heights of surrounding buildings. The largest monthly percentage difference of infiltration loads is 25%. For simulation cases with different site orientations, the largest monthly percentage difference for infiltration loads is 18%.\nIn addition, this research study investigated the infiltration rates for different U.S. climate zones using the neighborhood model. The simulated results show that Madison, WI has relatively higher air infiltration rates than the infiltration rates in Baltimore, MD and Atlanta, GA. However, the differences in infiltration rates among the three investigated climate zones are limited and not as significant as other comparison cases in the sensitivity analysis.\nWith the simulation results, this thesis project also included an investigation on the LEED Neighborhood Development (ND), aimed to promote construction of sustainable campuses by combining the research findings with the requirements and credits in LEED ND. The developed workflow included selection of construction site and orientation. The surrounding buildings in the urban neighborhood should be considered to benefit the new construction by providing shading and wind shielding. \nIn summary, by reducing infiltration rates and providing additional shading, the impact of interaction among adjacent buildings on the building energy consumption is not negligible by an average monthly difference of 12%. Results of this dissertation project may lead to an increased awareness that a building is impacted by its immediate surroundings and provided a reference for the future design of sustainable neighborhood.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10291], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Mingjie ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mingjie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jelena Srebric", "Jelena Srebric", "William P Bahnfleth", "Mosuk Chow", "Stephen James Treado"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jelena Srebric, Dissertation Advisor", "Jelena Srebric, Committee Chair", "William P Bahnfleth, Committee Chair", "Mosuk Chow, Committee Member", "Stephen James Treado, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Building energy", "Building interaction", "Sustainable neighborhood design", "Energy simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Discovering and Mitigating Software Vulnerabilities Through Large-scale Collaboration", "id": "13391muz127", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13391", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In today's rapidly digitizing society, people place their trust in a wide range of digital services and systems that deliver latest news, process financial transactions, store sensitive information, etc. However, this trust does not have a solid foundation, because software code that supports this digital world has security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are the root causes of many security incidents, ranging from massive user information leakages, to the damage of industrial control systems.\n\nSecurity professionals have been working hard to eliminate software vulnerabilities with mainly two approaches. The first approach is to protect software programs from unknown attacks at production run-time. The second approach is to continuously review and test a software product even after release, in order to find and fix vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. However, both approaches are limited by the capability and resource available to an individual program instance or a single organization.\n\nThis dissertation proposes and evaluates novel approaches for discovering and mitigating software vulnerabilities based on large-scale collaborations, which overcome the limitations of an individual party. We first look at how software program instances can autonomously collaborate with each other to defend against zero-day attacks. We propose a new security defense called collaborative run-time protection, which distributes the high overhead of security monitoring to a set of software instances, and coordinates the instances so that together they can cover the potential vulnerability space. Once an instance detects a zero-day vulnerability, it quickly shares a codeless patch with other instances so that the whole group becomes immune to the threat. We implement a prototype system called HeapCRP, which protects C/C++ programs from heap memory bugs. Our evaluation shows that HeapCRP is effective against real world vulnerabilities, with low cost.\n\nWe next explore the rapidly growing vulnerability discovery ecosystem emerging from the collaboration between organizations and the global white hat hacker community. Our study shows that this collaboration has yielded tens of thousands of vulnerabilities being discovered and fixed in the past several years, for a wide range of organizations, including many famous Internet companies, financial institutions, and even government agencies. We further provide evidence showing that white hats' scrutiny makes finding new vulnerabilities increasingly difficult, indicating improved security for these organizations. However, we also identified several frictions that raise the cost and risk of such collaboration. Therefore, we further propose new models and policies to scale the promise of this collaboration to a larger number of organizations and white hats. We first propose a new hacker allocation mechanism to reduce the number of duplicated reports. Next, we evaluate existing bug bounty policies that aim to control the quality of submission from hackers, and propose a new policy that has several advantages over existing ones.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13128], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Mingyi ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mingyi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peng Liu", "Peng Liu", "Jens Grossklags", "Xinyu Xing", "Minghui Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peng Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Peng Liu, Committee Chair", "Jens Grossklags, Committee Member", "Xinyu Xing, Committee Member", "Minghui Zhu, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["software vulnerability", "bug bounty", "memory corruption", "software diversity", "crowdsourcing"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Investigation of the molecular genetics of Drosophila synapse assembly", "id": "22720", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10375", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The nervous system consists of billions of neurons that interconnect to form functional neural circuits and networks. Synapses, the fundamental units of nervous system, are the highly-specialized cell junctions that mediate intercellular communication. The coordinated synaptic growth and plasticity ensures synaptic transmission upon intrinsic and environmental stimulus. Insight into the mechanism of synapse assembly is critical to our understanding of the nervous system and neurological diseases. In this study, by using the well-established model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, I aimed to gain further insight into the important regulatory components involved in synapse development. In particular, serine-threonine kinase Akt, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and genes affecting cytoskeleton organization were investigated for their functions in the assembly of postsynaptic specializations. \n\nAkt is an integral element of phosphatidylinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K)-Target of Rapamycin (TOR)-Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) signaling, a pathway that known to affect synapse assembly in both vertebrates and Drosophila.  In this work, the role of Akt in synapse assembly has been examined at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a glutamatergic synapse that displays developmental and activity-dependent plasticity. The single Drosophila Akt family member, Akt1 selectively altered the postsynaptic targeting of one glutamate receptor subunit, GluRIIA, and was required for the expansion of a specialized postsynaptic membrane compartment, the subsynaptic reticulum (SSR).\n\nA novel function of heparan sulfate-modified proteoglycans at the postsynaptic muscle cells has been identified as regulating a cellular membrane trafficking event, autophagy. HSPGs are a ubiquitous class of macromolecules that play important roles in molecular signaling and morphogen distribution in the extracellular spaces. Loss of HS-biosynthesis in the muscle cell disrupted the organization of SSR, and produced changes in mitochondrial morphology and numbers. Molecular and genetic findings showed these phenotypes were resulted from inappropriate activation of autophagy. Reducing autophagy in animals with globally compromised HS biosynthesis partially rescued the associated lethality, showing that autophagy is critically affected by HS production. Further evidence showed that HSPGs control autophagy via regulation of PI3K, a downstream mediator of a number of growth factors. \n\nA forward genetic screen was performed in our lab, designed to identify potential Akt1 downstream effectors and other novel genes required for synapse assembly. DnaJ2 (CG10565) and Acinus were identified for their specific requirements in the regulation of glutamate receptor composition and postsynaptic membrane organization respectively. Further experiments revealed that Acinus mediates autophagosome maturation. Animals defective for autophagy exhibited disorganization of both SSR membrane structures and \u03b1-Spectrin networks, suggesting that autophagy may affect synapse formation via the control of cytoskeletons.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10043], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Na ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Na", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott Brian Selleck", "Scott Brian Selleck", "Bernhard Luscher", "Richard W Ordway", "Zhi Chun Lai"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott Brian Selleck, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott Brian Selleck, Committee Chair", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["synapse development", "GluRIIA localization", "subsynaptic reticulum", "Akt", "heparan sulfate proteolycan", "autophagy", "Acinus", "spectrin"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Mixture Model Learning with Instance-level Constraints", "id": "6605", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5085", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Machine learning traditionally includes two categories of methods: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In recent years, one paradigm, semi-supervised learning, has attracted much more interest due to large data sets with only partial label information from different domains such as web search, text classification, and machine vision. However, much prior knowledge or problem-specific information cannot be expressed with labels and hence cannot be used by existing semi-supervised learning methods. In other words, we require extensions of semi-supervised learning that can encode these types of auxiliary information; of particular interest is information that can be encoded as instance-level constraints.\n\nThis dissertation presents a mixture model-based method able to make use of domain-specific information to improve clustering. The domain-specific information is cast in the form of instance-level constraints, i.e., pairwise sample constraints. Most prior work on semi-supervised clustering with constraints assumes the number of classes is known, with each learned cluster assumed to be a class and hence subject to the given class constraints. When the number of classes is unknown or when the ``one-cluster-per-class' assumption is not valid, the use of constraints may actually be deleterious to learning the ground-truth data groups. The proposed method addresses this by 1) allowing allocation of multiple mixture components to individual classes and 2) estimating both the number of components and the number of classes. This method also addresses new class discovery, with components void of constraints treated as putative unknown classes.  The improvement in clustering performance by this method for the case of partially labeled data sets is also illustrated. We also explore discriminative learning with instance-level constraints in this dissertation. Our proposed discriminative method assumes a family of discriminant functions specified with a set of parameters, and uses the minimum relative entropy principle to find a distribution over these parameters. The final discriminant decision rule is obtained by averaging over all classifiers. \n\nThe second major contribution of this dissertation is to image segmentation. The domain-specific information in images is spatial\ncontinuity, which can also be converted into instance-level constraints. After applying the proposed mixture-model-based method with constraints to image segmentation, we obtain a standard Markov random field potential objective function. Due to the structure of the constraints, a sequence-based forward/backward algorithm, i.e., a novel structured mean-field method, is presented. Better performance is obtained than a standard mean-field annealing algorithm.\n\nAn investigation of model selection techniques is another contribution in this dissertation. In the\nproposed mixture-model-based method, the cluster number is determined with model selection. We provide an integrated learning and model selection framework, which performs batch optimization over the components and has the character of deterministic annealing with the optimization performed over a sequence of decreasing ``temperatures'. With a large number of components initialized and only well-initialized components kept, this method is less sensitive to local optima than the standard EM algorithm.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5060], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Qi ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Jonathan Miller", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "George Kesidis", "Jia Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Jonathan Miller, Committee Chair", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Member", "George Kesidis, Committee Member", "Jia Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["semi-supervised learning with instance-level const", "mixture modeling with constraints", "constrained clustering", "image segmentation with background information"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Ion Transport and Storage in Ionic Electroacive Polymer Membranes", "id": "15273", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7273", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A great deal of research efforts have been denoted to ionic electroactive devices such as ionic electroactive polymer (i-EAP) actuators and supercapacitors. I-EAP actuators are attractive because relatively large electromechanical actuation can be generated under low voltage (a few volts). Hence they can be directly integrated with microelectronic controlling circuits, which have operation voltage of several volts, to perform complex actuation functions, and the low operation voltage also makes them safe to use. Thus they hold promise for a broad range of applications. Supercapacitors, because of their reasonable energy density, relatively high charge/discharge time and long cycle life, provide important energy storage devices besides batteries. The performance of these ionic electroactive polymer devices all combine an understanding of the ion and charge transfer processes that occur in the systems. For real devices, the structures can be very complicated. Yet from fundamental principle, the system can be abstracted to a simple one: metal-ionic conductor-metal sandwich structure. It provides a good study platform for ion transport and storage on ionic electroactive polymers.\nIn general, the response of ionic devices to external applied voltage is slow. For example, major actuation of i-EAP actuators occurs at >0.1s seconds after the application of electric stimulus. In earlier studies[1], it is observed that there is substantial non-linear increase of charge accumulated for ionic liquid (IL) of 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate (EMI-TF) in Aquivion membrane. In this thesis, further investigations are developed to determine whether the effect is limited to this combination of IL/ionomers or a more general phenomenon. \nPolymer matrix and ionic liquid are always the two basic elements to build up the ionic devices. Along this train of thought, hydrophobic IL 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(rtrifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMI-TFSI) is adopted, comparing with the original hydrophilic IL EMI-TF. On the other hand, P(VDF-CTFE) based polymer matrix group is characterized, which have a drastically different morphology with ionomer Aquivion previous study used.\nBoth the charge response and bending actuation of membrane actuators from these polymer/ILs combinations are investigated, especially at longer time scale (>0.1s). The results show that the nonlinear response of the total charge storage in i-EAPs with applied voltage also occurs in these polymer/IL systems and suggest that the nonlinear charge response at long time scale is a general phenomenon for ionic devices. The time dependence of the bending actuation vs. the charge stored is also studied and the results reveal that charge stored at different periods lead to curvature to various degree. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7254], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Ran ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ran", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Shizhuo Yin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Thesis Advisor", "Shizhuo Yin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["electroactive polymer actuator", "nonlinear effect", "ionic liquid"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Nonlinear Optical Processes In Liquid Crystals And Applications In Optical Switching ", "id": "27231", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12023", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation research completes the exploration and development of the theoretical framework for collective liquid crystalline optical nonlinearities capable of response speeds in the microseconds \u2013 nanoseconds scale, which is more than 1000 times faster than the conventional liquid crystal (LC) response speed. Also explored in this dissertation are utilizations of these new discoveries to achieve all-optical switching.\nThis work demonstrates all-optical switching using nonlinear orientational and thermal effects, respectively, in pure and dye-doped twisted nematic liquid crystal (TNLC) cells set between crossed polarizers. In the former case, the flow of liquid crystal molecules is generated by Maxwell stress and thereby exerts a torque on the liquid crystal. The resulting reorientation changes the effective birefringence of the liquid crystal, affecting the overall transmission. In dye-doped twisted nematics, the absorption of dye enhances laser heating in the liquid crystal, which leads to reduction of the order parameter and the corresponding macroscopic birefringence, finally making the transmission drop to zero. Following the sequences of these processes, detailed modeling for collective responses of liquid crystal and the time evolution of transmissions under short laser pulses are presented. \nBesides theoretical description and modeling, we demonstrate the nonlinear optical switching experimentally. The switching threshold and time are consistent with the simulation results. While dye-doped liquid crystals have a low threshold for nonlinear switching, pure twisted nematics possess high transparency in the entire visible and near-infrared spectrum. These findings are believed to advance the current arsenal of high-performance materials for integration/use in advanced optical systems designed for sensor protection; laser hardening; and other beam/image switching, sensing, and processing operations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11454], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Shuo ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shuo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Iam Choon Khoo", "Iam Choon Khoo", "Shizhuo Yin", "Timothy Joseph Kane", "Jun Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Iam Choon Khoo, Committee Chair", "Iam Choon Khoo, Dissertation Advisor", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member", "Timothy Joseph Kane, Committee Member", "Jun Huang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nonlinear Optics", "Liquid Crystals", "Optical Switching"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Radar Meteor Trail Detection and Classification", "id": "11179", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5895", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Meteor data are continuously collected by radars operating year round. Analyzing this fast growing, large dataset requires efficient and reliable detection routines. Currently, most meteor echo detection routines automatically detect underdense meteor trails but overlook overdense meteor trails and usually fail on non-specular trails. In this thesis, a multilayer radar detection algorithm is proposed to detect and correctly identify multiple types of meteor trail reflections. The complete process consists of two steps. The first step is based on the time-frequency waveform detector developed by Kang and Palo [2007]. We started by selecting low signal to noise ratio in order to detect all types of radar signals; however, a high probability of false alarm was produced. In the second step, several features from the detected echoes in step one are extracted and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is constructed to further classify these echoes. The algorithm was tested using data from a 50-MHz radar stationed near Salinas Puerto Rico on April 5, 1998. A total of 271 detected echoes were labeled as underdense, overdense, non-specular, other ionospheric echoes, and noise. We used 208 echoes as training and 63 echoes as testing samples. This technique successfully classified about 85% of the testing samples. Details concerning implementation, feature extraction, and data visualization are presented in this thesis.\nLastly, the effects of the Earth\u2019s magnetic B field on the detection of meteor trails are analyzed. Our data show that non-specular trails were exclusively detected when the radar k vector was oriented perpendicular to B, which is consistent with recent work reported by others. We also found that more specular trails were detected with the radar beam perpendicular to B than the beam pointed off-perpendicular to B. This may indicate that the development of turbulence enhances the specular reflection radar cross-section or relaxes the specular criterion to larger angles.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5891], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Siming ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Siming", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Julio Urbina", "Julio Urbina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Julio Urbina, Thesis Advisor", "Julio Urbina, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["detection", "meteor trails"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Modeling of Large-format Li-ion Cell Performance and Safety", "id": "20010", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9586", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Small Li-ion batteries have been widely used for consumer electronics due to their high power and energy density. Large-format Li-ion batteries are believed to be essential for vehicle- and grid- energy storage enabling a sustainable energy future. Today, scale-up of Li-ion cells has not maximized the potential of available battery materials, leading to much lower energy density than their coin cell benchmarks. How to unlock the potential of existing Li battery materials and scale up Li-ion cells to 10-100 Ah sizes without substantially lowering the cell\u2019s energy density remains a key technological challenge. \nSafety has become another pressing issue with the increasing interest in large-format Li-ion batteries for automotive applications due to the high energy density of Li-ion batteries and wide-ranging working conditions for electric vehicles compared with electronic applications. The highest specific energy available in today\u2019s commercial Li-ion rechargeable batteries is approximately 240 Wh/kg, almost 20% of the energy content of TNT at 4.61 MJ/kg. The release of the battery energy in an abnormal way could cause catastrophic consequences. Large-format Li-ion batteries are particularly vulnerable to abusive conditions because of their higher energy content.\nExperimental study of large-format Li-ion batteries performance and safety is more expensive and dangerous to perform than that of small batteries, making modeling a valuable tool for this purpose. In this work, a 3D, multiscale and electrochemical-thermal coupled model is introduced to study the performance and safety issues uniquely presented in large-format Li-ion cells. Firstly, we study the scale-up of Li-ion cells from coin cells to large-format cells. We show that significant performance penalty can be caused in large-format spirally wound cells if only one single pair of tabs is used for current collecting. The reason for the inferior performance is due to the in-plane electrons transport loss in the long current collector foils and non-uniform active material utilization. An effective design to mitigate the performance loss in large-format cells is to use multiple tabs minimizing the voltage loss and increasing the active material utilization uniformity. The effect of tab number and location is investigated using the 3D modeling tool. A quantitative relationship between the cell\u2019s useable energy density and the current density non-uniformity is established, for the first time, in the literature. Secondly, we use the 3D electrochemical-thermal coupled model to study the full nail penetration process of a large format cell. It is found that the thermal response of cell is closely coupled with its electrochemical performance after penetration. Two heating regimes, namely global heating and local heating are identified. The effect of various parameters such as shorting contact resistance, nail diameter, nail thermal conductivity, cell capacity, etc. is investigated using modeling. Finally, we use the model to study the internal short-circuit of a large-format Li-ion cell by a metal particle.  Compared with nail penetration, tab heating becomes an important mechanism in internal short-circuit. The cell electrochemical and thermal behavior changes significantly with the metal particle size and shorting resistance. The model results provide explanations for the poor reproducibility of the present nail penetration and internal short-circuit experimental methods. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9353], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Chao Yang Wang", "Donghai Wang", "Christopher Rahn", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Li-ion cell", "battery", "modeling", "safety"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Efforts Toward Catalytic Methods Based on P(III)/P(V) Redox Cycling", "id": "28691", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12246", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation describes efforts in the development of catalytic methods that are based on P(III)/P(V) redox cycling.

The synthetic utility of this transformation is exemplified by the reductive X-H (X = O, N, S) and C-H functionalizations. Mechanistic study and asymmetric variants are also presented. Several future avenues are documented to demonstrate the broader ambiphilic reactivity of Kukhtin-Ramirez adducts.

This thesis proposes a two-stage Bayesian based design method to construct an ALT plan that is robust with respect to distribu- tion misspecification and parameter uncertainty. In the method, the first stage experiment gives posteriors of parameters and distribution information, which are then used in the second stage experiment to get the final updated posteriors.

The changes of matrix volume would affect the permeability in coal during CBM production and have impact on CO2 coalbed sequestration. Shale, as a sorptive rock, is expected to have similar sorption-induced change of matrix volume. Besides its influence on permeability, the change of matrix volume would also change stress status in formation, thus affecting well stability. Therefore, a thorough understanding of sorption-induced strain in coal and shale is critical for the energy bearing subsurface characterization. In this study, an optical-based strain measurement apparatus was designed and established to measure the areal strain of specimens of San Juan coal, Hazelton coal and Marcellus shale with carbon dioxide and helium injections. For coals, compared with strain gauge, this optical method avoids the use of chemical glue and reduces the influence of the built-in cleats. At 5 MPa CO2, the linear strain of San Juan coal is 0.7% in current work but the value measured by pervious researchers using strain gauges is 0.37%, which is expected. The areal strain results for San Juan coal and Hazelton coal follows the Langmuir-type equation. Liu and Harpalani model was also used to model the pressure-strain data and the modeled results well matched with the measured strain data by choosing proper rock properties. The swelling of Hazelton coal with CO\u00ac2 is greater than that of San Juan coal at low pressure (<2.48MPa), and lower than that of San Juan coal at high pressure (>2.48MPa), which means the swelling depends not only on rank but also on other petrophysical properties. For Marcellus shale specimens, a negative strain was observed with CO2 at low pressure (0.69MPa). This repeatable results might imply that the adsorption-induced swelling was fully offset by the mechanical compression at low pressure. With injection pressure increase, the adsorption-induced strain started to dominate the overall strain behavior and a maximum swelling strain of 0.18% was observed for the tested shale.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11136], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Xu ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xu", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shimin Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shimin Liu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Coal", "Shale", "Sorption-induced Strain", "New Optical Method"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Engineering Plasmonics: An Engineering Approach to Interdisciplinary Challenges", "id": "23521", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10642", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\u201cEngineering Plasmonics\u201d describes application-oriented engineering approaches that utilizes the knowledge base of the plasmonic research to address most significant issues encountered in different research fields.

By using geometric description (sharp interface model) to represent the vesicle surface, and a phase field labeling function to distinguish the different components on the vesicle, the total energy, governing the equilibrium shapes of the vesicle, is set up. By solving the Euler-Lagrange equations, we present a number of typical adhered axisymmetric two-component vesicle profiles.

Like other CT antigens, PRAME is a multi-copy gene family representing one of the most amplified gene families in eutherian mammals. Members of the PRAME gene family encode leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins that fold into a horseshoe shape and provide a versatile structural framework for the formation of protein-protein interactions. PRAME has been extensively studied in cancer biology and is believed to play a regulatory role in cancer cells. The function of PRAME during testicular development and spermatogenesis remains unknown. The objective of this study is to characterize the expression of PRAME during spermatogenesis, to identify protein(s) that interact with PRAME and to explore the possible functions of PRAME. We chose the bovine PRAMEY (on chromosome Y) and mouse Pramel1 (on chromosome 4) as representatives of the PRAME gene family in this study. Using a custom peptide-specific antibody, PRAMEY was characterized as a testis- and spermatozoa-specific protein in bovine. PRAMEY was expressed in the acrosome of spermatids, as well as the acrosome and flagellum of spermatozoa. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed the subcellular localization of PRAMEY in spermatids and spermatozoa: PRAMEY was firstly localized in the acrosomal granule of step 4 spermatids, migrated with the content of acrosomal granule during spermiogenesis, and was finally present in the acrosome lumen of mature spermatozoa. To identify the PRAME interactive protein(s), we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using the PP1\u03b32 and PRAMEY antibodies in bovine spermatozoa. The results showed that PRAMEY was co-immunoprecipitated with PP1\u03b32 in caput and caudal epididymal sperm. By blocking PRAMEY during in vitro fertilization (IVF), fewer embryos were formed while the incidence of polyspermy increased, suggesting a role of PRAMEY in fertilization and blocking of polyspermy. In mice, the expression level of the PRAMEL1 protein was very low in newborn testes, then was increased gradually from 1- to 3-week-old testes, and remained constant after three weeks of age. Immunofluorescent staining on testis cross sections revealed that PRAMEL1 was localized in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes in 2-week-old testis, and translocated to the acrosomal region of round spermatids in 3-week-old testis. Taken together, these results suggest that PRAME is involved in acrosome formation during spermatogenesis, functions in block to polyspermy during fertilization, may interact with PP1\u03b32 and play a role in the regulation of sperm motility.

The slow oxygen transport in the cathode of a typical air-cathode MFC is one of the limiting factors giving rise to low kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in these systems. This research was aimed at studying gas-phase oxygen transport in air-cathode MFCs by the comparative performance of heliox- (21% oxygen and 79% helium, which enhances oxygen diffusivity relative) and air-supplied reactors. Identical air-cathode MFCs were operated until they all attained stable electrochemical performance. Two pairs of reactors were then switched to either air- or heliox-fed conditions, with one reactor maintain as an air-cathode control.  The cathode potentials of heliox-fed MFCs significantly increased and were higher than those of air-fed reactors. At a gas flow rate of 5 L/h, the highest peak current obtained by heliox-fed MFCs was 10 A/m2, compared to 9.1 A/m2 in air-fed MFCs. The maximum power density of heliox-fed reactors (1320 \u00b1 50 mW/m2) was 26% higher than that of air-fed systems (1050 \u00b1 40 mW/m2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to characterize cathode and system impedances.  The internal resistance of heliox-fed MFCs was 27% lower than that of air-fed reactors at a cathode potential of 0.4 V and 51% lower at 0 V. A significant decrease in diffusion resistance-the dominant component of internal resistance\u2013was measured for heliox systems relative to air-fed reactor. Heliox-fed MFCs also had slightly better chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies, and both gas conditions had comparable Coulombic efficiencies (CEs).  Collectively, these results demonstrate that heliox improved oxygen transport to the cathode catalyst by decreasing the diffusion resistance, without inducing negative effects associated with excessive oxygen intrusion to the MFCs.

The guard cell has been used as a model system in plant cell biology for decades. Here, I isolated a total of 3x108 guard cell protoplasts from 22,000 Arabidopsis plants and identified 1,764 unique proteins using three complementary proteomic methods: protein spot identification from broad and narrow pH range 2D gels, and 2D LC-MALDI MudPIT. Proteomic study suggested that myrosinase 1 (TGG1) is the most abundant protein in guard cells. TGG1 catalyzes the production of toxic isothiocyanates from glucosinolates, and the glucosinolate-myrosinase system is well known as a defense system against biotic invaders. Phenotypic analysis showed that tgg1 mutants were hyposensitive to abscisic acid (ABA)-inhibition of guard cell inward K+ channels and stomatal opening, revealing that the glucosinolate-myrosinase system is also central to abiotic stress responses. TopGO analysis of the identified guard cell proteome revealed that proteins involved in energy production were enriched in the GC proteome. I further characterized mutants lacking the glycolytic enzyme iPGM (2,3-biphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase). ipgm mutants showed defects in stomatal movements, growth, and pollen production in our study. Our study demonstrates that proteomic studies can make powerful contributions to the identification of novel signaling pathways.\nIn addition to the guard cell proteomic study, I also compared the proteomic patterns of Col and gpa1-4 guard cells with and without ABA treatment using iTARQ technology. The gpa1-4 mutant, lacking the heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit, shows hyposensitivity to ABA inhibition of inward K+ channels and ABA inhibition of stomatal opening. This iTRAQ study showed that two and six proteins were significantly regulated by ABA in protein abundance in Col and gpa1-4 guard cells respectively, while the abundance of 18 proteins in guard cells was affected by mutation of GPA1. Novel signaling models were proposed on the basis of the iTRAQ results.\nTo study the correlation of the transcriptome and proteome in guard cells, we also pursued microarray experiments. Comparison of transcriptome to proteome revealed that the correlation between mRNA and protein levels is poor in Arabidopsis guard cells, suggesting that the protein abundance in guard cells is not primarily regulated at the transcriptional level.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6984], "author_name_tesi": "Zhao, Zhixin ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhixin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Mary Assmann", "Hong Ma", "Ming Tien", "Reka Z Albert", "Jiaxuan Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Mary Assmann, Committee Chair", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member", "Jiaxuan Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PROTEOMICS", "CORRELATION BETWEEN TRANSCRIPTOME AND PROTEOME", "GUARD CELL"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "ACCOUNTING FOR THE MODELING ERROR AND SAMPLING ERROR OF ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTERS", "id": "dv13zt216", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12845", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is one of the most popular Monte Carlo-based data assimilation strategies in meteorology. The applications of EnKF in meteorology have to deal with the following two difficulties. Firstly, the dimension of a discretized global dynamical model could be as large as that of ($10^9$), while the current computing sources in the world could at most afford the ensemble size of the order of ($10^2$). This gap causes the ensemble to have inevitable sampling errors. A popular way of handling these errors is through an element-by-element multiplication of the background covariance matrix and a localization matrix. Secondly,  the numerical model unavoidably has difference with the true model that governs the nature. Accounting for the model error from unknown sources is the most important part of data assimilation. In this dissertation I first review the standard Kalman filter theory for both the continuous-time case and the discrete-time case. In particular, a small error in the Kushner equation is fixed when the system noise and the observation noise have non-zero correlation. Then, I introduce a rigorous theory on the optimal Kalman gain matrix, without any assumption on the linearity of the dynamical system, on the Gaussianity of any of the probabilistic distributions, or on the correctness of the dynamical model and observation model. Additionally, I explain the implications of this theory in how to empirically adjust the standard Kalman gain to improve the filter performance.

The US Army's rotorcraft handling qualities specification, ADS-33E-PRF, provides no specific design guidance on bandwidth or disturbance rejection properties for maritime operations. A family of controllers was developed to test varying levels of bandwidth and disturbance rejection properties of Attitude Command / Attitude Hold (ACAH) and TRC control modes. The controllers' gain sets for bandwidth were baselined at the minimum Level 1 ADS-33 requirements for response to pilot inputs. Two gain sets for disturbance rejection were developed with the first set of gains baselined at the 45$^{\\circ}$ / 6-dB stability margins recommended by standard flight control design specifications. The second gain set was baselined at the proposed disturbance rejection criteria developed by the Aeroflightdynamics Directorate (AFDD). \n\nPiloted simulation tests were conducted to evaluate the handling qualities of the family of controllers in the midst of high sea states and a turbulent airwake. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) airwake model was used for testing the disturbance rejection gain set baselined at the standard stability margins. The second gain set using the AFDD baseline was assessed with a Control Equivalent Turbulence Equivalent (CETI) model. Simulations used the GENHEL-PSU UH-60 model integrated with the Penn State rotorcraft flight simulator. A maritime mission task element (MTE) was flown to evaluate handling qualities ratings (HQR) using the various response types and gain parameters. Time-frequency metrics were used to supplement the pilot ratings in order to assess the impact of pilot workload and strategy on the handling qualities in the shipboard environment. \n \nResults indicate that ACAH can improve HQRs over the conventional rate command mechanical control system of the UH-60A. HQRs with ACAH were still Level 2, and the required bandwidth in order to improve HQRs is significantly higher than that currently specified in ADS-33E-PRF. Results also demonstrated that HQRs can be improved by increasing the disturbance rejection bandwidth (DRB) in ACAH in mild sea states or without ship motion. Pilot ratings indicated ACAH can achieve Level 1 HQRs in sea state 3, but the required DRB is much greater than the proposed minimum criteria recommended by the AFDD. The HQRs also show that sea state 4 diminishes the benefit of DRB where the ratings become strictly Level 2. \n\nResults indicated that a Level 1 HQR could be achieved with ship-relative TRC in sea state 5, but that handling qualities were sensitive to rise time, with the required rise time at the low end of the range recommended by ADS-33E-PRF. Initial results also show that HQRs can be improved by increasing the DRB in ship-relative TRC in sea state 4. Pilot ratings indicated ship-relative TRC can achieve Level 1 HQRs, but the required DRB is again significantly higher than AFDD's minimum criteria. \n\nThe results also demonstrate that utilizing time-frequency metrics for pilot workload provide useful indicators on the impact of gain selection to the handling qualities in shipboard operation.

By carefully studying the biharmonic equation with different types of boundary conditions, we are able to justify the fact that the lower order system of equations and the original problem may have different solutions. Our analysis shows that direct discretizations are much better suited for the numerical solution of high order problems.\n\n We construct two finite elements to directly discretize high order equations arising from magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models. These elements provide nonconforming approximations for which the number of degrees of freedom is much smaller than that of a conforming method. The inter-element continuity is only imposed along the tangential directions which is appropriate for the approximation of the magnetic field. A detailed construction of basis functions for the new elements is given, and we also prove that these finite element approximations converge for a model problem containing both second order and fourth order terms. \n\nAnother important property of high order PDEs that model physical phenomena in material sciences, fluid mechanics and plasma physics is that they often involve different time and spatial scales. The solutions exhibit sharp interfaces, such as shocks, current sheets and other singularities. Adaptive mesh refinement techniques are therefore crucial for reliable numerical computations of high order problems. We develop a post-processing derivative recovery scheme and a posteriori error estimates that can be used in local adaptive mesh refinement.

Therefore, the integration of wind power may impose extra heavy costs on system operation.\n  Our specific study focuses on the economic impacts of wind power integration on Regulation Service in the ERCOT region of Texas. Our goal is to quantify the amounts of additional ERCOT regulation services that will be required to support increased wind power penetration.

In order to determine the impacts of wind power integration in different scales, we estimate the increases of ERCOT regulation services as wind generation changes from 0 to 300% of the actual value.\n  The results show that wind power integration significantly impacts ERCOT regulation services. Increases should be expected in the amount of regulation services required as wind power becomes a more sizeable portion of ERCOT energy portfolio. In addition, less regulation services are required in nodal market than in zonal market with the same level of wind integration.

Ultra-high current operation, which cannot be normally achieved at a reasonable voltage by the commonly used cell architecture, has been enabled by material advancement and cell design lately. However, a robust model is needed to rise to the unprecedented challenges in heat and water management. A comprehensive 2D + 1 computational model has been developed in this work to explore the operation of a PEFC with open metallic element (OME) porous flow field in the ultra-high current regime. \n\nIn most of previous modeling works, the model validation has been generally limited to polarization curve comparison under single selected condition. This model distinguishes itself from the others in that it has been validated to a greater extent, including in-situ experimental measurement of performance, area specific resistance (ASR), and net water drag (NWD) coefficient. Data furnished by experimental diagnostics under a wide range of operating parameters serve as benchmark for model validation. Results also highlight the utility of experimentally-determined anode dry-out limits for validating multi-phase models.\n\nThe collaborative experimental and modeling investigation shows that gas phase oxygen transport, which is responsible for limiting current density observed with conventional parallel flow field, is not the limiting factor in OME porous flow field, even in the ultra-high current regime. Notwithstanding the significant performance improvement of OME porous flow field at high current, anode dry-out limits the performance, as confirmed by NWD data from both experiment and model. Moreover, diffusive transport has been determined to be the dominant mode of water removal from the catalyst layer in an OME porous flow field, compared to capillary action and convective flux.\n \nThermo-osmosis, which is a regularly-observed mode of water transport across membrane in experiments but relatively minor due to low performance and low temperature gradient achieved in conventional parallel flow field, demonstrates its non-negligible effect in comparison to electro-osmosis, especially under hot and dry high power density conditions, even with thin polymer electrolyte membranes.\n\nThe extensively-validated model is then applied to engineer cell operation so that anode dry-out can be mitigated in high temperature high power density operating regime, desired for automotive application. Predictions of internal water distribution demonstrate that moderate changes in operating parameters, such as pressure, stoichiometry and humidity, help maintain a hydrated anode stream and therefore enable a 20 \u2070C increase in stable operating temperature than the baseline case, making heat dissipation to the cooling system more efficient.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8006], "author_name_tesi": "Zheng, Lijuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Zheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lijuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew M Mench", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew M Mench, Dissertation Advisor", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Chair", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer electrolyte fuel cell", "porous flow field", "multi-phase model", "high power density operation", "anode dry-out", "net water drag"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Detecting and Recovering from Large-scale Failures in The Internet", "id": "14941", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7563", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Internet has become a significant and widely used infrastructure for a wide range of communication and other services. Internet reliability and availability are crucial to many applications such as financial transactions, online games, Voice over IP, and video services. However, large-scale failures, caused by events like natural disasters and intentional attacks, are common in the Internet. Unlike sporadic and isolated link failures, large-scale failures usually lead to serious routing disruption and severe packet loss. Therefore, efficiently monitoring the Internet to detect large-scale failures and quickly recovering from failures are particularly important for enhancing Internet reliability and availability.\n\nThe specific goal of this dissertation is to provide comprehensive solutions for detecting large-scale failures in the Internet and quickly recovering from large-scale failures. First, we design an approach for monitoring link performance using tomography-based end-to-end probe. Given a set of links to monitor, the objective is to select the minimum number of probing paths to uniquely determine the performance of all identifiable links and cover all unidentifiable links. Through this, we can identify the links with abnormal performance. Second, we propose a two-phase approach for detecting and localizing large-scale router failures using traceroute-like active probes. To detect large-scale router failures, the detection phase is periodically invoked to probe all routers. When detecting large-scale router failures, the localization phase is triggered to identify the failed routers. We reduce the probing cost by avoiding three types of useless probes. For the routers whose status cannot be identified by probes, we develop a distance-based method to estimate their failure probability. Third, we design an approach called Reactive Two-phase Rerouting (RTR) for intra-domain routing to quickly recover from geographically correlated failures with the shortest recovery paths. To recover a failed routing path, RTR first forwards packets around the failure area to collect information on failures. Then, in the second phase, RTR calculates a new shortest path and forwards packets along it through source routing. RTR can deal with geographically correlated failures associated with areas of any shape and location. Finally, we propose two cross-layer approaches built on backup paths to recover intra-domain routing from correlated link failures. Based on the mapping between the IP layer and optical layer topologies, we develop a correlated failure probability (CFP) model and a probabilistically correlated failure (PCF) model to quantify the impact of IP link failure on the reliability of backup paths. With the CFP model, we propose two algorithms to select a backup path to protect each IP link. The first algorithm aims at choosing the backup paths with minimum failure probability, and the second algorithm further considers the bandwidth constraint and aims at minimizing the traffic disruption caused by failures. With the PCF model, we propose an algorithm to choose multiple reliable backup paths for each IP link to minimize the routing disruption caused by failures.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7498], "author_name_tesi": "Zheng, Qiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Zheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Thomas F Laporta", "Sencun Zhu", "Tao Yao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Member", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Internet", "large-scale failures", "detection", "recovery"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Adaptation as an Integrated Endeavor: Learning from the Timeline Deployment Study", "id": "20563", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9716", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The past few years have witnessed the explosive growth of Online Social Networks (OSNs) and they have played an important role in people\u2019s daily life.

The basic subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of 147bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. The N-terminal domains of histone proteins protrude from the nucleosome surface, maintain proper chromatin structure and serve as binding site of regulatory proteins. Genome wide gene expression profiling of histone tail mutants suggested that the tails are required for both transcription activation and repression in vivo. However, the mechanisms of how histone tails regulate these events remain largely unknown.\n      Here I explored the roles of different histone tails in gene regulation and my study provides evidence to show that different histone tails regulate distinct events at multiple stages of transcription. First, I demonstrate that deleting the H3 N terminal tails results in a shift of RNA polymerase density towards the 3\u2019 end of gene, which indicates a defect in elongation. Further studies revealed that the H3 tail mutants severely impair H3 lysine 36 trimethylation. Recruitment of elongation factors and Set2 methyltransferase was examined and the H3 tails were dispensable for the association of these factors to genes. In vitro biochemistry assays carried out in the lab suggested that the H3 tail is critical for the catalytic activity of Set2. Thus, this novel \u201cintra-tail\u201d interaction added another level of regulation of Set2 activity, which in turn, controlled the dynamics of methylation during elongation.\n      Histone modifications not only regulate transcription directly, they also regulate one another, providing crosstalk. In the second part of this study, I describe a novel \u201ctrans-tail\u201d regulation involving the N-terminal tail of histone H2A. Deleting the N terminus of H2A reduces H2B ubiquitylation and H3K4 methylation, but does not affect the recruitment of the modifying enzymes to genes. I mapped the region primarily responsible for this regulation to the H2A Repression domain (HAR). Surprisingly, HAR locates in close proximity with H2BK123 in the nucleosome structure. Furthermore, the HAR is partially occluded by nucleosomal DNA, suggesting that the function of the H2A crosstalk pathway is to restrict histone modifications to nucleosomes altered by transcription.\n      Appropriate gene expression requires various factors, including histone chaperones and ATP dependent chromatin remodelers, to break through the chromatin barrier and facilitate RNAP II transcription. In the third section, I provided evidence to show that a conserved region in the histone H2B tail, the H2B Repression domain (HBR), regulates the activity of FACT, a histone chaperone. Deleting HBR, or the H2B tail, impairs the interaction between FACT and H2A/H2B dimer, and hampers FACT mediated chromatin remodeling, transcription activation and the redeposition of histone following the passage of polymerase. Therefore, in addition to its reported roles in repressing transcription, my study suggests a novel function of HBR in regulating histone chaperone activity and transcription activation.\n      The goal of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of how the different histone tails contribute to gene regulation. My initial hypothesis was that the tails mainly function to provide docking sites for transcription factors and regulatory proteins. However, our observations led me to investigate multiple aspects of chromatin biology and I conclude that the histone tails are important regulators throughout the transcription cycle.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6034], "author_name_tesi": "Zheng, Suting ", "last_name_ssi": "Zheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suting", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph C.

Among all these NVM technologies, STT-RAM is expected to be used as on-chip caches for its fast access latency and better scalability. While ReRAM is predicted to replace NAND flash in the foreseeable future due to its extremely high density.\n\nHowever, several challenges have to be dealt with before these emerging memory technologies being commercialized. Although the read latency of STT-RAM is relatively fast, the write latency remains to be slow. Also, traditional 1-Transistor-1-MTJ cell structure suffers from severe leakage current and dynamic power as the technology node continuously shrinks down. On the other hand, ReRAM also suffers from reliability problems. Due to the stochastic nature of memristor, ReRAM device not only suffers from spatial variation, but also temporal variation. As the cross-point structure is commonly used for ReRAM devices since it offers higher density and lower cost, the reliability issue of ReRAM becomes a constraint on preventing ReRAM being commercialized as large-scale memory.\n\nThe thesis proposes models and analysis on three novel array-level structures to mitigate the problems existed in STT-RAM based memory technology from different aspects. The parallel shared 1TNJ structure decreases the cell area by rerouting the wires between the access transistor and the MTJ so that one transistor is responsible for multiple MTJs. On the other hand, the 1S1J cross-point structure uses selector as the access transistor for better scalability.

When outbursts occur, a large amount of coal and gas is suddenly and violently ejected into the roadway and working area with the possibility of serious hazard and injury. Recent studies have shown that the physical behavior responsible for the energetic failure of coal is entirely consistent with coal viewed as a dual porosity\u2013dual permeability\u2013dual stiffness continuum where strength is proportional to effective stresses, and where effective stresses are controlled by both the pore pressure and varying stress field. Gas desorption driven by overstress is highlighted in this study as the key factor responsible for the increase in pore pressure close to the working face, and implicated together with elevated stress level, permeability evolution and drainage conditions in the triggering of outbursts. In this work, we incorporate the likely mass rates of desorption driven by an increase in abutment stress and mediated by permeability evolution to define the rates and distributions of gas pressure changes. The changing pattern of pressure redistribution is identified, and parametric studies are then performed to investigate all the key factors that influence the redistribution of pore pressure with respect to the deformation of the coal seam. Permeability evolution in the overstressed zone is determined by the evolution of porosity, which is attributed to both the change in effective stresses in the abutment and sorption-induced strain. Considering the weakening effects of desorption-induced pressure increase, energetic failure may be triggered from the pillar as defined by the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. According to this analysis, the pore pressure adjacent to the mining face may be lowered by drainage in a measurable way to reduce the likelihood of an outburst.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to liberate cybersecurity analysts from the tedious data analytics to focus on the higher-level cyber situational awareness. \n\nOur work is aimed to reduce analysts' workloads by leveraging analysts' previous cognitive processes of data triage. With this goal in mind, a fundamental step is to trace analysts' cognitive processes at the fine-grained level while they are performing data triage tasks. We defined data triage as a dynamic cyber-human system and proposed a trace representation of a fine-grained data triage cognitive process. Based on the trace representation, we developed a tracing method which integrates automated capture and self-reports to capture an analyst's cognitive process with the minimum interference.\nAn interactive toolkit, named ARSCA, was developed as a specific realization of the tracing method. \nIn collaboration with Army Research Lab, an experiment on professional analysts was conducted in which participants' cognitive processes were traced by ARSCA while they were performing a simulated cybersecurity analytics task.\nThe results of the experiment show that the proposed tracing method is a feasible way to conduct on-the-job cognitive task analysis studies with less influence on the human performance. Besides, the preliminary trace analysis indicates that the collected traces are abundant in information and shed some insights into the cognitive process of how the participants perform data triage task. \n\nTo the best utilization of the captured traces in the experiment, we proposed an automated trace analysis method for constructing data triage rules directly from the traces. The rules were further used to build finite state machines for automated data triage. The biggest challenge in the rule construction for the data triage was how to distinguish the effective data triage operations from the exploratory ones in traces. To solve it, a graph model was proposed to represent both the temporal and logical relationships among analysts' data triage operations.\nWe evaluated the automated data triage systems constructed from the traces by applying them to a large dataset and comparing the data triage results with the ground truth. \nThe results of the study illustrate the rules mined from the traces are useful to conduct effective data triage, which further validates the practical value of the proposed tracing method. Besides, the results also show that the automated system built on the traces from the analysts with better task performance have a better data triage performance, which implies that a better data triage performance can be achieved by tracing and utilizing experts' operations. \n\nIn conclusion, an initial step had been taken towards leveraging human analysts' previous cognitive processes to facilitate data triage. Its contribution lies in three aspects. Firstly, the proposed tracing method realizes the possibility of tracing human analysts' cognitive processes in a less intrusive manner while analysts are performing cybersecurity analytics tasks. Secondly,\nthe proposed trace analysis method was shown to be effective and useful in constructing useful data triage rules from the analysts' operation traces in a largely automated way. Thirdly, the constructed data triage rules can be used to construct data triage automation for reducing analysts' workloads.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12653], "author_name_tesi": "Zhong, Chen ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peng Liu", "Peng Liu", "John Yen", "John Millar Carroll", "David Russell Hunter", "Robert Erbacher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peng Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Peng Liu, Committee Chair", "John Yen, Committee Member", "John Millar Carroll, Committee Member", "David Russell Hunter, Outside Member", "Robert Erbacher, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cyber Situational Awareness", "Cybersecurity Data Triage", "Cognitive Process Tracing", "Operation Analysis", "Cyber Operation Automation", "Intelligent System"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES\n\n", "id": "10482", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1617", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents numerical efficient finite element solvers for synchronous machine,\nincluding a static finite element/analytical solver with accuracy of the finite\nelement analysis yet fast enough to use in large scale dynamic simulation, and a\ncomputational efficient steady-state finite element solvers for detailed design and\nanalysis of synchronous machines.\nThe static model exploits the fact that only certain spatial harmonics of the\nmagnetic field exist in the air gap of conventional machine designs to improve computational\nperformance.

The invariancy view, most strongly articulated by Hirschi and Gottfredson (1983), is that the age-crime relationship is universal and invariant across all social and cultural conditions and all social groups at all times. Writers holding the variancy position contend (e.g., Greenberg 1985; Steffensmeier, Allan, Harer and Streifel 1989; Tittle and Grasmick 1998) that there is fact considerable variation across crime types and across countries or historical periods. A central feature of this debate concerns whether development increases youth crime involvement and then changes the age-crime distribution. The present study addresses these issues by examining the age-crime relationship in Taiwan over the period of 1961-1991. Taiwan is a strategic research site mainly because it has undergone considerable development over the past several decades and, in fact, has moved from being classified as a developing nation to a developed nation. \n\nSpecifically, four hypotheses guide the research: (1) comparing age-crime distributions in Taiwan over the entire1960-1990 time frame, the distributions shift to a younger distribution with development; (2) based on both Taiwan and US arrest data, the age-crime curves in both nations should move to a younger distribution and peak earlier in the process of development; (3) due to cultural differences, there might be variations between Taiwan\u2019s age-crime curves and the United States\u2019 age-crime curves even at similar level of development; (4) markers of development predict changes (if they have occurred) in the age-crime distribution over the 1960-1990 period. Descriptive techniques and advanced time-series analysis are applied to examine these hypotheses. Overall, the results indicate that for general property offenses (except typical adult crime such as fraud), Taiwan\u2019s age-crime curves have shifted to a younger age distribution over this time period as predicted by the variancy position. Moreover, the forces of development are especially useful for explaining these shifts. Such shifts and effects of development are not found for violent offenses and total offenses, which may be at least partially due to the continuity of traditional Chinese culture.   \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2406], "author_name_tesi": "Zhong, Hua ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier", "Eric Silver", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer", "Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier, Committee Chair", "Eric Silver, Committee Member", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer, Committee Member", "Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["time-series analysis", "culture", "youth", "development", "age-crime relationship"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "The Modeling of Homogeneous Condensation in Free-expanding Plumes with the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Method\n", "id": "6503", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3247", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\nHomogeneous condensation in free-expanding plumes has been observed in\nthe last several decades and is important because it may cause\ncontamination problems on spacecraft surfaces.

Since free-expanding jets\nare mostly in the transitional to rarefied regimes, a kinetic approach\nshould be used to simulate condensation coupled gas expansion plumes. \n\nThe direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is \nconsidered as the main tool in this work for the numerical modeling of \nhomogeneous condensation in free-expanding plumes. To simulate condensation\nflow, we must address the processes of cluster nucleation, growth, decay and \ncollisions with other clusters and monomers as well as the gas \nkinetics. Therefore, microscopic models including nucleation, sticking and \nnon-sticking collision, and evaporation models need to be specifically developed \nand integrated into the traditional DSMC code to simulate condensation\nbehavior in this work. \n\nTo better understand basic cluster models and\ninteractions between clusters and molecules, the molecular dynamics (MD) approach\nis chosen to simulate cluster-monomer collision processes. Cluster collision\ncross sections and cluster-monomer sticking coefficients, validated by the\nMD work, are derived and applied to the DSMC microscopic models. \nThe DSMC condensation model was numerically validated by comparing simulation\nresults with analytical solutions in one dimensional test cases and further\nvalidated by comparison with Hagena's scaling laws. Comparison of \nthe simulated Rayleigh scattering intensity along the plume centerline \nwith the experimental data is also presented. \nFinally the methodology is applied to predict water homogeneous condensation in\na rocket plume, and the sensitivity of the results to the corrected \nnucleation rate and cluster coalescence process is discussed.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3234], "author_name_tesi": "Zhong, Jiaqiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiaqiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah A Levin", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Michael Matthew Micci", "Cengiz Camci", "Vigor Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah A Levin, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Michael Matthew Micci, Committee Member", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Member", "Vigor Yang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["free-expanding plume", "condensation", "DSMC"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DICE: A NONDETERMINISTIC MEMORY ALIGNMENT DEFENSE AGAINST HEAP TAICHI", "id": "12329", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6631", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Heap spraying is a security attack that mostly accounts for the popularity of exploits targeting web browsers and Adobe family products over the last few years.

That is, p>>n. Ultrahigh dimensional data analysis has become increasingly important in diverse fields of scientific fields, such as genetics and finance.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we develop a sure independence screening procedure based on the distance correlation learning(DC-SIS, for short) to select important predictors for ultrahigh dimensional data. The DC-SIS can be implemented as easily as the sure independence screening procedure based on the Pearson correlation (SIS, for short) proposed by Fan and Lv (2008).\nHowever, the DC-SIS can significantly improve the SIS. Fan and Lv (2008) established the sure screening property for the SIS based on linear models. That is, with a proper threshold,\nit can select all important predictors with probability approaching to one as n tends to infinity. We show that the sure screening property is valid for the DC-SIS under more general settings including linear models.\nFurthermore, the implementation of the DC-SIS does not require model specification (e.g., linear model or generalized linear model) for responses or predictors. This is a very appealing property in ultrahigh dimensional data analysis. Moreover, the DC-SIS can be used directly to screen grouped predictor variables and for multivariate response variables.\nWe establish its  sure screening property for the DC-SIS, and conduct simulations to examine its finite sample performance. An iterative procedure DC-ISIS is also proposed to enhance the finite sample performance. Numerical comparison indicates that the DC-SIS performs much better than the SIS in various models.\nWe also illustrate the performance of DC-SIS and DC-ISIS through two real data examples.\n\nIn Chapter 4, we propose a two-stage feature screening and variable selection procedure to\nstudy the estimation of the index parameter in heteroscedastic single-index models with ultrahigh dimensional covariates. In the screening stage, we propose a robust independent ranking and screening (RIRS) procedure to reduce the ultrahigh dimensionality of the covariates to a moderate scale. Aside from its computational simplicity, the RIRS procedure maintains the ranking consistency property and the sure screening property. Therefore, in an asymptotic sense the RIRS procedure guarantees to retain all the truly active predictors. However, some inactive predictors may be selected as well. In the cleaning stage, we propose penalized linear quantile regression to refine the selection of the preceding RIRS procedure, and to simultaneously estimate the direction of the index parameter. We establish the consistency and the oracle property of the resulting penalized estimator, and demonstrate through comprehensive numerical studies that the two-stage estimation procedure is computationally expedient and presents an outstanding finite sample performance.

Early notification of the pollutants can help to minimize the attacks, especially for people with vulnerable respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The development of gas sensors that consume \u00b5W of power and detect target gases down to ppm levels in the form of wearable accessories is of great interest. Such systems would benefit from inexpensive, high-performance complementary (CMOS)-based gas sensor platforms.\nTransition metal oxide nanowire sensor arrays satisfy the sensing requirements because they deliver key attributes of low cost, ppb to ppm sensitivity, and \u00b5W individual sensor power consumption.\n\nA limitation of using metal oxides in gas sensing is their cross-reactivity to multiple gases. Inspired by the process used in mammalian olfaction, discriminating a specific target gas in a complex mixture can be accomplished by simultaneous collection and processing of response data from many different elements in a multiplexed sensor array. To integrate the array, heterogeneous populations of high-quality polycrystalline metal oxide nanowires with uniform dimensions and well-characterized sensing properties are necessary.\n\nMetal oxide nanowires fabricated by bottom-up synthesis methods are typically non-uniform in geometry, impurity concentration, and crystallinity. Therefore, they are not well suited for integration into large-scale CMOS sensor arrays. This thesis research demonstrated a new, scalable, hybrid top-down/bottom-up fabrication method that produces highly uniform nanowires composed of a high-resistivity Si core that is coated with an ultrathin polycrystalline metal oxide shell. In this work, TiO2 and SnO2 coated-nanowires were fabricated by crystallizing the metal oxide shell under process conditions optimized for high sensitivity detection of the target gases.\n\nIndividual TiO2 or SnO2 nanosensors were integrated into test structures and onto CMOS circuits via electric-field-assisted deterministic assembly. The performance of the nanosensors was evaluated by monitoring their chemiresistive response as they were exposed to CO and H2. The results demonstrated device-to-device uniformity with a variation in resistance of less than 15%. Individual sensors displayed high sensitivity and fast response comparable to the best metal oxide nanowire sensors synthesized by bottom-up methods.

A CMOS chip was fabricated and tested for the integration of a heterogeneous metal oxide nanowire sensor array.

Thus, the decrease in average alpha is not due to an increasing proportion of funds with unskilled managers and negative alphas, as the hedge fund bubble hypothesis suggests. Instead, it is due to a decrease in the proportion of funds that are capable of producing large positive alphas. Our evidence is consistent with the predictions of the capacity constraint hypothesis. Using quantile regression and counter-factual density analysis, we show that both the changes in fund characteristics and the changes in market conditions from the 1990s to the 2000s contribute to the decrease in the proportion of funds with positive alphas. Furthermore, we find that fund-level flow has a positive (negative) impact on a fund's future performance for smaller (larger) funds, while strategy-level flow (flow into the strategy to which a fund belongs) always has a negative impact on the fund's future performance.

These properties make Mg alloys attractive for automotive, aerospace, and other light-weight structural applications. The majority of Mg alloys derives their mechanical properties from precipitation hardening, while the study of precipitation process demands accurate thermodynamic and kinetic (diffusion) properties.\nIn this dissertation, two computational techniques, the CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) modeling and first-principles calculations, have been employed to understand the effects of various alloying elements on the thermodynamic and diffusion properties of Mg alloys. Thermodynamics and phase stability of two Mg ternary alloy systems, Mg-Sn-Sr and Mg-Ce-Sn, have been investigated through use of the CALPHAD modeling technique. They have the potential to be used for high-temperature applications due to the highly stable Mg2Sn as the main precipitate phase. The thermodynamic modeling is supplemented by finite temperature first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) using the quasi-harmonic phonon calculations and the Debye model with inputs from first-principles calculations. The associate solution model is used to describe the short-range ordering behavior in the liquid phases of these two alloy systems.\nTo better understand the diffusion properties of Mg alloys, the self-diffusion and solute (impurity) diffusion coefficients of 61 alloying elements in hcp Mg are calculated from first-principles by combining transition state theory and an 8-frequency model. The minimum energy pathways and the saddle point configurations during solute migration are calculated with the climbing image nudged elastic band method. Vibrational properties are obtained using the quasi-harmonic Debye model with inputs from first-principles calculations. An improved generalized gradient approximation of PBEsol is used in the present first-principles calculations, which is able to well describe both vacancy formation energies and vibrational properties. It is found that the solute diffusion coefficients in dilute hcp Mg are roughly inversely proportional to bulk modulus of the dilute alloys, which reflects the solutes\u2019 bonding to Mg. Transition metal elements with d electrons show strong interactions with Mg and have large diffusion activation energies. Correlation effects are not negligible for solutes Ca, Na, Sr, Se, Te, Y, and early rare earths La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, in which the direct solute migration barriers are much smaller than the solvent (Mg) migration barriers. Solutes with large atomic size have lower migration barriers due to large local strain in the Mg matrix.

Examples of these materials include graphene, hexagonal-boron nitride and transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2). Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) heterostructures are also potential candidates in the fabrication of novel optoelectronic devices, because of the direct bandgap and strong light-matter interactions in the visible spectra range of single-layered MX2 (i.e. MoS2 and WS2) . There have been theoretical and experimental works describing that stacked MX2 heterostructures can tune the electronic band structure of MX2 with ultra-fast charge transfer properties that facilitate electron-hole separation. \nIn my thesis work, the chemical wet transfer method was used to fabricate stacked TMD bilayers. This involved several steps: The transfer process was optimized for better quality of the 2D crystals after transfer; the influence of the transfer process on the 2D materials was studied; and location-deterministic transfer was achieved by using a micro-manipulator under an optical microscope.\nBy the wet chemical transfer method, we successfully prepared stacked TMD bilayers including stacked MoS2 homostructures and WS2/MoS2 heterostructures. These bilayers possessed various twisted angles, and Moir\u00e9 patterns were formed due to the interference of the rotated lattices. The Moir\u00e9 pattern can be regarded as a \u2018super\u2019 lattice, and its size is related to the twisted angle, bringing new properties other than the intrinsic nature of the TMD materials.  We studied how the orientation of the twisted bilayers affect the properties of the homostructures and the heterostructures.\nFor stacked MoS2 bilayer homostructures, it is found that the intensities of the Raman mode peaks are related to the twisted angles, while the photoluminescence intensities will reduce after the coupling of the bilayer. In twisted WS2/MoS2 heterostructures, the symmetry is broken and the inter-layer coupling is affected due to the change of the van der Waals interaction between layers and also the change of chemical environment. From photoluminescence and low-frequency Raman of the heterostructures, we find that the charge transfer contributes more in heterostructures with small twisted angles due to better inter-layer coupling.

I also explicitly recognize that\n\u001crms make service quality and pricing decisions in the presence of competitive forces (e.g.,\nSteenkamp, Nijs, Hanssens and Dekimpe, 2005). Thus, I develop a model to capture the dy-\nnamic interplay among service quality (represented by \u001dight delays), price, and performance\noutcomes (i.e., capacity utilization and demand) in the presence of potential competition\n(i.e., number of competitors, e.g., Mazzeo, 2003) and realized competition (i.e., actual com-\npetitive actions, e.g., Chandrashekaran, Mehta, Chandrashekaran and Grewal, 1999) for\nservices \u001crm.

The results suggest interesting patterns of the asymmetry\nbetween service quality and price. In particular, though service quality decisions adjust to\npricing decisions, pricing decisions are not adjusted to service quality decisions. Together\nwith the result for competition variables, this \u001cnding indicates that \u001crms adjust their prices\nprimarily to manage capacity and in response to potential and realized competition.

Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are usually fully unsupervised, which are often found to generate ambiguous or incoherent topics based on human evaluations. Many extensions of topic models have been proposed to address this issue by incorporating prior knowledge into topic model to guide the topic discovery. Such prior knowledge can usually be defined as the discriminating words or cannot-links between two words indicating that these words should not be put into the same topic. \n\nHowever, discovering the domain prior knowledge is not an easy job. Common practice usually requires domain experts to manually define the discriminating words, which require laborious efforts and may even fail to fit the data closely. In this thesis, we explore the possibility to automatically extract discriminating words from relevant informal domain knowledge. For example, in epidemics online course forum, the discussion is usually related to the syllabus of the course. The course syllabus can serve as a source of informal domain knowledge that contains a structural information of topics and reflects the high level knowledge of the forum. We can call this kind of contextual domain knowledge as domain contexts.\n\nTo extract the discriminating words from the domain contexts automatically, we first extend the information distance measures to discover discriminating words with respect to the domain contexts. Specifically, we introduce KL Distance and Loss of Mutual Information to determine the most discriminating words that should be separated. Using these discriminating words, we developed an agglomerative algorithm to construct discriminating feature sets, which can be easily encoded as the cannot-link constraints to improve topic models. Then we incorporate the constraints into a state-of-the-art Multi-generalized P\u00f3lya Urn model to extract topics. Finally, we introduce a technique to discover the relationships between the discovered topics and the original domain contexts by mapping the top-k topics to each domain context elements. Our experiments on three large forum data sets show that even without any user input, it is possible to extract meaningful discriminating words automatically and discover coherent topics.

Although potential confounders could be adjusted for by fitting a multiple regression model, a more effective way to control for confounding is to use propensity score methods. Propensity scores are most commonly estimated from logistic regression with a binary exposure; generalized propensity scores could be estimated instead using linear regression if the exposure is continuous. One unresolved issue in propensity score estimation is handling of missing values in covariates. As covariates are only used for propensity score estimation but not for later outcome analysis, missing values in covariates may need to be handled differently from missing values in outcome analysis. Several approaches have been proposed for handling covariate missingness, including multiple imputation (MI), multiple imputation with missingness pattern (MIMP) and treatment mean imputation. There are other potentially useful approaches that have not been evaluated, including single imputation, single conditional mean imputation and Generalized Boosted Modeling (GBM), which is a nonparametric approach of estimating propensity scores and missing values are automatically accounted for in the estimation.\nTo evaluate the performance of single imputation, single conditional mean imputation and GBM in comparison to the previously proposed approaches including treatment mean imputation, MI and MIMP, a simulation study is conducted with a binary exposure. Results suggest that when all confounders are included for propensity score estimation, single imputation, single conditional mean imputation, MI and MIMP perform almost equally well and better than treatment mean imputation and GBM.   \nTo examine whether the finding could be extended to a continuous exposure setting, another simulation study is conducted. Results suggest that single imputation, single conditional imputation, MI, MIMP and GBM with single conditional mean imputation have equally good and better performance than treatment mean imputation and GBM with incomplete data under scenario A (linearity and additivity). None of the approaches perform well under scenario G (nonlinearity and nonadditivity). \nThese approaches are further demonstrated and compared through an empirical analysis with the Adolescent Alcohol Prevention Trial (AAPT). A similar pattern of results is observed as in the simulation study. It is recommended to impute missing covariates using different approaches and similar estimates help provide more confidence in the estimates. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10917], "author_name_tesi": "Zhou, Jiangxiu ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiangxiu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donna Coffman", "John Walter Graham", "Sheila Grace West", "Kari Lock Morgan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donna Coffman, Dissertation Advisor", "John Walter Graham, Committee Chair", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Member", "Kari Lock Morgan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["propensity scores; missing data"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Stochastic Semistability with Application to Stochastic Consensus\n\n", "id": "12168", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3121", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Originally developed in computer science, the consensus (or agreement) problem has become an important research topic in coordination control among mobile agents in recent years. Distributed consensus protocols that utilize each agent's neighboring information as local feedback rules are of particular interest to researchers. In practice, the communication network may be subject to random link failure, which results in a stochastic consensus problem.\n\n\nIn this dissertation, we extend the semistability theory for deterministic systems to stochastic systems with a continuum of equilibrium points. We establish the stochastic semistability theory, which serves as a useful mathematical tool for studying stability properties of stochastic systems with a continuum of equilibrium points. We propose the notion of almost sure semistability, which requires almost sure Lyapunov stability of every equilibrium point as well as almost sure convergence to the equilibrium set. We then develop necessary and sufficient conditions for almost sure Lyapunov stability of an equilibrium point in terms of the notions of restricted prolongation and nontangency. Based on that, we further derive Lyapunov-like sufficient conditions for almost sure Lyapunov stability and almost sure semistability for stochastic systems with a continuum of equilibrium points.\n\n\nBased on the newly established stochastic semistability theory, we then study the stochastic consensus problem in a unified framework. We formulate the consensus problem in a stochastic setting by modeling the communication link failure process as a continuous-time discrete-value Markov process. We consider communication networks with either bidirectional or unidirectional information flow, with possibly time-varying edge weights, and with possibly time-varying probability distribution of the link failure process. We apply the notion of almost sure semistability to consensus over a random network and define the notion of almost sure consensus. We then derive sufficient conditions for reaching almost sure consensus over a random network by using linear consensus algorithms. We consider the convergence speed of the stochastic linear consensus algorithm. We propose convergence factor/time as a measurement for convergence speed and derived lower/upper bounds for convergence factor/time. We also derived sufficient conditions for reaching almost sure consensus over a random network by using nonlinear consensus algorithms. We consider the family of nonlinear consensus algorithms using continuously differentiable functions and derive sufficient conditions for almost sure consensus. We also consider a particular family of nonlinear consensus algorithms using non-continuously differentiable functions.

Though organized in diverse arrays, the fundamental cytoskeletal elements and their regulatory toolbox are conserved. How different types of cell use the same set of basic cytoskeletal tools to build distinctive architectures has been extensively studied, but little has been done to investigate their regulation in complicated systems like tissues or organs.\nThe germline of Caenorhabditis elegans offers a simple model to investigate cytoskeletal organization and its regulation in a muticellular system. The majority portion of the C. elegansgermline is a syncytium in which the germ cell nuclei are orderly arranged in an evenly-spaced\npattern. Using this system I first investigated the mechanism of nuclear positioning in the germline. In the C. elegans embryo, the centrosome, which is attached to the nucleus via ZYG-12, organizes the microtubule network and promotes nuclear migration. Surprisingly, in the gonad\nZYG-12 is dispensable for centrosome attachment. Using temperature sensitive mutants, I discovered ZYG-12\u2013mediated recruitment of dynein to the nuclear envelope is required to maintain microtubule organization, membrane architecture, and nuclear positioning within syncytial gonad. I also found that \u03b3-tubulin localizes to the plasma membrane in addition to the centrosome, and regrowth initiates at both sites. I propose that gonad architecture, including membrane and nuclear positioning, is determined by microtubule nucleation at the plasmamembrane combined with tension on the microtubules produced by dynein anchored at the nucleus by ZYG-12. I further investigated the role of cytokinetic machinery in maintaining germline architecture. The germline syncytium is the result of incomplete cytokinesis at the distal\nmitotic zone. In the germline the cleavage plane organizer centralspindlin complex and the adapter protein anillin are sequentially assembled to the intercellular bridge in a microtubule independent\nmanner. Other cytokinetic factors, including RhoA, F-actin and myosin, are all enriched on the membrane. I showed F-actin is necessary for maintaining the germline morphology but myosin is not required. Given that both actomyosin ring components, F-actin and myosin, are loaded in the germline, an inhibitory mechanism may exist to prevent the contraction of the intercellular bridge.\n    Through this work I demonstrated C. elegans germline is a valuable model to study cytoskeletalregulations. The organization of microtubules in the germline and its underlying mechanism is unique. It not only keeps the germ cell nuclei in place, but also has a critical role in maintaining\nthe overall gremline architecture.

Besides the\nanticipated antioxidant activity in foods, polyphenols are also attractive ingredients for\ntheir potential health benefits after consumption. However, recent studies have\ndemonstrated that the oxidation of some phenolic compounds result in the generation of\nhydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a precursor for the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH),\nwhich can potentially compromise the oxidative stability of foods and beverages.\n\nDue to conflicting results regarding phenolic effects on lipid oxidation in the literature, I\nsurveyed the effects of pH (2-7) and phenolic concentration (0-500 \uf06dM) on the\ngeneration of lipid oxidation markers in flaxseed emulsions to determine conditions for\nfuture oxidation studies. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in\ngreen tea, was used as the model polyphenol in all oxidation studies. A low pH (2-4)\nresulted in pro-oxidant activity, while higher pH values (5-7) resulted in a net antioxidant\nactivity. Higher EGCG concentrations (100, 500 \uf06dM) also showed the largest changes in\nlipid oxidation markers compared to the no EGCG controls after 96 h.\nDisrupting redox cycling by metal chelation may be a viable solution for controlling\nmetal-catalyzed phenolic oxidation, since redox cycling of transition metals is essential\nfor the metal to exert a catalytic function. I added the iron chelators, EDTA and 2,2-\nbipyridine (BPY) to hexadecane emulsions containing EGCG (400 \uf06dM) and Fe3+ (25 \uf06dM)\nat pH 3 and pH 7 to determine their effects on EGCG oxidation and the resulting ROS\n\nproduced in the absence of an oxidatively labile lipid. I then repeated the studies in\nflaxseed emulsions to determine the effect on lipid oxidation. At neutral pH, EDTA\naccelerated EGCG oxidation and hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) formation. BPY treatment\nslightly slowed EGCG oxidation compared to EGCG-only samples, though both\ntreatments showed H2O2 accumulation and very slow \u2022OH radical generation. Even with\nrapid \u2022OH radical formation in EDTA treatments, all EGCG-containing samples showed\nantioxidant activity at neutral pH. Conversely, at acidic pH, EDTA strongly inhibited\nEGCG oxidation and \u2022OH radical formation resulting in strong antioxidant activity in\npreventing flaxseed emulsion oxidation, while EGCG readily oxidized in BPY and\nEGCG-only treatments, leading to rapid \u2022OH radical generation, and increased lipid\noxidation in flaxseed emulsions.\n\nThough EDTA showed promising results by preventing phenolic and lipid oxidation at\nacidic pH, EDTA may cause problems at neutral pH by accelerating phenolic loss even if\nno increased lipid oxidation occurs. Proteins may be another viable solution in inhibiting\nincreased lipid oxidation by scavenging the H2O2 generated from metal-catalyzed\nphenolic oxidation, prior to \u2022OH radical formation. We show that casein (CAS) and whey\nprotein isolate (WPI) readily scavenge H2O2 in emulsions. However, differences in\nperoxide scavenging activity were dependent on more than total methionine (Met) and\ncysteine (Cys) content; Met and Cys being the two amino acids capable of directly\nreacting with peroxides.\n\nA major factor for the variable peroxide scavenging activity observed in proteins may be\ndue to differences in Met and Cys accessibility. To further examine this, I effectively\nblocked Met and Cys residues in proteins by reacting them with peroxides and collecting\nthe oxidized proteins. CAS and \uf062-lactoglobulin (BLG) were pre-treated with the\nperoxides, t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) or H2O2. TBHP is a bulky peroxide whose\naccessibility to buried Met and Cys residues is sterically hindered; H2O2, on the other\nhand, has been shown to be able to access buried residues. Using the prepared proteins, I\nproceeded to examine the proteins\u2019 ability to scavenge exogenously added H2O2 and\nimprove EGCG stability. In Tween-stabilized hexadecane emulsions at neutral pH, CAS\ntreatments showed decreasing peroxide scavenging activity and EGCG stability as\nperoxide pre-treatments decreased solvent accessible Met concentration. Similar to WPI,\nBLG displayed much weaker peroxide scavenging activity and lower EGCG stability\ncompared to CAS, since the Met residues were not readily accessible to the ROS present.\nHowever, in SDS-stabilized emulsions, BLG readily scavenged H2O2 and showed\nincreased EGCG stability compared to CAS. As SDS denatured BLG, buried Cys\nresidues became accessible to oxidation.\n\nWhen I repeated experiments in flaxseed emulsions at pH 3, BLG was capable of\npreventing increased lipid oxidation from the addition of high (400 \uf06dM) and low (100\n\uf06dM) EGCG concentrations in Tween-stabilized flaxseed emulsions. The addition of\nBLG-CTRL-1% or BLG-HOOH-1% maintained lipid oxidation markers in EGCG\ntreatments well below the control. However, the addition of BLG-HOOH-0.2% with\nEGCG (400 \uf06dM) was unable to keep lipid oxidation markers in EGCG treatments below the control for the full duration of the 8-day study. This suggests that the presence of\nsolvent accessible Met residues is important to BLG\u2019s protective effect. At the low\nEGCG concentration (100 \uf06dM), both BLG-0.2% treatments showed higher lipid\noxidation markers by the end of the study, signifying phenolic concentration also impacts\nthe effects on lipid oxidation.\n\nOverall, I showed that EGCG readily oxidized to generate ROS in emulsions with a low\npH being a strong promoter of increased lipid oxidation due to metal-catalyzed phenolic\noxidation. Though all my studies were performed using the polyphenol EGCG, many of\nthe mechanistic investigation, such as the effects of metal chelators on oxidation, may be\nextrapolated to other phenolics that undergo metal-catalyzed oxidation. Further work is\nnecessary to elucidate the impact of the different reactions resulting from metal-catalyzed\nphenolic oxidation, such as \u2022OH radical formation and Fe reduction, on inducing lipid\noxidation. However, controlling metal redox cycling with chelators holds promise as a\npotential strategy for mitigating the pro-oxidant activity of phenolics in foods. The\nquenching of EGCG-generated H2O2 by solvent accessible Met and Cys residues in\nproteins is also a viable strategy for stabilizing lipids in foods.

With the interests in the space environment, for the first time, we tested the performance changes of flexible a-Si:H TFTs, on polyimide substrates, due to irradiation and mechanical stress. Significant changes were found on TFTs after irradiation with fast electrons, which, however, was essentially removed by post-irradiation thermal annealing. On the other hand, few changes were found in TFTs by mechanical stress. These preliminary results indicate that it can be readily engineered for space applications. Furthermore, for the first time, we designed and fabricated ungated n+ \u00810\u20268C-Si and gated a-Si:H strain sensors on flexible polyimide substrates. Compared with commercial metallic foil strain sensors, ungated \u00810\u20268C-Si sensors and gated a-Si:H sensors are two orders of magnitude smaller in area and consume two orders or magnitude less power. Integration with a-Si:H TFTs can also allow large arrays of strain sensors to be fabricated. To take advantage of lower glass-transition-temperature polymeric substrate materials, reduced processing temperature is desired. The 150 \u00810\u20202C low-temperature\niv\ndeposition process is achieved by using hydrogen dilution in the PECVD process. The TFT performance and bias stability property are tested similar to that of a 250 \u00810\u20202C process. These results suggest its viability for practical applications. For even lower process temperature, we have considered organic TFTs. As a practical demonstration, we integrated pentacene TFTs with OLEDs in a simple display. Pentacene TFT passivation techniques were researched, and a PVA and parylene bilayer structure was used. We designed and demonstrated 48 \u00a1\u00c1 48-pixel active matrix OTFT-OLED displays, and to our best knowledge, they are the largest on glass substrates and the first on flexible PET substrates. Device performance, uniformity and stability are also compared. These results demonstrate that pentacene TFTs are viable candidates for active-matrix OLED displays and other flexible electronics applications.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3744], "author_name_tesi": "Zhou, Lisong ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lisong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Christopher Roman Wronski", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Qing Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Chair", "Christopher Roman Wronski, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Qing Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["AMORPHOUS SILICON", "THIN FILM TRANSISTOR", "PENTACENE"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Microdevices for Implantation and Neuroscience", "id": "27475", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12007", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) and the microfabrication techniques, whose feature size covers a range of several microns to hundreds of microns, provides us the potential to develop miniaturized sensor and actuator for implantation applications and an unique way to address the biological and biomedical issues in microscopic and mesoscopic level. Three different devices were developed with MEMS techniques. One device is an implantable MEMS pressure sensor prototype that can be seamlessly integrated with continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) to enable real-time control, optimize its performance and reduce its risks. The pressure sensing mechanism is based on Fabry-P\u00e9rot interferometer principle.

A second device is a novel MEMS chopper modulator (MCM) that enables the chopper modulation in gas chromatography electroantennography (GC-EAG) by modulating the effluent from the GC separation column before it reaches the insect antenna. The key component of MCM is a MEMS flow control chip, fabricated with fully GC compatible materials using microfabrication techniques.

There are several ways to determine the permeability and porosity, such as laboratory experiments. It is using cores obtained from a reservoir, which is expensive, complicated, labor intensive and time consuming. Another way is well logging, which has difficulties and uncertainties to directly interpret permeability and porosity. Therefore, alternate methodologies for accurate determination of permeability and porosity are desirable.\nAn artificial neural network (ANN) has the potential to build a model that can be used as an effective tool for permeability and porosity prediction. It has the ability to understand a highly non \u2013 linear relationship and to perform simulation studies in a rapid manner. Artificial neural networks for this problem were developed based on well test data, which is more accurate and reflects the whole \u0336 flow characteristic in porous media as compared to laboratory and well \u0336 logging methods. Moreover, comparing it with other simulation models, the artificial neural network model is not restricted by difficulty to update for different systems.\nIn this study, the model is built with data from dual \u0336 lateral wells, which are the major methods to achieve higher accumulative production to meet the current high demand of energy consumption. In previous studies (Basbug, 2007), the authors predicted permeability and porosity with only reservoir and fluid properties without specifying the well type in the reservoir. Therefore, their model may not apply to the situation with dual \u0336 lateral wells. In this study, the well \u0336 configuration parameter and well test data are added into the ANN model, which is more accurate in estimating permeability and porosity as compared to the previous model.\nAn artificial neural network consists of two primary elements: neurons and interconnections. The number and kinds of neurons are determined by training and learning processes that depend on the input and output data. In the development of the ANN model here, a wide range of data sets were collected from the literature. Those data sets were used for training, testing and validating the proposed model.\nThe objective of this study is to generate two ANN models. The forward model was built to generate the pressure transient data and estimate whether the surface flow rate is reasonable for a specified reservoir. The inverse ANN model was developed to determine permeability and porosity of a specified reservoir with dual \u0336 lateral wells. And two Graphic User Interfaces were developed for the forward and inverse ANN models. In the end, the inverse neural network was applied to heterogeneous and anisotropic system to see how well it can perform. For homogeneous and anisotropic system, the forward neural network has approx 86% probability to obtain the result within 0-5% error. The inverse neural network has approx 70% probability to obtain the results within 0-5% error. When applied to heterogeneous and anisotropic reservoir, the inverse neural network has approx 40% probability to obtain the results within 0-5% error. From the results, it is shown that the forward and inverse networks can perform well for homogeneous and anisotropic reservoirs and not bad for heterogeneous and anisotropic reservoirs.

Earlier studies of equifinality have been used to argue for and against the EP-hypothesis. The five studies in this dissertation explored equifinality and its violations in multi-joint position-holding tasks. In all the studies, seated subjects grasped a handle, and occupied an initial arm configuration against a bias force produced by a robot (HapticMaster). The robot applied a smooth, transient change in the force (perturbation). The subjects were instructed \u201cnot to intervene voluntarily\u201d with hand deviations.\nThe first study confirmed hand equifinality following transient changes in external force, while individual joint rotations showed relatively large deviations from initial values such that significantly more variance in the joint configuration space was compatible with unchanged hand position. In the second study, the application of a transient force change with a dwell time between the force application (that moved the hand away from the body) and removal led to violations of equifinality; the hand stopped short of the initial position after the perturbation force removal. The magnitude of the undershoot increased linearly with the peak hand displacement and exponentially with the duration of perturbation with the time constant of about 1 s. In contrast, when the hand was perturbed toward the body, no violation of equifinality was observed. The third study explored the change of apparent stiffness of the arm during dwell time. The apparent stiffness increased in the direction of force action over 1-2 s (with a transient peak at about 0.4 s), without changes orthogonal to the force direction. The fourth study explored the unintentional movements produced by multiple transient changes in the external force. With repetitive perturbations, the hand moved further away from the body with violations of equifinality after each perturbation. The last study investigated the structure of joint configuration variance for both unintentional and intentional movements to about the same hand locations. Most variance at the final steady states was compatible with unchanged values of both hand position and orientation following both intentional and unintentional movements. \nThe main result of these studies is the demonstration of violations of equifinality (unintentional movements), which happen when a transient perturbation is interrupted by a dwell time. These results can be explained within a recent development of the EP-hypothesis as reflections an unintentional drift of the referent body configuration towards its actual configuration.

In this dissertation, I demonstrate the use of molecular phylogenetics in studying various evolutionary problems, including the phylogeny of individual gene families, the role of gene and genome duplication in organismal evolution, and the reconstruction of the tree of life. In Chapter 2, to study the relationship between gene function and the pattern of gene birth and death, I analyzed the evolutionary history of histone demethylase families as a case study. I found that the two histone demethylase families, KDM1 and JmjC, exhibit distinct evolutionary patterns, which might be explained by the differences in their functions. In Chapter 3, to understand the contribution of gene duplication to the evolution of early eukaryotes, I performed genome-scale analyses of gene family phylogenies to identify gene duplication occurred before the split of animals, fungi and plants. I identified more than 300 early eukaryotic duplications, which possibly resulted from whole genome or segmental duplication(s). The proposed large-scale duplication(s) might provide a genomic basis for the successful radiation of early eukaryotes. In Chapter 4, to identify phylogenetic makers for eukaryotic phylogeny, I systematically identified ~1000 genes that are widely distributed in eukaryotes and have reasonable orthology. From these genes, I further selected ~30 genes that are highly conserved and single-copy in most sequenced eukaryotic genomes. In addition, I demonstrated the performance of these genes in resolving relationships within and among eukaryotic lineages, including some challenging examples such as the placement of Microsporidia and the monophyly of Excavata.

Results show that rebates reduce the average price by $4 (1.7%), leading to 9% gains in total industry revenue. Consumers also benefit from the contract as the lower prices lead to a 9.5% gains in consumer surplus.\n\n\nThe second chapter evaluates the heterogeneous effect of online reputation for sellers on a large Chinese platform that differ in their offline presence.

Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) features a high dielectric constant (12) [3], and has the potential to reach a high energy density. This dissertation introduces general considerations leading to and the results of ultra-high energy density (> 25 J/cm^3) in PVDF-based copolymers P(VDF-HFP)(HFP: hexafluoropropylene) 95.5/4.5 mol% and P(VDF-CTFE) (CTFE: chlorotrifuoroethylene) 91/9 mol% [4], [5], which represents an order of magnitude improvement of the energy density over currently used polymers.\nIn addition, this dissertation is devoted to developing a fundamental understanding of several newly observed phenomena in these HED polymers, which are not present in the currently low dielectric constant polymers. In polymer film capacitors, high fields have been used to realize high energy density. Therefore, the emphasis is paid to understand the response behaviors of these HED polymer dielectrics at high fields, particularly the losses and the breakdown mechanism. Based on these investigations and fundamental understandings, different approaches are introduced to further improve performance of these HED polymers.\nThis dissertation demonstrates that in these HED fluoropolymer films the losses increase rapidly with applied electric fields. Immediately beyond the weak field, the losses can be caused by the ferroelectric domain wall type motions, similar to those in magnetic materials as described by Rayleigh's law [6]. On the other hand, a complex notation has been extensively used to describe the dielectric behavior [7]. In this dissertation, we extend this complex notation to the non-linear region to include the losses [8]. As the field increases further (> 100 MV/m), the loss due to the ferroelectric switching dominates. At very high fields (> 250 MV/m), it is the conduction loss that dominates. Even for state-of-the-art capacitor films that are widely regarded as \"linear\" dielectrics, the conduction loss can become higher at high fields due to a non-linear increase in the conduction [9].\nIn PVDF-based polymers, it is well known that polymer modifications and processing conditions can significantly influence the ferroelectric loss [10]. Therefore, two approaches were investigated to reduce the ferroelectric switching loss: (1) the irradiation method [11] to destabilize the polar conformation and correspondingly reduce the ferroelectric loss and (2) the biaxial stretching method. The film processing study revealed that the orientation of polymer chains parallel to the film surface improves the breakdown strength and reduces the conduction loss in PVDF-based polymers, while a random orientation of polymer chains along the film surface is desired to reduce the ferroelectric loss.\nIn order to reduce the conduction loss, we take the general approach to employ a blocking layer which possesses a higher resistivity compared to the original film [12]. However, for these HED polymers, the blocking layer should also meet the requirements: (1) a dielectric constant closer to the original film (~ 13) to maintain a high energy density and (2) a low temperature fabrication because of the low melting temperature (~ 160 oC) of PVDF-based polymers. Hence, insulating polymers of low dielectric constants (< 3.2) cannot meet the first requirement and will significantly reduce the energy density. On the other hand, ceramics can meet the first requirement. However, their high temperature fabrication process (> 300 oC) [13] is not compatible with PVDF-based polymers. In this study, we demonstrated that very high resistivity with a dielectric constant of ~ 7 can be obtained with Si3N4 deposited at 100 oC and that the conduction loss of the resulting bilayered films can be much less than a single layer of PVDF-based copolymers.\nIn the study of the electrical breakdown in these HED capacitor films, it was observed that although the temperature dependence of the breakdown strength in the P(VDF-HFP) 95.5/4.5 mol% films is consistent with the electromechanical (EM) breakdown [14], the widely accepted EM breakdown model of Stark-Garton significantly overestimates the breakdown strength. We show that this discrepancy lies in the fact that the Stark-Garton model fails to capture the mechanical properties of the polymers that experience a plastic deformation. Furthermore, we introduce a more general power law relation to characterize the elastic-plastic deformation of polymers. This newly developed model agrees well with the experimental data [15], and should be applicable to any polymer dielectrics in their electromechanical breakdown because of the universal validity of this model to describe the mechanical behavior of polymer dielectrics.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6659], "author_name_tesi": "Zhou, Xin ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Qiming Zhang", "Qing Wang", "Heath Hofmann", "Craig Grimes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Chair", "Qing Wang, Committee Member", "Heath Hofmann, Committee Member", "Craig Grimes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy storage", "thin films", "polymers", "electrical properties", "dielectric. ferroelectric", "energy density"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF SSRA DELETION PHENOTYPE IN DIFFERENT BACTERIA\n", "id": "9120", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6702", "abstract_tesi": "ssrA, a gene that encodes tmRNA is found in all bacteria that have been examined. tmRNA is a unique small RNA that has properties of both tRNA and mRNA. Using its unusual structure, tmRNA plays an important role in ribosome rescue and protein quality control through a trans-translation process. In this remarkable process, tmRNA first recognizes stalled translation complex by an unknown mechanism and enters the A site of a stalled ribosome like a tRNA. After transpeptidation reaction, the nascent polypeptide chain is transferred to the alanyl-tmRNA. tmRNA then moves from the A site to the P site in the ribosome and the translation template switches from the former mRNA to the mRNA portion within tmRNA. Normal translation continues till the ribosome reaches the stop codon within tmRNA. Release factors are recruited and the ribosomes, which were originally stalled on the mRNA, get released from the tmRNA and recycled. A peptide tag encoded by tmRNA is added to the polypeptide. This peptide tag is recognized by a number of intracellular proteases and therefore targets the tagged protein for rapid degradation.\nThe deletion of ssrA causes different phenotypes in different bacterial species. In Caulobacter crescentus, ssrA deletion causes a specific delay in DNA replication initiation as well as a defect in maintaining pBBR1 family plasmids. In Escherichia coli, ssrA deletion results in higher sensitivity to heat shock and lower motility on semi-solid agar. In Shigella flexneri, a closely related species of E. coli, ssrA deletion is lethal. This study has identified three genes in C. crescentus that inactivation of any of these genes in \u00c4ssrA strain can bypass the plasmid maintenance defect. This study has also demonstrated that not only is ssrA essential in S. flexneri, some DNA element(s) can even bypass this phenotype in S. flexneri. Understanding the molecular basis of the ssrA deletion phenotypes can shed light on elucidating the physiological role of tmRNA in different species and understanding how\niv\ntmRNA is integrated into bacterial genetic network. Since tmRNA is important for bacterial pathogenesis, this study may also reveal targets for new antibiotic development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6699], "author_name_tesi": "Zhou, Xin ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Charles Keiler", "Kenneth Charles Keiler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Charles Keiler, Thesis Advisor", "Kenneth Charles Keiler, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Shigella flexneri", "tmRNA deletion phenotypes", "Caulobacter crescentus"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Evaluating Drivers\u2019 Stop-line Violation Behavior at Signalized Intersections", "id": "12375xzz117", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12375", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Stop lines are common at intersections; however, few studies have focused on the position of stopped vehicles with respect to the stop line.

How common is recombination in these viruses and what role does it\nplay in their evolution? Different virus sequences were used to study each of these questions.\nOverall my thesis is comprised of four separate chapters each dealing with a different topic in\nthe molecular evolution of virus. Among this diverse set of topics, a common topic is the action\nof recombination. In particular, I found abundant recombination in hepadnaviruses and a\nrecombination-hot region which contains the majority of all the recombination, while\nrecombination was found to be rare, or absent in the negative-strand, segmented human\ninfluenza A virus.

Both self-pollinated wildtype and mn1 plants and split-pollinated plants with mn1 as the maternal parent were used to study development and assimilate partitioning in the maize kernel.  Split-pollination simultaneously applies self and wildtype pollen to separate groups of silks on homozygous mn1 plants to produce both wildtype and mn1 phenotype kernels on a single ear.  It facilitates comparative analysis of kernel development of two endosperm genotypes mn1mn1mn1 and Mn1mn1mn1 (designated mn and wt kernels, respectively) on a common mn1 maternal plant.  One dose of the Mn1 gene is sufficient to restore kernels to full size (wildtype phenotype).  The wt kernels not only resemble homozygous wildtype kernels in size but also in many physiological characteristics, such as endosperm cell number, starch granule number, endosperm cell nuclei endoreduplication pattern, presence of invertase activity at kernel base, and sucrose partitioning.  Homozygous mn1 kernels were significantly different from homozygous wildtype kernels in the pattern of assimilate compartmentation and partitioning in the growth period from 10 to 22 DAP (days after pollination).  Similarly, differences in assimilate partitioning were found in wt and mn kernels of split-pollinated plants.  Sucrose concentration did not differ between mn and wt kernels at 10 DAP, a period before strong sink development in maize kernels, but was higher in mn than wt kernels during rapid grain filling of wt kernels at 21 DAP.  The differences of glucose and fructose specific activity between the two type kernels were significant at both 10 and 21 DAP.  The difference in specific activity of sucrose between the two kernel types was significant only at 21 but not at 10 DAP.  Significant differences in kernel tissue sugar composition and compartmentation were observed between homozygous wildtype and mn1 tissues from 10 to 22 DAP.  In pedicel tissue, homozygous mn1 kernels had a higher percentage of sucrose and lower percentage of hexoses than wildtype kernels.  That the difference in sugar percentage between the two genotypes became more dramatic in placental-chalazal (P-C) tissue provides the evidence for invertase function.  In wildtype kernels, because of the presence of invertase activity, a big pool of hexoses establishes in the apoplastic P-C tissue so that both sucrose concentration gradients between pedicel tissue and P-C tissue and hexoses concentration gradients between P-C tissue and distal endosperm are created and maintained.  In endosperm tissue, homozygous wildtype kernels only had a lower sugar percentage than mn1 kernels.  Tissue or sugar radioactivity in disintegrations per minute (DPM) relative to total tissue or carbohydrate DPM (relative DPM) was used in 14CO2 pulse-chase experiments with self-pollinated wildtype and mn1 plants to study carbohydrate transport kinetics.  The difference in kernel sugar relative DPM was similar between the two genotypes for all tissues.  The kinetics of sugar transport into kernels differed significantly between genotypes, but was similar among sugar species within a genotype.  A low sucrose to hexose ratio in the phloem post-unloading zone is thought to facilitate sugar flux to sink tissue.  The homozygous wildtype kernels had lower sucrose percentage to hexose percentage ratios than mn1 kernels in all kernel tissues, averaging 0.12 and 2.90, respectively, in P-C tissue.  The amount of assimilate transported to mn kernels was lower than that in wt kernels when the leaves of split-pollinated plants were exposed to a pulse of 14CO2.  The difference of assimilate partitioning is associated with the essential difference between the two kernel phenotypes, the existence of invertase in the pedicel and basal endosperm.  In the split-pollinated plants, mn kernels had fewer endosperm cells per kernel, fewer starch granules per endosperm and lower activities of starch synthesis related enzymes (AGPase and starch synthase) compared to wt kernels.  The mn kernels had a higher level of ABA and lower level of IAA than wt kernels through the 9 to 21 DAP growth period.  There was no difference in cytokinin levels between the two kernel genotypes during most of the early developmental period, but mn kernels had higher zeatin and ZR levels at 15 DAP and after 14 DAP, respectively, than wt kernels.  These results show that sucrose composition in kernel tissues, which is controlled by invertase at the kernel base, not only regulates assimilate transport to and partitioning in kernel tissue, but also interacts with other characteristics of kernel metabolism.  Invertase at the kernel base plays a pivotal role in the growth and development of the maize kernel by affecting the final sugar mixture entering kernel sink tissue which appear to regulate sink size formation, sink activity, and assimilate transport and partitioning.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6881], "author_name_tesi": "Zhou, Yibing ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yibing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara White Pennypacker", "Simon Gilroy", "Jack Corum Shannon", "Daniel Paul Knievel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara White Pennypacker, Committee Member", "Simon Gilroy, Committee Member", "Jack Corum Shannon, Committee Chair", "Daniel Paul Knievel, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["assimilate partitioning", "miniature mutant", "invertase", "maize"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Interactome analysis reveals ZNF804A, a schizophrenia risk gene, as a novel component of protein translational machinery critical for embryonic neurodevelopment", "id": "14925yxz167", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14925", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a chronic, debilitating mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population. The symptoms of SCZ fall into three categories: positive, negative, and cognitive. Current understanding attributes SCZ to both genetic and environmental determinants, supported by clinical and experimental evidence. Earlier genetic studies of SCZ have focused on monogenetic factors and family studies. Entering the new millennium, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) started to be used to find the disease-associated loci on the meta-genomic scale.\nSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1344706, localized in the gene ZNF804A, was the first SNP identified to achieve genome-wide significance for psychosis. Several follow-up GWASs have validated the association of rs1344706 with SCZ and other psychosis in different populations. Although the association with SCZ has been reported since 2008, the molecular function of ZNF804A remains largely unclear. \nIn our study, we found that ZFP804A (the rodent homolog of ZNF804A) expression is high in the embryonic mouse brain but decreased in the adulthood. We proved that proper expression level of ZFP804A is essential for normal neuronal migration. We also noticed decreased neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation and differentiation caused by insufficient ZFP804A. \nTo unbiasedly elucidate its molecular functions, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening and identified novel proteins that interact with ZNF804A. The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed two major functions of ZNF804A interacting proteins: cellular adhesion/cytoskeleton regulation and translation control. In sucrose gradient fractionation assay, ZNF804A co-fractionates with translational machinery and modulates the translational efficiency potentially through the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Using Duolink\u00ae proximity ligation assay (PLA), we confirmed the interaction between ZNF804A and ribosomal protein SA (RPSA). A proper level of RPSA is critical for optimal translation efficiency. Overexpression of RPSA rescues the migration and translation defects caused by Zfp804a knockdown. On the other hand, RPSA also serves as a receptor for laminin and presence of laminin in the extracellular matrix (ECM) augments the interaction between RPSA and ZNF804A. This implies that the function of ZNF804A might be regulated by extracellular cues.\nIn addition, ZFP804A target RNA was identified with RNA-immunoprecipitation - RNA sequencing (RIP-seq). ZFP804A is physically associated with transcripts involved in ribosomal and mitochondrial functions. This suggests that ZFP804A might regulate translation through multiple mechanisms: direct involvement as a part of translational machinery; indirect contribution by regulating the expression level of other components of translational machinery. The role of ZNF804A in regulating translation efficiency of target transcripts is confirmed by Duolink\u00ae PLA. Among the ZNF804A bound transcripts, neurogranin (Nrgn) has been associated with SCZ in previous GWAS study (S. W. G. o. t. P. G. Consortium, 2014). Nrgn has been implicated in regulating post-synaptic signals and synaptic plasticity (Pak et al., 2000). Overexpressing NRGN in utero successfully reversed the migration defect caused by Zfp804a knockdown. \nTaken together, by analyzing the transcriptome, we revealed a novel role of SCZ risk gene ZNF804A in translational regulation. In addition, by profiling the associated genes with ZNF804A, we provided new insights into the mechanism ZNF804A regulates neurodevelopment and contribute the risk of SCZ.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16258], "author_name_tesi": "Zhou, Yijing ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhou", "first_name_ssi": "Yijing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yingwei Mao", "Yingwei Mao", "Timothy J Jegla", "Gong Chen", "Wendy Hanna-Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yingwei Mao, Dissertation Advisor", "Yingwei Mao, Committee Chair", "Timothy J Jegla, Committee Member", "Gong Chen, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna-Rose, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["schizophrenia"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Examining the Influences on Faculty Departure Intentions: A National Study Using NSOPF-99\n\n\n", "id": "6141", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6889", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-09-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The flow of faculty into and out of higher education and within higher education institutions is a topic of continuing concern to the higher education community.  This research focuses on the dynamics of faculty satisfaction and intention to leave as an important institutional outcome and predictor of faculty turnover.  It proposes a theoretical model of faculty turnover intentions and tests the model using the latest 1999 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF-99).  The study focuses on full-time instructional faculty in research and doctoral institutions.  Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to identify and model the relationships among the variables associated with intended faculty departure.  \n\n\nThe study presents three path models, one for all faculty, one for tenured faculty and the last one for non-tenured faculty.  The path models visualize the direct and indirect effects of demographic characteristics, institutional characteristics, work experience and satisfaction variables on intention to leave.  The top three strongest predictors of faculty departure intentions are seniority, satisfaction with job security, and satisfaction with compensation.  Senior faculty are less likely to seek another position than junior faculty.  For tenured faculty, satisfaction with compensation is more important than satisfaction with job security; and for non-tenured faculty, vice versa.  The total effects of these three variables outweigh the total effects of the rest of the variables in the model.  Satisfaction with job autonomy, with resources and perceived institutional decline also have strong direct effects. Faculty\u00a1\u00afs work experience influences their intentions to leave, both directly and indirectly through its impact on job satisfaction.  Teaching and service productivity, rather than research productivity, is significantly related to turnover intentions.  Compensation has strong indirect effect through its impact on every aspect of job satisfaction.  The effects of personal characteristics and institutional characteristics variables are weak and indirect.   The study also identifies five external \u00a1\u00b0pull\u00a1\u00b1 factors but only finds one factor, extrinsic rewards, to be significantly related to intended departure.  \n\n\nAlthough this study is limited by the available information in NSOPF-99, it has high generalizability.
