Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data from 106 specimens representing all eight currently recognized species were used to evaluate the relationships of the species within the genus. The molecular phylogeny of the genus is inconsistent with the current species-level taxonomy. Species delimitation methods indicate that there are as many as 24 species, hidden within the eight currently described species. This was especially true of Aristelliger praesignis (Jamaican Croaking Gecko) which has 10 clades of potential species-status, eight of which are in Jamaica, showing deep genetic divergences. Further support that at least six of these clades represent cryptic species comes from the consistency with which most clades can be differentiated from each of the other clades based on morphological characters. In addition, two clades are sympatric and syntopic at Port Antonio, Portland Parish, Jamaica. Another two clades are nearly sympatric, separated by only about 0.75 km at Port Maria and Cabarita Island, St. Mary Parish, Jamaica. In addition to the high levels of cryptic diversity found within Jamaica, A. georgeensis (St. George Island Gecko)\u2014the only member of this genus found on the mainland\u2014is nested within a clade of A. praesignis from Port Antonio, and is the most recent of the clades to diverge,about 1.5 million years ago (Ma). Based on molecular divergence time estimation and geology, it is likely that this genus originated on Hispaniola between 37 Ma and 23 Ma. From there, a lineage invaded Jamaica giving rise to A. praesignis. There have been three dispersals out of Jamaica giving rise to populations or species elsewhere: two out of northern Jamaica, and one very recently from southwestern Jamaica.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8524], "author_name_tesi": "Cloud, Tiffany Loren", "last_name_ssi": "Cloud", "middle_name_ssi": "Loren", "first_name_ssi": "Tiffany", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Blair Hedges"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Blair Hedges, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cryptic Species", "Aristelliger", "biogeography", "phylogeny", "evolution", "geckos", "Caribbean"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Lighter Shade of Green: The concept of Bounded Space as an influence on sustainability in architecture", "id": "19653", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9302", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sustainable approaches within the discipline of architecture are largely oriented toward a building\u2019s energy considerations and physical attributes, and often do not delve into the human experiential essence of dwelling.

It is the human being\u2019s perspective of themselves in this world, and their relationship to the essential life elements of the earth, that hold the key to a \u201clighter shade\u201d of sustainable application in architecture.\n\nIn looking to Native American philosophies of dwelling as a source of influence, this research navigated toward the intriguing writings of Viola F. Cordova (a philosopher of Jicarilla-Apache descent), and specifically to her concept of Bounded Space.  The qualities and attributes of Bounded Space dwelling include aspects of community, awareness, individual perspective, diversity, and ultimately an intimate relationship between the human being and the land upon which he/she dwells.  Through the research and examination of Cordova\u2019s theories, interspersed with extrapolations from varied philosophical perspectives, a set of principles for Bounded Space dwelling was developed for application in architectural design constructs.  Three case studies, representational of current projects of laudable achievement in sustainable building design, were selected and then evaluated based on Bounded Space principles.  \n\nThe relationship of the individual to the group and the group\u2019s relationship to the place of dwelling, defines the core principle of Bounded Space dwelling.  By exploring the determining qualities of Bounded Space dwelling, this research attempts to provide a complimentary and enriching approach to sustainable application in architectural design criteria; an approach which looks beyond architecture as art or object - or high performance eco-machines - into a more \u2018participatory\u2019 aspect of architecture and human dwelling.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9106], "author_name_tesi": "Clouse, Carol Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Clouse", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Carol", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jawaid Haider"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jawaid Haider, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["dwelling", "sustainability", "nature", "bounded space", "essential elements", "carrying capacity", "diversity", "community", "Native American"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Unresolved attachment and alliance in three treatments for borderline personality disorder", "id": "25916", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11532", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Therapeutic alliance is an important predictor of outcome in psychotherapy (Castonguay et al., 2006; Martin et al., 2000). However, patient differences in capacity to form an alliance likely influence this relationship between alliance and outcome (Clarkin & Levy, 2003). Levy and colleagues (2011) found that attachment security predicts better outcome. In a follow-up meta-analysis, they found that self-reported insecure attachment predicted poorer alliance (Bernecker et al., 2014). However, few studies have examined the role of unresolved attachment organization in predicting alliance and outcome in psychotherapy. Unresolved attachment organization, which indicates the presence of unresolved loss or trauma, has been associated with higher rates of psychopathology and other negative outcomes (Riggs et al., 2007), and may predict difficulty effectively engaging in treatment (Korfmacher et al., 1997). In the present study we examine how unresolved attachment impacts early alliance in three treatments for BPD. Ninety patients from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and supportive psychotherapy (SPT) (Clarkin et al., 2007) were assessed for attachment organization using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). Patients were classified as unresolved with regard to loss or trauma if they exhibited disorganization, dissociation or lapses in monitoring their speech or reasoning when discussing past trauma and/or losses during the AAI. For each patient, three early sessions were coded for alliance by trained raters with the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI): two at about one month into treatment, and a third about three months into treatment. Ratings from the first two sessions were averaged into a single time point in order to control for any discrepancy resulting from a focus on setting the therapeutic frame. A two-way (unresolved organization x treatment group) ANOVA was used in order to assess whether there is any interaction between unresolved attachment organization and treatment orientation in predicting the quality of the therapeutic alliance. The main effects of treatment and unresolved attachment on alliance were nonsignificant at both time points. At the first time point, there was a significant interaction between unresolved attachment and treatment group. There was also a trend-level interaction between these variables at the second time point.

This model of settler colonialism was soon exported to the New World and spawned a range of social institutions and cultural artifacts, including a genre of literature. While plantation fiction seemed to reach the height of its popularity in the United States after emancipation, the genre was revived in the twentieth century by Irish, Caribbean, and American writers. Indeed, the genre was revised with surprising frequency by modernists from a wide variety of national and cultural backgrounds, including Elizabeth Bowen, Liam O\u2019Flaherty, Jean Rhys, Claude McKay, Eric Walrond, Arna Bontemps, and of course, William Faulkner. Serving as an important device of cultural linkage, plantation fiction offers a way of understanding the reverberations of empire in transatlantic modernity.\n\nWhile writers of nineteenth-century plantation romance sought its origins in feudalism, the plantation in fact emerged out of the capitalist-imperial ventures of the maritime bourgeoisie of early modern Europe. Plantation ideology derived not from steadfast traditions, but rather from the demands of the market and the defense of property, often human. My project concentrates on Anglophone plantation culture from roughly 1890 through 1950. I track the vast changes in the plantation complex that took place during the modern period, including the transformations that occurred after emancipation, the shift from traditional colonial-settler (family owned) plantations to corporate ventures and state owned plantations, and the simultaneous rise of British decolonization and American imperial expansion. The modernist era marks a shift in global production patterns, as the plantation complex adumbrates transnational agribusiness, and the literature of this period attempts to grapple with the clash between these residual and emergent capitalist agricultural forms.  \n\nAlthough the plantation complex is an institution of empire, it would be wrong to expect that all plantation fiction simply serves the ideological imperatives of empire (as it might when the archive is limited to nineteenth-century American writers). Broadening the definition of \u201cplantation fiction\u201d beyond the narrow confines of plantation romance reveals more ideologically diverse and critical representations of the plantation\u2019s role in producing and sustaining empire. Modernist plantation fiction underscores the plantation\u2019s global socio-economic reach by tracing the flow of capital and people to the metropole from plantation cultures. I argue that plantation modernism uses modernist techniques to focus narrative through perspectives from postlapsarian plantation cultures: octoroon mistresses, exploited field hands, disaffected and dishonored planters\u2019 daughters, and other characters burdened by the legacies of the plantation past.  Works like Elizabeth Bowen\u2019s The Last September, Jean Rhys\u2019s Voyage in the Dark, Claude McKay\u2019s Banana Bottom, and William Faulkner\u2019s Absalom, Absalom! experiment with the generic conventions established by plantation romance in order to reveal the local manifestations of global capitalism and mediate between imperial centers and peripheralized regions. Plantation modernism\u2019s cosmopolitan style embraces epistemological and political uncertainty, and foregrounds the forms of cosmopolitanism that emerge among  plantation modernity\u2019s voluntary and involuntary diasporas. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [22], "author_name_tesi": "Clukey, Amy ", "last_name_ssi": "Clukey", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janet Wynne Lyon", "Janet Wynne Lyon", "Deborah Clarke", "Mark Stewart Morrisson", "Jonathan Paul Eburne", "Sean X Goudie"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janet Wynne Lyon, Dissertation Advisor", "Janet Wynne Lyon, Committee Chair", "Deborah Clarke, Committee Member", "Mark Stewart Morrisson, Committee Member", "Jonathan Paul Eburne, Committee Member", "Sean X Goudie, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plantation fiction", "modernism"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "PRODUCTION OF PHENYLPYRUVIC ACID AND PHYTASE \nBY MICROBIAL FERMENTATION\n", "id": "23459", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10525", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Feed and food additives are very popular in industry to increase the quality of diets. They have been used for various applications such as nutritional quality enhancing, coloring, flavor enhancing, antimicrobial effects, thickening, stabilization, increasing shelf-life, and calorie reducing. Phenylpyruvic acid (PPA) and phytase are just two of the important feed and food additives. \nPPA and phytase have important applications in the industry. PPA is being experimentally used as a substitute for phenylalanine in feeds to decrease excessive nitrogen accumulation in the manure to prevent negative effects on the environment. PPA is also used for kidney patient\u2019s diets to decrease urea accumulation in the body. Additionally, PPA is a very important compound for cheese and wine production to generate a specific taste and aroma. Phytase breaks down phytate, which serves as an anti-nutrient agent by binding divalent ions, amino acids, and proteins in the intestine. Also, phytase is an important additive in monogastric animals\u2019 diet to decrease excessive phosphorus accumulation in the manure, which may cause changing flora and fauna. \nTherefore, the purpose of this research was to enhance PPA and phytase productions in bioreactors by optimizing growth and fermentation medium parameters, also conducting various fermentation modes. Additionally, the effect of two microparticles (talcum and aluminum oxide) on fungal phytase production was studied. \nFor PPA fermentation, strain selection was first performed using four microbial strains (Morganella morganii, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, Proteus vulgaris, and Corynebacterium glutamicum) based on a literature search and P. vulgaris was selected as the best microorganism based on PPA production level in shake-flask fermentation, (358 mg/L). Thereafter, growth parameters such as temperature, pH, and aeration were optimized for PPA and biomass production in the bioreactors by using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Optimum conditions were determined as 34.5\u00b0C, 5.12 pH, and 0.5 vvm aeration for PPA production and 36.9oC, pH 6.87, and 0.96 vvm aeration for biomass production. Under optimum conditions, 1054 mg/L PPA and 3.25 g/L biomass productions were obtained. ANOVA results showed that all of growth factors evaluated were significantly (p<0.05) effective on biomass production, however aeration was not a significant (p<0.05) factor for PPA production. \nAdditionally, concentration levels of fermentation medium ingredients such as glucose, yeast extract, and phenylalanine were optimized by RSM. The optimum ingredient concentrations for PPA production were determined as 119.4 g/L for glucose, 3.68 g/L for yeast extract, and 14.85 g/L for phenylalanine, whereas 163.8 g/L glucose, 10.75 g/L yeast extract, and 9.84 g/L phenylalanine were the best for biomass production. PPA and biomass concentrations increased to 1349 mg/L and 4.35 g/L, respectively, under these respective optimum conditions. \nFurthermore, fed-batch and continuous fermentation were conducted to further enhance PPA production. It was determined that addition 4 g of phenylalanine into the reactor at 30 h of fermentation increased PPA concentration to 2958 mg/L. Also, PPA productivity was increased to 259 mg/L/h in continuous fermentations, which is almost 5 times higher compared to productivity in batch fermentation. \nAdditionally, PPA and biomass production, glucose and phenylalanine consumption by P. vulgaris were predicted with modified Gompertz and modified logistic models. The models over-predicted PPA and biomass productions however lower-predicted phenylalanine and glucose consumption data. The modified Gompertz model predicted the experimental data with lower root mean square error (RMSE) and mean average error (MAE) values compared to modified logistic model for all predictions.\nFor phytase fermentation, first phytase producer microorganisms were screened by evaluating four different strains (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus amylovorus, and Aspergillus ficuum) and A. ficuum was selected as the most productive strain among them. The highest phytase activity was measured as 1.02 U/ml in shake-flask fermentation. A. ficcum phytase activity increased to 2.27 U/ml in bioreactors by optimization of growth parameters. For phytase production these were determined to be 33\u00b0C, pH 4.5, and 0.9 vvm aeration and all the factors were significantly effective on phytase production. \nAlso, optimum pH and temperature values were determined as 5.5 and 55oC, respectively for A. ficuum using a phytase assay. Additionally, the lowest phytase activity loss was seen under 4oC storage conditions for 1 week. However, -20oC storage conditions provided lower activity loss for A. ficuum phytase when storage was more than 1 week of storage period.\nThereafter, phytase fermentation medium ingredients such as glucose, Na-phytate, and CaSO4 were optimized in the next study. Maximum phytase activity was measured as 3.45 U/ml with 126 g/L of glucose, 14 g/L of Na-phytate, and 1.1 g/L of CaSO4. \nFurthermore, the effect of glucose and phytate additions on phytase activity were evaluated in fed-batch fermentations. Maximum phytase activities were measured as 3.84, 4.63, and 4.83 U/ml, when 45 g of glucose, 5 g of Na-phytate, and 10 g of Na-phytate was added into the bioreactors, respectively, at 96 h of the fermentations. Also, continuous fermentation of phytase increased the productivity almost 7-fold compared to batch fermentation. \nAdditionally, the effects of aluminum oxide and talcum were studied on phytase production with A. ficuum. It was reported that phytase activity remarkably increased by addition of 15 g/L of aluminum oxide and talcum to 2.01 and 2.93 U/ml, respectively, compared to the control (1.02 U/ml) in shake-flask fermentations. Moreover, microparticle addition provided small pellets and prevented bulk fungal growth in the fermentation broth. The highest phytase activity was measured as 6.49 U/ml by addition of 15 g/L of talcum in bioreactors at 96 h of fermentation. \nAlso, the effect of talcum addition on fed-batch and continuous fermentations were studied. Phytase activity increased from 4.912 to 9.587 U/ml and from 3.3 to 6.3 U/ml in fed-batch and continuous fermentations, respectively, by addition of 15 g/L talcum. Moreover, maximum phytase productivity was measured as 0.621 U/ml/h at 0.1 h-1 dilution rate with 15 g/L of talcum added continuous fermentation. \nFinally, phytase production and glucose consumption were predicted with modified Gompertz model and modified logistic model. Modified Gompertz model predicted phytase activity slightly more successfully compared to modified logistic model. Lower MAE and RMSE values were obtained for the prediction of glucose by the modified logistic model compared to the modified Gompertz model, however higher R2 and slope values were obtained by the modified Gompertz model. \nIn conclusion, PPA production increased almost 10 fold in fed-batch studies compared to shake-flask fermentations. Similarly, phytase productions increased almost 5 and 10 fold in fed-batch and microparticle added fed-batch fermentations, respectively, compared to shake-flask fermentations. These studies clearly demonstrated that PPA and phytase productions were significantly enhanced by optimization and using novel fermentation methods. Also, mathematical models provided better understanding of microbial kinetics for both fermentations. With these enhancements, industrial productions of PPA and phytase by using submerged fermentation are now closer to reality than before.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10174], "author_name_tesi": "Coban, Hasan Bugra", "last_name_ssi": "Coban", "middle_name_ssi": "Bugra", "first_name_ssi": "Hasan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali Demirci", "Virendra Puri", "Paul H Patterson", "Ryan John Elias"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali Demirci, Dissertation Advisor", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member", "Paul H Patterson, Committee Member", "Ryan John Elias, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Phenylpyruvic acid", "phytase", "fermentation", "optimization", "bioreactors"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Chemistry and Biology of some tannin analogues and studies toward the synthesis of lihouidine\n", "id": "7911", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "484", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The syntheses of three fluorescent tannin analogues (two monomers and one dimer) was accomplished.

The first, and most interesting, technique offers a very low cost means to study spin dependent transport in microelectronics as an alternative to electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR). EDMR measurements generally require strong static magnetic fields, typically 3 kG or greater, and high frequency oscillating electromagnetic fields, typically 9 GHz or higher. In this work, it is demonstrated that large spin dependent recombination and tunneling signals can be detected in the absence of the oscillating electromagnetic field at zero magnetic field. The physics behind this technique is based upon the mixing of singlet and triplet energy states of the electron spin pairs involved in the spin dependent processes. In this study, we show that this technique can be applied to Si and SiC based devices. Theoretically, it can be applicable to devices of all material systems in which defects play a role in spin dependent transport, some of which include CdTe and GaN. Although the resolution of the g value is sacrificed in this new measurement, the technique can detect electron-nuclear hyperfine interactions and possibly dipolar and exchange interactions. The technique also has great promise in microelectronic device reliability studies as it is directly applicable to time dependent dielectric breakdown in thin film dielectrics and bias temperature instabilities in transistors. Other applications of this new physics include self-calibrating magnetometers, spin based memories, quantum computation, and miniature EDMR spectrometers for wafer probing stations. The second technique involves the utilization of passage effects that arise when performing magnetic field modulation in EDMR. When certain conditions are met, the higher order harmonics of the spin dependent signal can contain much useful information; one of them being the fast passage signal. In this work, we designed a multiband virtual lock-in amplifier that can simultaneously demodulate any of these higher order harmonics. This tool has allowed for the identification of a very important recombination center in 4H SiC MOSFETs; the silicon vacancy. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study that utilized passage effects for defect identification in EDMR. And finally, this work involves the development of an adaptive signal averaging technique that is capable of reducing the noise variance of a single scan by a factor of 10 or more which reduces the time of acquisition by the same amount. This technique is applicable to all methods in which signal averaging is utilized, some of which include medical imaging, electrocardiography, or electroencephalography.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8250], "author_name_tesi": "Cochrane, Corey Jonathan", "last_name_ssi": "Cochrane", "middle_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "first_name_ssi": "Corey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick M Lenahan", "S Ashok", "Mark William Horn", "Jerzy Ruzyllo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick M Lenahan, Dissertation Advisor", "S Ashok, Committee Chair", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["zero field spin dependent recombination", "electrical transport", "electrically detected magnetic resonance", "magnetoresistance"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ENHANCEMENT OF SENSING CAPABILITIES AND FUNCTIONALIZATION OF OPTICAL MICRORESONATORS", "id": "14334asc5097", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14334", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Optical microresonators have been demonstrated to provide a large enhancement in\nelectric field by containing an resonant mode in a very small volume.

Factors that describe the coupling between the fluid and structure have been defined for low flow Mach numbers.  This experimental and analytical study shows for which combinations of coupling factors lock-in is possible and for what states it can be achieved.  A unified theory has been derived based on describing functions, a nonlinear control theory used to predict limit cycles of oscillation, where a self-sustaining oscillation or lock-in is possible.  \nA key concept to the lock-in process is the relative source generation versus dissipation.  The type of fluid instability source dominates the generation component of the process, so a comparison between a cavity shear layer instability with a relatively stronger source, for example vortex shedding from a bluff body, can be described as a coupling factor.  The describing function models capture the primary characteristics of the instability mechanisms and are consistent with Strouhal frequency concepts.  The properties of the resonator dominate the dissipation component, so a comparison between an elastic resonator with one that has a similar material to the source, an acoustic resonator, can be described as a coupling factor.  The describing function models capture the effect of impedance and damping and are consistent with wake oscillator theory.  Also, a comparison between a distributed resonator with one that has a wavelength closer to the source, a discrete resonator, can be described as a coupling factor.  The describing function models capture the effect of a mode shape limited modal mass in comparison to a lumped mass.    \nIn the fluid-elastic cavity lock-in case, the shear layer instability produced by flow over a cavity couples to the elastic structure containing the cavity.  This combination of coupling factors has not been studied previously and is the weakest combination under consideration.  This type of lock-in was not achieved experimentally.  A similar sized cavity, however, was able to achieve lock-in with an acoustic pipe resonator.  Fluid-elastic cavity lock-in is unlikely to occur given the critical level of damping that exists for a submerged structure and the relatively weak source strength that a cavity produces.  A stronger source such as vortex shedding from a bluff body is able to lock-in to the same resonator as the fluid-elastic cavity case.  Thus, the type of instability source and the impedance difference between the source and resonator are dominating coupling factors for lock-in.  They represent the generation and dissipation balance that must be met in order to achieve lock-in.  \nThis study shows a strong consistency between the analytical models and experimental results.  Describing function modeling is a useful method for better understanding and predicting lock-in, particularly for configurations where synchronization is difficult to achieve experimentally.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3499], "author_name_tesi": "Cody, Kristin Lai-Fook", "last_name_ssi": "Cody", "middle_name_ssi": "Lai-Fook", "first_name_ssi": "Kristin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen A Hambric", "Timothy A Brungart", "Dean Capone", "Gary Hugo Koopmann", "Michael Lester Jonson", "Martin L Pollack"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen A Hambric, Committee Chair", "Timothy A Brungart, Committee Member", "Dean Capone, Committee Member", "Gary Hugo Koopmann, Committee Member", "Michael Lester Jonson, Committee Member", "Martin L Pollack, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydroacoustics", "flow tone", "lock-in", "fluid-elastic instability", "flow-induced vibration", "structural acoustics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "MOTOR PSYCHOPHYSICS: DEVELOPING A METHOD FOR MEASURING MOVEMENT-RELATED EFFORT\n\n", "id": "11661", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1002", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Motor planning theories suggest that the movements people perform are generally less effortful than the alternatives that could complete the task at hand.

My approach to studying this degrees-of-freedom problem was to identify body- and task-related features that help constrain the alternatives. The current work addressed the understudied issues of whether and how actions depend on multiple constraints in any given task. Thus, the overarching goal of the present research was to test the notion that individuals select actions with respect to multiple constraints that are cognitively ranked by their values for meeting task demands.\n\nTo pursue this idea, I conducted a series of experiments that pertained to the prominent preference to use the right hand for unimanual tasks. This hand preference likely serves as a common constraint, but surprisingly little research has described it in such a fashion. It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that little research has tested the relative priority of hand preference with other known constraints. The experiments reported here were meant to fill this void. The first experiment showed that right-handed people make hand choices that are related to, and may therefore depend upon, interlimb control asymmetries that lead to distinct ways of completing point-to-point reaches. However, choices were not related only to these interlimb sensorimotor performance asymmetries but also depended on other workspace location constraints. These findings support the idea that action choices depend on constraints that are ranked for each task.\n\nThe second experiment extended this idea to unimanual object transport tasks. I gave right-handed people choices between moving objects in ways that either satisfied hand preference or the well-known tendency to end transports in comfortable arm postures. This experiment tested three specific hypotheses. One was that hand preference is weighted more heavily than comfort. The associated prediction was that participants would use the right hand even when doing so led to uncomfortable postures. Another hypothesis was that comfort is weighted more heavily than hand preference. The associated prediction was that participants would use whichever hand afforded comfortable ending postures. The third hypothesis was the only logical alternative -- that people do not prioritize hand preference and comfort. This hypothesis predicted that participants would not consistently satisfy hand preference or comfort. The results showed that participants almost always used the hand that afforded comfortable ending postures, suggesting that aiming-related comfort outranks hand preference for the types of object transports I tested.\n\nThe third experiment explored the flexibility of this weighting by manipulating task demands. The results showed that the magnitude of this priority can be attenuated by more heavily weighting hand preference. However, the priority is not reversed or eliminated in this case.\n\nThe final experiment tested the idea that the priority that comfort has over hand preference also reflects considerations of performance. This hypothesis predicted that comfortable postures would afford better performance at the end of the transport than uncomfortable postures and that the right hand would afford better performance than the left hand. The most important prediction, however, was that the performance advantage of comfortable postures over uncomfortable postures would be greater than the performance advantage of the right over the left. The results bore out these predictions, again supporting the idea that manual action choices depend on hierarchies of constraints that are weighted in accordance with the demands of the task.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8669], "author_name_tesi": "Coelho, Chason Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Coelho", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Chason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A.

Despite evidence in humans that sleep disturbances and circadian disruption are associated with both the development of addiction and relapse to drug use, this relationship has received relatively little attention in the field. As such, the goal of this dissertation is to examine how sleep and circadian disruption arise as an aspect of heroin addiction and how these disturbances might further contribute to the addiction process. Chapter 2 used electroencephalography and electromyography to record sleep in rats throughout an entire cycle of addiction, including acquisition of heroin intake, abstinence, and an animal model of relapse. Rats, known to be nocturnal, were given access to heroin or saline during the light phase of their light/dark cycle. Results showed that sleep patterns were severely disrupted, such that heroin self-administering rats were in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep more during the dark (active) phase than during the light (inactive) phase. This reversed pattern was sustained for REM sleep for nearly a week of abstinence. The persistence of this effect suggests that self-administering heroin during the light phase causes a circadian disruption in the timing of REM sleep in rats. In Chapter 3, this study was replicated, but the rats were given access to heroin or saline during the dark phase. Sleep patterns in these heroin self-administering rats were not affected during acquisition. During abstinence, REM sleep spiked during the first dark phase, but this occurred in both the heroin rats and the saline rats and likely reflected an effect of the procedure. These data indicate that self-administration has differential effects on sleep and circadian rhythms depending on the time of access. While we are now learning the effects of time of access on sleep-wake patterns, we know little about how it affects heroin self-administration. To address this question, rats were given access to heroin during either the light or the dark phase for 18 days, with one progressive ratio challenge, followed by an abstinence period with multiple extinction tests and a heroin-induced reinstatement test (Chapter 4). The results showed that, overall, Dark Access rats self-administered more heroin and exhibited more seeking during extinction than did Light Access rats, but they did not show more addiction-like behaviors (escalation of intake, motivation to take drug, incubation of heroin seeking, or reinstatement of heroin seeking following a heroin prime). Importantly, Dark Access rats decreased extinction seeking when tested during the light phase, whereas Light Access rats increased seeking when tested in the dark phase. These results indicate that the increased seeking in extinction was due to the time of testing (during the dark/active phase), rather than the time of training. Buprenorphine, a mu/kappa opioid receptor agonist, is commonly used in treatment for opioid use disorders, but it also has been shown to affect sleep. Chapter 5 investigated gender differences, with a particular interest in sleep disturbances, in human patients taking an abuse-deterrent formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone for opioid use disorder. The results showed that women consistently reported worse sleep quality than did men while on buprenorphine/naloxone. Interestingly, whereas about half of men reported that their sleep improved once they began medication-assisted treatment, only one third of women reported the same. In Chapter 6, medication-assisted treatment was revisited in the rodent model with buprenorphine. Specifically, I tested the hypothesis that chronic, daily injections of buprenorphine, given at dark onset during abstinence, would reduce heroin seeking and rescue the circadian disturbance in REM sleep timing caused by a history of heroin self-administration during the light phase. The results showed that saline-treated rats with a history of light phase heroin self-administration exhibited the same increase in REM sleep during the dark phase that was seen in Chapter 2 and a great deal of heroin seeking during extinction testing. Buprenorphine-treated rats, on the other hand, appropriately spent more time in REM sleep during the light phase than during the dark phase, exhibited decreased heroin seeking during extinction in rats with a history of high heroin taking, and exhibited decreased seeking following a heroin prime compared to the saline-treated rats. Overall, the data in this dissertation demonstrate that sleep and circadian disruption are a consequence of heroin self-administration and that correcting these disturbances may be beneficial for recovery from heroin addiction.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16419], "author_name_tesi": "Coffey, Alissa Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Coffey", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Alissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy", "Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy", "Jidong Fang", "Scott C Bunce", "Kent Eugene Vrana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy, Committee Chair", "Jidong Fang, Committee Member", "Scott C Bunce, Committee Member", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Addiction", "Sleep", "Circadian rhythms", "Opioids", "Self-administration"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "A Structural Validity Study of the Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents - Home (ASCA-H)", "id": "6971", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1479", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Use of behavior rating scales has been called a \u201cbest practice\u201d in the assessment of children\u2019s emotional and behavioral problems.

It was designed to be completed by a parent/caregiver as a counterpart to the Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents (ASCA), a teacher-completed scale. The ASCA built upon limitations of traditional behavior rating scales with a unique format and multisituational approach.

Flowback ranges from 1,000-150,000 ppm total dissolved solids (TDS) including sulfates, chlorides, bromides, and toxic proprietary fracturing chemicals (Shramko et al., 2009). Flowback contains several components that are linked to harmful environmental and health effects.\nDue to these potentially toxic substances contained within flowback waters, discharge directly into the aquatic systems is not permitted. Flowback water requires extensive treatment at specialized treatment facilities to meet Pennsylvania discharge regulations. Due to the high quantities of flowback produced in Pennsylvania, 4 million gpd (15 million Lpd), a more efficient and cost effective disposal method is needed. Land-based disposal of flowback waters could potentially meet this need.\nFeasibility of land-based disposal of flowback in Pennsylvania was evaluated specifically focusing on the effects on soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and leaching of selected flowback components (Ba, Cd, Pb, Se, Sr, and Cl) through 66 cm soil cores collected from an area mapped as the Morrison soil series. The soil Ksat was estimated in-situ at the soil collection location with double-ringed infiltrometers and in the laboratory column leaching experiments. Leachate samples (100 mL) were collected from soil columns until one pore volume (~1,000 mL) had leached. Leachate concentrations of Ba, Cd, Pb, Se, Sr, and Cl were evaluated by the PSU Agricultural Analytical Services Laboratory and compared to federal drinking water standards and EPA lifetime advisory levels.\nThe flowback water collected from an active well pad in SW Pennsylvania was characterized by very high salinity (EC = 87.7 dS/m), sodicity (SAR=68.8 (meq/L)0.5), and extremely high TDS (219,000 ppm). Chloride (141,000 mg/L) was a major contributor to the high TDS level. Elevated Ba and Sr concentrations were comparable to values reported in the literature for other flowback waters.\n The Ksat values measured using flowback were not significantly different (\u03b1=0.05) from those determined for a 0.05 M CaCl2 solution in both the field infiltrometer and laboratory column leaching experiments. Results therefore indicate that flowback water will not likely impact the hydraulic capacity of the soil if applied directly to the land surface as a disposal method. \n\tApplication of flowback water to soil columns resulted in leachate concentrations of Ba, Cd, and Pb that significantly exceeded Federal Drinking Water Standards. Leachate Sr levels were far in excess of the EPA Drinking Water Lifetime Advisory Level of 4 mg/L. The Ba and Sr leachate concentrations increased progressively as more flowback was applied to the soil columns so that the leachate concentrations were equal to the initial flowback concentrations of Ba and Sr. Based on the estimated total soil cation exchange capacity, it is likely that the extremely high content of cations in the flowback quickly saturated all available exchange sites in the column soils.\n Equilibrium calculations based on tabulated thermodynamic stability constants suggest that high Cl- in the flowback enhanced leaching of Cd and Pb by forming non-adsorbing complexes with these metals. Some leachate Cd and Pb concentrations were higher than levels in the flowback water applied to the soil columns, implying that the high Cl- in the flowback water was mobilizing Cd and Pb from the soil itself. \nResults indicate that direct application of flowback water will not initially have a negative impact on the hydraulic capacity of the Morrison soil used in this study. However, the presence of Ba, Cd and Pb at levels above drinking water standards in soil column leachates suggest land application of flowback water potentially represents a groundwater pollution risk. Further investigation is needed under a variety of soil, flowback water, and vegetation conditions for a more comprehensive evaluation of the feasibility of land-based disposal of flowback waters generated in hydrofracturing operations. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8436], "author_name_tesi": "Cogan, Cody  Clair", "last_name_ssi": "Cogan", "middle_name_ssi": "Clair", "first_name_ssi": "Cody ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Marcellus Shale", "Flowback Water", "Land-based Disposal", "Hydraulic Fracturing"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Code Deflections Provisions for Two-way Slabs Deflections", "id": "14942", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7629", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current code provisions for design and analysis of two-way slab deflections on the long term are known to be inefficient for heavily loaded systems which often experience excessive deflections, causing damages to partitions and hanging objects below.

The issue under investigation is whether electron transfer within PS I occurs through both branches of cofactors or through only one branch of cofactors. The electron transfer co-factors in the PS I reaction center are located on two similar protein subunits, PsaA and PsaB. Light induced charge separation is carried out between the primary donor termed P700, and a chlorophyll acceptor termed A0. The electron is then transferred to A1 and to the three iron-sulfur clusters FX, FA and FB. Because of the presence of symmetry-breaking subunits in the PS I reaction center, it is not clear whether electron transfer is uni-directional e.g. along one branch of cofactors or bi-directional e.g. along both branches of cofactors.  If electron transfer is uni-directional, then the question arises as to which branch of co-factors is active, the PsaA-branch or the PsaB-branch.  The major, unsolved problem in this field is why two branches are available for electron transfer in PS I since only one is, in principle, required.  In PS I, mutagenesis provides a technique by which the two branches can be distinguished by introducing a specific change into only one branch of cofactors.  To tackle the directionality issue, mutations around the primary acceptor, A0 and A1, were engineered at each branch of the PS I branches.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5271], "author_name_tesi": "Cohen, Rachel O", "last_name_ssi": "Cohen", "middle_name_ssi": "O", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John H Golbeck", "Donald Ashley Bryant", "Davis T Ng", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Michael Thomas Green"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John H Golbeck, Committee Chair", "Donald Ashley Bryant, Committee Member", "Davis T Ng, Committee Member", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Member", "Michael Thomas Green, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Optical and EPR spectroscopy", "site-directed mutagenesis", "Synechocystis sp.

They can be found in brain activity, facial expressions, microsaccades, and neck muscle activation. Recent work suggests that they also occur in fixational limb movements, which may include drift, tremor, and small quick movements. In the studies reported here, limb movement was measured while participants pointed to a central location and anticipated a target-directed movement. During the pauses before voluntary movement, the amplitude of small \u201cfixational\u201d movement increased in the axis of forthcoming target-directed movement relative to the orthogonal axis, while frequency decreased in the axis of forthcoming target-directed movement relative to the orthogonal axis. These fixational movement biases may be online indicators of attention or some other cognitive process. Alternatively or additionally, they may reflect some functional aspect of motor preparation. This project investigates the phenomenon of fixational limb movement biases and seeks to elucidate whether, and in what manner, they reflect mental and physiological aspects of readiness. \nIn Experiments 1-3, participants memorized and then performed simple sequences of pointing movements that included long pauses. Experiment 1 verified that the effects held across different limb segments, and Experiments 2 and 3 confirmed that they were robust to various exploratory manipulations, including changes in instruction mode, internal vs. external timing, and pause duration. The amplitude effect depended on the proportion of recent movements made in each axis, suggesting that fatigue and gravity might play a role. Analysis of results with and without the last submove indicated that the countermove was critical to the frequency effect. Furthermore, when the last submove was removed from the period of analysis, vision was critical to the amplitude effect. \nIn Experiments 4-6, participants responded to cues. Cue validity had a large influence on the effects. Discreteness or reciprocity of the movement and size of the staging area had smaller influences. The influence of the size of the staging area provided support for the hypothesis that the effects are due at least in part to participants drifting toward the expected target and correcting. Additional analyses provided support for the idea that for rapid discrete movements with known start times, fixational movements in advance of movement onset promote synchronization of discrete movement onset with ongoing oscillation. Finally, correlations of effects with performance suggested that the countermove had a facilitatory effect on movement times. \nIn sum, the dependency of fixational limb movements on the direction of intended or expected forthcoming movement most likely has several sources. Support was found for: (1) the countermove, which serves to build up elastic energy immediately before the voluntary movement; (2) engagement of attention by the direction of forthcoming movement, combined with effort to maintain position with respect to a visual cue; (3) synchronization of fixational movements with respect to the expected time and direction of discrete movement onset. Other plausible relations between fixational and voluntary movements are discussed. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5335], "author_name_tesi": "Cohen, Rajal G.", "last_name_ssi": "Cohen", "middle_name_ssi": "G.", "first_name_ssi": "Rajal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A.

This arises as a result of the formation of composite fermions (CFs), which are bound states of electrons and an even number of vortices. The FQHE of electrons is understood as arising from the integer QHE (IQHE) of CFs. Alongside superconductivity, Bose-Einstein condensation and spin-liquids, the CF quantum fluid provides a model system for understanding strongly correlated systems and their collective behavior. Although it has been more than three decades since  the experimental discovery of FQHE, the field continues to produce profound insights and pose interesting problems some of which have been addressed in this thesis.\\\\\n\nA major unanswered question in the field of FQHE is the mechanism of FQHE for the 1/3 state in the second Landau leve (7/3 state). Numerical studies of this state have brought out the following puzzle: exact diagonalization studies suggest that the ground state and excitations of 1/3 state in the second Landau level are different from its counterpart in the lowest Landau level (LLL), while entanglement spectra of the two states point to the fact that they fall in the same universality class. Using methods from  CF theory we show that the excitations of the 7/3 FQHE lie in the same universality class as those of the 1/3 state but are strongly modified due to screening by CF excitons, thereby settling the above discrepancy. \\\\\n\nArmed with the exciton calculation, we illustrate that by imposing certain exclusion rules for CF excitons one can build the full spectrum of FQHE in the lowest Landau level. Equipped with the techniques to calculate the spectra of FQHE systems, we carry out an extensive study of FQHE of multi-component CFs (systems possessing degrees of freedom for eg: valley and spin degeneracy), which is applicable to FQHE in systems such as graphene, AlAs and GaAs quantum wells. We provide a comprehensive list of the possible fractions, their ground state energies and the critical ``Zeeman'' energies for the ``spin'' transitions between the states and compare them with the experimental observations. In the lowest Landau level of graphene, we find an excellent agreement between theory and experiments. However, in the second Landau level of graphene we find an unexpected spontaneous spin polarization of CFs. We predict that there are no spin transitions to be expected in the second Landau level of graphene, a result that could be tested out in experiments. We reanalyzed some old experimental data showing excitation modes below the Zeeman energy in the vicinity of 1/3 filling of the lowest Landau level whose theoretical origin was unexplained. Using methods of exact diagonalization and CF theory we demonstrate that these modes arise as a result of formation of trions of CFs which have sub-Zeeman energy due to skyrmion-like physics.\\\\\n\nIn the past couple of years, the Fermi wave vector of CFs has been measured very accurately in pioneering experiments at Princeton University. Motivated by these experiments we address the issue of the validity of Luttinger's theorem (which is a fundamental tenet of Landau Fermi liquid theory) for the Fermi sea of CFs. Our calculations suggest that the CF Fermi sea may violate Luttinger's theorem slightly. This not only provides a nontrivial example of a non-Fermi liquid, but gives new insight into the nature of the CF Fermi sea state and opens a new line of inquiry in the field of FQHE.

In fact, regretted sexual experiences are beginning to be recognized as significant and fairly common in the lives of college students. Research regarding the sexual regret experienced by adolescents and college students is limited and has only been addressed in a few studies to date. Given the incidence of and consequences from regretted sex, researchers have argued for more in-depth study of this phenomenon. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to examine the relationships among the experience of regretted sex, the reasons for regretted sex, and the factors associated with sexual regret. In the first of a three-part study, a convenience sample of 435 undergraduate students completed a survey about regretted sex, which resulted in the development of the 11-item Experience of Regretted Sex Scale (ERSS) as a reliable and valid measure of the experience of sexual regret. In study 2, the 36-item Reasons for Regretted Sex Scale (RRSS) was created and its psychometric properties were tested. Five categories of reasons for regretting sex were identified as significant factors: casual/drunken sex, negative sexual experiences, bad sex, relationship issues, and partner issues. The RRSS and each associated factor provided evidence of good psychometric properties.

The strong spectrum change observed at core/reflector boundaries combined with geometry complexity, material and structural heterogeneity of radial and axial reflectors make such treatment a challenging task. The correct modeling of the reflector response is important for accurate predictions of core power distribution especially in regions next to the reflector. For this reason special care is taken in generation of reflector homogenized cross-sections and discontinuity factors (DFs). Historically, one-dimensional (1-D) color set problems are used for the reflector, which are different from the unit fuel assembly cross-section generation models. The investigations presented in this thesis are further extension of studies performed elsewhere to achieve a more correct modeling by introducing improved color set models for reflector cross-section and DF generation and parametrization. These color set models more accurately capture the 2-D effects that occur on re-entrant surfaces. From the transport solution of the color set model, discontinuity factors are calculated, which in turn preserve the transport solution in the nodal code calculations. Two sensitivity studies have been performed. The first study evaluates the effect of the size of the color-set model on calculated reflector constants as compared to full 1/8 core sector of symmetry. The second sensitivity study is conducted with the aim of determining a parametrization for the reflector discontinuity factors at the core-reflector interface as function of the core conditions such as boron concentration,\nmoderator temperature and density. In addition, the effects of the loading pattern next to the reflector region on the discontinuity factors are examined through the use of color sets that include Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel and the traditional UO2 fuel. The prediction improvements that are achieved in both the global eigenvalue and power distribution from the selected optimal 2-D color sets as compared to the 1-D models currently in use are discussed in this thesis for two nuclear power plants. The newly calculated discontinuity factors show an improvement in predicting the global eigenvalue and power distribution and correcting the power tilt that was previously observed.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1600], "author_name_tesi": "Colameco, David Vincent", "last_name_ssi": "Colameco", "middle_name_ssi": "Vincent", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Thesis Advisor", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["LWR Analysis", "Discontinuity Factors", "Reflector Modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Next Generation Iterative Transport-Diffusion Methodology (ITDM) For LWR Core Analysis", "id": "15992", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7930", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ongoing trend of increasing fidelity and accuracy of reactor analysis and corresponding computational resources available to the nuclear core designer demands productive and efficient use of this added capacity.  Full core 3D transport solutions are not currently practical given the computational resource environment of the everyday commercial core designer.  An embedded approach, such as the Iterative Transport-Diffusion Method (ITDM), can bridge the gap between the current resource environment and the future full core 3D transport resource environment.  This approach provides a 3D transport like core solution while promoting productive and efficient use of present and future computational resources through the use of parallel localized transport calculations.  The major strength of this methodology is that it utilizes pre-existing codes and therefore industry use would require licensing only of the iterative methodology and not licensing of new transport and diffusion methodologies.   Additionally the modularization provides flexibility in the ability to develop the underlying codes and simply swap versions but more importantly invites parallelization.\n\nThe work in this dissertation shows that the neutronic modeling of a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) could be greatly improved through the use of an iterative transport-diffusion method (one-step procedure) compared to the current once through transport to diffusion methodology (two-step procedure).  The current methodology is efficient; however the infinite environment approximation of the transport lattice calculation introduces errors in the diffusion core calculation due to the lack of the effect of the core environment.

Hydride platelets normally precipitate with the platelet habit plane in the transverse-rolling plane of the sheet and are homogeneously distributed through the cladding thickness. Once hydrogen enters the cladding it can respond to a combination of temperature and stress such that hydrides particles reorient with their habit planes normal to the sheet surface and processes such as delayed hydride cracking may occur by preferential reoriented hydride precipitation at crack tips. This reorientation of hydrides can severely reduce ductility, thus it is crucial to understand the kinetics of hydride dissolution and precipitation under stress at temperature. Studies of hydrogen behavior in zirconium alloys are normally performed post facto, and suffer both from a scarcity of data and from the confounding effects of studying a hydride microstructure different from that present at higher temperature.\nIn the current study we have used synchrotron radiation diffraction to study the kinetics of hydride precipitation and dissolution in situ (under stress and at temperature). Samples of Zircaloy-4 and Zircaloy-2 hydrided between 80 and 610 wt.ppm and cut in different orientations were examined by transmission x-ray diffraction (using 80 keV synchrotron radiation), while heated and cooled in a furnace at temperatures ranging from 20 to 550\u00baC and stresses up to 100 MPa. Under these conditions the hydrides dissolved and re-precipitated in a different orientation under sufficiently high stress. A careful study of the intensities and peak broadening of the diffraction peaks as a function of time, stress and temperature allowed the identification of specific characteristics of the diffraction patterns of reoriented hydrides. As a result, the kinetics of dissolution, re-precipitation and orientation of the hydrides could be followed continuously by monitoring the peak broadening of diffraction peaks. The analysis of the diffraction patterns allowed detailed understanding of the kinetics of the hydride evolution under temperature and stress. Additional experimental techniques were used to enhance the understanding of hydrides in the material such as metallography and reflection x-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation. Finally a preliminary experiment was performed using micro-beam synchrotron radiation to study hydride precipitation at a crack tip while under stress. The experiment was done at room temperature and under no load on a hydrided cracked sample, and showed the viability of using micro-beam synchrotron radiation to study hydride precipitation at a crack tip.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3557], "author_name_tesi": "Colas, Kimberly Barbara", "last_name_ssi": "Colas", "middle_name_ssi": "Barbara", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Arthur Thompson Motta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Thesis Advisor", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["precipitation kinetics", "synchrotron radiation", "zirconium hydrides"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Fundamental Experiments on Hydride Reorientation in Zircaloy", "id": "15214", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7523", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As a result of corrosion during operation in nuclear reactors, hydrogen can enter the zirconium fuel cladding tubes and precipitate as brittle hydrides particles under normal conditions. These hydrides form as platelets oriented with the platelet face in the circumferential-axial plane of the tube, thus circumferential hydrides. When subjected to temperature cycles and applied stress such as can happen during preparation for dry-storage of used fuel, these hydride platelets can dissolve and reorient in the axial-radial plane perpendicular to the hoop stress. This phenomenon, present as a result of fission gases pressure, called hydride reorientation, leads to loss of ductility of cladding and is thus an important issue for used fuel safety. Hydrides can also precipitate at pre-existing stress concentrations such as flaws and lead to early cladding failure by the repetitive cracking process called Delayed Hydride Cracking (DHC). Such processes depend on the hydrogen mobility and precipitation under temperature and stress. The current available data in the literature on hydrogen and hydride behavior usually comes from studies conducted post-facto, thus suffering both from a scarcity of data points and from the confounding effects of studying only the resulting hydride microstructure at room temperature, rather than what is present at higher temperature. \nIn the current study, an in-situ X-ray diffraction technique using synchrotron radiation was used to follow directly the kinetics of hydride dissolution and precipitation during thermo-mechanical cycles. This technique was combined with conventional microscopy (optical, SEM and TEM) to gain an overall understanding of the process of hydride reorientation. Thus this part of the study emphasized the time-dependent nature of the process, studying large volume of hydrides in the material. In addition, a micro-diffraction technique was also used to study the spatial distribution of hydrides near stress concentrations. This part of the study emphasized the spatial variation of hydride characteristics such as strain and morphology. Hydrided samples in the shape of tensile dog-bones were used in the time-dependent part of the study. Compact tension specimens were used during the spatial dependence part of the study. \nIn the study of the kinetics of hydride precipitation and dissolution in bulk samples, it was found that the precipitation and dissolution temperatures (Tp and Td) corresponded well to the values obtained with differential scanning calorimetry. The applied stress when enough to reorient the hydrides, lowered the Tp. \nThe samples used showed hydride reorientation at 200 MPa for cold-worked Zircaloy-4, 80 MPa for recrystallized Zircaloy-4 and below 75 MPa for recrystallized Zircaloy-2 for samples with 200-600 wt.ppm of hydrogen. The degree of reorientation and the hydride connectivity increased with the number of thermo-mechanical cycles. \nThe hydride elastic strains from peak shift and size and strain broadening were studied as a function of time for precipitating hydrides. The hydrides precipitate in a very compressed state of stress, as measured by the shift in lattice spacing. As precipitation proceeds the average shift decreases, indicating average stress is reduced, likely due to plastic deformation and morphology changes. When nucleation ends the hydrides follow the zirconium matrix thermal contraction. When stress is applied below the threshold stress for reorientation, hydrides first nucleate in a very compressed state similar to that of unstressed hydrides. After reducing the average strain similarly to unstressed hydrides, the average hydride strain reaches a constant value during cool-down to room temperature. This could be due to a greater ease of deforming the matrix due to the applied far-field strain which would compensate for the strains due to thermal contraction. Finally when hydrides reorient, the average hydride strains become tensile during the first precipitation regime and remain constant in the tensile direction during the second precipitation regime. This could be due to the fact that the face of reoriented hydride platelet is in compression once these platelets have grown to a sufficient size. \nWhen studied with TEM, reoriented hydrides were observed to be approximately 300 nm thick and made of a single large precipitate. Circumferential hydrides were also about 300 nm thick and the individual hydrides stacked on top of each other. The orientation relationship for both circumferential and reoriented hydrides was found to be approximately \u03b4(111)// \u03b1(0002). \nA phase-field model was developed to attempt the modeling of hydride precipitation in bulk single crystal and poly-crystalline zirconium. The model was found to successfully predict the stacking of circumferential hydrides and the expected orientation relationship between the hydride and the matrix. The effect of stress was also studied and found to lead to partial hydride reorientation. \nThe second goal of this study was to perform a spatially resolved study of the effect of a stress concentration such as a notch or a crack on hydride reorientation. Using SEM and image analysis, it was found that a sharp crack induces a different hydride microstructure than a blunt notch. In the case of sharp crack, hydrides are more localized and align more with the defect than for blunt notches. The hydride connectivity also increases close to a stress concentration which will assist in crack propagation during DHC. Using TEM, the microstructure of hydrides grown near crack tips were observed to be similar to that of circumferential hydrides grown in the bulk. The orientation relationship studied with SEM and micro-X-ray diffraction was found to be in most cases \u03b4(111)// \u03b1(0002) for hydrides grown both near and far from stress concentrations. Using the same micro-X-ray diffraction technique local hydride and matrix elastic strains were measured and observed to vary significantly from grain to grain. It was however observed that hydrides grown close to the stress concentration are in tension in the face of the platelet, similar to reoriented hydrides, while those grown far from the stress concentration are in tension, similar to circumferential hydrides. The orders of magnitude of the measured strains in the hydrides and the zirconium matrix compared well to those predicted by finite element models. \nThis study shows that it is possible to study hydride dissolution and precipitation in-situ using time-dependent techniques. It was found that the precipitation temperature is lowered by hydride reorientation. The evolution of hydride strains during precipitation was found to be different for unstressed, stressed and reoriented hydrides. The reoriented hydride fraction and connectivity increase with number of cycles which could lead to more dangerous microstructure for storage of spent fuel. Pre-existing cracks were also found to affect hydride connectivity and morphology which directly impacts DHC and fuel integrity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7461], "author_name_tesi": "Colas, Kimberly Barbara", "last_name_ssi": "Colas", "middle_name_ssi": "Barbara", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Long Qing Chen", "Paul Raymond Howell", "Mark Daymond"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Dissertation Advisor", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Chair", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Paul Raymond Howell, Committee Member", "Mark Daymond, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["zirconium", "hydrides", "synchrotron X-ray diffraction"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Exploring the Sensitivity of Convective Storm Characteristics and Dynamics to Grid Spacing in Convection-Allowing North American Mesoscale Forecast System Simulations", "id": "14345mrc5452", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14345", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In support of the Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS) project, two severe weather cases (28 April 2014 and 6 May 2015) are simulated using the North American Mesoscale Forecast System (NAM) 1.33-km Fire Weather nest and 4-km CONUS nest, each with 5-min output.  On 28 April 2014, convection along and ahead of a cold front traversing the southeast U.S. was responsible for 359 storm reports (121 of which were tornado reports). On 6 May 2015, convection that initiated ahead of a dryline resulted in 144 storm reports (59 of which were tornado reports) in the central Great Plains region. Comparisons are made between the simulations and observations to explore how convection evolves differently on the two model grids.  The analysis focuses on the models\u2019 representations of the environment (e.g., instability and vertical wind shear), storm attributes (e.g., cold pools, storm motion, and mesocyclones), and dynamical processes within the storms (e.g., the baroclinic generation of vorticity.) The results suggest that the increased resolution of the Fire Weather nest promotes the simulation of convective storms with more realistic sizes and structures. The Fire Weather simulations also tend to perform better with the timing and location of convection initiation. However, as time progresses in the model simulations, the Fire Weather nest seems to lose some of its advantages over the CONUS nest. In the 28 April 2014 case, cold pools in the Fire Weather simulation ultimately became too cold and large and the convection moved faster than in the observations. Among other factors, the relative decrease in benefits of the Fire Weather nest late in the simulations may be related to its limited domain, its tendency to produce spurious convection patterns, and parameterizations which are not optimally calibrated for simulations at 1.33-km grid spacing.

The GCM used in this study was the Multiscale Modelling Framework (MMF), which uses a cloud system resolving model (CSRM) as a parametrization of cloud processes. Four sensitivity experiments were performed with the MMF. Within the CSRMs, either local or horizontally averaged radiative heating rates were used and the GCM used either biased or unbiased radiative heating rates and fluxes. For simulations over a single season, the MMF was sensitive to the inclusion of local cloud-radiation interactions within the CSRMs and the MMF was less sensitive to GCM receiving unbiased radiative heating rates and fluxes.

The method uses higher order vorticity elements to represent the wings and propeller blades as lifting surfaces.  The higher order elements allow for better force resolution and more intrinsically computationally stable wakes than a comparable vortex-lattice method, while retaining the relative ease of geometric representation inherent to such methods.  The propeller and wing surfaces and wakes are modeled within the same flow field, thus accounting for mutual interaction without the need for empirical models.  \n\nThe method was shown to be accurate through comparisons with other methods and experimental data.  To ensure the method is capable of capturing an unsteady lift response, it was compared with a Kussner function approximation of the change in two-dimensional lift due to a sharp-edged gust.  This study showed excellent agreement with an average error in the HOFW lift response of less than 3% from 0 to 10 semi-chords, but required high time and space resolution.  The time-accurate lift response of a propeller-wing system as predicted with the HOFW method was then compared with with fully unsteady CFD.  These results showed that the HOFW method can identify the peak frequency and general amplitude of the lift oscillations at high resolution.  Due to the high resolution requirements, this mode of analysis is not recommended for use in design studies.  \n\nTime-averaged results found using the HOFW method were compared with experimental propeller, proprotor, and propeller-wing system data, along with two semi-empirical methods.

To protect its assets, an organization needs to implement information security\ncontrols that mitigate the risks associated with these techniques. One of the key controls available\nto an organization today is the intrusion detection system (IDS), which is used to detect specific\nevents associated with unauthorized or suspicious activity. Traditional IDS systems have two\nlimitations that this research addresses. First, most IDS systems are tuned to detect specific\nattacks, but do not attempt to automatically reason across multiple attacks. Such emphasis on\n\u201csingle-step\u201d attacks, as opposed to \u201cmulti-step\u201d attacks puts the entire burden of reasoning\nacross multiple steps of a potential attack on the security analyst.

First, we consider the bounding of uncertainty in a linear Bayesian\nmodel of multi-step attacks.

In the case of zero parameter uncertainty, we provide an efficient algorithm to enumerate useful operating points within the 2-dimensional design space of\ndetection rate x false positive rate. For the uncertain parameter case, we show how operating\npoints become 2-dimensional operating boxes and show that the general problem of operating\nbox enumeration is highly computationally complex, necessitating heuristic solutions.

By virtue of its ability to transform cells in experimental systems and its association with human tumors, T antigen serves as an important model for studying carcinogenesis.\nTransformation of primary cells in culture requires both overcoming growth arrest by stimulating the cell cycle and blocking apoptosis (cell death signals presumably activated by oncogene-mediated hyperproliferative signals).  Among the many functions of T antigen are stimulation of cell DNA synthesis, binding the growth control protein p300/CBP, and binding and inactivating the tumor suppressor proteins pRb and p53.  Both pRb and p53 have been implicated in growth arrest and apoptosis.  The regions of T antigen that contain the functions described above have been defined and are genetically separable.  T antigen also contains a domain homologus to the anti-apoptosis protein, Bcl-2.  Therefore, T antigen has activities that stimulate cell cycle progression and activities that can inhibit apoptosis.  However, the role of each T antigen activity in modulating apoptosis has not previously been determined. \nStudies have shown that transformed cells can be susceptible to p53-dependent apoptosis following treatment with DNA-damaging agents while primary cells are resistant.  The study presented here examines whether specific regions of T antigen would either render cells susceptible to, or protect from DNA damage induced apoptosis.  The purpose of this study was to more closely define the T antigen activities involved in induction or inhibition of apoptosis.\nThe N-terminus of T antigen binds pRb and contains a DNA J-domain (amino acids 1-82) which act in concert to inactivate Rb functions.  The C-terminus contains the p53 and p300 binding regions and contains a Bcl-2 homology domain.  Since T antigen binds p53, p300, pRb and contains a Bcl-2 homology domain, the hypothesis underlying the research described here was that rat embryo fibroblasts expressing this protein would be resistant to DNA damage induced apoptosis.  Additionally, rat embryo fibroblasts expressing a C-terminal portion of T antigen, containing the p53/p300 binding region and the bcl-2 homology domain, would also be resistant to apoptosis following DNA damage.\nIn contrast to the expected result, rodent fibroblasts expressing either full-length T antigen (amino acids 1-708) or a C-terminal portion (amino acids 251-708) undergo apoptosis following exposure to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) through a p53-dependent pathway.  These data demonstrate that neither the p53-binding region nor the Bcl-2 homology region of T antigen is sufficient to prevent cell death induced by DNA damaging agents.  In addition, rodent fibroblasts expressing N-terminal fragments of T antigen (amino acids 1-127, 1-136 or 1-147) are also susceptible, demonstrating that there are two independent regions of T antigen which sensitize cells to 5-FU induced apoptosis.  Specific mutations within the first 128 amino acids of T antigen can result in a variable apoptosis response following 5-FU treatment suggesting that T antigen mediated chemosensitivity is dependent, in part, on the integrity of the J-domain and subcellular localization.  Finally, rat embryo fibroblasts expressing the C-terminal fragment 251-708 are protected from 5-FU-induced apoptosis only when this fragment is targeted to the nucleus.  These data suggest that the sensitization function(s) of T antigen is located in the N-terminus and is dominant.  The apoptosis response in cells expressing full-length T antigen following 5-FU treatment demonstrates that while T antigen can inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis in response to the hyperproliferative signals T antigen provides, other p53-mediated response pathways, such as the DNA damage response, are still active.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5649], "author_name_tesi": "Cole, Sara L.", "last_name_ssi": "Cole", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Sara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Warren Wills", "Anita Klein Hopper", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "Mary Judith Tevethia", "Satvir Singh Tevethia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Warren Wills, Committee Member", "Anita Klein Hopper, Committee Member", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Member", "Mary Judith Tevethia, Committee Chair", "Satvir Singh Tevethia, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cell stress", "Rb", "Bcl-2", "J-domain", "SV40", "5-fluorouracil", "p53", "apoptosis", "DNA damage", "large t antigen", "transformation"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Bilateral Topography of Cortical Projections to MI Cortex\n", "id": "9532", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1810", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To determine the cortical regions that project to primary motor (MI) cortex, we injected retrograde tracers into physiologically-identified sites in rat MI.

Therefore, understanding the link between cues and drugs of abuse is of great interest. My central goal is to elucidate the predictive value of early cue reactivity for later cocaine intake and addiction-like behaviors in an animal model.\nRats emit aversive taste reactivity (TR) behavior (i.e., gapes) following intraoral delivery of a flavor cue that predicts the opportunity for cocaine self-administration, and greater conditioned aversive TR in well-trained rats is associated with greater drug-taking.  I first examined the development of this conditioned aversive TR behavior on a trial-by-trial basis in an effort to determine when the change in behavior occurs and whether early changes in this behavior can be used to predict later drug-taking (in a within-subjects design).  Rats received 30 TR-self-administration sessions. During each session, a Kool-Aid\u2122 flavored saccharin solution was intraorally infused at a rate of 1 infusion/min for 30 min followed by a 2-h opportunity to self-administer 0.33 mg/infusion cocaine (CS+) or saline (CS-).  The results showed that conditioned aversion to a cocaine-paired cue (CS+) occurs after a single flavor-drug pairing, and, very early in training (within 3 trials) can be used to predict later cocaine-taking.\nI next tracked the development of this conditioned aversive TR behavior in an effort to determine when the change in behavior occurs and at what point individual differences in cue reactivity become predictive of cocaine-seeking and cocaine-taking (in a between-groups design).  Rats underwent 16 TR-self-administration sessions. The results confirmed my earlier findings that conditioned aversive TR to a cocaine-predictive flavor cue appears very early in training, stabilizes quickly, and becomes predictive of terminal self-administration within 3 to 4 trials. Moreover, using this design, rats that exhibited high conditioned aversive TR to the cocaine-paired cue also exhibited greater goal-directed behavior, were faster to take drug, self-administered more cocaine, and exhibited greater seeking during periods of drug non-availability.  \nThird, I tested whether early cue reactivity also can predict addiction-like behaviors for cocaine in a paradigm designed to foster stable self-administration and elicit behaviors characteristic of pathological use. Rats underwent 4-6 flavor-drug pairings as described above. Thereafter, they were given three 40-min access periods to cocaine, with a 15-min signaled non-availability period between each. Following 25 such trials, the willingness to work for drug was assessed using progressive ratio (PR). One week later, rats underwent an extinction-reinstatement test. Results showed that greater aversive reactivity during the taste-drug phase predicted a greater willingness to work for drug, but not increased drug-seeking when the drug was not available, or increased drug-induced reinstatement.\nFinally, I tested whether early aversion to a drug-associated cue relatively can predict escalation of cocaine self-administration behavior. Rats received 6 TR-self-administration sessions. Thereafter, the rats were given 15 daily trials of 6-h access to cocaine, after which the willingness to work for cocaine was assessed using PR. After an additional FR trial, the relative value of the Kool-Aid\u2122-flavored saccharin cue vs. cocaine was assessed in a single 6-hr two-choice test. The results showed that greater aversive TR early in training was associated with escalated cocaine self-administration during the extended-access and increased preference for cocaine over Kool-Aid\u2122-flavored saccharin when both were available.  \nTaken together, my findings demonstrated that early aversion to a drug-predictive cue is associated with higher drug intake, as well as the expression of increased motivation for cocaine, escalation of cocaine self-administration, and increased persistence in non-rewarded responding. My results confirm that I have developed a useful model of the association of contextual cues with addiction-like behaviors, which can be used to examine the role of cues in human cocaine addiction. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10240], "author_name_tesi": "Colechio, Elizabeth M", "last_name_ssi": "Colechio", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson", "Ralph Norgren", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Andras Hajnal", "Victor J Ruiz Velasco", "Willard M Freeman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson, Dissertation Advisor", "Ralph Norgren, Committee Chair", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member", "Victor J Ruiz Velasco, Committee Member", "Willard M Freeman, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rat", "cocaine", "self-administration", "addiction", "taste reactivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Roles of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-beta/delta and B-cell Lymphoma-6 in Pancreatic Cancer\n\n\n", "id": "11405", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2611", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors and members of the nuclear receptor superfamily.  The PPARs are implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes, including glucose and lipid homeostasis, fatty acid oxidation, inflammation and cell proliferation and invasion.  Of the three \nsubtypes &#8722; PPAR&#945;, PPAR&#946;/&#948; and PPAR&#947; &#8722; PPAR&#946;/&#948; is the least well understood in terms of its endogenous ligands and biological role(s). The PPAR&#946;/&#948; null mouse is more susceptible to hepatotoxicity than the wild-type mouse following challenge with Arsenic or CCl4, compounds known to induce toxicity via increased reactive oxygen intermediates.  Recently, PPAR&#946;/&#948; has generated much interest in its ability to regulate the inflammatory response in coordination with the transcriptional repressor, B-cell lymphoma-6 (BCL-6).  This dissertation will examine the hypothesis that modulation of oxidative stress underlies the protective role of PPAR&#946;/&#948; in the mouse liver, and that the regulation of inflammation and cell invasion by PPAR&#946;/&#948; and BCL-6 is a significant role for the receptor in human pancreatic cancer cells.  Oxidized very-low density lipoprotein (oxVLDL) and its constituents, including 13-S- hydroxyoctadeca-dienoic acid (13-S-HODE) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), are endogenous PPAR&#946;/&#948; activators in PPRE-dependent reporter assays. A structure-activity relationship was established where 4-HNE and 4-hydroperoxynonenal (4-HpNE) enhanced the activity of the PPAR&#946;/&#948; subtype.  Other oxidative stress mediators, including 4-hyroxy-hexenal (4-HHE), 4-oxo-2-nonenal (4-ONE), and trans-4,5-epoxy-2(E)-decenal, did not activate this receptor in these experiments.  Gene expression assays using both wild-type and PPAR&#946;/&#948;-/- cells demonstrated that 4-HNE induced gene expression in a PPAR&#946;/&#948;-dependent manner.  Furthermore, wild-type cells were more resistant to 4-HNE-induced toxicity (EC50 68&#956;M) compared with PPAR&#946;/&#948;-/- cells (EC50 5&#956;M).  Consistent with this observation, addition of a synthetic PPAR&#946;/&#948; activator protected cells from 4-HNE-induced toxicity, while treatment with a PPAR&#946;/&#948; antagonist reversed this observation.  Microarray analyses using both wild-type and PPAR&#946;/&#948;-/- cells indicated several anti-oxidant genes known to be involved in 4-HNE metabolism that were increased at the transcript level in a PPAR&#946;/&#948;-dependent manner.  Molecular modeling, using the coordinates of PPAR&#946;/&#948; bound to another endogenous ligand, eicosapentadienoic acid (EPA), indicated that 4-HNE forms a putative hydrogen bonding interaction with His413 in the PPAR&#946;/&#948; ligand-binding pocket.  Thus, 4-HNE binding activates the PPAR&#946;/&#948; subtype, increasing transcription of anti-oxidant and detoxification genes in a PPAR&#946;/&#948;-dependent fashion, and this observation may account for the protective role of the receptor in the mouse liver.\nThe identification of several PPAR&#946;/&#948;-regulated anti-oxidant genes prompted further studies to investigate the role of the receptor in regulating the inflammatory response in human cancer cells. Forced PPAR&#946;/&#948; over-expression inhibited basal and TNF&#945;-induced NF-&#954;B activity in reporter assays.  The synthetic PPAR&#946;/&#948; agonist, GW501516 induced a physical interaction between the receptor and the p50 subunit of NF-&#954;B in mammalian 2-hybrid assays.  Furthermore, GW501516 reduced basal and TNF&#945;-induced NF-&#954;B luciferase activity. Short-hairpin RNAi knock-down of PPAR&#946;/&#948; attenuated the GW501516 effect on NF-&#954;B luciferase, while knock-down of BCL-6 significantly enhanced TNF&#945;-induced NF-&#954;B activity.  The use of GW501516 and shRNAi technology identified several anti-inflammatory genes that were increased in a PPAR&#946;/&#948;-dependent fashion.  Moreover, GW501516 inhibited MCP-1 luciferase activity, although this effect was dependent on BCL-6.  Real-time PCR experiments identified several pro-inflammatory genes that were regulated in a BCL-6-dependent manner following GW501516 treatment.  Finally, GW501516-conditioned pancreatic cancer cell media affected pro-inflammatory gene expression and cell invasion abilities of differentiated THP-1 macrophages.  Together, these observations identify that the PPAR&#946;/&#948;- and BCL-6-dependent anti-inflammatory pathways are active in the human pancreas, and that the PPAR&#946;/&#948;-specific agonist GW501516 may prove useful in controlling inflammation and immune cell infiltration in pancreatic cancer cells.\nSeveral pro-inflammatory genes are consistently over-expressed in pancreatic cancers and are involved in metastasis.  The matrix-remodeling matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) has been linked to PPAR&#946;/&#948; and BCL-6 in macrophages, and is one of several genes highly expressed in pancreatic cancers.  Indeed, real-time PCR analyses identified both MMP-9 and PPAR&#946;/&#948; as being significantly elevated in human pancreatic cancer tissue at the mRNA level, while BCL-6 was significantly repressed. PPAR&#946;/&#948; activation by GW501516 was sufficient to reduce the TNF&#945;-induced expression of various genes implicated in metastasis and invasion, including MMP-9 mRNA and protein, and reduced the invasion of pancreatic cancer cells through a basement membrane in cell culture models.  The use of shRNA technologies indicated that the receptor was responsible for the ligand effects observed, while BCL-6 was responsible for inhibiting MMP-9 and pro-inflammatory gene expression.  These observations indicate that both PPAR&#946;/&#948; and BCL-6 play important roles in regulating pancreatic cancer cell invasion.\nRecent studies using other cell lines have implicated PPAR&#946;/&#948; in the regulation of both the inflammatory response and cell invasion and proliferation.  Understanding the mechanisms by which PPAR&#946;/&#948; agonists inhibit and ameliorate reactive oxygen, the inflammatory response and cell invasion may prove useful in the generation of alternative therapies for diseases in which inflammation and reactive oxygen species play a causative role.  Furthermore, the observations presented in this dissertation suggest that PPAR&#946;/&#948; agonists may be used in concert with chemotherapies to combat and control cancer-related metastases. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2604], "author_name_tesi": "Coleman, Jeffrey David", "last_name_ssi": "Coleman", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Jack Vanden Heuvel", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Adam Bleier Glick", "Karam E El Bayoumy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Jack Vanden Heuvel, Dissertation Advisor", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Chair", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Adam Bleier Glick, Committee Member", "Karam E El Bayoumy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["B-cell lymphoma-6", "pancreatic cancer", "PPARbeta/delta"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Time Poverty, Work Characteristics and the Transition to Food Insecurity among Low-income Households", "id": "9934", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "153", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Food insecurity refers to a household\u2019s inability to provide adequate food for all adults and children.

The arguments and characterizations they used shaped and reshaped how we imagine the responsibilities and relationships between government and citizens.\n\tFour case studies provide insight into different visions of democratic citizenship.

The purpose of this study was to determine the possible motivational factors of two popular fitness bands and one talking pedometer on the PA motivation of youth with VI, and whether these factors differ based upon sex or VI level. \n\nMethods: Participants consisted of 20 youth (13 males, 7 females, Mage=12.65\u00b12.26) with VI. During a weeklong developmental sports camp for youth with VI, participants were placed in groups of 5 and given the two fitness bands and talking pedometer to wear concurrently. Focus groups were conducted at the end of each day; the sessions were recorded and transcribed.  Participants responded to questions based on the social-ecological model (SEM) to discern, relative to these exercise devices, various motivators for PA at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and organizational levels, including: ease of use and access to data, understanding of the data, device preference, interpersonal benefits of using these devices, specific aspects of the devices that were found to be motivating, and suggested changes to the devices. Two researchers developed a coding scheme within an SEM framework using standard qualitative methods and coded responses by VI level, perceived motivation for PA, favorite device, and motivating device components; once consensus was reached, coding was analyzed using NVivo 10.  \n\nResults: Results included the perceived motivational benefit of using these devices, the variance of device preference based upon VI level and the lack of variance based upon sex, such as a preference for the audible device by those with less vision, and different aspects of each device on three SEM levels that the participants found to be motivating, such as the type of PA measures displayed, the incentive they offered to compete with peers or set PA competition goals, and ways in which the devices could be utilized at the organizational level to improve PA motivation for these participants.\n\nConclusion: Overall, all three PA-monitoring devices were reported to increase the participants\u2019 motivation for PA.

Though it mentions fan-generated content, it is rare to find more than a passing mention of fanart and its potential roles within these communities. The study takes a qualitative & interpretive point of view in order to establish the reasons that players create and consume artwork. Through a combination of text analysis, surveys, and interviews this research is intended to provide a broad understanding of players\u2019 general knowledge and feelings about fanart as well as how and why fanart affects the World of Warcraft community.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4131], "author_name_tesi": "Colibraro, Michael J", "last_name_ssi": "Colibraro", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrea H Tapia", "Andrea H Tapia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrea H Tapia, Thesis Advisor", "Andrea H Tapia, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["MMORPGs", "fan communities", "fan-generated artwork"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "IGNITION PROCESSES AND FLAME SPREADING IN A GRANULAR SOLID PROPELLANT BED", "id": "10613", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "89", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the detailed ignition, flame spreading, and combustion processes inside of a granular solid propellant bed is vital for accurate internal ballistic modeling and development of weapon systems. To characterize these items, a modular test chamber was designed, fabricated, and utilized to analyze ignition processes in axial, radial, and azimuthal directions. A percussion primer and black powder igniter jet were fired into a bed of an inert material which simulates the geometric properties of the live granular propellant to characterize its penetration. These particles were analyzed with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to confirm that the condensed phase species contain potassium species as predicted by equilibrium analyses. Three correlations were found which describe the region affected in the granular bed by condensed phase products of the igniter jet including: axial depth of penetration, maximum radial penetration, and the volume of the coated region. They are related by: the Reynolds number based on the jet diameter, the ratio of pressure in the igniter jet to the ambient, and the ratio of bed particle diameter to orifice diameter. Through the use of high-speed photography, photodetectors, and pressure transducers igniter jet penetration into the granular bed was examined in terms of its influence on flame spreading behavior. The igniter jet is shown to fully penetrate the bed, over approximately 1 ms, before any major granular bed combustion was measured through pressure time traces, high-speed photography, or photodetector signals. Tests performed with high-speed photodetectors, sensitive to either the visible and infrared spectrum, show that the relative spread between the hot gaseous front and the flame front can be determined utilizing this windowed test chamber.

This religious education is provided at any school in North Rhine-Westphalia attended by at least 12 students of the particular confession (NRW School Law III, 31, 1). The majority of Muslims living in Germany, the Turkish Alevi minority being the exception, are not yet considered to constitute a legally recognized religious community, and therefore, do not have a right to confessional religious education (Kaplan 2008). In 1999, North Rhine-Westphalia launched an Islam instruction school trial as an interim solution.  It differs from confessional religious education in that it is fact-based rather than faith-based (Ucar 2007).\n\nThere have been several studies on the acceptance of this interim school subject by the Muslim community (e.g., Kiefer 2005, Ucar 2006).  In contrast, my study asks:  What do people see as the socio-political goals of the school trial and are they being accomplished?  I interviewed political/government officials, representatives from the Muslim organizations and Churches, and principals and teachers from two schools partaking in the school trial and from one school which is not.  I distributed questionnaires to the 4th-grade students, both Muslim and non-Muslim, and their parents at these schools.  The purpose of this study is to highlight the varying expectations that members in society have for the school trial, and how these affect their acceptance of the course.

Specifically, films with grain sizes less than 100 nm have exhibited low elastic modulus compared to the expected coarse grain material value, and this is often contributed to a large volume fraction of grain boundaries.  The mechanical behavior of pulse electrodeposited (PED) nickel films with a micrograined microstructure was examined in this study and compared to the properties of nanycrystalline direct current deposited thin films and bulk material behavior.  \n\nTensile tests of the PED specimens were analyzed using digital image correlation (DIC).  Engineering strain was determined using the DIC technique and, in conjunction with engineering stress, was used to calculate elastic modulus values between 81 and 112 GPa.  The bulk coarse-grained value of elastic modulus is 200 GPa.  DIC evaluation of the transverse strain ratio led to values as great as 3.4 for this ratio in the apparent elastic regime of the material, values greater than the elastic limit of 0.5 for uniaxial tension.  These values corresponded to a volume change of -17.0% below the proportional limit of the material.  The specimens had an average yield strength of 826 MPa and average tensile strength of 995 MPa.  The use of incremental step fatigue tests conducted at a maximum stress of 876 MPa revealed that elastic modulus increased after initial loading and that this increase in elastic modulus was a stable and permanent effect.  The average increase in elastic modulus was 51.7%.  DIC evaluation indicated average modulus changes from 100 GPa to 160 GPa. Constant amplitude fatigue tests conducted at the nominal yield strength and at half of the yield strength confirmed the results of the incremental step tests with regards to elastic modulus.  The specimens were heat treated and then incrementally step tested to observe the effect of thermal energy on the change in elastic modulus.  Specimens were heat treated for 24 hours at 100\u00b0C and 25% RH.  After heat treatment, the average change in elastic modulus was 14.0%, showing that thermal energy drove the mechanism responsible for elastic modulus evolution in the material.   Additional specimens were creep tested at ~25\u00b0C for 24 hours in force control, and these specimens also showed increases in elastic modulus and also primary and secondary creep regimes.  Both elastic strain energy and thermal energy appeared to drive the mechanism responsible for stabilization of the dilated material.\n\nOptical micrography on metallographically prepared specimens indicated the films were textured, and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed a (111) orientation for the films.  X-ray microanalysis indicated no grain reorientation or grain growth when comparing as-received and fatigued specimens.  Analysis of the lattice parameter through X-ray diffraction showed that as-received specimens had a lattice parameter 0.1% greater than specimens that had been heat treated at 100\u00b0C and 25% RH for 30 minutes.  Comparison of fatigued and heat-treated specimens to as-received specimens using ion contrast imaging revealed, qualitatively, recrystallization of grains below ~10 nm in size throughout the fatigued and heat-treated specimens.  \n\nDensity measurements supported the transverse strain results from tensile testing.  The as-received specimens decreased 18.9% by volume after heat treatment at 100\u00b0C and 25% RH for 30 minutes.  A possible mechanism to account for these changes in elastic modulus is lattice dilation.  Current models of nanocrystalline materials are not applicable due to the low volume of grain boundaries, and there was no evidence of microcracking in the material, which is another mechanism that can reduce the apparent elastic modulus of the material.  Through the use of thermodynamic models, the observed density volume changes would correspond to a reduction in elastic modulus of 48.9% with respect to the bulk material equilibrium value at 0 K, suggesting that this material system could be modeled using first principles thermodynamic calculations.  The proposed mechanism for low elastic module in PED nickel thin films does not depend on grain boundary volume like the nanocrystalline material models, and the lattice dilation model correlated well with observed volume changes and elastic modulus changes in the material system.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2678], "author_name_tesi": "Collins, James Grayson", "last_name_ssi": "Collins", "middle_name_ssi": "Grayson", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Muhlstein", "Christopher Muhlstein"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Muhlstein, Thesis Advisor", "Christopher Muhlstein, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanocrystalline", "nickel", "thin films", "electrodeposition", "fatigue"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Failure prediction of composite bonded joints by analyzing strain homogeneity\n", "id": "12278", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13248", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Composite joints and structures are used xtensively in applications where a high strength to weight ratio is required, such as the frame in aircraft wings.

This dissertation focuses on understanding what schooling uniquely does to influence risk taking and preventative strategies in the context of heterosexual transmission of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. This dissertation presents the results of three empirical studies that examine different aspects of the role of schooling on the HIV and AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa. The research uses Demographic Health Surveys from 11 SSA countries with data collected in 4 relatively homogenous and remote villages in the Eastern region of Ghana on cognitive and decision-making abilities. The empirical studies yield data to test the effect of schooling on HIV infection, engagement in sexual behavior, mathematic ability, cognitive skills, and decision-making capacities related to the HIV and AIDS pandemic. This study presents the results of both logistic regression and structural equation modeling that examines hypotheses that link schooling with basic cognitive skill enhancement and how these relate to risk assessment and decision-making. This line of inquiry is a new approach to consider how schooling has such a wide impact on health behavior, a major social issue facing the future of numerous societies. This dissertation presents findings that extend existing lines of research of health and decision-making into a very different and important population (the non-schooled and low-schooled) in SSA. This dissertation also introduces the effect of schooling to enhance cognitive skills in the health behavior and decision-making paradigms.  This analysis is a step in understanding how attending school protects an individual from HIV infection and engagement in protective behavior above and beyond the acquisition of facts and attitudes.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2842], "author_name_tesi": "Collins, John Matthew", "last_name_ssi": "Collins", "middle_name_ssi": "Matthew", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David P Baker", "David P Baker", "Gerald K Letendre", "Katerina Bodovski", "Francis Dodoo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David P Baker, Dissertation Advisor", "David P Baker, Committee Chair", "Gerald K Letendre, Committee Member", "Katerina Bodovski, Committee Member", "Francis Dodoo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Decision making", "Schooling", "HIV and AIDS", "sub-Saharan Africa", "Sexual behavior", "HIV infection", "Cognitive skills"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Invisible Adult Educators: Public Online Discussion Group Moderators' Perceptions of their Roles, Tasks and Responsibilities", "id": "6132", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4266", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the past seventy years the study of adult education has professionalized, and some groups of informal adult educators have become marginalized.

By the late nineteenth century these problems had led to a rich and vital debate over America\u2019s economic future, a debate that played out not only in politics and judicial proceedings but in social and cultural milieus as well. While most research on literature and economics during this period has concentrated on the expression of revolutionary and socialist ideology, this dissertation examines those writers whose views were reformist, rather than revolutionary. In so doing, it argues that the Progressive Era and the Great Depression were historical periods in which liberalism turned inward, confronting and attempting to solve the problems inherent in its orthodoxy. The texts examined cover a range of literary fields, including late nineteenth-century utopian fiction (Edward Bellamy\u2019s Looking Backward and some novelistic responses to it), naturalism (the work of Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Frank Norris and Theodore Dreiser), and modernism (John Dos Passos\u2019s U.S.A. trilogy in particular).

Pancreatic cancer is characterized by immunosuppression. In late stage disease, the tumor microenvironment shifts from one favoring tumor recognition and clearance to one that promotes the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) which can exacerbate tumor growth (2). Thus, a better understanding of the immunosuppressive factors in pancreatic cancer and the development of novel strategies to counteract them is critical in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n The first aim of this project was to characterize tumor growth, inflammatory milieu, MDSC subset-specific accumulation and the assessment of MDSC subset functional differences in a murine model of pancreatic cancer. Female C57BL/6 mice were placed on an AIN-76 diet and 1x106 Panc.02 tumor cells were injected subcutaneously in the lumbar region of the back. Tumor growth and survival were monitored for 30-60 days post tumor implantation. Plasma levels of inflammatory mediators and growth factors known to drive pancreatic carcinogenesis and MDSC were quantified in tumor free (TF) and tumor bearing mice at 60 days post tumor implantation. Total MDSCs and MDSC subset accumulation was also quantified in TF and Panc.02 tumor bearing mice at days 30, 40, 50 and 60 post tumor implantation. The contribution of MDSCs to pancreatic tumor development was assessed by treating mice with either anti-Gr-1+ or anti-IgG isotype antibodies, or PBS vehicle. Lastly, the ability of MDSC subsets to inhibit T cell proliferation, and the gene expression profile of each MDSC subset were quantified. We demonstrated increased plasma levels of inflammatory mediators GM-CSF, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, VEGF and TGF- \u03b2 in Panc.02 animals in comparison to TF controls. MDSCs accumulated over time, with a preferential accumulation of the Gr-1HiCD11b+ subset, which is also characterized as CD11b+ Ly6G+Ly6CLo. Antibody depletion of MDSCs reduced Panc.02 tumor burden in comparison to both isotype and PBS treated controls. Additionally, MDSCs subsets from tumor bearing animals inhibited T cell proliferation and produced TGF-\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10. These findings indicated that MDSCs accumulate in pancreatic tumor bearing mice, and can inhibit T cell proliferation and enhance pancreatic tumor growth. \nThe second aim of this project was to evaluate the effect of obesity on the emergence of immunosuppressive factors at work in the Panc.02 model, in particular MDSCs. We hypothesized that obesity contributed to tumor growth by exacerbating the immunosuppressive environment, via the accumulation of MDSCs. To generate lean, control and obese mice, C57BL/6 mice were placed on a 30% kcal carbohydrate calorie restricted diet, a 10% kcal from fat diet, and a 60 kcal% from fat diet for 16 weeks, respectively prior to tumor implantation. Mice on each dietary intervention were injected subcutaneously with 1x106 Panc.02 cells and continued on their respective diets for 60 days post tumor implantation. At sacrifice, tumor weight, splenic immune function, and MDSC accumulation and function were assessed. Obesity significantly enhanced pancreatic tumor growth and reduced survival in Panc.02 tumor bearing mice in comparison to lean and control mice. Obese Panc.02 tumor bearing mice had a greater accumulation of MDSCs in the spleen, tumor draining lymph node (TDLN), and tumor in comparison to lean Panc.02 tumor bearing mice. Obesity in tumor bearing mice increased both MDSC subsets in spleen, but only increased the monocytic subset in the tumor in comparison to lean mice. We also demonstrated that MDSCs subsets from lean, control, and obese Panc.02 tumor bearing animals suppressed T cell proliferation to the same extent. These findings demonstrate that obesity increases the accumulation of MDSCs in pancreatic tumor bearing mice and may contribute to the immunosuppressive environment, thereby enhancing tumor growth. \nResults from the current study contribute to our understanding about the role of MDSCs in pancreatic cancer and the role of obesity on MDSC accumulation and function. Understanding the long-term health consequences of obesity on tumor-associated immunosuppressive factors may provide critical insight into the prevention and treatment of obesity-related cancers in the future.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11601], "author_name_tesi": "Collins, Shawntawnee ", "last_name_ssi": "Collins", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shawntawnee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Connie Jo Rogers", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Gordon Lee Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Connie Jo Rogers, Dissertation Advisor", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Gordon Lee Jensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["obesity", "immunosuppression", "myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)", "pancreatic cancer", "anti-tumor immunity"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF PHYTASE ACTIVITY FROM CULTIVATED EDIBLE MUSHROOMS AND MUSHROOM SUBSTRATES", "id": "6201", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4867", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Phytases (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate 3-phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.8) belong to a family of enzymes (histidine acid phosphatases) that catalyze the hydrolysis of phytic acid (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) and generate myo-inositol phosphates, myo-inositol and inorganic phosphates.  Various organisms including plants, bacteria, yeast, and many species of filamentous fungi have phytase-producing abilities.  \nA survey of various edible mushrooms and mushroom substrates has demonstrated phytase activity in all mushroom sources assayed.  Edible mushrooms that were surveyed included: Agaricus bisporus (white button, crimini, portabella, and breakfast flats), shiitake (Lentinula edodes), maitake (Grifola frondosa), and yellow oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus cornucopiae).  No significant differences in phytase activity (range 0.046 to 0.074 U/g tissue) were observed between samples of A. bisporus grown at The Pennsylvania State University Mushroom Test Demonstration Facility.  These samples were produced on the same substrate, regardless of harvest time or strain type.  However, a portabella (A. bisporus) sample obtained from a commercial farm displayed a 3-fold higher phytase activity level (0.211 U/g tissue).  This finding suggests that phytase levels may be inducible within mushrooms depending on substrate formulation and growth conditions.  Specialty mushrooms such as the shiitake (0.107 U/g tissue), yellow oyster (0.213 U/g tissue), and maitake (0.287 U/g tissue) all showed phytase activity.  Crude protein extracts from maitake showed the highest phytase activity among the specialty mushrooms.  The addition of various nutrient supplements to mushroom substrate did not alter phytase enzyme production in A. bisporus.  \nPhytase was purified from portabella (A. bisporus) basidiomata in a three-step process involving anion-exchange chromatography, ultrafiltration, and gel filtration chromatography.  The enzyme was purified 314-fold with a recovery of 1% and a specific activity of 14.7 U/mg protein.  Anion-exchange chromatography yielded 5% of the total phytase activity detected in crude protein extracts.  The molecular weight of purified phytase from A. bisporus was estimated at 531 kDA by gel filtration chromatography.  The optimum pH for activity was 5.5, but appreciable phytase activity was observed over the range of pH 5.0-8.0.  The pH range for A. bisporus phytase activity agreed with the acceptable pH range of mushroom compost supporting mycelial growth of A. bisporus.\nPurified A. bisporus phytase was inactivated following a 10 min incubation of ?60\u00b0C.  Approximately 75% of its activity was retained following an incubation of 50\u00b0C for 10 min.  Despite the apparent high molecular weight of the purified phytase from A. bisporus, this enzyme did not display an unusually high thermotolerance.\nSequence information from a cDNA contig was used to obtain putative full-length cDNA phytase clones by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR (RACE-PCR).  Full-length cDNA clones revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of approximately 1.96Kb.  The translated ORF contained the highly conserved RHGXRXP motif among phytases, suggesting that the putative function of this cDNA may be involved with the hydrolysis of phytic acid.  This full-length cDNA was transformed into the Pichia pastoris (yeast) strain X33 for protein expression and secretion.  However, numerous attempts to express heterologous protein in ten different P. pastoris transformants through bench-top fermentation and methanol induction were not successful, regardless of media, media volume, or cell density at the time of induction.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4845], "author_name_tesi": "Collopy, Patrick Damien", "last_name_ssi": "Collopy", "middle_name_ssi": "Damien", "first_name_ssi": "Patrick", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel J Royse", "Charles Peter Romaine", "Timothy W Mcnellis", "Gary William Moorman", "Robert Bruce Beelman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel J Royse, Committee Chair", "Charles Peter Romaine, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member", "Gary William Moorman, Committee Member", "Robert Bruce Beelman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Agaricus bisporus", "Grifola frondosa", "Pleurotus cornucopiae", "Lentinula edodes"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Enhancing student performance: Linking the geography curriculum, instruction, and assessment in the English-Speaking Caribbean", "id": "17788", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8482", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-01-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The effectiveness of any education system rests on the systemic alignment of three components: curriculum, instruction and assessment (CIA).

However, the alignment between curriculum and instruction and assessment and instruction was poor (Alignment Index \u2264 0.12).  The baseline threshold for acceptable alignment was 0.25.  The analysis revealed that the source of the misalignment between the curriculum and assessment was that there were items tested in the assessment that were not identified in the examination syllabus.  In terms of the misalignment between the curriculum/assessment and instruction, teachers were spending too much time teaching the skills of the discipline rather than the core content areas and they were spending too much time teaching the content at the cognitive level of recall.  In addition, teachers were not providing students with the types of instructional activities and approaches that would enable them to acquire and display their knowledge at the higher cognitive levels. \n\nThe cause of the misalignment was attributed to a vague, overloaded syllabus and limited teaching time; vague evaluative criteria and feedback from the examiners; inadequate and insufficient teacher training and professional development; a lack of administrative support and mentorship for teachers; and teacher frustration.  Consequently, the study offers evidence based recommendations that range from the modification and refinement of the geography curriculum and assessment to the implementation of professional development programs and interventions that can advance the teaching and learning of the discipline.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8383], "author_name_tesi": "Collymore, Jennifer Cecelia", "last_name_ssi": "Collymore", "middle_name_ssi": "Cecelia", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger Michael Downs", "Roger Michael Downs", "Richard Alan Duschl", "Deryck William Holdsworth", "David P Baker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger Michael Downs, Dissertation Advisor", "Roger Michael Downs, Committee Chair", "Richard Alan Duschl, Committee Member", "Deryck William Holdsworth, Committee Member", "David P Baker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["geography education", "curriculum alignment", "teacher education", "assessment", "geography instruction", "Surveys of Enacted Curriculum"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE CRISTOS YACENTES OF GREGORIO FERN\u00c1NDEZ:POLYCHROME SCULPTURES\nOF THE SUPINE CHRIST IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY SPAIN\n", "id": "8666", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2467", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Cristo yacente, or supine Christ, is a sculptural type whose origins date back to the Middle Ages.  In seventeenth-century Spain these images became immensely popular as devotional aids and vehicles for spiritual contemplation.  As a form of sacred drama these sculptures encouraged the faithful to reflect upon the suffering, death, and Resurrection of Christ as well as His promise of salvation.  Perhaps the most well-known example of this type is by the Valladolidian sculptor, Gregorio Fern\u00e1ndez (1576-1636).  Located in the Capuchin Convent of El Pardo near Madrid, this work was created in accordance with Counter-Reformation mandates that required religious images inspire both piety and empathy.\n\tAs a \u201csemi-narrative\u201d, the Cristo yacente encompasses different moments in the Passion of Christ, including the Lamentation, Anointment, and Entombment.  As an andachtsbild, it is a devotional image that allows contemplation on various stages of the Passion.  Images of the supine Christ played a key role in liturgical reenactments in both the Eastern and Western church; epitaphioi and medieval wooden sculptures of the dead Christ served as iconographical precedents for the Cristo yacente by establishing a relationship between the Eucharist and the physical body of Christ.  These Cristos yacentes are meant to be understood not only as metaphors for the Eucharist but also as embodiments of the promise of resurrection.  \n\tThe symbolism of the Cristo yacente as the bread of life was furthered by the construction of structures that recreated the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and by ceremonial reenactments held during Holy Week in which these figures were processed through cities in Spain.  It was through imagery that both the Holy Sepulchre and the Resurrection of Christ were recreated as part of a sacred drama.  The sculpture of the Cristo yacente then functioned as a surrogate for the physical body of Christ and played a key role in the liturgical ceremony.\tFern\u00e1ndez\u2019s formulation of the Spanish Cristo yacente type was aided by sixteenth-century carved and printed precedents.  Together with contemporary mystical writings by San Juan de la Cruz, St. Teresa of \u00c1vila, and Fray Juan de \u00c1vila, these provided the artist with the necessary visual and verbal imagery that was to be crystallized in three-dimensional form.  Through a detailed study and cataloguing of the most significant examples of the type, most of them produced by Fern\u00e1ndez and his workshop, I present, for the first time in English, a thorough material, critical, and socio-historical evaluation of the Cristo yacente as a sculptural and devotional image.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2450], "author_name_tesi": "Colon Mendoza, Ilenia ", "last_name_ssi": "Colon Mendoza", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ilenia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeanne Chenault Porter", "Brian A Curran", "Elizabeth J Walters", "Simone Osthoff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeanne Chenault Porter, Committee Chair", "Brian A Curran, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth J Walters, Committee Member", "Simone Osthoff, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cristo yacente", "Gregorio Fernandez", "Polychrome Sculpture", "Dead Christ", "Spanish Baroque", "Hapsburghs"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Predictions of Fleet Readiness Using Daily Optimization\n", "id": "10750", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3735", "abstract_tesi": "The planning of future operations is a complex process that requires knowledge and understanding of many different factors and resources.

Thus the objective of this research is to develop a procedure that aids in the short-term planning of operations by predicting the future readiness level of a fleet of vehicles that are subjected to various personnel factors.  This research presents a procedure that combines two different models to appropriately predict readiness levels at the end of a seven-period horizon.  This first model is a Monte Carlo simulation that determines different personnel availability scenarios based on three different factors that affect the net resource pool of workers.  These scenarios are then entered into a binary integer linear program (BILP) which iteratively optimizes fleet maintenance schedules on a daily basis.  An overall fleet readiness level with a certain degree of probability is determined which serves as an extremely useful tool for operations planning.  In addition, sensitivity analysis is presented on the different factors affecting personnel availability that can serve as useful aids in operational decision-making.  Overall, these results show that the procedure presented in this research serves as a very useful tool to aid in resource planning and overall operations planning.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3716], "author_name_tesi": "Colosi, Lindsey Diane", "last_name_ssi": "Colosi", "middle_name_ssi": "Diane", "first_name_ssi": "Lindsey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ling Rothrock", "Ling Rothrock", "Russell Richard Barton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ling Rothrock, Thesis Advisor", "Ling Rothrock, Thesis Advisor", "Russell Richard Barton, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["maintenance optimization", "fleet readiness"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS OF PALEOCENE PLANT LOCALITIES WITHIN ESTUARINE FACIES OF THE SALAMANCA FORMATION, CHUBUT PROVINCE, ARGENTINA\n", "id": "12445", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1744", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The most well preserved and diverse early Paleocene macrofloras from Gondwana occur within sediments from Chubut Province, Patagonia, Argentina. Two prolific sites of fossil preservation, Palacio de los Loros and Parque Provincial Ormachea, sit near the top of the southwestern outcrops of the Danian (65.5-61.7 Ma) Salamanca Formation. Resting just above an unconformity spanning the K-T boundary, the Salamanca Fm. provides evidence of plant recovery after the extinction event and the depositional environments in which these floras existed.\n\nThis thesis provides a sedimentological description and paleoenvironmental interpretation of the Salamanca and Banco Negro Inferior Fms. in their southwestern outcrops and places macroflora fossil localities in stratigraphic context. The Salamanca Fm. in the area 25-40 km south of Sarmiento, Argentina consists of ten facies and four facies associations representing a transgression onto continental Cretaceous facies followed by regression and infilling of marine, tidal facies. Lower sections of the Salamanca Fm. contain abundant glauconite and fossils characteristic of an open marine shelf environment. These facies transition upward to bi-directional trough cross-bedded sands interspersed with flaser-bedded sandy silts. Cross beds indicate meso-tidal currents with paleocurrent directions that cluster in the NW-SW quadrants. The uppermost unit of the Salamanca Fm. is composed of sands and silts that gradationally transition to dark muds of the Banco Negro Inferior (BNI) Fm. These silts and muds are interpreted as a series of stacked gleysols and vertisols consisting of montmorillonite, illite, glauconitic, and halloysite clay phases deposited through progradation of a widespread inland swamp. High aluminum content is the cause of dark coloration within the BNI Fm. \n\nPlant localities at PL and OR occur at two stratigraphic levels within the upper Salamanca Fm. and represent accumulation in five types of sedimentary deposits- silty beds of accretion sets, transported silt lenses, mud drapes, tidal flats, and muddy deposits along low-energy tidal channels. These sedimentary deposits signify two stages of estuary infilling and the progradation of a widespread, coastal swamp represented by the Banco Negro Inferior Fm. \n \nTwo-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling of tidal currents and ranges in the proto-San Jorge embayment produce tidal amplitudes of 1-3.5 m, consistent with the hypothesis that the Salamanca Fm. was deposited in an open estuary that amplified Paleocene microtidal Atlantic tides to meso-tidal range. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1730], "author_name_tesi": "Comer, Emily Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Comer", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rudy Slingerland", "Rudy Slingerland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rudy Slingerland, Thesis Advisor", "Rudy Slingerland, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sedimentology", "depositional environments", "paleobotany"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "ECOLOGY OF COMMON RACCOON (Procyon lotor) IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA AS RELATED TO AN ORAL RABIES\nVACCINATION PROGRAM\n\n\n", "id": "7518", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2493", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since the mid-1980s, the common raccoon (Procyon lotor) has been responsible for the most intensive rabies outbreak in U.S. history. In response to this outbreak, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) developed the Oral Rabies Vaccination (ORV) program. The ORV program was launched with the goal of developing a national control effort that positively impacts human and domestic rabies prevention and control. The multi-year program has the primary goal of creating zones of vaccinated animals along the leading boundaries of the epizootics, thereby halting the spread of the rabies virus.\n\nThe ORV program was initiated in Pennsylvania in 2001, with the primary objective of halting the westward expansion of raccoon rabies and secondarily reducing the incidence of rabies and eventually eliminate raccoon rabies throughout the state. The western front of the current rabies outbreak in Pennsylvania provides a unique opportunity to investigate raccoon ecology. An understanding of home ranges of and habitat use by raccoons among different landscapes has become important as rabies developed into an enzootic throughout the mid-Atlantic. The objectives of this study are to (1) identify sizes of home ranges and core areas among 3 landscapes (rural, forested, and suburban), (2) identify landscape differences regarding raccoon habitat use selection at the home-range and core-area scale, and (3) create raccoon resource selection function (RSF) models that are landscape specific.\n\nI monitored radio-collared raccoons from May through early January 2003\u00a8C2006 in 3 western Pennsylvania counties. I recorded 5,920 locations for 74 (24 female and 50 male) adult radio-collared raccoons, which include 4,703 nocturnal locations (1,223 rural, 1,531 forested, and 1,949 suburban) and 1,217 diurnal locations (339 rural, 397 forested, and 481 suburban). Additional information was recorded from 738 trapped raccoons captured in 6 western Pennsylvania counties (2003\u00a8C2006) for a secondary study on the public health significance of asymptomatic Salmonella serovar infections in raccoons.\n\nA significant 3-way interaction was found for raccoon den type use among sex, den type, and landscape (G2 = 391.52, df = 22, P \u00a1\u00dc 0.0001), with den type differing by sex (G2 = 115.22, df = 4, P \u00a1\u00dc 0.0001) and landscape (G2 = 270.66, df = 8, P \u00a1\u00dc 0.0001). Female raccoons used tree dens more often than males. Males used ground dens and human structures much more frequently than females.\n\nMean sizes of home ranges and core areas of raccoons did not differ between males and females within the same landscapes (rural: t = 0.81, df = 15, P = 0.433; forested: t = 0.12, df = 17, P = 0.906; and suburban: t = 0.36, df = 12, P = 0.72). As urbanization increased from forested to suburban landscapes, sizes of mean home ranges decreased; however, sizes of core areas did follow a decreasing trend. Male and female raccoons in forested landscapes had significantly larger mean home ranges and core areas than those of male and female raccoons in either rural or suburban landscapes. However, size of core areas for male and female raccoons in rural landscapes did not differ between those of male and female raccoons in suburban landscapes. Differences in seasonal sizes of home ranges were observed only in male raccoons within rural landscapes (t = 2.45, df = 20, P = 0.024).\n\nRaccoons within rural, forested, and suburban landscapes (home ranges: \u00a6\u00d62 \u00a1\u00dd 219.5, df = 5-7, P \u00a1\u00dc 0.001; and core areas: \u00a6\u00d62 \u00a1\u00dd 137.8, df = 5-7, P \u00a1\u00dc 0.001) used home-range and core-area habitats disproportionately to their availability. Habitat use by raccoons differed among landscapes, with different habitat types being selected within the 3 landscapes.\n\nAccurate predictive models are needed to provide quantitative measures of raccoon distribution on the front of the ORV zone. My research developed landscape specific RSF models that are valuable for quantifying the probability of a raccoon inhabiting an area of interest. Using logistic regression, radiotelemetry locations, geographic information system (GIS) software, and habitat types, I derived study-site probability maps of raccoon occurrence. The RSF models provide the spatial-probability distribution (likelihood of being in an area) of an adult raccoon and can be visualized and made functional within a GIS.\n\nMy secondary study isolated Salmonella enterica serovars from 6 western Pennsylvania counties examined. Ten serovars were identified, with approximately 7.4% of all raccoon samples being positive. Pulse field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed 13 unique Salmonella enterica serovar isolate profiles.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2476], "author_name_tesi": "Compton, Justin A.", "last_name_ssi": "Compton", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary San Julian", "Richard Tucker Yahner", "Duane R Diefenbach", "Bhushan M Jayarao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary San Julian, Committee Chair", "Richard Tucker Yahner, Committee Chair", "Duane R Diefenbach, Committee Member", "Bhushan M Jayarao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Raccoon", "Rabies", "Home range", "Resource selection function", "Salmonella"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "THE ROLE OF HOST-PATHOGEN-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS IN SUCCESSFUL BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF CIRSIUM ARVENSE WITH THE RUST FUNGUS PUCCINIA PUNCTIFORMIS ", "id": "13505sac327", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13505", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The noxious weed Canada thistle, Cirsium arvense, causes extensive problems in agricultural and conservation land worldwide.  Systemic infections of the host-specific rust pathogen Puccinia punctiformis produce severe impacts on C. arvense survival and the pathogen has been explored as a potential biological control agent since 1893.  Implementing successful biological control has been limited by ineffective inoculation methods, low disease incidence within weed patches, inconsistent disease latency, and lack of spread across the landscape.  Overcoming these hurdles requires knowledge of P. punctiformis epidemiology, specifically the interplay of host-pathogen-environment, in producing severe and widespread disease. \nExperiments were conducted to determine the infection court and seasonal timing required for systemic P. punctiformis disease.  Statewide Pennsylvania field trials were conducted to test a novel technique utilizing living, diseased C. arvense transplants as an inoculum source.  Late season root inoculations with teliospores were found to be most effective at producing systemic disease.  Transplanting diseased plants did not produce significant infections compared to control patches. \nThe role of C. arvense landscape distribution, genetic diversity, and host resistance in limiting biological control efficacy was investigated by testing natural C. arvense populations from three sites in Pennsylvania.  Landscape surveys of C. arvense density showed aggregated weed distributions, but with high connectivity between patches.  Host diversity within and between patches was determined with SSR markers and unique genotypes were clonally propagated and challenged with inoculations.  Highly variable host resistance was observed within patches of C. arvense.\nPathogen movement and spread was investigated with a series of experiments to evaluate production and dispersal characteristics of the two infective P. punctiformis spore types.  Aerial spore concentrations were measured with volumetric spore traps in naturally infected C. arvense patches.  Dispersal gradients were measured by releasing spores in windy field conditions and capturing spores at different distances from the source.  Timing and quantity of spores released were evaluated in systemically infected thistle patches. Terminal velocities of spores were also compared in a particle settling tower. By all measures, aerial movement is significantly different between the two major spore types but both are capable of escape from weed patch canopies and landscape scale dispersal given the right meteorological conditions.   Better understanding of infection conditions, pathogen dispersal and host resistance helps progression towards prescriptive applications of P. punctiformis for effective biological control but the litany of natural limitations delimited by this research explains why success with this pathosystem has remained elusive for so long.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13536], "author_name_tesi": "Conaway, Steven Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Conaway", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott Alan Isard", "Scott Alan Isard", "Donald Durwood Davis", "Katriona Shea", "David A Mortensen", "Gary W Moorman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott Alan Isard, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott Alan Isard, Committee Chair", "Donald Durwood Davis, Committee Member", "Katriona Shea, Committee Member", "David A Mortensen, Outside Member", "Gary W Moorman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biological control", "invasive weeds", "canada thistle", "rust fungus", "cirsium arvense", "puccinia puntiformis"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Negotiating Race To The Top: An Intervention Teacher's Story", "id": "18943", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9100", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When President Obama signed The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in February of 2009, he authorized the use of $4.35 billion to fund Race to the Top, an education initiative encouraging states to compete for grant money to use towards education reform.

The kinetics data determines the probability for each type of reaction to perform based on radical survival times and Arrhenius reaction rates.

For the case where an absorbed photon directly causes a bond scission, ablation occurs following the rapid chemical decomposition of material.  The photolytic decomposition process is shown to be more efficient in initiating ablation.  Stress is important in initiating ejection when a short pulse width is used causing a propagating pressure wave.  Additionally, following excitation, molecular dopants can lead to ablation either through localized chemical decomposition of the polymer or the mechanical cleavage of the polymer bonds.

Second, the present study characterized the chemistry of cross linking between amino acids and proteins with lignin.  Third, poplar was transformed to express and secrete proteins into the lignifying cell wall.

Our experimental results are highly consistent with proteomics database and this study provides a fast and quantitative way for detecting extracellular localization of apoplastic proteins. \nOur results show that three amino acids (Cys, Tyr, and Thr) are able to react with intermediates of in vitro lignin synthesis: incubations of coniferyl alcohol, peroxidase and H2O2.  LC/MS results show that the mechanism of cross linking of Cys, Tyr and Thr with lignin, is through the quinone methide intermediate of synthesis.  In addition to free amino acids, our results also show the ability of whole proteins to cross link with lignin in vitro through Cys or through Tyr residues.  Our findings provide a mechanism by which proteins and lignin can cross link in the plant cell wall and reveal the chemical nature of the interactions between protein and lignin.  \nPoplar was transformed to express and secrete proteins into the lignifying cell wall.  One construct (NTRG2) contains a gene encoding a peptide with high Tyr content (17%) with the poplar phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL2) promoter (Gray-Mitsumune et al. 1999) and a signal peptide from Pinus coniferin &#946; glucosidase (C&#946;G) (Samuels et al. 2002).  The other vector (MGRP) has a gene encoding a peptide rich in Cys (11% Cys), which is able to participate in cross linking reactions with lignin in vitro.  This vector is driven by the double 35S CaMV promoter and poplar C&#946;G signal peptide.  Transgenic poplars of NTRG2 showed normal plant growth, morphology, stem structure, and unaltered cell wall composition.  Transgenic poplars of MGRP showed slow plant growth, narrow leaf shape, and small stem radius.  The digestibility of most transgenic lines of NTRG2 and MGRP surveyed was increased compared to wildtype.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1987], "author_name_tesi": "Cong, Fang ", "last_name_ssi": "Cong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ming Tien", "Ming Tien", "John Edward Carlson", "Nicole Robitaille Brown", "Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Thomas Lehman Richard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ming Tien, Dissertation Advisor", "Ming Tien, Committee Chair", "John Edward Carlson, Committee Member", "Nicole Robitaille Brown, Committee Member", "Jeffrey M Catchmark, Committee Member", "Thomas Lehman Richard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lignin", "bioethanol", "poplar", "signal peptide", "amino acid", "crosslink", "lignocellulose"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Essays on Mortgage Broker, Borrower, and Lender Behavior in the Subprime Mortgage Market", "id": "21988", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10128", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation presents three essays on the behavior of mortgage brokers, borrowers, and lenders in the subprime mortgage market.  In the first essay, I examine the relationship between the type of broker-borrower interaction in the origination process and subsequent mortgage performance.  I show that face-to-face interaction between a mortgage broker and borrower before the loan funds is associated with lower levels of ex post default.  This relation holds only for loans that have certain characteristics associated with low levels of financial literacy.  Specifically, face-to-face interaction is negatively related to default for minorities, borrowers located in areas with low levels of education, low-income borrowers, and borrowers with low FICO scores.  Additionally, a face-to-face meeting between the mortgage broker and the borrower is associated with lower default rates on cash-out loans, which brokers often originated as \"credit-repair\" loans.  Moreover, the relation between default and broker-borrower interaction is significant only for certain loan products (ARMs, low-doc) that have been linked to low levels of financial literacy.  Taken together, these results suggest that face-to-face interaction between the mortgage broker and borrower may reduce problems associated with financial illiteracy.\n\nIn the second essay I explore differences in low-doc mortgages across employment types.  Evidence suggests that stated income documentation mortgages, or \"liars' loans,\" are used to falsify income so that borrowers can obtain mortgages that would be deemed unaffordable by traditional underwriting standards.  By examining differences in stated income loans across employment types (e.g. self-employed versus W2 borrowers), I show that not all lies are created equal.  My results demonstrate that high default rates for stated income loans are driven by W2 borrowers.  For self-employed borrowers, default is not significantly related to the level of income documentation.  Also, I find that income falsification is problematic only on stated income loans to W2 borrowers.  In addition, I provide evidence that selection effects before the loan funds, at both the lender and borrower level, exist on stated income loans.  Taken together, the results indicate that important differences exist between stated income loans to W2 borrowers versus low-doc loans to self-employed borrowers.\n\nThe third essay investigates real earnings management in the context of the residential mortgage market.  Specifically, I try to determine if the lender originates lower quality loans to meet earnings benchmarks.  My results are consistent with the lender lowering origination standards to manipulate earnings.  Depending on the specification, loans originated in the final month of income constrained quarters are 27% - 34% more likely to default, ceteris paribus.  Furthermore, expected default rates, based on ex ante risk characteristics observable at origination, are higher in the final month of income constrained quarters.  In addition, I try to detect how the lender manipulates its activities in the final month of quarters where it meets or just beats earnings expectations.  The results indicate the lender is less likely to reject loan applications when it is in jeopardy of meeting earnings expectations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9820], "author_name_tesi": "Conklin, James Neil", "last_name_ssi": "Conklin", "middle_name_ssi": "Neil", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brent William Ambrose", "Brent William Ambrose", "Austin Jay Jaffe", "N Edward Coulson", "Jiro Yoshida", "Michelle Lowry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brent William Ambrose, Dissertation Advisor", "Brent William Ambrose, Committee Chair", "Austin Jay Jaffe, Committee Member", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member", "Jiro Yoshida, Committee Member", "Michelle Lowry, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Financial literacy", "brokerage", "mortgage default", "subprime", "liars' loans", "income documentation", "real earnings management"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Assessing the Invasive Potential of Acer platanoides and Viburnum opulus Cultivars", "id": "8034", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2986", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tInvasive plant species threaten the biodiversity of natural areas (Bir, 2000; Morin, 1999; U.S. Department of the Interior, 1999; Wilcove et al., 1998) and cause destructive environmental and economic affects throughout the United States (Clinton, 1999; Reichard and White, 2001).  Methods for determining the invasive potential of plant species and the management concerns surrounding these plants is constantly developing to encompass a broad range of topics.  Issues surrounding invasive species have both captivated and divided the attention of many environmental community members such as conservation organizations, land managers, ornamental horticulture industry groups, and public awareness groups.   The Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) and guelder rose (Viburnum opulus L.) are two species that have been used throughout the ornamental horticulture industry in the United States for years and are labeled as potentially invasive.  \n\tThe purpose of this study was to determine the invasive potential of A. platanoides and V. opulus cultivars.  Fifteen A. platanoides cultivars including \u2018Columnare\u2019, \u2018Crimson King\u2019, \u2018Emerald Queen\u2019, \u2018Erectum\u2019, \u2018Faasen\u2019s Black\u2019, \u2018Fairview\u2019, \u2018Globosum\u2019, \u2018Greenlace\u2019, \u2018Reitenbachii\u2019, \u2018Royal Red\u2019, \u2018Rubrum\u2019, \u2018Schwedleri\u2019, \u2018Summershade\u2019, \u2018Superform\u2019, and \u2018Undulatum\u2019 along with two hybrids A. truncatum xplatanoides \u2018Norwegian Sunset\u2019 and A. truncatum xplatanoides \u2018Pacific Sunset\u2019 and seven V. opulus cultivars including \u2018Aureum\u2019, \u2018Compactum\u2019, \u2018Leonard\u2019s Dwarf\u2019, \u2018Losely\u2019s Compact\u2019, \u2018Nanum\u2019, \u2018Roseum\u2019, and \u2018Xanthocarpum\u2019 were assessed over a 3 and 2 year period, respectively to document annual flower and seed production, germination, and seed viability.  In addition, environmental weather and soil conditions were analyzed to determine their affect on appraised traits.  Biological traits were then employed by a current analytic assessment tool which was modified to determine the invasive potential of the cultivars within each taxon.  \n\tResults displayed that weather and soil conditions did affect measured traits and that differences existed among all traits for A. platanoides and V. opulus cultivars.  Germination rates for V. opulus cultivars at the open site and within the forest in the absence of litter were the only exception to this in that they were similar.  Most A. platanoides cultivars varied from one year to the next in flower production and seed yields; however, seed set and germination rates under optimal and field conditions did not vary.  Of these traits, only germination rates under optimal conditions differed from one year to the next for many V. opulus cultivars.  Such findings on these traits do not allude to invasiveness.  Instead, they are useful in further describing the cultivars researched and in showing that it is necessary to research these traits over several years to accurately reveal each cultivars full potential.  \n\tA modified weed risk assessment (WRA) tool was then employed.  All A. platanoides and V. opulus cultivars were placed in the further evaluate category except for A. platanoides, A. truncatum xplatanoides \u2018Norwegian Sunset\u2019, A. truncatum xplatanoides \u2018Pacific Sunset\u2019, and V. opulus that were rejected.  All cultivars that were placed in the further evaluate category need to be reevaluated to determine whether they should be accepted or rejected.  This can be done by collecting as much information as can be reasonably gathered on these plants naturalization potential in temperate zones, invasive history, weediness, allelopathic abilities, fire hazard, capability of hybridization, seed bank longevity, and ease of control.   As additional information becomes available for each cultivar, invasive potential should be reassessed by the modified WRA.  \n\tFrom this research, it was concluded that cultivars which produce prolific seed quantities and that showed high to moderate germination or viability rates may be capable of escaping cultivation and establishing in regions where they may become invasive overtime.  For this reason, A. platanoides and cultivars \u2018Emerald Queen\u2019, \u2018Fairview\u2019, and A. truncatum xplatanoides \u2018Norwegian Sunset\u2019 along with V. opulus and cultivars \u2018Roseum\u2019 and \u2018Xanthocarpum\u2019 should refrain from being used in the trade.  Although A. platanoides cultivars \u2018Columnare\u2019 and \u2018Faasen\u2019s Black\u2019 had low germination and viability rates, these cultivars should refrain from being used in cultivation because they produce many seeds that may foster invasiveness via the spread of propagules.  Despite that V. opulus cultivar \u2018Leonard\u2019s Dwarf\u2019 was low yielding and germinated at low rates, it should not be heavily used by the industry because its seeds are highly viable which may permit the establishment of this plant at unwanted locations.    \n\tCultivars that generate low seed quantities, germination rates, and viability may pose less of a threat of becoming invasive outside of the landscape.  Because A. platanoides cultivars \u2018Crimson King\u2019, \u2018Globosum\u2019, and \u2018Rubrum\u2019 along with V. opulus cultivars \u2018Losely\u2019s Compact\u2019 and \u2018Nanum\u2019 were low yielding, germinated at low rates, and had low to moderate viability rates these plants should be encouraged for use within cultivation.  Although research was conducted on germination and seed viability for A. platanoides cultivars \u2018Erectum\u2019, \u2018Greenlace\u2019, A. truncatum xplatanoides \u2018Pacific Sunset\u2019, \u2018Reitenbachii\u2019, \u2018Royal Red\u2019, \u2018Schwedleri\u2019, \u2018Summershade\u2019, \u2018Superform\u2019, and \u2018Undulatum\u2019 along with V. opulus cultivars \u2018Aureum\u2019 and \u2018Compactum\u2019, to accurately assess their invasiveness it is necessary that further research be conducted on these plants seed production.   \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2978], "author_name_tesi": "Conklin, Janine Ranee", "last_name_ssi": "Conklin", "middle_name_ssi": "Ranee", "first_name_ssi": "Janine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James C Sellmer", "Ricky M Bates", "Robert Berghage Jr.", "William Curran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James C Sellmer, Committee Chair", "Ricky M Bates, Committee Member", "Robert Berghage Jr., Committee Member", "William Curran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["seed production", "germination", "viability", "norway maple", "guelder rose", "flowering"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Boron-to-Carbon Ratio From The First Cosmic Ray Energetics and Mass Balloon Campaign\n", "id": "9787", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4623", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Cosmic Ray Energetics and Mass (CREAM) project consists of a series of balloon campaigns\nintended to study the composition of high-energy cosmic-ray nuclei near the knee of the all-particle cosmic-ray spectrum.

While not a serious pest of honeybees in its native range, the small hive beetle is a major problem for beekeepers its invasive range, frequently causing hives to abscond. Recently, a yeast (Kodamaea ohmeri) has been found associated with the small hive beetle. When growing on pollen, this yeast produces an odor blend that is very attractive to the beetle. It has been hypothesized that the presence of K. ohmeri may be a key factor in severity of small hive beetle infestations. This dissertation explores the connection between the small hive beetle and its yeast in three areas. The first area is the growth of K. ohmeri in bee hives. It has been hypothesized that the presence of K. ohmeri in the bee hive causes attraction and aggregation of the small hive beetle. However, no evidence has been provided that K. ohmeri is capable of multiplying in the hive environment when small hive beetle infestations are low. This dissertation, then, examines the factors that affect growth of K. ohmeri in the bee hive, including water activity, nutrient availability, the presence of beetles, and the presence of bees. This dissertation documents K. ohmeri is capable of growing on bee bread from bee hives without beetles present, and that water activity is important to the growth of K. ohmeri on bee bread and pollen. Beetle frass, which contains a high quantity of K. ohmeri, may be the source of yeast inoculum. The second area of research concerns the specificity of the interaction between K. ohmeri and the small hive beetle. Several species of yeast occur naturally in bee hives or in beekeeper-added pollen supplements. This dissertation reports that these yeasts, as well as other yeasts associated with beetles and other insects are capable of producing beetle-attractive volatiles and attracting small hive beetle adults, implying that the small hive beetle\u2019s relationship with K. ohmeri is not an exclusive one, and the small hive beetle may be attracted to naturally occurring yeasts growing on pollen in the bee hive. Finally, the third area of research concerns the effect of K. ohmeri on the oviposition of the small hive beetle. Though K. ohmeri has been shown to increase reproduction of small hive beetles on pollen or oranges, the mechanism for this increased growth is unknown. This dissertation finds that pollen fermented by K. ohmeri is a preferred oviposition substrate for small hive beetle females, though fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae or K. ohmeri did not increase the rate of ovary development over that of control pollen. Preference was most likely mediated by gustatory or olfactory cues in the pollen. Beetles switched ovipositional preference to control pollen after 24 hour hours of oviposition. This switch in preference appeared to be caused by changes in the K. ohmeri-fermented substrate, since adding fresh K. ohmeri\u00ac-fermented pollen after 24 hours restored preference. The presence of yeast in the hive may influence small hive beetle host selection and beetle reproduction in bee hives. In addition, this dissertation provides initial data on the mating biology of the small hive beetle, including first descriptions of mating behavior and reproductive structures. Initial data gathered in this study indicates that small hive beetles may require an extended mating period in order to be fertile, providing an opportunity for control by mating disruption strategies.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7638], "author_name_tesi": "Conklin, Tracy Miranda", "last_name_ssi": "Conklin", "middle_name_ssi": "Miranda", "first_name_ssi": "Tracy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "John Frazier Tooker", "Christina M Grozinger", "David Michael Geiser"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Committee Chair", "John Frazier Tooker, Committee Member", "Christina M Grozinger, Committee Member", "David Michael Geiser, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aethina tumida", "Apis mellifera", "Kodamaea ohmeri", "attraction", "specificity", "mating", "oviposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Automated Hypothesis Generation of Processes Causing Clusters in Geographic Datasets", "id": "8297", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2675", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While there are many algorithms and statistical tests to detect clustering of geographic phenomena, such as disease cases, the follow-up task of analyzing the cluster to hypothesize a cause is generally left to the researcher.

There are challenges to measuring both self-control and physical activity, and a two-method measurement (TMM) strategy provides a valuable solution to address measurement validity concerns. The TMM model improves our confidence in the validity of the measurement of one construct by drawing strength from two forms of measurement of the same construct. The TMM model works best when one measure is the gold-standard measure of a construct; however this dissertation tested a two-group strategy for use when both measures of the construct are biased. The first study applied this method to re-quantify the intention-behavior gap for physical activity, a known but widely ranging association in the literature. Study 1 applied several versions of the TMM model to a sample of approximately 120 college-aged students for whom two weeks of daily self-reported physical activity and accelerometer data were collected.  A second study tested a larger conceptual framework outlining associations between elements of self-control and physical activity in the MIDUS dataset, including variables such as trait-like tendencies to plan, persevere and express an internal locus of control.  The third study examined the correlation between perseverance and physical activity, both of which are potentially biased in self-report measures.  Similar to Study 1, a two-group, TMM model was implemented to study perseverance, using heart rate variability to correct bias in the self-report measures in the MIDUS dataset.  This study had two parts: a replication of previous significant associations between perseverance or grit and variables such as education, conscientiousness, life satisfaction, and happiness. The second part of the study tested the association between perseverance and physical activity using the TMM approach to study both constructs. Overall there was support for using TMM models to estimate physical activity and attenuate self-report bias, and also some evidence to suggest TMM models could be valuable for studying perseverance.  Further, there was support for the conceptual model linking self-control to physical activity. Specifically the findings suggest that trait levels of planning and perseverance are associated with more physical activity.

This information, coupled with the parents\u2019 interest in a school that provides interaction between school and home, higher order thinking experiences, people outside the classroom participating in learning, individualized learning and career/interest opportunities, led parents to choose charter or cyber charter schools.\nIf local public schools want to lessen the exodus of students from their buildings, they must begin to think of parents and students as customers.  These customers have specific interests and values which must be understood.  This study provides the basis for that understanding for one school district, the Penns Valley Area School District.

The use of cryogenic means to store and supply hydrogen is inefficient, as losses due to boil off are inevitable, making long term storage an issue.  Furthermore, the low density of liquid hydrogen and the insulation requirements to maintain it results in large volumes and significantly increases the bulk system mass.  The ability to manufacture bulk quantities of nano-sized particles have enabled their use in the development of propellants with increased performance properties, including faster burning rates.  This performance increase is purely a result of the much higher surface area these particles possess, and thus enables their use in the manufacture of reactive compositions, which would otherwise remain inert.\n\nThe motivation for the current work stems from the ability of nanometer sized aluminum particles, when combined with water to self-propagate, reacting to form high temperature molecular hydrogen and condensed phase aluminum oxide.  Freezing these mixtures produces a solid propellant having applications of long term hydrogen storage for low earth orbit and for specialized missions.  Furthermore, the simplicity of the chemistry and relative ease of manufacture promotes their use as in-situ propellants for lunar and Mars missions.  \n\nInvestigations include baseline frozen propellants consisting only of nanometer sized aluminum particles combined with water, and compositions which make use of fuel blends and energetic additives as a means of increasing the propulsive performance of the baseline composition.  The particles used were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer Emmett Teller analysis, and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, to determine active content, nominal particle size and size distribution, oxide shell thickness, and surface composition.  Generally, the particles used had a nominal diameter of 80 nm and an active aluminum content of 74.5 percent by mass.  Propellant mixing, manufacture, and casting techniques were all developed specific to these compositions, using hand and acoustic mixing methods to blend reactants.\n\nExperimental analysis of the frozen compositions was conducted using a constant pressure strand burner, constant volume cell, and a series of scaled rocket motors, several of which were constructed for use during this investigation.  Strand burning tests provide information on propellant linear and mass burning rates with respect to pressure and composition which were correlated using a Saint Roberts Law fit, while the cell provided an effective means to study combustion efficiency of compositions, through analysis of the gaseous products.  Static-fired motors, instrumented with pressure and force transducers, were used to determine the propulsive performance of several propellant formulations.  Additional compositions included substitution of micron sized aluminum and aluminum hydride (AlH3) for nano material, and ammonia borane (AB), and hydrogen peroxide (HP) were considered as additives.  \n\nTwo specific equivalence ratios (0.71 and 0.943) were chosen based on theoretical performance calculations and testing requirements.  Baseline compositions were shown to self propagate and strand tests yielded pressure coefficients of 0.602 and 0.992 with exponential values of 0.785 and 0.405 for the two given equivalence ratios.  Similar compositions containing several different batches of nanometer aluminum yielded measurable variations in burning rate, suggesting careful particle characterization should be conducted prior to use.  A comparison between the baseline and classical hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)/ammonium perchlorate (AP) and aluminized HTPB/AP/Al composite solid propellants yielded faster burning rates at higher pressures for the frozen compositions, and for the formulation having an equivalence ratio of 0.943, the resulting pressure exponent was very similar to the aluminized composite solid propellant.  These compositions, successfully tested in a series of scaled rocket motors (in both end-burning and center-perforated grain configurations), were shown to produce repeatable results, with slightly lower pressures and longer burn durations exhibited with increasing equivalence ratio.  Performance was also shown to increase with increasing motor size and equivalence ratio.  \n\nSubstitution of micron aluminum for nanometer material showed the increasing fraction of larger particles did not significantly impact the linear burning rates up to a certain loading fraction, following which the burning rates were observed to decrease.  This limit was determined to be particle size dependent, decreasing with increasing nominal particle diameter.  Compositions tested under varied pressure conditions yielded significantly reduced burning rates at low pressure, which was recovered as pressures were increased, yielding a higher pressure exponent.  Combustion efficiency was shown to increase from the 72% measured for the baseline to approximately 80% for compositions containing 20 micron aluminum particles, both having an equivalence ratio of 0.943.  Motor tests conducted for compositions containing 25 and 50% (by mass) 2 micron aluminum yielded lower chamber pressures, longer burn times, higher C* efficiencies and similar specific impulse (Isp) efficiencies compared to the baseline composition.  Similarly, micron-sized AlH3 was introduced in place of micron aluminum to boost the hydrogen yield.  Measured linear burning rates decreased with increasing AlH3 weight percent.  Pressure tests yielded similar pressure exponents, with burning rates decreasing from the baseline as the fraction of AlH3 in the composition increased, following the same overall trend.  Conversion efficiencies for compositions containing alane were similar to mixtures containing micron aluminum, however, with decreasing pressure (below approximately 7 MPa), combustion efficiencies were shown to decrease as low as 32%.\n\nHydrogen peroxide was considered as an energetic additive to the baseline formulation.  Burning rate measurements were obtained for several formulations at pressures up to approximately 7 MPa, however, at higher pressures the combustion process was observed to transition to an unsteady mode.  Ammonia borane was also considered as an energetic additive, introduced to the baseline composition to increase the hydrogen yield, and ultimately the propulsive performance of the composition.  Varied amounts of AB tested under constant pressure conditions, yielded a peak burning rate of approximately 3 cm/s corresponding to approximately 18.8 wt% addition of AB.  Pressure tests conducted using a similar formulation yielded an increased burning velocity over the baseline, following the same linearly increasing trend.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6206], "author_name_tesi": "Connell Jr., Terrence Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Connell Jr.", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Terrence", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Yetter", "Richard A Yetter", "Grant Alexander Risha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Yetter, Thesis Advisor", "Richard A Yetter, Thesis Advisor", "Grant Alexander Risha, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogen generation", "nano particles", "combustion"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DETERMINING EDUCATIONAL NEEDS AND BEST METHODS OF DELIVERY FOR CONFINED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS\n\n", "id": "8647", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3385", "abstract_tesi": "Agriculture is one of the most complex and hazardous industries within the United States, annually ranking within the top two for fatal injuries among workers (NIOSH, 2007).

Insurance companies are interested in finding the best way to educate their CAFO clients to take preventative steps in lowering loss on farms. This study worked with a single insurance company in Pennsylvania. The goal of the study was to examine six problematic areas among their CAFO clients. These topics included Manure and Odor Management, Bio-Security, the Pennsylvania Right to Farm Law, Animal Rights Activism, Construction Issues, and Worker Safety. The first objective was to examine which of the six common problem areas CAFO\u2019s required the most attention and increased awareness. The second objective was to identify which of the six common problem areas clients wanted further information and assistance. The third objective was to identify the most preferred methods of delivery for information.\nBoth qualitative and quantitative methods of research were used to examine the three objectives listed above. A quantitative knowledge assessment survey was sent out to 116 CAFO owners and operators. Thirty-three surveys were completed and returned. Of those 33 respondents, 15 were successfully contacted and interviewed about their experiences owning and operating a CAFO, any loss or problems within the six common areas they experienced on their farm, and the preventative measures that they had taken to prevent a reoccurrence.\nAnalyses have shown that Worker Safety and Construction Issues were the two topics most in need of education by the participants.

The initial item pool was reviewed for content validity by a panel of four content experts.  Several teacher focus groups also contributed to the revision of item wording.  The final survey consisted of 41 items.  Sampling yielded 215 responses.  Reliability was measured through an internal consistency method.  Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1=808 indicating the instrument has good reliability.  Construct validity was examined through three separate analyses.  A factor analysis was conducted to uncover if factors were revealed from the survey responses.  ANOVA, independent samples t-test, and correlation were used to see if variables that previous literature found as influential on DAP had a similar relationship with the PPQ results.  Lastly, correlation was used to investigate the relationship between the responses on the PPQ to another instrument, the Beliefs about Primary Education Scale.  The Primary Practices Questionnaire appears to have an underlying two factor structure, however this finding is considered tentative.  First grade teachers over third grade teachers and teachers who engage in higher numbers of different types of professional development activities (recency and content not examined) reported higher levels of implementation of developmentally appropriate practices.  These two findings are consistent with previous research.  Other teacher and context variables measured, such as certification, level of education, total years teaching, autonomy in curricular and instructional decision making, class size, and classroom support did not results in between groups differences on the PPQ which is inconsistent with previous research.  The PPQ shows some evidence of construct validity as it has a moderate positive correlation (r=.34) with a theoretically related instrument.  In all, the results of the investigation into the psychometric properties of the Primary Practices Questionnaire provide a promising start for further development of the instrument.  It is hoped the creation of this instrument will go far in creating an understanding in the greater public education community of the need to promote the use of developmentally appropriate practices.

Although it remains unfinished, San Cataldo is one of the most frequently featured examples of Rossi\u2019s work in studies of postmodern architecture. However, despite San Cataldo\u2019s significance, the cemetery is too often presented as an illustration of theoretical issues rather than a work deserving of study in its own right.

It does so through a critical analysis of four decades of discourse surrounding San Cataldo to identify gaps within the existing conversation about the cemetery.

The first is the materiality of the actual built work versus the more famous drawings of the project that are often treated as the \u201creal\u201d project itself.

The efficacy of miscible gas flooding is compromised by hydrodynamic dispersion, which consists of both molecular diffusion and velocity-dependent dispersion. Hydrodynamic dispersion dissipates concentration fronts, causing early breakthrough and weakening the strength of the injected solvent. Dispersion can cause two-phase flow to develop in displacements that are otherwise multi-contact miscible, resulting in the formation of a residual oil phase.\n\nDispersion is a scale dependent phenomenon that has been shown to increase with increasing heterogeneity, mobility ratio, correlation length, aspect ratio and distance traveled. Generally, dispersion is not modeled explicitly in reservoir simulation and physical diffusion is almost never modeled. At typical reservoir flow rates diffusion is expected to be much smaller than dispersion. Numerical dispersion in reservoir simulation is usually used as a proxy for true physical dispersion. Large grid blocks used in reservoir simulation can result in gross over-estimates of in-situ mixing. Higher order methods can be used to attenuate numerical dispersion in reservoir simulation, allowing for more accurate modeling of concentration gradients.\n\nThe key objectives of this research were to:\n-Develop a higher-order flux-limited TVD code;\n-Use this code to study the scale dependence of reservoir mixing, particularly at high mobility ratios and high correlation lengths;\n-Explicitly model the effects of diffusion and determine the impact of various levels of diffusion on dispersion in reservoir simulation.\n\nThis thesis details the development and use of a higher order flux-limited simulator with ``TVD-like\" properties. The simulator was purpose-built to fulfill the requirement for a fast, high-resolution model that would not create excessive numerical dispersion. This simulator has been used to study the scale dependence of hydrodynamic dispersion.\n\nIn this work over 1600 FCM displacements were simulated on heterogeneous grids. Both mobility ratio and longitudinal correlation length were varied across a wide range. Physical diffusion was modeled as part of this work. The simulation code was used to automatically calculate local dispersivity by fitting the 1D CD equation to the concentration history at each grid block and taking the log average across a vertical cross section. It was hypothesized that dispersivity would increase with increasing correlation length and mobility ratio. It was also envisaged that dispersivity would eventually decrease as mobility ratio became extremely adverse and/or correlation length became very long. Diffusion was predicted to have no significant impact on dispersivity in reservoir simulation because diffusion is much smaller in magnitude than numerical dispersion.\n\nDispersivity behaved as predicted in the absence of input physical diffusion: increasing correlation length and mobility ratio resulted in increases in dispersivity, before causing it to decrease. Highly correlated, layered media and highly adverse mobility ratios appeared to be conducive to the development of channel-dominated flow. However, dispersivity was shown to peak at higher mobility ratios and correlation lengths as physical diffusion was progressively added. Diffusion was shown to significantly increase dispersivity. \n\nDispersion is scale dependent, increasing with mobility ratio and correlation length. High resolution, fine-grid simulation models predict a decrease in dispersivity as mobility ratio and correlation length become very large, and flow appears to become channel-dominated. In reality, the presence of diffusion is likely to delay the onset of channel-dominated flow. Dispersion is likely to continue increasing even as mobility ratios become highly adverse and reservoirs become highly layered. In these scenarios diffusion plays an important role in initiating dispersion across sharp concentration gradients. In high resolution, fine-scale reservoir simulation models, numerical dispersion is unlikely to be sufficiently large to initiate dispersion. Flow may be erroneously modeled as channel-dominated, when in fact it is dispersion-dominated.\n\nChapter 1 of this thesis is a literature review that details the nature of hydrodynamic dispersion. Chapter 2 provides an explanation of the mathematical principles used in this research. In Chapter 3 the simulation model is described. Chapter 4 provides details on the simulation study and an analysis of results.

According to the Joint United United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, an estimated 33.3 million people were living with HIV in 2010. As early as 1987, prevention guidelines from the Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommended that people living with HIV (PLWH) disclose their HIV serostatus to their sexual partners. Self-disclosure of HIV serostatus to sexual partners is vital to addressing the global pandemic because it can promote condom use and prevent new HIV infections.  In addition, self-disclosure of HIV serostatus to friends and family members, including children, has potential benefits to provide PLWH the social support needed to cope with the challenges associated with HIV. Although the Caribbean region has the second highest HIV rate in the world, few studies have examined the HIV serostatus disclosure experiences of people in the Caribbean and among Caribbean immigrants residing in the United States.\n \tPaper 1 describes a qualitative study conducted in central Haiti between 2006-2007 with 25 HIV-positive mothers and 26 children ages 10-17. An extended HIV-focused adaptation of the Disclosure Decision Model was used to identify the factors influencing maternal HIV serostatus disclosure to children, examine the breadth of the mother\u2019s disclosure, and understand the impact of disclosure on children in Haiti. Paper 2 uses baseline data from a randomized trial of a Cognitive-Behavioral Stress Management intervention to examine the factors associated with HIV serostatus disclosure to sexual partner among 258 HIV-positive alcohol users in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. In Paper 3, the Disclosure Processes Model was used to examine the disclosure experiences of 21 HIV-positive Haitian immigrants in New York City.\n\nThe findings from the first paper revealed that reasons for maternal HIV serostatus disclosure were children\u2019s experience of HIV-stigma in the community, fear of death, encouragement from psychosocial intervention workers, trust, and not wanting to hide the illness from their children. The main themes related to breadth of disclosure were brief disclosure and explicit disclosure with some mothers sharing information about how they learned about their illness diagnosis and their medication. Themes related to impacts of disclosure included emotional reactions for children and mothers, HIV education and concerns about transmission, and desire to assist mothers with illness. In the second paper, we found that only 38.6% of the participants disclosed their HIV serostatus to their sexual partner and that participants who had an HIV-negative partner or were unaware of their partner\u2019s HIV serostatus were significantly less likely to disclose their HIV serostatus to their sexual partner than those with an HIV-positive partner. The themes related to reasons for disclosure that emerged in the third paper were close relationship with someone they trusted, comfortability, and the need for support and understanding about the illness.  Reasons for nondisclosure were fear of being stigmatized, and rejected.  Some of the outcomes of disclosure included social support, emotional relief and encouragement to take their medication, mistreatments.  These findings highlight the facilitators, barriers, and outcomes of HIV serostatus disclosure among HIV-positive Haitians. The implications of these findings are discussed with regards to developing culturally appropriate interventions to assist PLWH in different context with the disclosure process.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8362], "author_name_tesi": "Conserve, Donaldson ", "last_name_ssi": "Conserve", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Donaldson", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary King", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa", "Shedra Amy Snipes", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary King, Dissertation Advisor", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa, Committee Member", "Shedra Amy Snipes, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HIV; disclosure; Haitians;"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "High School Employment, Dropping Out, and Early Fertility among Young Men", "id": "15668", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7996", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite previous research examining the impact of high school employment on educational attainment, academic performance, substance use, delinquency, and risky sexual behaviors, very little research has considered the impact of high school employment on early fertility; this is especially true for early fertility among males.

At the same time, the U.S. experienced a rise in nonmarital cohabitation and nonmarital childbearing that has radically changed American family structure. Despite previous research suggesting that men\u2019s economic position is important for family formation and in particular whether cohabiting couples will ultimately marry, there is a shortage of current research examining how men\u2019s educational attainment influences their family formation behaviors. Given the potential promise of professional licenses, certifications, and educational certificates, collectively known as alternate educational credentials (AECs), for promoting employment outcomes among low-skilled adults, the aim of this dissertation is to examine the role of young men\u2019s attainment of AECs in young men\u2019s family formation behaviors. Using 16 waves of data on young men participating in the 1997 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), I explore the prevalence of young men\u2019s attainment of AECs and whether earning AECs influences young men\u2019s entry to fatherhood and the relationship context in which they enter fatherhood. Overall, about one-third (35 percent) of young men in the sample earned an AEC and an additional 26 percent earned a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Respondents who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher were on average more advantaged than their peers who did not. Among those who did not earn a bachelor\u2019s degree, respondents who earned an AEC were similarly more advantaged than their peers that did not earn an AEC. I used discrete-time hazard analyses to examine the influence of earning an AEC on young men\u2019s entry to fatherhood. Logistic regression analyses revealed no statistically significant differences in the odds of entering fatherhood among those who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher or those who earned an AEC compared to those who did not earn any credential after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics, educational experiences in high school, and a range of activities including labor force participation, post-secondary enrollment, and incarceration. There were, however, differences in young men\u2019s entry to fatherhood in different relationship contexts. Young men who had earned an AEC were 23 percent more likely to father a child in a marital relationship than those who did not earn any kind of post-secondary credential, though the difference is not significant after controlling for other factors. Young men who had earned a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher were significantly less likely to father a child outside a marital relationship than those who did not earn an AEC or a bachelor\u2019s degree; they were also 23 percent more likely to father a child in a marital relationship than those who had not earned any kind of credential, though the difference is only marginally statistically significant. Other factors were significantly related to young men\u2019s entry to fatherhood, including being employed full-time and being currently enrolled in a four-year college or university. These findings suggest that training programs that lead to AECs have the potential to promote stable family formation behaviors among young men, in addition to any potential benefits in the labor market.

Most often associated with delivering advertising content (which made them infamous) online, pop-up windows are also common offline where they deliver warnings, alerts, or other system information to computer users. Yet, little is known about how pop-ups affect the processing of information in and around themselves. The present study proposes that three different mechanisms, derived from attentional spotlight, limited capacity, and affect-as-information models, could explain the effects of pop-up presence on the extent and nature of information processing on a Web page. A 2 (same vs. different pop-up location) x 2 (number of pop-ups\u2014one versus three) x 2 (pop-up content\u2014advertisements vs. factoids) factorial experiment was employed to test the above-mentioned mechanisms. Free recall and recognition of the various news stories on the Web pages where pop-ups appeared were used to indicate the extent and nature of information processing. At the same time, facial EMG, skin conductance responses and heart-rate measures were measured in order to assess the attention-getting, interruptive, and annoying nature of pop-up windows that are implied in the three mechanisms. The findings suggest that pop-ups direct users\u2019 attention towards a specific location on the screen, and that information located in their vicinity benefits from this movement of the attentional spotlight.

Separability means that the spatiotemporal covariance structure factors into the product of two functions, one depending only on space and the other only on time.  Separability is a property which can dramatically improve computational efficiency by substantially reducing model complexity.  It is especially useful for functional data as it implies that the functional principal components are the same for each spatial location.\n\nIn Chapter 1, we give a brief introduction to functional data, separability and introduce the data sets that motivate this dissertation.\n\nIn Chapter 2, we present a new methodology to test for separability of spatiotemporal functional data. We present three tests, one being a functional extension of the Monte Carlo likelihood method of Mitchell et al. (2005), while the other two are based on quadratic forms.  Our tests are based on asymptotic distributions of maximum likelihood estimators, and do not require Monte Carlo or bootstrap replications. The specification of the joint asymptotic distribution of these estimators is the main theoretical contribution in this chapter. It can be used to derive many other tests. The main methodological finding is that one of the quadratic form methods, which we call a norm approach, emerges as a clear winner in terms of finite sample performance in nearly every setting we considered.  The norm approach focuses directly on the Frobenius distance between the spatiotemporal  covariance function and its separable approximation.  We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods via simulations, and applications to Irish wind data and Nitrogen Dioxide levels on the east coast of the United States.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we derive and study a significance test for determining if a panel of functional time series is separable. In this context, separability means that the covariance structure factors into the\nproduct of two functions, one depending only on time and the other depending only on the coordinates of the panel. In this case, under the assumption of  separability, the functional principal components are the same for each member of the panel. However such an assumption must be verified before proceeding with further inference. Our approach is based on functional norm differences and provides a test with well controlled size and high power.  In addition to an asymptotic justification, our methodology is validated by a simulation\nstudy. It is applied to functional panels of particulate pollution and stock market data.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14605], "author_name_tesi": "Constantinou, Panayiotis ", "last_name_ssi": "Constantinou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Panayiotis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Logan Reimherr", "Matthew Logan Reimherr", "Michael G Akritas", "Bing Li", "John C Liechty"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Logan Reimherr, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Logan Reimherr, Committee Chair", "Michael G Akritas, Committee Member", "Bing Li, Committee Member", "John C Liechty, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Separability", "Functional data", "Space-time processes", "Functional panels"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Determination of Optimal Earth-mars Trajectories to Target the Moons of Mars", "id": "21382", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9791", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The focus of this thesis is to analyze interplanetary transfer maneuvers from Earth to Mars in order to target the Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos.

Additionally, the orbital parameters of the arrival trajectory as well as the relative required \u0394Vs and times of flights were determined in order to define the optimal departure and arrival windows for a given range of date. The first step in solving Lambert\u2019s Problem consists in finding the positions and velocities of the departure (Earth) and arrival (Mars) planets for a given range of dates. Then, by solving Lambert\u2019s problem for various combinations of departure and arrival dates, porkchop plots can be created and examined. Some of the key parameters that are plotted on porkchop plots and used to investigate possible transfer orbits are the departure characteristic energy, C3, and the arrival v\u221e. These parameters, in combination with given desired initial and final parking orbital conditions about Earth and Mars, were also used to determine the total \u0394V for the various Earth-Mars transfers. \u0394V results were used to find the necessary amount of propellant needed for the transfer maneuvers as a percentage of total spacecraft mass for a given specific impulse.

One potential solution is to offload the main rotor by compounding with a lifting wing and auxiliary propulsion system. Compound rotorcraft also feature additional control effectors (flaperons, elevators, propeller thrust, etc.), which can be used to augment control response of the aircraft. To leverage the benefits of fly-by-wire flight controls and meet flight handling qualities requirements, it is essential that controller design be incorporated early in the development process.\n\nModern handling qualities design standards, such as ADS-33E-PRF, provide specifications that can be implemented in early design phases. Predictive strategies relate signal response characteristics to desired flight handling qualities specifications, and piloted simulation verifies the results for various maneuvers called Mission Task Elements. This thesis incorporates predictive and experimental handling qualities analysis into the design of a future high-speed compound rotorcraft and its fly-by-wire flight control system. The simulated rotorcraft features a compounded wing and pusher propeller to offload the main rotor, various drag clean-ups and larger installed power to reach high forward flight speeds, and a full-authority dynamic inversion controller to optimize handling qualities.\n\nThis study focuses on the combined effect of controller and design parameter variations on handling qualities. Initial results revealed that the controller command filter parameter impacts the bandwidth of the aircraft, where increasing this parameter generally improved handling qualities for all cyclic pitch deflections. The addition of redundant controls improved handling qualities by relieving control saturation, and trends from variation of flapping hinge offset and wing/tail size were generally unclear.

Using a minority stress model, these risk and resiliency factors have been hypothesized to affect GLB youth of color in similar and unique ways based upon ethnic/racial, gender, and sexual identification group categorizations. A sample of Black, Latino, and White GLB adolescents (ages 15 to 22) from a large metropolitan area provided information on their mental health, psychosocial stressors, support systems, and social identifications at three different times across a two-year period. It was hypothesized that psychosocial stressors would negatively affect mental health outcome scores, and that youth of multiple minority statuses would demonstrate poorer mental health outcomes than youth of a single minority status. However, the influence of these stressors, and the subsequent resiliency factors, were predicted to influence mental health outcomes differently based on demographic categorizations. Finally, identity development was also predicted to influence mental health outcomes. Using mixed linear modeling analyses, it was found that multiple minority statuses do not cause more difficulties, and that stressors and resiliency factors did affect youth in different ways.

The imported methods are generally used with little or no grounding in explicit theoretical models about collaboration; the measures are very heterogeneous and not explicitly mapped onto investigated concepts. Also the overall methodology of the studies tends to be unilaterally oriented either toward naturalistic field methods or controlled laboratory methods. To date, there has been no attempt to address such deficiencies within an empirical program that incrementally investigates related research constructs.  \nThis thesis addresses the problem of constructing appropriate research methods for studying awareness and knowledge sharing (common ground) in CSCW. It presents a research program, or a sequence of related studies, as an instantiation of a new methodological approach. The approach has three characteristics: (1) Model-based: provides a mapping between conceptual models and methods; (2) Centered on group-level processes: the group is the unit of analysis and specific group processes are the focus of investigation; (3) Comprehensive in measurement: field and laboratory results are integrated and multiple measures of the same constructs are used.  \nThe first part of the program investigated activity awareness in CSCW, with pairs that performed a multi-session collaborative editing task. Drawing on the findings of a prior field study, a laboratory method was developed. A first lab study validated the laboratory method. A second lab study provided detailed measurements of activity awareness and compared the effects of two CSCW systems.  The findings confirmed that many events tend to remain unnoticed in current systems and point to specific classes of factors that affected activity awareness.\nThe second half of the program investigated common ground. The knowledge sharing process was studied in two lab studies respectively with collocated teams using a paper prototype and with distributed teams using a software prototype.  The results gave clear evidence of the increase in common ground and helped to understand the ways in which such increment occurred.

Our understanding of native HPV (NV) capsid assembly and maturation events within its natural host environment- stratifying and differentiating human epithelial tissue is lacking due to the widespread utilization of recombinant HPV particles. Recombinant particles bypass the need for stratified and differentiated tissue since they are produced via the overexpression of capsid proteins in monolayer culture. \nThe objective of this thesis was to investigate the mechanisms of NV assembly and maturation within the context of its natural host environment. Included within this thesis are novel qPCR-based assays that allow for the specific infectivity of wild-type and mutant NV to be assessed, in addition to novel techniques to assess the relative stabilities of wild-type and mutant capsids.\nRecent research suggests that recombinant, HPV pseudovirions (PsV), which are produced in monolayer culture, can undergo a redox-dependent conformational change that takes place over the course of many hours. This conformational change is dependent on the formation of disulfide bonds. It is also characterized by resistance to proteolysis and chemical reduction, and the appearance of more orderly capsid structures via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). \nIn order to understand the kinetics and mechanisms of NV assembly and maturation within stratifying and differentiating epithelial tissue, electron microscopic analysis in addition to immunohistochemical staining were performed on HPV16-infected 10, 15, and 20-day organotypic raft tissues. We found a temporal transition of NV capsids from the chemically reducing suprabasal nuclei within 10-day-old tissue to the chemically oxidizing cornified envelope within 15 and 20-day-old tissue. Importantly, we showed that stability and specific infectivity of NV extracted from 20-day-old tissue increased over that of NV extracted from 10-day-old tissue. Also, both viral DNA encapsidation and infectivity of HPV-infected tissues were redox-dependent in that they were positively manipulated via the treatment of organotypic tissues with oxidizing reagents. These effects were concentration and temporally-dependent. Conversely, both viral DNA encapsidation and infectivity of HPV-infected tissues were negatively manipulated via the treatment of organotypic tissues with the organic and inorganic antioxidants which supported a role for a tissue-spanning redox gradient in the production and stabilization of HPV capsids.  \nFurther, the redox-dependent enhancement of capsid stability and genome encapsidation was altered in HPV16 NV containing serine substitutions for the conserved L1 cysteine residues, C175, C185, and C428. We propose from these studies that a regulated assembly process occurs within stratifying and differentiating epithelial tissue whereby C185-C428 disulfide bonds form first, followed by final C175-C428 interpentameric disulfide bonds within mature, 20-day NV. \nExposure of HPV16 L2 cross-neutralizing epitopes also appeared to be temporally regulated through a redox-dependent mechanism, with 20-day native HPV16 virions being more susceptible to neutralization than 10-day virions. However, this temporal susceptibility to neutralization did not extend to native HPV31 or HPV18 virions, since they were equally susceptible to cross-neutralization at both 10 and 20-days. Further, substitution of the N-terminal conserved L2 cysteine residues, C22 and C28, for serine showed overlapping yet distinct functional roles for these residues. Substitution of either residue led to less effective neutralization of native HPV16 virions; however, C22S mutations led to a more dramatic resistance to neutralization. Conversely, whereas the C28S substitution greatly reduced the stability of 20-day capsids, 20-day native C22S virions remained as stable as wild-type.\nAs a result of work in this thesis, we hypothesize that, in the context of stratifying and differentiating human epithelial tissue, HPV may take advantage of a tissue-spanning redox gradient in order to form critical disulfide bonds necessary for assembly and maturation. We propose that initial capsid assembly occurs within the reducing environment of suprabasal nuclei through mostly hydrophobic interactions. These hydrophobic interactions are then reinforced by disulfide bonds as the virions are pushed up through the epithelial strata, into the oxidizing environment of the cornified envelope. Our studies highlight the synergy between utilizing recombinant and native papillomavirus particles to uncover novel aspects of the HPV life cycle, and provides a framework for the continued study of HPV assembly within its natural host environment.           \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4133], "author_name_tesi": "Conway, Michael James", "last_name_ssi": "Conway", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Matthew Meyers", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "Neil David Christensen", "David Joseph Spector", "Jianming Hu", "John Michael Flanagan Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig Matthew Meyers, Dissertation Advisor", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Chair", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member", "John Michael Flanagan Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Differentiation", "Redox", "Maturation", "Assembly", "Capsid", "Human Papillomavirus", "Disulfide bond"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks in Harsh Environments", "id": "15502", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7257", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Originally developed for military applications, wireless sensor networks have become an important research topic and have been adapted for numerous applications.

Team charters were diffused into engineering education as one of many instructional activities to meet the ABET accreditation mandates. However, the implementation and execution of team charters into engineering team based classes has been inconsistent and accepted without empirical evidence of the consequences. \nThe purpose of the current study was to investigate team effectiveness, operationalized as team viability, as an outcome of team charter implementation in an undergraduate engineering team based design course. Two research questions were the focus of the study: a) What is the relationship between team charter quality and viability in engineering student teams, and b) What is the relationship among team charter quality, teamwork mental model similarity, and viability in engineering student teams?\nThirty-eight intact teams, 23 treatment and 15 comparison, participated in the investigation. Treatment teams attended a team charter lecture, and completed a team charter homework assignment. Each team charter was assessed and assigned a quality score. Comparison teams did not join the lecture, and were not asked to create a team charter. All teams completed each data collection phase: a) similarity rating pretest; b) similarity posttest; and c) team viability survey. \nFindings indicate that team viability was higher in teams that attended the lecture and completed the charter assignment. Teams with higher quality team charter scores reported higher levels of team viability than teams with lower quality charter scores. Lastly, no evidence was found to support teamwork mental model similarity as a partial mediator of the team charter quality on team viability relationship.  \nFoci for future research opportunities include using: a) online data collection methods to improve participant adherence to similarity rating instructions; b) story or narratives during pre- and posttest similarity rating data collection to create common levels of contextual perception; and c) support to ensure charters are integrated into the full project life cycle, not just a pre-project one time isolated activity. \nTwenty five sections, on average, of EDSGN 100 are taught each spring and fall semester.

The researcher was interested in discovering the impact of the teacher\u2019s language with her students in learning to write. In a sociocultural perspective, learning is both social and contextual, and language is vital to constructing meaning within social interactions. The goal of this study was not to evaluate the Kid Writing program or to generalize the findings, but to inform other teachers about the role of language during writing instruction.\n\n\tA microethnographic research design was used to observe and record the details of the interactions during Kid Writing workshop. The researcher utilized ethnographic techniques of prolonged behavioral observations as well as becoming a participant observer during Kid Writing workshop. The researcher also utilized socio-linguistic techniques to analyze language and discursive practices of the behavior observed. As a microethnographic study, the researcher was particularly attentive to the discursive practices, specifically language use during writing instruction. \n\n\tData were analyzed utilizing discourse analysis methods which realized the interconnectedness of text, discourse, and context. First, the writing conversation data were analyzed by following the linguistic and thematic patterns in the language. Second, by utilizing intertextual analysis, these data findings were compared to the data collected from observations and interviews with the students, parents, and teacher. Analyses of these data provided the researcher with the thematic content of the conferences between the teacher and the students, the linguistic structure of the interaction, and the extralinguistic forms utilized during instruction.\n\n\tKid Writing, as a curriculum, was situated within the pedagogical framework of writing workshop. Writing workshop was defined and described using four models: expressionist, socio-linguistic, psycho-linguistic, and critical. The role of language by teacher and students in each model was explained. Then the Kid Writing curriculum was analyzed and positioned within these workshop models, particularly within the psycho-linguistic model.  \n\n\tThe findings revealed that the teacher used her language to build relationships within the community of Kid Writing workshop. Through her language and discursive practices, she established positive rapport with students by learning about them, by thinking out loud with them, and by conversing with them. Her language use also revealed the importance of establishing the meaning of the text and co-constructing knowledge during conference interactions. The findings revealed that this teacher used her expert discursive practices to provide a means for students to learn the language and skills necessary for school discourse.\n\n\tThe findings also revealed that the teacher pulled her students along the learning continuum to grow as writers. Through her language use the teacher noticed and named the actions and content of the text so that students could claim identities as writers. Her instructional language included utilizing questions and conditional phrases to reveal knowledge to the students as well as utilizing specific strategies to explicitly tell students information so that they could become self-sufficient writers. During Kid Writing workshop the teacher pulled her students along to become productive writers.\n\n\tThis study provides teachers with an example of how to use language and discursive practices to assist students to grow as writers. This study also situates the Kid Writing curriculum within a sociocultural perspective of learning. This study contributes to the body of knowledge about writing instruction by revealing the importance of using language both to build relationships with students and to support them as writers. At a time when public education is very content-driven, this study emphasizes the importance of the teacher as she utilizes her language to teach contextually to the needs of individual students.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1023], "author_name_tesi": "Cook, Carolyn L.", "last_name_ssi": "Cook", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Carolyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jacqueline Edmondson", "Patrick Willard Shannon", "Jamie Myers", "Susan G Strauss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jacqueline Edmondson, Committee Chair", "Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Member", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member", "Susan G Strauss, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["psycho-linguistic writing model", "socio-linguistic writing model", "expressionist writing model", "teacher language", "conferencing", "kid writing", "writing workshop", "sociocultural theory", "zone of proximal development", "teacher relationship with students"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Nutrient Management Using Compost in Organic Bell Pepper Production", "id": "17600", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8696", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fertility management in organic vegetable production systems relies on the use of non- synthetic sources such as compost, manure, and approved fertilizers.  Compost is a main source of nutrients on many organic farms.  Application recommendations for the use of compost are difficult to make because of the wide variety of feedstocks used in producing compost, and the variable effects of weather, soil type, soil microbial communities and management practices on nutrient release.  This research investigates the use of compost as a nutrient source for green bell pepper production.\nGreen bell peppers were grown in two years, using three composts: manure-food waste compost (MFWC), leaf compost (LFC), and spent mushroom compost (SMC).  The MFWC was applied at a low rate (10-13 ton/acre) and high rate (20 ton/acre).  The LFC was applied at rates to meet pepper nitrogen demand (53 and 65 ton/acre), and the SMC was applied at 15 and 18 ton/acre.  Soil tests were taken before compost application and at the end of the season to investigate changes in soil properties and nutrient levels.  Leaf tissue analysis and pre-sidedress nitrogen testing were used to monitor in-season nutrient status.  \nTreatment related differences in pepper yield, soil properties and soil nutrients were found in the first year, but not the second.  Year related factors were thought to have effected mineralization of composts and plant performance in the second year.  Soil nutrient levels were high before compost application in all treatment plots.  Applying compost to soils with high nutrient levels is unlikely to result in yield and soil differences after only one season.  Soil nitrate was below the suggested 25 mg/kg following application of some treatments over the two years of the study, but crop leaf nitrogen was normal to excessive in all treatment samples, including the unamended control.  Nitrate sufficiency levels for pepper production using black plastic mulch may be lower than levels necessary for bare ground production.\nThis study highlights the importance of compost testing for the proper application of the material, and should be regarded in combination with soil tests to determine if there are existing soil problems that would be compounded, or improved, by the application of a particular compost.  \nPumpkins grown the second year of the experiment, in the same plots as the first year peppers- with no additional nutrient amendments- had poor yields but adequate soil and leaf fertility.  Insect and disease pressure were high, and yields were poor in all plots including the control.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8565], "author_name_tesi": "Cook, Emily Klamberg", "last_name_ssi": "Cook", "middle_name_ssi": "Klamberg", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elsa Selina Sanchez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elsa Selina Sanchez, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["compost", "organic", "nutrient management", "bell pepper"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Examining the Relationship between Design Quality Indicators (DQIs) of the Built Environment and Health Status of Youth in Rural Pennsylvania", "id": "10664", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2498", "abstract_tesi": "Numerous studies have linked health (and obesity in particular) to the active living opportunities close to where people live. Moreover, it is likely that the attractiveness of the sidewalks and parks in the community also have an effect on willingness to be physically active. This study looks at the relationship between body mass index (BMI) as a measure of obesity, and thus health; neighborhood walkability; and perceived attractiveness as measured by a design quality indicators analysis (DQI).\n\nThis study is set in rural Pennsylvania. Many towns are characterized by a town morphology that has elements of design linked to walking: high density, mixed-land use, prevalence of street trees, and minimal building setbacks. Studies have found that people who walk generally have a lower BMI, and residents of walkable neighborhoods are more likely to walk. Instruments have been developed that calculate the walkability of neighborhoods based on existing infrastructure (including, for example, street connectivity and density). However, while a town may provide the physical infrastructure to walk, it may not be perceived as walkable due to safety and/or aesthetic reasons. Aesthetics, or design quality indicators (DQIs), are inherently subjective, and while there are validated instruments that include design quality factors, none focus exclusively on design quality.\n\nThis study focused first on developing an instrument to operationalize features of the built environment related to DQIs. A sample of 30 municipalities located across rural PA was selected, and the DQI Survey was utilized to assess each. BMI data for youth living within each of the sample municipalities was obtained and analyzed to examine the relationship between the DQI Survey outcomes and the BMI data. As a control, the objective walkability of each sample was also calculated through a reliable and validated Walkability Index (WI) (Frank, et al., 2006).\n\nWhile the relationship between the WI, DQI, and BMI was largely inconclusive due to the limitations resulting from the available aggregate level BMI data, there were three significant outcomes from this study: (1) focus group outcomes indicate that there are two primary motivations for walking in youth: socialization and relaxation, which are linked to preference for environmental setting: urban or natural; (2) the DQI Survey, developed through this study, is a reasonable instrument to assess design quality features of the built environment at the street scale that are linked to active living; and, (3) the preliminary categorization method utilized for sampling is an appropriate alternative to the WI, which can be time and resource intensive for rural areas lacking sufficient GIS data.\n\nThis study lays the foundation for further refinement of the DQI Survey, including further exploration of the link between BMI and WI-DQI and youth motivations for walking. This project is significant in light of the obesity epidemic in the United States, and the realization of the important role played by the built environment in facilitating or discouraging active living.

As the master circadian regulator in the body, melatonin has many physiological functions depending on its site of action. Pharmacological levels of melatonin have been reported to decrease nerve activity of medial vestibular nuclei in the rat and are associated with attenuated muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) responses to baroreceptor unloading in humans. Additionally, melatonin has been demonstrated to differentially alter blood flow to assorted vascular beds by MT1 vs. MT2 melatonin receptor activation. Therefore, the overall objective of this dissertation project was to determine the neurovascular changes elicited by exogenous and endogenous plasma melatonin levels at rest and during vestibular stimulation.\n\nThe purpose of Aim 1 and 2 (Chapter 3) was to determine if melatonin alters the vestibulosympathetic reflex (VSR) and vestibulocollic reflex (VCR) in humans. In Aim 1, MSNA, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were measured in 12 healthy subjects (28\u00b11 yr; 6 male, 6 female) during head-down rotation (HDR) before and 45 min after ingestion of either melatonin (3 mg) or placebo (sucrose). Subjects returned at least 2 days later at the same time of day to repeat the trial after ingesting the opposite drug. Melatonin increased MSNA during baseline as compared to placebo (11\u00b12 vs. 9\u00b11 bursts/min; p<0.05). However, melatonin significantly attenuated MSNA responses during HDR as compared to placebo (burst frequency: &#8710;4\u00b11 vs. &#8710;7\u00b11 bursts/min and total MSNA: &#8710;51\u00b120 and &#8710;96\u00b115%, respectively; p<0.02). In Aim 2, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) were measured in 10 healthy subjects (26\u00b11 yr; 4 male and 6 female) before and after ingestion of 3 mg melatonin. Melatonin did not alter the timing of the p13 and n23 peaks (pre-melatonin: 13.2\u00b10.4 and 21.3\u00b10.6 msec vs. post-melatonin: 13.5\u00b10.4 and 21.4\u00b10.7 msec, respectively) or the p13-n23 inter-peak amplitudes (pre-melatonin: 22.5\u00b14.6 a.u. and post-melatonin: 22.7\u00b14.6 a.u.). In summary, melatonin attenuates the VSR does not alter the VCR in humans suggesting melatonin\u2019s effect on the VSR might be mediated by the utricles.\n\nThe purpose of Aim 3 (Chapter 4) was to determine the effect of melatonin on blood flow to various vascular beds in humans. Renal (Doppler ultrasound), forearm (venous occlusion plethysmography), calf (venous occlusion plethysmography) and cerebral blood flows (transcranial Doppler), arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were measured in 10 healthy subjects (29 \u00b1 1 yr; 5 male, 5 female) while lying on a table for 3 minutes. The protocol began 45 min after the ingestion of either melatonin (3 mg) or placebo (sucrose). Subjects returned at least 2 days later at the same time of day to repeat the trial after ingesting the opposite drug. Melatonin did not alter heart rate and mean arterial pressure. Renal blood flow velocity (RBFV) and renal vascular conductance (RVC) were lower during the melatonin trial as compared to placebo (RBFV: 40 \u00b1 3 vs. 45 \u00b1 2 cm&#8901;s-1; RVC: 0.47 \u00b1 0.02 vs. 0.54 \u00b1 0.01 cm&#8901;s-1&#8901;mmHg-1, respectively). In contrast, forearm blood flow (FBF) and forearm vascular conductance (FVC) were greater with melatonin compared to placebo (FBF: 2.4 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 ml&#8901;100ml-1&#8901;min-1; FVC: 0.029 \u00b1 0.003 vs. 0.023 \u00b1 0.002 a.u., respectively). Melatonin did not alter calf or cerebral blood flow measurements compared to placebo. In summary, exogenous melatonin differentially alters vascular blood flow in humans.\n\nIncreases in sympathetic nerve activity are hypothesized to contribute to the observed circadian rhythm of adverse cardiac events. Pharmacological levels of melatonin increase MSNA at rest and attenuate reflexes involved in blood pressure regulation such as the vestibulosympathetic reflex (Aim 1). Melatonin typically increases 8-10 times over daytime concentrations during the late evening hours. The purpose of Aim 4 (Chapter 5) was to determine if MSNA at rest and the VSR follow a circadian rhythm in humans in relation to the endogenous melatonin circadian rhythm. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, calf blood flow and MSNA were measured in 9 healthy subjects (28\u00b11 yr; 5 male, 4 female) at rest and during head-down rotation. Each subject was tested around noon and 10-12 hr later that evening (day: 11:34\u00b113 min, night: 22:10\u00b15 min). MSNA at rest was significantly lower at night compared to day (8\u00b11 vs. 11\u00b12 bursts/min, respectively; P<0.05). Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were significantly increased at night compared to day (heart rate: 70\u00b14 vs. 66\u00b14 beats/min, arterial blood pressure: 91\u00b12 vs. 87\u00b11 mmHg, respectively). MSNA and cardiovascular responses to head-down rotation were not significantly altered at night compared to day (&#8710;3\u00b11 bursts/min, &#8710;25\u00b16% for MSNA and calf blood flow, respectively). The data indicate that MSNA at rest is lower during the late evening hours and exhibits a circadian rhythm whereas the vestibulosympathetic reflex is not altered by endogenous changes in melatonin. A circadian rhythm of MSNA in humans may be important for understanding the increase of adverse cardiac events in the morning hours.\n\nThe current project demonstrated that 3 mg melatonin ingestion attenuates the vestibulosympathetic reflex, increases MSNA at rest and differentially alters vascular blood flow. Additionally, we observed lower MSNA at rest at night compared to daytime. Together, these data demonstrate melatonin\u2019s multiple effects on neurovascular control in humans.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2991], "author_name_tesi": "Cook, Jonathan Sutton", "last_name_ssi": "Cook", "middle_name_ssi": "Sutton", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chester A Ray", "Chester A Ray", "Charles H Lang", "Urs Andreas Leuenberger", "David Nathan Proctor", "Stephen R Rannels"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chester A Ray, Dissertation Advisor", "Chester A Ray, Committee Chair", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Urs Andreas Leuenberger, Committee Member", "David Nathan Proctor, Committee Member", "Stephen R Rannels, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["circadian", "microneurography", "blood pressure"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Improving the synchrony of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) nitrogen release for corn (Zea mays) growth\n\n\n", "id": "9076", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2583", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Leguminous green manure legume crops can often meet much of the nitrogen (N) demand of a succeeding crop. There may be, however, an asynchrony between N mineralization from green manures and crop N uptake, resulting in substantial nitrogen loss through leaching or denitrification. In our research, we hypothesize that this synchrony can be improved by manipulating the termination date of a hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) cover crop and the sowing date of the succeeding corn (Zea mays) crop. This will regulate the quality and quantity of the N in the vetch, the rate of N mineralization from the vetch residues, and the relative rate of N uptake in the corn.  The study was located at the Russell E. Larson Agricultural Research Center in Rocks Springs, PA on Hagerstown soil. The vetch termination/corn planting dates chosen were May 4th, May 15th, and May 31st.  A 92 RM variety corn was planted into live vetch, which was then chemically terminated.  Corn fertilized with ammonium nitrate was used in order to compare yields of legume derived N with a mineral N control.  \nThe vetch biomass at termination was approximately 1500, 5000, and 7000 kg ha-1 for the May 4th, May 15th, and May 31st planting dates, respectively.  The N content of the vetch was 4% and did not vary among treatments.  The May 31st vetch treatment had higher peak soil inorganic N content in the top fifteen centimeters and greater peak N flux rates, but did not have greater corn biomass or grain yields.  The grain yields in the vetch treatments were comparable to the ammonium nitrate-fertilized grain yields, but slightly below the yield capability for the field site\u2019s soil type.  A comparison of N inputs and outputs suggests that the vetch terminated on May 31st provided excess N, the May 4th-terminated vetch was not a sufficient N source, and the May 15th vetch treatment probably achieved the best synchrony.  We anticipate that these experiments will provide help provide management guidelines to improve the N-use efficiency of green manure systems and reduce nitrogen pollution.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2576], "author_name_tesi": "Cook, Justine Cecilia", "last_name_ssi": "Cook", "middle_name_ssi": "Cecilia", "first_name_ssi": "Justine", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Paul Gallagher Iii", "Robert Paul Gallagher Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Paul Gallagher Iii, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Paul Gallagher Iii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["fertility management", "nitrogen loss", "cover crop", "green manure", "sustainable agriculture", "no till"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WORKED EXAMPLES AND PRODUCTIVE FAILURE IN LEARNING PROCEDURAL AND CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO STATISTICS", "id": "14382mac397", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14382", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In statistics instruction, strategies that promote initial student success in instruction, such as worked examples, are frequently used.  There is evidence that difficulties at the beginning of the instructional process can significantly hinder student learning, so instruction should be designed to minimize the chances of students failing (i.e., Kirschner, Sweller, & Clark, 2006).  However, other instructional paradigms, such as productive failure, have shown evidence supporting the idea that initial difficulty may actually be helpful in the learning process.  Furthermore, the use of productive failure in statistics instruction has shown evidence of greater gains for students on conceptual knowledge measures, with no loss of performance on procedural knowledge measures.  However, both worked examples and productive failure have usually been compared to direct instruction or some other variation of a control condition of instruction.  There is little available research that has directly compared these strategies, either in statistics instruction or other content areas. This study examines the interaction between instruction type (worked examples and productive failure) and knowledge learners acquire (procedural and conceptual knowledge) in the instruction of basic statistics.  This interaction is examined at both immediate and delayed posttests.  Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to address these research questions.  This study contributes to the literature by examining whether an instruction by knowledge interaction occurs in statistics instruction on both immediate and delayed posttests, which has not been investigated in previous research.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14777], "author_name_tesi": "Cook, Michael Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Cook", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peggy Noel Van Meter", "Peggy Noel Van Meter", "Rayne Audrey Sperling", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich", "Roy Clariana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peggy Noel Van Meter, Dissertation Advisor", "Peggy Noel Van Meter, Committee Chair", "Rayne Audrey Sperling, Committee Member", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich, Committee Member", "Roy Clariana, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["statistics instruction", "worked examples", "productive failure", "procedural knowledge", "conceptual knowledge", "cognitive load"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Inhibition of Pythium spp. and suppression of Pythium blight and anthracnose with phosphonate fungicides  \n", "id": "9954", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4896", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Turfgrass diseases are a limiting factor in the maintenance of turfgrasses.  Most diseases can be managed using an integrated program of cultural practices, resistant species and cultivars, and fungicides.  One option for the integrated control of Pythium blight [Pythium aphanidermatum (Edson) Fitzp. and other Pythium spp.] and anthracnose diseases [Colletotrichum cereale Manns (Crouch, Clarke and Hillman)] of turfgrasses is the use of phosphonate fungicides.  Phosphonate compounds are composed of the salts and esters of phosphorous acid [HPO(OH)2] and are formulated as fungicides and fertilizers.  Phosphonate fungicides suppress Pythium blight and anthracnose diseases when applied preventatively, but efficacy may vary with product, rate and timing of application, and host species.  \nThe objectives of this study were to assess the inhibitory effects of phosphorous acid on Pythium spp. and C. cereale in vitro, and determine if active ingredient and formulation of phosphonate fungicides provide similar levels of Pythium blight suppression on perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) and anthracnose basal rot on an annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) putting green when applied at equivalent rates of phosphorous acid. \nPhosphorous acid EC50 values for P. aphanidermatum isolates ranged from 35.6 to 171.8 \u00b5g ml-1.  EC50 values for isolates of six other Pythium spp. were between 38.7 and 220.8 \u00b5g ml-1.  None of the C. cereale isolates used in the in vitro study were inhibited by phosphorous acid concentrations up to 1000 \u00b5g ml-1, and growth of two isolates increased slightly with increasing concentrations of phosphorous acid.\nIn 2004 and 2005, all phosphonate treatments provided significant suppression of Pythium blight symptoms on creeping bentgrass and perennial ryegrass relative to the untreated control.  No differences in percentage of blighted turf occurred among phosphonate treatments when applied at equivalent rates of phosphorous acid in either year of the study, regardless of active ingredient, formulation, or turfgrass species.  \nOf the phosphonate treatments included in the anthracnose study, fosetyl Al formulated with a blue-green pigment provided the most consistent and highest degree of anthracnose symptom suppression over two growing seasons.  The fact that fosetyl Al/pigment suppressed anthracnose symptoms and a formulation of fosetyl Al without the pigment did not when applied at the same rate of active ingredient, indicates that formulation differences may account for the improved anthracnose control.  The only other phosphonate treatment that provided suppression of anthracnose was a non-commercial potassium phosphite solution with no formulation enhancements, but this only occurred in 2005 and was less effective than fosetyl Al/pigment.  All phosphonate treatments improved turfgrass quality relative to the untreated control, but fosetyl Al/pigment showed the highest quality ratings over both growing seasons.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4873], "author_name_tesi": "Cook, Phillip Joshua", "last_name_ssi": "Cook", "middle_name_ssi": "Joshua", "first_name_ssi": "Phillip", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Landschoot", "Peter Landschoot"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Landschoot, Thesis Advisor", "Peter Landschoot, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Colletotrichum cereale", "fosetyl aluminum", "potassium phosphite"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Heart Rate Zones and High Intensity Interval Training in Collegiate Women Soccer Athletes", "id": "22763", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10489", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soccer is the world\u2019s most popular sport and is growing in the United States.  Women\u2019s college soccer exemplifies this growth, where during the same period of time participation has more than tripled.  There are now over 25,000 athletes representing 1,000 NCAA women\u2019s soccer teams on a yearly basis.  NCAA rules, specifically regarding substitutions and the chronological proximity of competitions, make it different than any other league in the world.  The majority of research efforts have quantified the physiological demands and performance determinants at various levels in men\u2019s soccer.  Recent studies have focused on similar variables in women\u2019s soccer at the professional level in Europe.  Women\u2019s soccer in general, and American college soccer in particular, is still vastly underrepresented in the soccer literature.  First, this thesis seeks to quantify the training load (TL) of NCAA women\u2019s soccer athletes through 13 weeks of the competitive season.  Training load is defined here as exercise intensity as measured by mean heart rate and time spent in the top two heart rate zones \u2013 85-89% and 90-100% of peak heart rate.  There is a significant difference in intensity between games and training sessions resulting in dissimilarity in TL between starters and nonstarters through the season.  In addition, there is a difference in mean heart rate and distribution of time spent in each heart rate zone in starters between games played within 48 hours.  And finally, there is a decrease in time in the highest heart rate zone in games as the season progresses.  Next, training status, defined as body composition and VO2peak, is evaluated before and after a 6-week offseason high intensity interval training intervention.  Time in the 85-100% heart rate zones, with this method of conditioning, correlates with improvements in training status.  Therefore, HIIT may be an effective protocol in a well-trained college athlete cohort to maximize competition performance and minimize training time.  In short, this thesis provides benchmarks for NCAA soccer athletes as well as coaches with implications for training methods and protocols.
