Various studies to date have found circumstantial evidence linking contrails with modifications in surface temperature (e.g., in the eastern U.S. and parts of Europe). It is clearly important to understand what a contrail is and where and when contrails occur to more definitively relate their occurrence to surface climate. The use of surface observations for developing contrail climatology is problematic, owing to the occurrence of intervening cloud layers.\nAccordingly, satellite images have been used to identify and map contrails, mostly from manual (subjective) interpretation of images, although some automated (quantitative) approaches have been developed but whose success is variable and dependent on a number of factors (Cirrus clouds, curved contrails, complexity of algorithm, etc.) Detecting contrails, therefore, is critical in understanding the atmospheric effects of aviation.\nThis research involves the automatic detection of jet contrails in Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery with a high degree of confidence and its segmentation written in MATLAB programming language. Contrails are characterized as thin, nearly straight linear features of higher intensity than the background. Contrails possess another highly characteristic feature; they tend to create straight lines in satellite images. Due to the large volume of satellite imagery, selecting contrail images for study by hand is impractical and highly subject to human error. It is far better to have a system in place that will automatically evaluate an image to determine whether it contains contrails and where. This research develops and tests two new and easier quantitative approaches to find contrails in satellite image data, for a variety of atmospheric and cloud conditions (e.g., clear-skies, partly cloudy skies; cloudy skies).", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9236], "author_name_tesi": "Padmanabhan, Viveknarayanan ", "last_name_ssi": "Padmanabhan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Viveknarayanan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Mark Carleton", "Timothy Joseph Kane", "William Evan Higgins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Mark Carleton, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy Joseph Kane, Thesis Advisor", "William Evan Higgins, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Contrail", "AVHRR", "Line detection", "segmentation", "Hough Transform"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Cyclic and Radial Variation of Ultrasonic Backscatter from Flowing Porcine Blood\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "5977", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1659", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ultrasonic backscattering from flowing blood was investigated using several hemodynamic parameters and a physiological parameter. An emphasis was placed on the cyclic variation of the backscattering power and the origin and mechanisms responsible for it. Acceleration was hypothesized to enhance the aggregation of red blood cells (RBCs), and this is the first time that acceleration is suggested and experimentally verified as having an effect on aggregation of RBC. Two interesting phenomena, the \u2018Black Hole (BH)\u2019 phenomenon and the \u2018Bright Collapsing Ring (BCR)\u2019 phenomenon, were observed under pulsatile flow in B-mode cross sectional images. The BH phenomenon describes a dark hypoechoic hole at the center of the tube surrounded by a bright hyperechoic zone in B-mode cross sectional images, and the BCR phenomenon describes the appearance of a bright hyperechoic ring at the periphery of the tube at early systole and its convergence from the periphery to the center of the tube, finally collapsing as flow develops. These two phenomena were analyzed by the RBC aggregation due to the combined effects of the shear rate and acceleration, and this analysis could provide an integrated explanation of the cyclic and radial variation of the backscattered power.\n\nThe origin of the Doppler power variation was investigated using a 10 MHz pulsed Doppler system with a single element transducer from three different fluid media: a rigid polystyrene microsphere solution, deformable porcine RBC suspension, and aggregating porcine whole blood. The Doppler power variation was observed only from porcine whole blood, which led to a conclusion that the ultrasonic backscattering was mainly dependent on the RBC aggregation under steady and pulsatile flow. The pattern of the cyclic variation of the Doppler power to have a maximum power at peak systole was mainly due to the enhanced rouleaux formation by acceleration. The BCR phenomenon was observed from the cyclic variation pattern of the Doppler power at different radial positions; the Doppler power peak was observed at early systole at the periphery of the tube and lagged the flow as close from the periphery to the center of the tube. The BH phenomenon from the Doppler power measurements was also observed during some parts of a cycle.\n\nThe BCR phenomenon from porcine whole blood in a mock flow loop was further examined in real time in B-mode images under pulsatile flow. The BCR phenomenon was found to be dependent on the flow speed, stroke rate and hematocrit, but independent on the transducer frequency from 9 to 13 MHz. The BCR phenomenon was stronger as systolic peak speed at the center of the tube increased from 10 to 25 cm/s, and as stroke rate decreased from 60 to 20 BPM. At low hematocrit of 12 %, no BCR phenomenon was discernable although it was observed at higher hematocrits. The pattern of the nonlinear relationship between echogenicity and hematocrit varied with radial positions. The BH phenomenon was also observed under certain hemodynamic conditions and varied over a pulsatile cycle. The BCR phenomenon was also observed from human carotid arteries from 10 subjects only in the harmonic images.\n\nIn order to better understand these phenomena, the cyclic and radial variation of echogenicity under oscillatory flow was measured and the results showed a different pattern from that under pulsatile flow. The echogenicity at the center of the tube was enhanced during acceleration and degraded during deceleration, while the expansion and collapse of the \u2018bright ring\u2019 was observed twice per cycle. The cyclic and radial variation of echogenicity was dependent on stroke volume, stroke rate, mean steady flow added to the pure oscillatory flow, and transducer angle. The rouleaux distribution and orientation across the tube during flow acceleration were proposed based on the experimental results of the transducer angle, reaching a maximum of the echogenicity variation at about 25\u00b0. The cyclic variation of echogenicity was also observed from the porcine RBC suspensions, independent of the transducer angle and stroke rate but changed with the mean steady flow added to the pure oscillatory flow. The strong variation of echogenicity from oscillatory flow seemed to be caused by the rouleaux formation in addition to the echogenicity variations from one cell based deformation of RBC suspensions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1645], "author_name_tesi": "Paeng, Dong-Guk ", "last_name_ssi": "Paeng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dong-Guk", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["K Kirk Shung", "Nadine Barrie Smith", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "John Michael Tarbell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["K Kirk Shung, Committee Chair", "Nadine Barrie Smith, Committee Member", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member", "John Michael Tarbell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["red cell aggregation", "ultrasonic backscatter", "Black Hole", "Bright Collapsing Ring", "shear rate", "cyclic variation", "acceleration"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Synthesizing modern child and infant anthropometry for design", "id": "14193", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7125", "abstract_tesi": "The most recent comprehensive study of child (2.00 to 18.99 years of age) and infant (birth to 1.99 years of age) anthropometry (body size) was performed by Snyder et al. in 1977 at the University of Michigan.  For over 30 years, this dataset has been the primary source of anthropometry in the design of products, environments, and safety standards for infants and children.  Since 1977, the United States has seen large increases in the prevalence of overweight and obesity, compromising the distributions of anthropometric measurements in infants and children and slowly decreasing the accuracy of the 1977 dataset.\n\nThis research aims to synthesize (predict) accurate datasets of modern child and infant anthropometry for use in design.  Relationships between anthropometric variables were successfully extracted from the Snyder et al. datasets through the use of principal component analysis, data weighting based on demographics, and other statistical techniques, and were applied to predictor anthropometry from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset.  The methodology developed for this work generates detailed anthropometry for thousands of stature and body mass index pairs for children and infants in NHANES from 1999-2008 to create a virtual population.

This study builds upon Bolino (2007) in order to identify the extent to which the international assignment has the potential for individual career development. I identify four major themes that address organizational and individual goals during expatriate assignments: 1) International assignments address organizational goals, 2) the nature of international assignments and its potential to impact career development, 3) successful repatriation for career development, and 4) training and development to ensure successful completion of the assignment. A qualitative analysis conducted on the interview responses obtained from global mobility managers in a professional service firm validates these propositions. The results also indicate a unique approach adopted by the organization in order to provide international experience based on individual preferences, even when these deployments are not strategically tied to organizational goals.

Apoapsis orbit raising, in particular, takes a spacecraft from a circular orbit to an elliptical orbit by thrusting at a periapsis. This technique was applied as the initial stage for the lunar (LADEE), GEO (ARTEMIS), and interplanetary (Mangalyaan) missions to save propellant usage and raise the apoapsis distance of the orbits. These projects show that the apoapsis orbit raising can be applied to various types of missions.\nIn this thesis, by applying the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to the five finite thrust maneuvers, evaluation of an optimal solution that derives optimized propellant usage is presented. Each transfer orbit pushes out the apoapsis of the trajectory, depending on the thrust duration and the thrust-on location. The final orbit of the optimal solution of the problem should meet two criteria: the line of apside (LOA) alignment and the apoapsis distance.\nThe PSO is a computational method that is inspired by a swarm movement. By sharing information obtained by each member, the entire swarm (set of possible solutions) can find the best location efficiently and rapidly. This algorithm highly depends on size of a swarm and number of iterations as well as an initial solution set. In this thesis, a modification is applied to the PSO to handle equality constraints.\nThe PSO application to apoapsis orbit raising shows the feasibility of determining an optimized trajectory to reach a target orbit and gives required propellant for each maneuver in terms of a thrust duration.

The results of most of these studies have consistently shown that distributed practice schedules result in higher retention rates than massed practice schedules because of the spacing effect associated with human memory. These studies, however, failed to show either the optimal interval between learning sessions, or to consider the knowledge types used to perform tasks. Furthermore, these studies did not provide any theoretical supports except the spacing effect for predicting performance at the specific time of the schedules. To address these problems, I explored both theoretically and empirically. First, I investigated ACT-R\u2019s learning and forgetting theories to help identify an optimal practice schedule. Second, psychological experiments were conducted to validate these theories. In the experiments, four kinds of tasks were tested using four practice schedules (distributed, massed, Hybrid1, and Hybrid2). Finally, models were developed using ACT-R, and then compared with empirical data.\nACT-R\u2019s learning theories suggest that hybrid practice schedules (schedules consisting of distributed and massed practice) could produce better performance than an exclusively distributed practice schedule. The results of empirical data indicated a more complex picture. Like previous studies, the results of experiments showed a higher correlation between retention and distributed practice schedules than retention and massed practice schedules. There were, however, no significant differences between distributed and hybrid practice schedules when testing a declarative memory task. Nevertheless, the results also suggested that some hybrid schedules might produce better performance than distributed practice schedules for perceptual-motor skills. Specifically, my results show that the Hybrid1 practice schedule produced greater skill retention than the distributed practice schedule for the perceptual-motor task, indicating that the spacing of distributed and massed practiced with respect to each other also influences performance. \nWhen comparing the ACT-R models\u2019 performance with that of the participants\u2019, the models could predict the learning and forgetting trends of the participants in each group for declarative memory tasks; however, there were differences in the correct responses between the models\u2019 prediction and the human data. These results indicated that ACT-R could be used to predict the learning and forgetting trends of practice schedules, however, revisions might be necessary to fully map the models\u2019 predictions to the participants\u2019 specific responses. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3275], "author_name_tesi": "Paik, Jaehyon ", "last_name_ssi": "Paik", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jaehyon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Frank Edward Ritter", "Frank Edward Ritter", "David Arthur Nembhard", "Andris Freivalds", "Ling Rothrock", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Frank Edward Ritter, Dissertation Advisor", "Frank Edward Ritter, Committee Chair", "David Arthur Nembhard, Committee Chair", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cognitive Modeling", "Effective Training Schedules"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Aeroelastic Stability Improvements of Soft-Inplane Tiltrotors By Active and Passive Approaches\n", "id": "9887", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3212", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soft-inplane tiltrotors in cruise mode have exhibited unacceptably low subcritical damping in the wing vertical bending mode as well as reduced critical whirl-flutter speed. However, soft-inplane rotor system is highly advantageous over stiff-inplane rotor system in terms of inplane dynamic hub loads which results in weight/performance penalties. Therefore, ensuring adequate aeroelastic stability characteristics is a prerequisite for soft-inplane rotor system to be used in future advanced tiltrotors. This dissertation constitutes fundamental studies of soft-inplane tiltrotors and appropriate methods to alleviate whirl-flutter instability. This study consists of four major investigations. The first investigation includes validation efforts of present analytical model against the recently available data for the Bell generic semi-span model in airplane mode and the SASIP model in hover mode. The second investigation addresses the approaches which have been employed to establish a physical understanding of the very low sub-critical damping phenomenon, which is consistently exhibited by soft-inplane tiltrotor configurations. Through analyses and comparison studies mainly between the Bell generic soft- and stiff-inplane semi-span models, the physics behind this phenomenon is emphasized. In the third investigation, parametric studies and design optimization of the rotor/wing design variables are performed in order to passively improve the whirl stability boundaries. For the last investigation, the effectiveness of active control through wing-flaperon and swashplate control inputs is examined in terms of stability improvement of soft-inplane tiltrotors. Scheduled gain and constant gain controllers are first compared for each actuation scheme and then output feedback controllers based on easily measurable wing states are compared with full-state feedback controllers. The baseline soft-inplane configurations used in passive and active studies are the full-scale Boeing Model 222 and the Bell generic soft-inplane semi-span model, which employ hingeless and gimballed hub respectively.

This study makes both conceptual and empirical contributions to the race-crime literature. Conceptually, the macro-social framework is extended to study the structural correlates of Native American violent offending, a phenomenon which has gone understudied in prior macro-social race-crime research. \n     Empirically, recent California arrest data are used to extend previous research on Native American criminality in several important ways. First, by examining the structural correlates of Native American violent offending, the study goes beyond previous Native American criminality research which has focused almost exclusively on violent victimization. Second, the robustness of findings are assessed across different measures of violent offending (violent index arrests and robbery arrests) and across different analytic techniques (ordinary least squares and negative binomial regression). Third, California census places are used as a unique ecological unit which provides advantages for examining Native American violent crime. Fourth, both discrete indicators of disadvantage and a structural disadvantage index are used to examine the impact of disadvantage on Native American violent crime. Fifth, the study examines whether the relationship between structural disadvantage and Native American violent crime varies across two different analytic samples: a single-race sample comprised of census places that have at least 900 single-race Native Americans (i.e. individuals who report being only Native American) versus an overall sample comprised of census places that have at least 1000 individuals who are either single-race or mixed-race Native Americans (i.e. individuals who report being only Native American or individuals who are Native American combined with one or more races). \n     The study\u2019s findings are mixed with regard to the effect of structural disadvantage on rates of violent crime among Native Americans. Although structural disadvantage leads to increases in Native American robbery arrest rates, it has trivial effects on Native American overall violence for the overall sample (i.e. sample of communities defined by population counts of individuals who are either single-race or mixed-race Native Americans). Furthermore, the strength of the relationship between structural disadvantage and Native American violent crime is largely contingent upon the racial specification of the analytic sample used-i.e., structural disadvantage exerts a stronger impact on overall violence for the single-race sample than for the overall sample.

The primary objective of this dissertation is to examine how the link between immigration and crime is contextualized by immigrant destination types and the race/ethnicity of offenders. Specifically, I examine (a) if the effects of immigration on crime differ depending on whether the movement of Latino immigrants is into established as compared to emerging immigrant communities and (b) whether immigration\u2019s effects vary by the race/ethnicity of the offender (White, Black, Latino).

Specifically, using samples of established and emerging destinations, I examine whether there are racial/ethnic differences in the way that structural disadvantage and indicators of social disorganization (i.e. residential instability, racial/ethnic heterogeneity, population density) impact group rates of violence. \n     To address these issues my study draws on a strong theoretical and empirical framework. Theoretically, my study merges theories of immigration and crime (also race and crime) with sociological perspectives that link social change to racial/ethnic stratification. Empirically, I address the above objectives using race/ethnicity-specific (e.g. White, Black, Latino) arrest data on violent crime from the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and the crime reporting programs of California, New York, and Texas linked with census place structural characteristics from the 2000 census.  I examine the effects of structural factors on crime at the census place-level with a full set of census places (N=528) and with samples of both established (N=297) and emerging destinations (N=117).  I use two measures of crime, an expressive violence index (sum of assaults and homicides) which captures violence that typically arises out of disputes, and robbery, a form of violence that is financially motivated. Seemingly Unrelated Regression is used to compare the effects of structural factors on violence across racial/ethnic groups. \n     Two important findings emerge from the immigration analyses. First, in general, immigration has small or trivial effects on violence and this pattern holds across most comparisons, including most destination and race/ethnicity specific models. Second, despite the general pattern of immigration having small or trivial effects, the immigration-crime link is contextualized to some extent by immigrant destination type and by race/ethnicity. The most notable contextualization is moderate to strong crime-generating effects of immigration on Black robbery and Latino robbery in emerging destinations.  These findings suggest that when examining the effect immigration has on crime it is important to account for both the immigrant destination type and the race/ethnicity of the offender. \n     There are two key findings from the racial invariance analyses. First, for the full set of communities, structural disadvantage is associated with higher rates of violence for each racial/ethnic group, but the effects are significantly stronger for some groups compared to others.  Second, conclusions regarding racial invariance vary somewhat depending on the destination type under study. In both established and emerging destinations, structural disadvantage is associated with higher rates of violence for Whites, Blacks, and Latinos. However, there are more differences (i.e. a greater number of statistically significant differences) in the way structural disadvantage impacts groups in established destinations than in emerging destinations. In established destinations, the effects of disadvantage are more likely to vary across groups, having stronger effects on one group compared to another (e.g. disadvantage has stronger effects on Blacks than Whites). In emerging destinations, the magnitude of the effects of disadvantage are more likely to be statistically similar across groups. Because there are more differences in the effects of structural disadvantage on violence in established destinations, there is less support for the racial invariance hypothesis in established destinations than in emerging destinations. All in all, my dissertation finds that the geographic diversification of immigrant populations to emerging destinations has important implications for the links between immigration and crime and between structural disadvantage and racial/ethnic disparities in crime, with immigrant destination types shaping how these structural factors impact crime.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8740], "author_name_tesi": "Painter-Davis, Noah ", "last_name_ssi": "Painter-Davis", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Noah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier, Dissertation Advisor", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Committee Chair", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer, Committee Member", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["immigration", "crime", "immigrant destination types", "race/ethnicity"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Transition as Condition: Toward Flood Resilience Through Flexible Architecture", "id": "21113", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9703", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Flooding is increasingly becoming an inevitable reality affecting communities around the globe. Following current urban planning and landscape design approaches, which challenge the exclusive application of hard-infrastructure projects and advocate the implementation of urban environments \u2018making room for the water,\u2019 architects propose solutions able to withstand the pressures exerted by flooding. This thesis focuses on these strategies, analyzing contemporary residential architecture for the floodplain, aiming to create a catalog of ideas for the design of houses better suited to cope with flooding. It also intends to unveil a paradigm shift in architecture, from the conceptualization of static structures, toward the design of flexible solutions that accept and incorporate the transitory condition established by floodwaters in the production of residential design. The thesis presents the systematic analysis of twelve residential case studies located in the Netherlands, the United States, and the United Kingdom, exploring emergent built forms able to cope with flooding through structures that are raised, buoyant and/or permeable. Each house was analyzed through a set of parameters (Site, Structure, Skin, Program, Infrastructure, and Furniture), which allowed for the examination of architectural elements in each design and their later comparison. The analysis shows that flexibility becomes a crucial component in the establishment of flood resilient architecture. It also concludes that, in order to sustain the daily lives and minimize the disruption of affected populations, architects must design houses able to physically withstand flooding, at the same time guaranteeing the continuous provision of access and utilities for their inhabitants. Furthermore, the research has unveiled that architecture for flooding generates unique housing typologies able to influence the way populations inhabit space. The dissimilarities between proposed and implemented case-studies additionally point to the fact that flood resilience can only be attained through the implementation of strategies at various scales, which are contingent to well integrated planning practices and building codes regulating development in floodplains.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9457], "author_name_tesi": "Paiva Henrique, Karen ", "last_name_ssi": "Paiva Henrique", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Karen", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ute Poerschke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ute Poerschke, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["architecture", "flooding", "resilience", "design analysis", "flexible architecture"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Tariff Reduction and Global Demand Growth on the U.S. Dairy Industry\n\n", "id": "8335", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4531", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this study was to measure the impact of proposed Doha Round tariff reductions on the U.S. and global dairy industry.

The results of the tariff reduction scenario on the U.S. and world dairy market indicate that over-quota tariff reductions reduce supplies of cheese and whole dry milk and raise world prices. However, this is not true for global butter prices which decline relative to the baseline due to greater EU supplies and greater U.S. imports. The EU shifts milk components away from cheese to butter production, thus increasing butter supply on the world market. One implication of this is that tariff reductions for the EU would cause it to reduce intervention prices or reduce milk quota levels in order to prevent an increase in butter production and increased use of export restitution payments.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4500], "author_name_tesi": "Pajic, Mirjana ", "last_name_ssi": "Pajic", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mirjana", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth W Bailey", "David Blandford"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth W Bailey, Thesis Advisor", "David Blandford, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["tariff reduction", "dairy trade", "simulation model"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A CROSS-LINGUISTIC AND CROSS-CULTURAL ANALYSIS OF TASTE, FOOD, COOKING, AND INTERACTION IN A CORPUS OF TELEVISION COOKING SHOWS FROM ROMANIA AND THE U.S. \n", "id": "12520", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "52", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines how language and culture are performed in a corpus of selected television cooking show discourse from Romania and the US.  More specifically, this study offers a micro- and macro-level linguistic analysis of two television cooking shows from the US, 30 Minute Meals and The Essence of Emeril, and two from Romania, The Recipe from Home and I Eat Therefore I Am; both the US and the Romanian television corpus include one male and one female host.  The US shows are among the most popular cooking programs on contemporary television, while the Romanian shows constitute the first food programs ever produced in Romanian. \nThe present study is the first linguistic anthropological study that investigates how culture and stance-taking, or socio-culturally determined attitudes, are constituted in television cooking show discourse.  Drawing on scholarly work from anthropology (e.g., Mannheim and Tedlock, 1995), sociology (Bourdieu, 1997; 1990; 1991), and linguistic anthropology (Ochs & Schieffelin, 1989; Besnier, 1990; K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen, 2006; Du Bois, 2007), I argue that culture and stance are intrinsically connected, and that a nuanced understanding of US and Romanian cultural frames expressed in cooking show discourse requires an analysis of stance-taking linguistic features.  In this dissertation, I focus on two types of discursive stance-taking, affective stance (Ochs, 1996) and interactional stance (K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen, 2006; Du Bois, 2007), and on how they both reflect and construct cultural patterns in television cooking show discourse.   \nMore specifically, using Ochs\u2019 (1996) and Silverstein\u2019s (2003) indexicality principle, I analyze affective stances towards taste and their indexical meanings in television cooking show discourse to understand cross-linguistic and cross-cultural differences and similarities, as well as gender-specific characteristics of affective stance towards taste in this media genre.  I also appeal to Goffman\u2019s constructs of the presentation of self (Goffman, 1959), frame analysis (Goffman, 1974), and footing (Goffman, 1981), to examine stance and interaction in television cooking show discourse from the two countries, and how such interactions point to the construction of several host roles.  Lastly, I use Silverstein\u2019s indexical order (2003) concept to understand how particular instantiations of stance, taste, affect, and interaction in the selected corpus have meaning within the broader Romanian and US cultural context.  \nAs the first discourse-analytic study on Romanian media, and the only discourse- analytic study of television cooking show discourse in the US, this analysis contributes to a more nuanced understanding of how everyday discursive patterns (in this case, via the medium of television) relate to cultural patterns in general, and those in Romanian and US cultures in particular.  For instance, this study provides evidence not only of differences with regard to affect and interaction between US and Romanian cultures\u2014consistent with traditional \u201ccontrastive\u201d or dichotomous views of the differences between Western and Eastern cultures--but also illustrates discursive similarities between the two sets of cultural artifacts, that call for re-examination and questioning of such dichotomous schemata. Furthermore, this dissertation study illustrates the creation of cultural personae of television cooking show hosts through micro- and macro-level linguistic features, and shows how their popularity is at least partly a feature of their stance-taking process towards taste, affect, and interaction.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [53], "author_name_tesi": "Pajtek, Alina C.", "last_name_ssi": "Pajtek", "middle_name_ssi": "C.", "first_name_ssi": "Alina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Meredith Christine Doran", "Meredith Christine Doran", "Robert William Schrauf", "Celeste S Kinginger", "Steve L Thorne", "Matthew Frank Jordan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Meredith Christine Doran, Dissertation Advisor", "Meredith Christine Doran, Committee Chair", "Robert William Schrauf, Committee Chair", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Member", "Steve L Thorne, Committee Member", "Matthew Frank Jordan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["linguistic anthropology", "discourse analysis", "Romanian television cooking shows", "U.S. television cooking shows"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Effect of Changing Injection Water Salinity on Oil Recovery from Oil-wet Carbonate Rocks ", "id": "27292", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11934", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Experimental studies and some field applications have shown that tuning the salinity of the injected water can affect oil recovery from water flooding. Most of the available literature has dedicated efforts to investigate the effect of low salinity water injection, especially for sandstone. Further studies on carbonate rocks also proved that low salinity effect might be observed for carbonate rocks as well. The main mechanism for the improved oil recovery from low salinity water flooding has been attributed to wettability alteration. The purpose of this work is to further investigate the effect of water salinity on oil recovery from oil-wet carbonate rocks.  A series of core flood experiments were performed in the laboratory to measure and compare oil recovery from increasing and decreasing salinity floods at room temperature. Selected carbonate cores were aged with synthetic oil at 100 \u00baC for 12 days prior to core flooding. Contact angles were measured on pre-aged and post-aged core slices to validate aging procedure and oil-wet conditions. Both, increasing and decreasing salinity floods showed measurable recovery gains in the secondary and tertiary modes compared with initial floods. In case of increasing water salinity, 1.3% and 0.6% additional recoveries were obtained while in the case of decreasing water salinity, additional recoveries were 0.6% and 0.7%, all in terms of original oil in place in the core. Results suggest that the system disturbance caused by the change in injection water salinity may have a greater influence on oil recovery than wettability alteration under the laboratory conditions tested.

Radiation calculations for such problems require accurate, robust, and computationally efficient models for the solution of radiative transfer equation (RTE), and spectral properties of radiation. One more layer of complexity is added in predicting the overall heat transfer in turbulent combustion systems due to nonlinear interactions between turbulent fluctuations and radiation. The present work is aimed at the development of finite volume-based high-accuracy thermal radiation modeling, including spectral radiation properties in order to accurately capture turbulence{radiation interactions (TRI) and predict heat transfer in turbulent combustion systems correctly and efficiently. \n\nThe turbulent fluctuations of temperature and chemical species concentrations have strong effects on spectral radiative intensities, and TRI create a closure problem when the governing partial differential equations are averaged. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to take TRI into account. Among these attempts the most promising approaches are the probability density function (PDF) methods, which can treat nonlinear coupling between turbulence and radiative emission exactly, i.e., \"emission TRI\". The basic idea of the PDF method is to treat physical variables as random variables and to solve the PDF transport equation stochastically. The actual reacting flow field is represented by a large number of discrete stochastic particles each carrying their own random variable values and evolving with time. The mean value of any function of those random variables, such as the chemical source term, can be evaluated exactly by taking the ensemble average of particles. The local emission term belongs to this class and thus, can be evaluated directly and exactly from particle ensembles. However, the local absorption term involves interactions between the local particle and energy emitted by all other particles and, hence, cannot be obtained from particle ensembles directly. To close the nonlinear coupling between turbulence and absorption, i.e., \"absorption TRI\", an optically thin fluctuation approximation can be applied to virtually all combustion problems and obtain acceptable accuracy.\n\nIn the present study a composition-PDF method is applied, in which only the temperature and the species concentrations are treated as random variables. A closely coupled hybrid finite-volume/Monte Carlo scheme is adopted, in which the Monte Carlo method is used to solve the composition-PDF for chemical reactions and the finite volume method is used to solve for the flow field and radiation. Spherical harmonics method-based finite volume solvers (P-1 and P-3) are developed using the data structures of the high fidelity open-source code flow software OpenFOAM. Spectral radiative properties of the participating medium are modeled using full-spectrum k-distribution methods. Advancements of basic k-distribution methods are performed for nongray nonhomogeneous gas- and particulate-phase (soot, fuel droplets, ash, etc.) participating media using multi-scale and multi-group based approaches. These methods achieve close-to benchmark line-by-line (LBL) accuracy in strongly inhomogeneous media at a tiny fraction of LBL's computational cost. A portable spectral module is developed, which includes all the basic to advanced k-distribution methods along with the precompiled accurate and compact k-distribution databases. The\nP-1 /P-3 RTE solver coupled with the spectral module is used in conjunction with the combined Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and composition-PDF-based turbulence-chemistry solver to investigate TRI in multiphase turbulent combustion systems.\n\nThe combustion solvers developed in this study is employed to simulate several turbulent jet flames, such as Sandia Flame D, and artificial nonsooting and sooting flames derived from Flame D. The effects of combustion chemistry, radiation and TRI on total heat transfer and pollutant (such as NOx) generation are studied for the above flames. The accuracy of the overall combustion solver is assessed by comparing it with the experimental data for Flame D. Comparison of the accuracy and the computational cost among various spectral models and RTE solvers is extensively done on the artificial flames derived from Flame D to demonstrate the necessity of accurate modeling of radiation in combustion problems.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2141], "author_name_tesi": "Pal, Gopalendu ", "last_name_ssi": "Pal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gopalendu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael F Modest", "Michael F Modest", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Stephen R Turns", "Deborah A Levin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael F Modest, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael F Modest, Committee Chair", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Chair", "Stephen R Turns, Committee Member", "Deborah A Levin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["k-distribution methods", "radiation transport equation", "turbulence-radiation interactions", "nonpremixed jet flames", "spectral model"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "MAXIMUM ENTROPY AND IMPROVED ITERATIVE SCALING FOR CLASSIFICATION ON MIXED SPACES, ENSEMBLE CLASSIFICATION AND EXTENSIONS.\n", "id": "7404", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5859", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Improved iterative scaling (IIS) is an algorithm for learning\nmaximum entropy (ME) joint and conditional probability models,\nconsistent with specified constraints, that has found great\nutility in natural language processing and related applications.\nIn most IIS work on classification, discrete-valued \"feature\nfunctions\" are considered, depending on the data observations and class label, \nwith constraints measured based on frequency counts,\ntaken over \n<I> hard</I> (0-1) training set instances.\nIn this thesis, we consider the case where the training (and test) set consist\nof instances of <I> probability\nmass functions</I> on the features, rather than hard feature values.\nIIS extends in a natural way for this case. \nThis has applications\n1) to ME classification on mixed\ndiscrete-continuous feature spaces and 2) to ME aggregation of soft \nclassifier decisions in ensemble classification.

The ice layers are accreted to a 0.7 mm thick, 30.4 cm x 30.4 cm steel plate at an environment temperature of -200 C. A power input of 50 Watts is applied to the actuator (50 V, 19.6 KV/m), which translates to a de-icing power of 0.07 W/cm2. A finite element model of the actuator bonded to the isotropic plate is used to guide the design of the system, and predicts the transverse shear stresses at the ice interface. Wind tunnel icing tests were conducted to demonstrate the potential use of the proposed system under impact icing conditions. Both glaze ice and rime ice were generated on steel and composite plates by changing the cloud conditions of the wind tunnel. Continuous ultrasonic vibration prevented impact ice formation around the actuator location at an input power not exceeding 0.18 W/cm2 (1.2 W/in2). As ice thickness reached a critical thickness of approximately 1.2 mm, shedding occurred on those locations where ultrasonic transverse shear stresses exceeded the shear adhesion strength of the ice.

Discovered patterns could help researchers understand inherent properties and characteristics in large and complex graphs. Frequent subgraph mining has been widely applied successfully in many applications, such as mining network motifs in a complex network, identifying malicious behaviors or mining biochemical structures. However, the high frequency of a subgraph does not always indicate that a subgraph is statistically significant. In this dissertation, we propose a framework for mining statistically significant subgraphs. Our framework is based on a new method for measuring the statistical significance of subgraphs. Given a training set of graphs from two classes (e.g., positive and negative graphs), our method utilizes the class labels provided in the training data to calculate p-values. The p-values reflect how significant the subgraphs are in one class with respect to a null distribution. Our method can assign p-values to subgraphs of new graph instances even if those subgraphs have not appeared before in the training data.\n\nWe apply our framework to malware analysis where we extract malicious behaviors from malware executables and calculate their p-values. We focus on this problem because malware is still a serious threat to our society. Traditionally, analysis of malicious software is only a semi-automated process, often requiring a skilled human analyst. As new malware appears at an increasingly alarming rate, now over 100,000 new variants each day, there is a need for automated techniques for identifying suspicious behavior in programs.\nThe contribution of this dissertation is two-fold. (1) We propose a framework for extracting statistically significant subgraphs and apply the framework to identify significant behaviors from malware samples. (2) We develop a methodology for evaluating the quality of significant malware behaviors. The experimental results showed that our framework was able to identify behaviors that are both statistically significant and malicious based on a description by the malware expert. The results also showed that our framework could possibly able to detect unseen behaviors not previously seen in the training dataset.

A normalized bi-criteria additive weighting scheme is developed to show the importance of the chronic disease in terms of both prevalence and impact. The motivation behind developing such a weighting factor is to aid decision makers in making allocation decisions across several domains that influence health care needs, public policy, and research priorities.

If the consumption of electricity by data centers is treated as a\ncountry, then it becomes the \ffth in the world for electricity use. Hence the need to reduce the\npeak power demand in data centers is a hot topic of research. There has been various techniques\nproposed to do this. Our study focuses on one of the Internet-Scale networks and reducing\nthe power cost by using batteries (such as Akamai). The operating expenses of large distributed\nnetworks are increasingly driven by the cost of supplying power to their servers. Typically, CDNs\nprocure power through long-term contracts from co-location providers and pay on the basis of\nthe power (KWs) provisioned for them, rather than on the basis of the energy (KWHs) actually\nconsumed. We propose the use of batteries to reduce both the required power supply and the\nincurred power cost of a CDN. We provide a theoretical model and an algorithmic framework for\nprovisioning batteries to minimize the total power supply and the total power costs of a CDN. We\nevaluate our battery provisioning algorithms using extensive load traces derived from Akamai's\nCDN to empirically study the achievable bene\fts. We show that batteries can provide up to 14%\npower savings, that would increase to 22% for more power-proportional next-generation servers,\nand would increase even more to 35.3% for perfectly power-proportional servers. Likewise, the cost savings, inclusive of the additional battery costs, range from 13.26% to 33.8% as servers become more power-proportional. Further, much of these savings can be achieved with a small\ncycle rate of one full discharge/charge cycle every three days that is conducive to satisfactory battery lifetimes. In summary, we show that a CDN can utilize batteries to signi\fcantly reduce\nboth the total supplied power and the total power costs, thereby establishing batteries as a key element in future distributed network architecture. While we use the canonical example of a CDN, our results also apply to other similar Internet-scale distributed networks.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8452], "author_name_tesi": "Palasamudram, Darshan Suresh", "last_name_ssi": "Palasamudram", "middle_name_ssi": "Suresh", "first_name_ssi": "Darshan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bhuvan Urgaonkar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Batteries", "Power", "CDN"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Negotiating Contested Zones: \nA Post-Tourist Vision of Famagusta", "id": "21346", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9904", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis focuses on an emergent urbanism, one that negotiates the contradictory and seemingly incompatible environments of military and tourism as they are interpreted in Famagusta, Cyprus. The unique characteristics of Famagusta invite research into an alternative reading of urbanism: On one hand, it represents a so-called ghost town marked by an amalgamation of borders and boundaries, and on the other hand, the persistent image of a cosmopolitan tourist resort seems to be the only common story between the two contested communities.\n\nWhat are the spatial preconditions necessary to reshape resistant and tenacious environments into adaptable and negotiable zones? In exploring this question, this thesis hypothesizes that contested zones require the development of a framework for solutions given the situation\u2019s uncertainty and the unpredictability of human behavior. This suggested design framework is based on a re-interpretation of Richard Sennett\u2019s paradigm on the distinction between borders and boundaries. Space develops as an experimental device examining the effects of incremental changes, a relationship between action and reaction over time, rather than one fixed plan.\n\nThis thesis was conducted through the layering of three main lenses: (1) the History Lens, which investigates the power of institutional decisions to form, organize, and control spaces; (2) the Border and Boundary Lens, which explores society\u2019s paradoxical tendency to persistently preserve parts of history that cause feelings of hatred, processes of forced displacement, and spatial division; and (3) the Transgression Lens, which examines the way grassroots actors are inspired from the movements of tourists in space and adapt themselves to take advantage of conflict conditions. Tourism and the survival needs of grassroots actors come to soothe the predominant image of space as a conflict zone. Three case studies related to tourist operations a) the Viewpoints, b) the Tours, and c) the Palm Beach Hotel explicitly depict how before breaking the law, there are many shades of legality that architects should observe when leading themselves to creative design processes.\n\nThis thesis develops a strategy for negotiating space to convert a spatial disadvantage into an advantage by unfolding creative forces hidden behind contested zones. The complex urban conditions of contested zones and fields of tension represent a microcosm of contemporary reality, where borders and boundaries are the inevitable nature of architecture. The insistence of architects to re-design borders in conflict spaces and other impoverished social conditions demands architects to take the role of a co-designer along with institutions and grassroots actors.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9637], "author_name_tesi": "Palate, Savia ", "last_name_ssi": "Palate", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Savia", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jawaid Haider"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jawaid Haider, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["conflict", "contested zones", "borders", "boundaries", "urban design", "famagusta"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "FREE-TIME ACTIVITIES AND SUBSTANCE USE\nAMONG ADOLESCENTS IN CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA\n", "id": "8538", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3901", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this dissertation is to describe the execution and implications of two research studies aimed at understanding adolescent free-time experiences and their links to substance use in a sample from one area of South Africa.

Youth were involved in a broad range of activities, however, socializing, media use, sports, risk behavior (including substance use), dance, musical performance, and going to game shops were most prominent and popular. Free-time was most strongly characterized by intrinsic motivation, which included experiences of competence, relatedness, and positive affect. Activities were also often seen as a way to achieve goals related to health, well-being, and personal achievement. With few exceptions, multiple motivations were identified for the same activities, and specific motivations were reported across multiple activity types. In particular, youth mentioned many of the same motivations for risk behavior as they did for more traditionally pro-social free-time activities. However, there is also some evidence for unique social influences on risk behavior.\nThe second study examined longitudinal patterns of regular smoking in one cohort of survey participants (N = 2,425). It explored gender and treatment group differences in these patterns, as well as certain free-time experiences that could potentially predict these patterns. There was evidence for four patterns of smoking, with intervention effects on smoking prevention for girls and smoking cessation for boys. Experiences of extrinsic motivation, amotivation, and boredom were related to heightened odds of being a regular smoker. \nThese studies make a number of unique contributions to what is known about free-time and substance use among South African adolescents. They offer some support for the generalizability of theory, elucidate longitudinal associations between free-time experiences and smoking, and provide a nuanced assessment of one intervention\u2019s impact on smoking behavior.

Over the last decade in particular, similar levels of interest have also evolved within other sub-disciplines of psychology and philosophy.  Such work has begun to change how many phenomena, including attention, happiness, and excellence, are understood.  \n\nPerhaps the most recognized work in these areas focuses upon measuring the states and traits of relatively advanced meditation practitioners.  But very little effort has been invested, as yet, in understanding the various methods that these practitioners are employing, and what purposes each of these methods serve in the contemplative context.  (e.g., Lutz, Dunne, and Davidson, 2007).  According to the practitioners themselves, each such method may require years or decades of study and experiential investment for genuine understanding (e.g., Begley, 2007).  Given the lack of extant effort in this direction, within psychology, and the essential role that such effort must play in interpreting the ground-breaking data now being published on advanced meditation practitioners, I invested myself in full-time contemplative practice for over two years under the guidance of a qualified teacher.  This period of mentorship began after five years of academic and personal investigation of contemplative practice, which itself included months of field research, as well as time spent in formal contemplative practice settings.  Overall, this extended period of investigation focused primarily upon one particular category of contemplative methods - practices for training the attention, or shamatha practices - which are commonly considered among the most basic, and most essential (e.g., Buddhaghosa, 1999; Wallace, 1999).  \n\nThe current work presents introductory explanations of shamatha in both a theoretical and applied context.  Requisites for the successful cultivation of the practice, and possible implications for the aforementioned fields - including apparent connections between this training and the flow phenomenon identified by Positive Psychology\u2019s Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi \u2013 are also discussed.  These discussions are focused, in large part, upon the potential of shamatha as a method for natural research and application within the study of optimal experience.  Specifically, shamatha may be a methodology enabling direct empirical investigation of the mental causes and conditions contributing to optimal experience, as well as the intentional habituation, or training, of these causes and conditions for applied purposes (Wallace, 2000).\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6154], "author_name_tesi": "Palmer-Angell, Terran ", "last_name_ssi": "Palmer-Angell", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Terran", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Robert Scott Kretchmar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Scott Kretchmar, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["attention", "flow", "introspection", "applied sport psychology", "optimal experience", "mental training", "spirituality", "sport psychology", "Csikszentmihalyi", "shamatha", "meditation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Examining the conditioning effect of self-control on strain using a within-individual change appraoch", "id": "25030", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11284", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Agnew\u2019s (1985; 1992) general strain theory posits that strains increase the likelihood of criminal coping. Generally, research has found that strains are associated with an increase in delinquent behaviors. One of the key assumptions of general strain theory asserts that various factors, including personality and social resources, condition the effect of strain on delinquency or crime. Agnew et al. (2002) argues that self-control should provide individuals with a protective factor against the negative effects of strain. While many studies have empirically examined this relationship, the evidence has been largely inconclusive. A major shortcoming in these studies is the utilization of designs that are unable to rule out selection prior to testing for conditioning effects. Recent examinations of strain have also highlighted the instrumental nature of coping (Felson et al. 2012) and argued that criminal coping should only be predicted when it is aimed directly at the source of the strain. In the current study, I extend the work of Felson et al. (2012) to determine whether or not the influence of self-control depends on the particular crimes and strain involved. In order to address the limitations of previous work, I utilize data that contain 3 years of monthly measurements and use a within-individual change approach to control for selection effects. Results indicate that self-control moderates the relationship between family strain and assaults in the predicted direction, but has little to no effect on the relationship between illness/injury strain and assaults or financial strain and dealing drugs. Furthermore, while the results indicate the self-control moderates the relationship between financial strains and property crimes, it was in the opposite predicted direction.

None of the modern, non-invasive, imaging modalities (such as CT scan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or Ultrasound) used today by radiologists to find and diagnose tumors provides the critical information about the stiffness of the imaged tissues. The work presented in this thesis is based on the clinical observation of palpation and focuses on testing the following hypothesis: the Young\u2019s modulus of tissues helps differentiating not only between normal and abnormal tissues but, most importantly, between benign (not cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) tumors. We will show some preliminary results on tumor classification and growth with the help of biomechanical modeling. First, we propose a novel mechanical model of differentiating between benign and malignant tumors based on their corresponding Young\u2019s moduli obtained using information about tissue microstructure provided by imaging mass spectrometry. Imaging mass spectrometry is a new technology that can provide a molecular assessment of tumor progression and treatment obtained from biopsies, with the potential to identify tumor subpopulations and predict patient survival that is not evident based on the cellular phenotype determined histologically. Our second biomechanical model shows how the mechanical properties of tumors affect their growth. By replacing the first order temporal derivative in this mechano-growth model with a fractional order derivative we are able to predict for the first time when a benign tumor turns into cancer. We used the Adomian method to find analytic solutions to the non-linear classic and fractional-order ordinary differential equation corresponding to our second model. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [174], "author_name_tesi": "Palocaren, Antony J", "last_name_ssi": "Palocaren", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Antony", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Corina Stefania Drapaca", "Corina Stefania Drapaca"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Corina Stefania Drapaca, Thesis Advisor", "Corina Stefania Drapaca, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["tumor modelling"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Ignition of Aluminum Powder with a 2.45-GHz Microwave Plasma Torch", "id": "13647jep318", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13647", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research was conducted at The Pennsylvania State University to investigate and develop a proof-of-concept aluminum igniter using a 2.45-GHz microwave plasma torch. Using Penn State\u2019s Microwave Plasma Torch design, an argon and helium plasma were generated at 300-W delivered power in both air and steam environments. Injector design iterations allowed for steam, with reduced condensation effects, to become entrained within the plasma and mitigated the presence of air chemistry by employing a fused-quartz chamber. Aluminum powder, carried by argon, was able to enter the plasma volume directly at a relatively steady flow rate drawn from a beneficial pressure drop through the delivery line. It was hypothesized that a region in the microwave-generated plasma would have a temperature greater than or equal to 2300 K, the melting point of aluminum oxide, which exists as an ignition-inhibiting layer in aluminum particles. Preliminary work was performed to study the plasma temperature as a function of axial distance and delivered power via diatomic rovibrational spectra fitting of the NO\u03b3, OH, and N2 2nd positive system bands from axial spectral measurements. Difference in ignition over the axial measurements was noted to depend on the diffusivity of the working gas, as the broadband continuum from the thermal emission saturated the optical spectrometer when using helium as a plasma starter near the injection tube, but it did not signal that saturation had occurred when using argon as a plasma starter. \n\nValidation of the plasma state was obtained via optical emission spectroscopy with reference to profiles of plasma radicals for helium, argon, air, water, aluminum, and aluminum monoxide. Peak lines of interest for the following elements were studied at particular wavelengths: helium at 587.56 nm; argon at 750.387 nm and 811.531 nm; hydrogen at 656.3 nm (H\u03b1); and a hydroxide band from 250 nm to 340 nm (OH: A2 \u03a3+ \u2192 X2 \u03a0).

No research related to project-based leisure has yet been published, and thus it has not been supported by any studies.  Self-drive recreation, while it has received some academic attention in recent years (Carson & Waller, 2002), has largely been ignored in leisure studies despite its apparent mass popularity.  Thus, in studying these two phenomena in relation to each other, it was hoped that a deeper understanding could be gained of both. To that end, three related investigations were undertaken.\n   The first study tested and found through qualitative means that self-drive recreation can be classified as project-based leisure and/or\u2014as a plethora of previous studies have examined for other activities\u2014its parent theoretical construct, serious leisure (Stebbins, 1982).  This study also found that the delineation between serious and project-based leisure is likely highly subjective, and that self-drive recreation has extraordinarily high indicators of dedication in some participants, as well as unusual patterns of participation rates that further raised questions about how the frequency of partaking in a recreational pursuit relates to its being classifiable as serious or project-based.\n   The second study employed quantitative means to determine if they were suitable for use in classifying recreational activities as serious/project-based leisure or not, as such methods have never been tested before.  Through the use of confirmatory factor analysis by structural equation modeling (Byrnes, 2001), it was determined that although it was not perfectly demonstrated in this study, that such use of quantitative means would likely be possible.  Perfect results were probably not obtained in this analysis due to the fact \nthat this was an initial exploratory study in this area, and thus there was no precedent for appropriate survey items.  Several items developed for this analysis were likely faulty, though most of the others worked well and produced nearly-complete models.  \n   The third study examined differences in demographics, enjoyment, constraints, and activity identification between project-based and serious self-drive recreationists.  It was determined that serious devotees are more likely to be older and thus retired, indicating that free time is the biggest constraint.  Serious drivers are also likely to identify more strongly with their activity.  Both groups had high levels of enjoyment, and they also had some differences between their feelings towards various leisure constraints.  Therefore, it appears that enjoyment is the largest factor in determining if project-based self-drive participants will want to become serious ones, and the removal of the constraint of not enough discretionary time allows for that change.  It was also determined that early project-based self-drive trips, if they provide enough enjoyment, can serve as markers or turning points in leisure careers (Kane & Zink, 2004) if the activity is indeed later adopted as a serious pursuit. \n   These studies lend support to Stebbins\u2019 notion of project-based leisure (2005), and expand his over-arching serious leisure theory by providing some evidence of its existence and relationship to serious leisure, while at the same time discovering some areas for future study and clarification.  The studies also delved into self-drive recreation and found that it has unique characteristics, especially related to participation rates, frequencies, and expenditures, that have not been addressed in previous studies.  This oft-overlooked activity could thus become more attractive as a laboratory for those interested in examining leisure concepts, as well as increase understanding of this travel market that may be useful to tourism interests in Alaska and northwestern Canada.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4692], "author_name_tesi": "Palso, Nicholas Terence", "last_name_ssi": "Palso", "middle_name_ssi": "Terence", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan R Graefe", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Deryck William Holdsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan R Graefe, Committee Chair", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Member", "Andrew Justin Mowen, Committee Member", "Deryck William Holdsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Self-drive recreation", "road-trip", "Alaska", "serious leisure", "project-based leisure"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Optimization Of An Inbound Logistics Network: An Automotive Case Study", "id": "15103", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "587", "abstract_tesi": "The design, execution and coordination of a logistics network are essential activities of any supply chain. Although outbound logistics is very important to ensure high responsiveness for customer satisfaction, improper planning of the inbound process could cause disruptions further down the supply chain and affect the overall performance. The two most important factors to be considered for inbound logistics planning are: overall costs and the delivery time. \nThis thesis aims at building an optimization model to aid an Indian automotive OEM in determining the most suitable option to ship material into their plant. The firm currently receives a variety of material at the plants via direct shipments from remotely located suppliers leading to high inventory holding costs. To address the issues of limited plant capacity and increased delivery lead times, including a warehouse and distributors located closer to the plant is proposed. The bi-criteria mixed integer linear program is developed to help determine if: (1) the plants should receive material from the suppliers by direct delivery or (2) from the distributors. The objectives of the model are to minimize overall costs (inventory and transportation) and lead time. The model is solved using Non Pre-emptive Goal Programming by assigning a set of weights to either objective. The model determines the most suitable option to ship material to the plant in the shortest time and at the lowest cost to the company. A scenario analysis is also performed to consider the uncertainty in demand. The most frequently selected shipping option is selected as the best strategy for a given material.

This water when tested for the minerals present in it in a laboratory, it clearly shows a predominant presence of mineral salts which can cause a high risk of precipitations inside the reservoir due to pressure and temperature changes. These salts needs to be studied of their severity in causing the plugging of tubes, valves and the other production flow systems which can ultimately result in the abandonment of the wells. This is termed to be a very serious problem in the present day petroleum industry as it can incur very huge losses to the industry even though the wells may have the potential to produce more oil and gas.\n\nThe potential players of scaling can be listed as calcium carbonates, calcium sulfates, barium sulfates and the sodium chloride. All these scales are evaluated on the basis of their saturation index values which would imply whether it would cause scaling or not. The general notation to imply the same is if the saturation index (SI) is greater than 0, it would result in scaling. If the SI value is less than 0, there is no scaling.\n\nSo as to study these affects, this thesis concentrates more on the scaling potential of the different types of scales and their severity in causing the well to shut off completely. The various thermodynamics and solubility aspects involved in the determination of the saturation index of different scales are studied and quantified. Also we build a model to demonstrate the scaling potential in a particular gas reservoir with different temperature and pressure profiles to determine the saturation indices of the scales and study. The saturation index calculations for different scales are included in the model so that it shows the pressure and temperature profiles and also the scaling affects simultaneously in the model.\nWith this model the idea the scaling potential of four different scales are studied and quantified. This study could be a source to the major understanding of the scaling severity and how we adopt the scaling calculations into the reservoir simulation model so as to quantify the various parameters which would lead us to the identification and subsequently to the solutions to tackle this scaling problem in gas reservoirs.\n\n\n\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4998], "author_name_tesi": "Pamidimukkala, Phani Kiran ", "last_name_ssi": "Pamidimukkala", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Phani Kiran", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yilin Wang", "Yaw D Yeboah", "Li Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yilin Wang, Thesis Advisor", "Yaw D Yeboah, Thesis Advisor", "Li Li, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Scaling potential", "saturation index", "scaling minerals"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "OPTIMAL INTERMEDIATED INVESTMENT IN A \nLIQUIDITY-DRIVEN BUSINESS CYCLE \n", "id": "8678", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3287", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The &#64257;rst essay of this dissertation presents a general equilibrium model of a &#64257;nan- \ncial intermediary that extends the model &#64257;rst introduced by D.

They use wireless radio communications to automatically identify objects or people without the need for line-of-sight or contact, and are widely used in inventory tracking, object location, environmental monitoring due to their low cost, small size, and wireless functionality. \n  This dissertation explores the application of active RFID tags in outdoor environments responding to random noise radar interrogations with pre-determined messages. A conceptual system design for communication between radar and RFID tags using ultrawideband (UWB) noise waveforms is proposed and analyzed theoretically and via simulations. The tag structure comprises a sensing receiver and active receiver/transmitter. The sensing receiver senses the radar header consisting of a pre-arranged secret realization of the noise waveform. The active receiver/transmitter modulates the RFID tag\u2019s message onto the radar interrogation signal through weighted tapped delays and reradiates the tag message back to the radar. System performance is evaluated in terms of symbol error probability in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. An algorithm to combat multipath interferences on the RFID tag\u2013to\u2013radar link is presented. It is shown that this system is capable of communicating a suite of messages from the tags to the radar.\n  This dissertation also explores the application of active RFID tags in target discovery and information routing in the RFID networks. The design of a covert RFID tag network for target discovery and target information routing is presented. In the design, a static or very slowly moving target in the field of RFID tags transmits a distinct pseudo-noise signal, and the RFID tags in the network collect the target information and route it to the command center. A map of each RFID tag\u2019s location is saved at command center, which can determine where a RFID tag is located based on each RFID tag\u2019s ID.

Traditionally, quality engineers, who are more familiar with SPC methods, avoid using process adjustment methods because of process tampering concerns. This has resulted in very few systematic studies on how to apply process adjustment strategies for continuous quality improvement. Most of the work in this area concentrates on chemical processes which typically have long production runs. This thesis focuses on studying sequential adjustment methods, closely related to well-known Stochastic Approximation procedures, for the purpose of quality control of a short-run manufacturing process.\n\nFirst, the problem of adjusting a machine that starts production after a defective setup operation is considered. A general solution based on a Kalman Filter estimator is presented. This solution unifies some well-known process adjustment rules, and is a particular case of Linear Quadratic (LQ) control methods. In essence, this solution calls for a sequential adjustment strategy which recursively calculates the value of an adjustable variable according to the prior knowledge of this variable and the most recent observation from the process.\n\nNext, the integration of sequential adjustments with SPC control charts is investigated for controlling an abrupt step-type process disturbance on a manufacturing process. The performance of this type of integrated methods depends on the sensitivity of the control chart to detect shifts in the process mean, on the accuracy of the initial estimate of shift size, and on the number of sequential adjustments that are made. It is found that sequential adjustments are superior to single adjustment strategies for almost all types of process shifts and shift sizes considered. A combined CUSUM chart plus sequential adjustments approach has better performance than other methods when the shift size is not very large.\n\nIf there are different costs associated with a higher-than-target quality characteristic compared to a lower-than-target quality characteristic, that is, an asymmetric cost function, the adjustment rule needs to be modified to avoid the quality characteristic falling into the higher cost side. For this case, a sequential adjustment rule with an additional bias term is proposed. A method to determine these bias terms is developed. Furthermore, the effect of process measurement and adjustment costs on the decision of whether or not to apply adjustment actions at each sampling instant is investigated. A modified Silver-Meal scheduling algorithm is found to be good at providing robust and close-to-optimal adjustment schedules for this problem.\n\nFinally, methods for identifying and fine-tuning a manufacturing system operating in closed-loop are studied. When a process is operated under a linear feedback control rule, the cross-correlation function between the process input and output has no information on the process transfer function, and open-loop system identification techniques cannot be used. In this research, it is shown that under certain general assumptions on the controller and process disturbance structure, it is possible to identify the process disturbance models from data obtained under closed-loop operation. After identification, it is proposed to tune the controller to a near-optimal setting according to a performance criterion that considers both the variance of the output and the variance of the adjustments.\n\nIn summary, a collection of mathematical models for short-run manufacturing processes are proposed and studied systematically in this thesis. It is demonstrated that by implementing proper adjustment strategies the stability of the process can be better maintained; thus, significant economic benefits obtained from the consistent quality of products will be achieved. This research contributes directly to the quality improvement program of the manufacturing industry and to the field of applied statistics.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5401], "author_name_tesi": "Pan, Rong ", "last_name_ssi": "Pan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Allen Wysk", "Bruce G Lindsay", "Enrique Del Castillo", "M Jeya Chandra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Allen Wysk, Committee Member", "Bruce G Lindsay, Committee Member", "Enrique Del Castillo, Committee Chair", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Engineering process control", "Asymmetric cost functions", "Closed-loop systems", "Process setup adjustment", "Statistical process control"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Novel Approach For Fabricating Nanochannel Templates For Si Nanowire Growth And Transistor Fabrication", "id": "18933", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8965", "abstract_tesi": "For the past decades, silicon nanowire (SiNW) has been extensively studied due to their unique electric, optical, and mechanical properties and great compatibility with modern integrated circuits industry. Researchers have successfully demonstrated its potential applications in many fields, such as high performance transistors, high resolution and sensitivity bio and chemical sensors and so on. Scientists even predicted it is most likely that SiNW transistor will become the final winner for the competition of future generation transistor architecture. Therefore, it is very obvious that SiNW has become the rising star for future nanoelectronics. Up to date, many efforts have been devoted to synthesizing SiNW. In general, there are two main categories in terms of SiNW growth methods, and post growth device fabrication and assembly: \u201cgrow-and-place\u201d and \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d. For \u201cgrow-and-place\u201d approach, intensive post growth treatments are needed to fully realize SiNW device application, which leads to higher cost and lower throughput. For \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d approach, the SiNW is grown on the substrate, where the final device will be fabricated, and there is no post growth treatments needed. This approach improves the throughput and cost of \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d approach.  However, it is still a great challenge for realizing mass production of SiNW based device due to the lack of well-controlled nanofabrication techniques with lower cost and higher throughput.\n \nTo resolve some of these above-mentioned issues, in this thesis, we have developed a novel approach for fabricating nanochannel templates for SiNW growth and further device applications. This method represents \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d approach and takes full advantages of \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d approaches. However, it has several improvements compared with \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d approach in terms of the fabrication of nanochannel templates, and catalyst patterning and control. We have investigated two alternative sacrificial materials for nanochannel templates, which are further used for encapsulated SiNW growth. Those two alternative sacrificial materials are polymers of specified properties and amorphous silicon. Specifically, we have explored the NXR 3022 polymer, which is water soluble, and NXR 1025 polymer, which is general solvent soluble. In addition, we have investigated and optimized the patterning techniques of sacrificial polymer based on the throughput, patterning cost and polymer compatibility with subsequent process steps. Taking into account of all the factors, we have chosen new nanoimprinting lithography to pattern the polymers. Detailed procedures and issues encountered during the nanochannel fabrication process will be discussed. For inorganic amorphous silicon, we have successfully demonstrated its capability as the sacrificial material of nanochannel. The advantages of using amorphous silicon are as follows: process simplicity, great compatibility with further processes as well as its ease of dry removal for forming nanochannels.\n\nThrough this novel proposed approach, we have successfully grown SiNW with high-quality surface and structure properties: smooth surface morphology, prefect single crystal structure, and excellent electrical characteristics. The detailed information will be discussed in this thesis. Additionally, we have successfully fabricated the accumulation mode MOSFET (AMOSFET) on grown SiNW. The device performance was characterized through I-V measurements and it has shown excellent device performance with high on and off current ratio and sharp subthreshold swing.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8802], "author_name_tesi": "Pan, Suxing ", "last_name_ssi": "Pan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suxing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash", "Stephen Joseph Fonash", "Samia A Suliman", "Sanjay B Joshi", "Sulin Zhang", "Judith Todd Copley", "Wookjun Nam"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Joseph Fonash, Committee Chair", "Samia A Suliman, Committee Member", "Sanjay B Joshi, Committee Member", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Member", "Judith Todd Copley, Committee Member", "Wookjun Nam, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Silicon Nanowire", "Transistor", "AMOSFET"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "aerial dispersal of particles emitted inside plant canopies: application to the spread of plant diseases", "id": "22892", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10468", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work combines numerical, experimental, and theoretical methods to investigate the dispersion of particles inside and above plant canopies. The large-eddy simulation (LES) approach is used to reproduce turbulence statistics and three-dimensional (3-D) particle dispersion within the canopy roughness sublayer (the region of flow significantly modified by the presence of the canopy, extending from ground to about three canopy heights). The Eulerian description of conservation laws of fluid momentum and particle concentration implies that the continuous concentration field is advected by the continuous flow field. Within the canopy, modifications are required for the filtered momentum and concentration equations, because spatial filtering of flow variables and concentration field is inapplicable to a control volume consisting of both fluid and solid elements. In this work, the canopy region is viewed as a space occupied by air only. The sink of airflow momentum induced by forces acting on the surfaces of canopy elements is parameterized as a non-conservative virtual body force that dissipates the kinetic energy of the air. This virtual body force must reflect the characteristic of the surface forces exerted by canopy elements within the control volume, and is parameterized as a \"drag force\" following standard practice in LES studies. Specifically, the \"drag force\" is calculated as a product of a drag coefficient, the projected leaf area density, and the square of velocity. Using a constant drag coefficient, this model allows first-order accuracy in reproducing the vertically integrated sink of momentum within the canopy layer for airflows of high Reynolds number. The corresponding LES results of first- and second-order turbulence statistics are in good agreement with experimental data obtained in the field interior, within and just above mature maize canopies. However, the distribution of momentum sink among weak (low velocity) and strong (high velocity) events has not been well reproduced, inferred from the significant underestition of streamwise and vertical velocity skewness as well as the fractions of vertical momentum flux transported by strong events. Using a velocity-dependent drag coefficient that accounts for the effect of plant reconfiguration (bending of canopy elements due to the aerodynamic drag force), the \"drag force\" model leads to LES results of streamwise and vertical velocity skewness as well as the fractions of vertical momentum flux transported by strong events in better agreement with field experimental data. Specifically, modeling the impact of reconfiguration allows strong events to penetrate into deeper canopy regions, reducing the underprediction of streamwise and vertical velocity skewness as well as the vertical momentum flux transported by strong events from 60%, 60%, and 40% to 5%, 20%, and 5%, respectively. On the other hand, the vertically integrated sink of momentum within the canopy layer has been kept approximately the same, so do first- and second-order turbulence statistics.\n\nThe link between plant reconfiguration and turbulence dynamics within the canopy roughness sublayer is further investigated. The \"reconfiguration drag model\" using velocity-dependent drag coefficient is revised to incorporate a theoretical model of the force balance on individual crosswind blades. In the LES, the dimension and degree of the reconfiguration of canopy elements affect the magnitude and position of peak streamwise velocity skewness within the canopy as well as the fractions of vertical momentum flux transported by strong events. The streamwise velocity skewness is shown to be related to the penetration of strong events into the canopy, which is associated with the passage of canopy-scale coherent eddies. With the profile of mean vertical momentum flux constrained by field experimental data, changing the model of drag coefficient induces negligible changes in the vertically integrated \"drag force\" within the canopy layer. Consequently, first- and second-order turbulence statistics remain approximately the same. However, enhancing the rate of decrease of drag coefficient with increasing velocity increases the streamwise and vertical velocity skewness, the fractions of vertical momentum flux transported by strong events, as well as the ratio between vertical momentum flux transported by relatively strong head-down \"sweeps\" and relatively weak head-up \"ejections\". Note that \"sweeps\" and \"ejections\" are defined based on streamwise and vertical velocity fluctuations, and are different from their classical definitions. These results confirmed the inadequacy of describing the effects of canopy-scale coherent structures using just first- and second-order turbulence statistics.\n\nThe filtered concentration equation is applied to the dispersion of particles within the canopy roughness sublayer, assuming that a virtual continuous concentration field is advected by a virtual continuous velocity field. A canopy deposition model is used to model the sink of particle concentration associated with the impaction, sedimentation, retention, and re-entrainment of particles on the surfaces of canopy elements. LES results of mean particle concentration field and mean ground deposition rate were evaluated against data obtained during an artificial continuous point-source release experiment. Accounting for the effect of reconfiguration by using a velocity dependent drag coefficient leads to better agreement between LES results and field experimental data of the mean particle concentration field, suggesting the importance of reproducing the distribution of momentum sink among weak and strong events for reproducing the dispersion of particles. LES results obtained using a velocity-dependent drag coefficient are analyzed to estimate essential properties for the occurrence of plant disease epidemics, i.e., the fraction of particles that escape the canopy (escape fraction) and the growth of the particle plume in the vertical direction. The most interesting finding is that an existing analytical function can be used to model the crosswind-integrated mean concentration field above the canopy normalized by the escape fraction for particles released from the field interior.\n\nOur LES results suggest that the escape fractions of particles released close to the canopy leading edge are greater than those released in the field interior, especially for particles released in the bottom half of the canopy. Effects of the canopy leading edge on the escape fraction can be tracked to the effects on the fractions of particles removed by deposition on modeled \"canopy elements\" and on the ground. The rate of deposition on canopy elements can be suppressed by enhanced modeled retention and re-entrainment of particles in the region of strong mean wind, while the rate of deposition on the ground can be suppressed by non-negligible mean vertical advection with respect to vertical turbulent transport. Away from the source, the vertical growth of the plume above the canopy-leading-edge area is slower than that above the field interior, due to greater shear of mean streamwise velocity in the internal boundary layer (IBL) than that in the fully-developed canopy roughness sublayer above the canopy.\n\nSpore dispersal downwind from the source field is investigated by representing the infected field as a prescribed constant mean concentration at a reference height near the canopy top. This \"source-in-the-mean\" model neglects the spatial heterogeneity of infections, release rates, and escape fractions, allowing a first-order accuracy in reproducing the effective source strength of a severely infected field. For dispersion of particles emitted from finite area sources in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), pre-existing theoretical models proposed for neutral conditions are extended to unstable conditions. The major effects of buoyancy are accounted for by modifying the profile of vertical velocity variance and considering the ratio between friction and convection velocities. Theoretical predictions of mean concentration profile, plume height, and horizontal transport above the source as well as ground deposition rate downstream from the source are in good agreement with LES results for the plume within the atmospheric surface layer.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10122], "author_name_tesi": "Pan, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Pan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marcelo Chamecki", "Marcelo Chamecki", "Scott Alan Isard", "Scott Alan Isard", "Jerry Y Harrington", "James Gordon Brasseur"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marcelo Chamecki, Dissertation Advisor", "Marcelo Chamecki, Committee Chair", "Scott Alan Isard, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott Alan Isard, Committee Chair", "Jerry Y Harrington, Committee Member", "James Gordon Brasseur, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["atmospheric turbulence", "canopy roughness sublayer", "dispersion of particles", "large-eddy simulation", "theory of dispersion"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Optoelectronic study of topological insulators and topological insulator - magnetic insulator heterostructures", "id": "14496yyp5028", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14496", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Topological insulators have attracted much contemporary interest due to the gapless\nspin-textured surface states which reside within the bulk band gap. The\nspin-momentum locking in these helical surface states provides a unique opportunity\nfor \"topological spintronics\" devices that function at technologically relevant\ntemperatures (300 K and above). Optoelectronic methods have been adopted to\ncontrol electron spin and charge currents in 3D TIs. In particular, experiments\nhave shown that circularly polarized light induces a directional helicity-dependent\nphotocurrent (HDPC) in 3D TIs. The ready observation of this phenomenon at 300\nK promises interesting opportunities for developing opto-spintronic devices wherein\nelectron currents might be steered optically.

Thus, the second topic of the dissertation\n(Chapter 4) is to explore the spin pumping by light illumination on the heterostructure.\nThe discovery of a spin-dependent photocurrent (PC) is a signature of the\nspin pumping, which maps out the magnetization at the interface, as confirmed by a\ndirect comparison with magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements. Further insight\ninto this phenomenon is gained by studying the spin-dependent PC as a function of the chemical potential of the TI film, as well as by examining its variation with\nthe temperature and the wavelength of the optical excitation. The optoelectronic\nstudy in the heterostructure of TI-MI not only identifies the spin pumping, but\nalso provides a new method for magnetization measurements.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15440], "author_name_tesi": "Pan, Yu ", "last_name_ssi": "Pan", "first_name_ssi": "Yu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth", "Nitin Samarth", "Jun Zhu", "Chaoxing Liu", "Venkatraman Gopalan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth, Dissertation Advisor", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Chair", "Jun Zhu, Committee Member", "Chaoxing Liu, Committee Member", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["topological insulators", "optoelectronics", "spintronics", "photo-galvanic effect", "magnetism"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITIONS OF FLOWBACK WATER FROM MARCELLUS SHALE WELLS BY UTILIZING DATAMINING TECHNIQUES\n", "id": "26679", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11654", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "       Water that is produced from shale gas wells in three months after stimulation treatments and shut-in periods is called flowback water.

The correlations between the temporal and spectral features manifested by these afterglows are in accord with the predictions of the relativistic fireball model, giving it thus a very strong support. Here we model the dynamics and radiation emission of fireballs interacting with an external medium and compare some of the results with the observations.\n       \n   We present a one-dimensional code to solve ultra-relativistic hydrodynamic problems, using the Glimm method (based on an exact Riemann solver) for an accurate treatment of shocks and contact discontinuities, and a finite differencing scheme in those regions where the fluid flow is sufficiently smooth. The accuracy and convergence of this hybrid method is investigated in tests involving strong shocks and Lorentz factors of up to ~2000.\n      \n    With the aid of the hydrodynamic code we model the interaction between an expanding fireball and a stationary external medium. We compute burst spectra and time structures arising from synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scatterings by non-thermal electrons accelerated by the shocks which form during the fireball external medium interaction. We investigate the effect of varying the most important model parameters on the resulting burst spectra, and we present a set of correlations among the spectral and temporal features of the bursts.

Many attempts have been made to understand the mechanisms that determine this range for a specific enzyme. Studies comparing the structural variations between mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes have led to speculation that different structural factors such as the number of ion pairs, the number of hydrogen bonds, the amount and type of solvent exposed surface area, and the amino acid composition are important. In order to determine whether any of these factors varied significantly between mesophilic enzymes alone, I performed a statistical analysis of the distributions of these factors in all mesophilic and thermophilic alpha/beta barrel glycosyl hydrolase structures. These data provide a spectrum of values against which researchers can compare findings from pairwise studies of naturally occurring homologues to evaluate whether the differences they observe are significant and worth further study. Only two significant differences were observed between the two groups studied: the\nnumber of glycine residues in turns at the bottom of the barrel was higher in mesophilic\nstructures and the B factors were consistently higher in the thermophilic structures. These\nobservations suggest differences in enzyme flexibility may play a key role in temperature\nadaptation. For the factors most commonly conjectured as imparting thermostability (ion pairs, hydrogen bonds, solvent accessible surface area, and amino acid composition) the degree of fluctuation within one temperature regime (mesophiles) was equal to the variability between the two regimes (mesophiles vs. thermophiles). Consequently, such comparisons of gross structural features between naturally occurring extremophilic homologs were found not to contain sufficient resolution to determine the molecular basis for thermostability. <p>\n\n\nI examined several approaches that would more specifically address the question of what structural changes, if any, could alter the temperature range for enzyme activity. I selected a directed evolution approach in which I used random mutagenesis to increase low temperature activity of one thermophilic and one psychrophilic family 42 beta-galactosidase. <p>\n\n\nIn the first case, a low temperature enrichment strategy was developed to select for\nincreased activity at low temperatures in the psychophilic enzyme, and the existence of a\nselective pressure was validated. Two mutations, K206G and L423F, were found to double the specific activity of the beta-galactosidase toward ONPG substrate. The effects of these two mutations on enzyme kinetics were examined with lactose as a substrate. The Km values decreased by a factor of two while the kcat value remained unchanged. <p>\n\n\nIn directed evolution of the thermophilic enzyme, the low temperature limit of the mutant enzyme was extended 25\u00baC below that of its parent while maintaining stability at high\ntemperatures (60\u00baC). The individual mutations responsible for this phenotype were identified as V3E, L4I, F187I, and F258S. The effects of these four mutations on enzyme kinetics were\nexamined. The Km value remained unchanged while the kcat value was increased. The effects of the individual mutations were found to be additive. Titration experiments using dithiobisnitrobenoic acid (DTNB) to determine the number of cysteine residues accessible in the soluble enzyme indicated that molecular flexibility is increased. This work demonstrates that the temperature range of enzyme activity may be broadened without the loss of thermostability. <p>\n\n\nAlthough there is not sufficient data to identify the location of mutations F187I and F258S in relation to structure or the active site, the localization of the other two mutations (V3E and L4I) to the N-terminus of the protein and their resultant effects on enzyme flexibility\nsuggests that the N-terminus of an eight-stranded alpha/beta barrel strongly influences the flexibility and thermostability of these molecules and allowed us to propose this as a general mechanism for adaptation to low temperatures. Subsequent saturation mutagenesis in the N-terminal region of the gene for the thermophilic enzyme led to a high percentage (over 50%) of mutant enzymes that were significantly altered in their thermal characteristics. To determine if the same region was important in the thermal adaptation of a related psychrophilic enzyme, the N-terminal region of the psychrophilic gene was subjected to saturation mutagenesis and two variants were\nobtained that exhibited increased activity at low temperatures. A statistical comparison of the crystallographic structures of other thermophilic and mesophilic eight-stranded alpha/beta barrel glycosyl hydrolases was then performed, and results suggest this mechanism may be common to many eight-stranded alpha/beta barrels.<p>\n\n\nThe unique structural role that the N-terminus plays in eight-stranded alpha/beta barrel architecture further suggests that some mechanisms leading to low temperature activity and thermostability are protein fold dependent. <p>\n\n\nTaken as a whole, this work shows that while the commonly undertaken comparisons of naturally occurring extremophilic homologues that are based on differences in the gross amounts of structural features may not reveal mechanisms of thermostability or thermal dependency of activity, strategies may be developed that can lead to the identification of general mechanisms that control an enzyme\u2019s thermostat.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4753], "author_name_tesi": "Panasik, Nicholas ", "last_name_ssi": "Panasik", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Koerner", "James Gregory Ferry", "Allen T Phillips", "B Tracy Nixon", "Jean Elnora Brenchley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Koerner, Committee Member", "James Gregory Ferry, Committee Member", "Allen T Phillips, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Jean Elnora Brenchley, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["directed evolution", "psychrophile", "structure", "thermostability", "alpha/beta barrel"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Novel Frequency Domain Techniques and Advances\nin Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Method for\nEfficient Solution of Multiscale Electromagnetic\nProblems", "id": "17571", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8733", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the advent of sub-micron technologies and increasing awareness of Electromagnetic\nInterference and Compatibility (EMI/EMC) issues, designers are often interested in full-\nwave solutions of complete systems, taking to account a variety of environments in which\nthe system operates. However, attempts to do this substantially increase the complexities\ninvolved in computing full-wave solutions, especially when the problems involve multi-\nscale geometries with very fine features. For such problems, even the well-established\nnumerical methods, such as the time domain technique FDTD and the frequency domain\nmethods FEM and MoM, are often challenged to the limits of their capabilities. In an\nattempt to address such challenges, three novel techniques have been introduced in this\nwork, namely Dipole Moment (DM) Approach, Recursive Update in Frequency Domain\n(RUFD) and New Finite Difference Time Domain (\u03bdFDTD). Furthermore, the efficacy of\nthe above techniques has been illustrated, via several examples, and the results obtained\nby proposed techniques have been compared with other existing numerical methods for\nthe purpose of validation.\n\nThe DM method is a new physics-based approach for formulating MoM problems, which is based on the use of dipole moments (DMs), as opposed to the conventional Green\u2019s functions. The absence of the Green\u2019s functions, as well as those of the vector and scalar potentials, helps to eliminate two of the key sources of difficulties in the conventional MoM formulation, namely the singularity and low-frequency problems. Specifically, we show that there are no singularities that we need to be concerned with in the DM formulation; hence, this obviates the need for special techniques for integrating these singularities. Yet another salutary feature of the DM approach is its ability to handle thin and lossy structures, or whether they are metallic, dielectric-type, or even combinations thereof. We have found that the DM formulation can handle these types of objects with ease, without running into ill-conditioning problems, even for very thin wire-like or surface-type structures, which lead to ill-conditioned MoM matrices when these problems are formulated in the conventional manner. The technique is valid over the entire frequency range, from low to high, and it does not require the use of loop-star type of basis functions in order to mitigate the low frequency problem.\n\nNext, we have introduced the RUFD, which is a general-purpose frequency domain technique, and which still preserves the salutary features of the time domain methods. RUFD is a frequency domain Maxwell-solver, which neither relies upon iterative nor on inversion techniques. The algorithm also preserves the advantages of the parallelizability\u2014which is a highly desirable attribute of CEM solvers\u2014by using the difference form of Maxwell\u2019s equations. Since RUFD solves the Maxwell\u2019s equations in a recursive manner, without using either iteration or inversion, the problems of dealing with ill-conditioned matrices, or constructing robust pre-conditioners are totally avoided. Also, as a frequency domain solver, it can handle dispersive media, including plasmonics, relatively easily. \n\nThe conventional time domain technique FDTD demands extensive computational resources when solving low frequency problems, or when dealing with dispersive media. The \u03bdFDTD (New FDTD) technique is a new general-purpose field solver, which is designed to tackle the above issues using some novel approaches, which deviate significantly from the legacy methods that only rely on minor modifications of the FDTD update algorithm. The \u03bdFDTD solver is a hybridized version of the conformal FDTD (CFDTD), and a novel frequency domain technique called the Dipole Moment Approach (DM Approach).\nThis blend of time domain and frequency domain techniques empowers the solver with\npotential to solve problems that involve: (i) calculating low frequency response accurately\nand numerically efficiently; (ii) handling non-Cartesian geometries such as curved surfaces\naccurately without staircasing; (iii) handling thin structures, with or without finite losses;\nand (iv) dealing with multi-scale geometries.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8594], "author_name_tesi": "Panayappan, Kadappan ", "last_name_ssi": "Panayappan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kadappan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raj Mittra", "Dr James Breakall", "Douglas Henry Werner", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raj Mittra, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr James Breakall, Committee Member", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Computational Electromagnetics", "Multiscale Problems", "FDTD", "Conformal FDTD", "RUFD", "DM Approach", "Low Frequency", "Numerical Methods"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATING THE PALEOCENE-EOCENE CARBON CYCLE PERTURBATION: \nAN EARTH SYSTEM MODEL APPROACH \n\n", "id": "7772", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3521", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or PETM, was a time of sudden and major environmental change 55 million years ago, linked to a ~200 ka interval of global warming.

Lignocellulosic biofuels can generate significantly less greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels if efficient methods for biofuel production are developed. One of the biggest challenges for using lignocellulosic biomass to generate biofuels is the pretreatment process, which involves the breakdown of the plant cell wall structure to release cellulose and hemicellulose from lignin. Pretreatment techniques such as liquid hot water pretreatment, acid hydrolysis, UV pretreatment, microwave pretreatment, and steam explosion have been developed for several biomass materials including agricultural wastes, food processing and industrial wastes, grasses and some woody species. However, the mechanisms of lignocellulose breakdown during pretreatment are not yet fully understood. Understanding pretreatment breakdown mechanisms is crucial in order to scale-up the pretreatment process to commercial scales. The primary feedstock used in this research was poplar, a hardwood species widely studied as an energy crop. Poplar trees, especially hybrid varieties, have a lot of potential for biomass conversion because of their fast growing nature and their ability to regenerate from roots and stumps. The main goal of this research was to understand the effect of heating rates during hot water pretreatment of poplar wood using two lab-scale systems that differed in heat transfer properties: 1) Accelerated Solvent Extraction-350 (ASE-350) system (microbench-scale) and 2) Parr high pressure reactor (macrobench-scale). Xylan removal and inhibitor production were compared for the two systems. Enzymatic degradation experiments carried out with these pretreated materials helped to understand the effect of heat-up times on the saccharification yields. The resulting sugar and inhibitor yields were correlated with the pretreatment system properties of reactor volumes and heating rates to understand their effect on the pretreatment severity and effectiveness. Comparisons of temperature profiles and ramp-up times within the two systems gave useful information about the process of breakdown of lignocellulose. An integrated severity parameter based on the temperature profile curves, that incorporated the effect of ramp-up time, was developed. These results are useful in understanding the system properties that result in effective pretreatment. Understanding the heat transfer considerations for biomass pretreatment is important in order to obtain high sugar and subsequently high biofuel yields on a commercial scale.

The presence of lignin in the plant cell walls provides recalcitrance to plant biomass, making it difficult to convert lignocellulosic biomass to sugars and other reactive intermediates during the production of biochemical and biofuels. Even though lignin is the second most abundant biopolymer on earth after cellulose, the structure and formation of lignin is very poorly understood; a better understanding of how lignin if formed is required in order to develop methods to effectively degrade it. It is quite well understood how lignin monomers or monolignols are synthesized in the cytoplasm of plant cells. However, not much is understood about how these monolignols are transported from the cytoplasm and deposited into the cell wall, cell corners and middle lamella and polymerized into lignin. This dissertation aims at understanding some of these aspects of lignification by developing methods to visualize lignin monomer deposition in plant cell walls. Lignin localization and visualization have also been attempted using fluorescent dyes and other markers, but their specificity has been a topic of\ncontention. In this dissertation, a different approach to visualize the process of lignification was developed. Monolignol analogs that accurately imitate natural monolignols but contain a bioorthogonal alkynyl functional group were developed. These monolignols could be labeled with\nvarious tags containing an azide group using a simple click chemistry reaction. The tags explored in this dissertation include fluorescent-azide dyes, which can be visualized using fluorescence microscopy. Other tags that could be used include gold nanoparticles functionalized with an azide group, which can be visualized using electron microscopy. Monolignol analogs were fed to plant tissue and were successfully incorporated into cell walls, which is attributed to the flexibility with which multiple lignin monomers are known to be deposited into the walls. These versatile monolignol analogs provide several approaches to visualize lignin deposition, as the characteristic Raman signal for the alkyne group enables its visualization using Raman microscopy without requiring an additional labeling step that kills the plant cells. In addition to exploring the\ndeposition of the monolignols in plant cell walls, the nature of their interactions with another wall\ncomponent were explored using computational chemistry. Methods based on Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) were developed to study the nature and strength of non-covalent interactions between lignin dimers and individual amino acids. This computational analysis is not only helpful in understanding the nature of lignin-protein interactions that occur in cell walls but could also be helpful in developing force fields to model larger lignin-protein interactions at the molecular level in the future, and aid in designing protein modifications to lignin in the cell wall to improve degradability, strength, or other functional or structural characteristics.

Consequently, there is a significant demand for low-latency high-performance data processing which is not only reliable but also energy efficient. The requirement of maintaining high performance at extremely low power is especially critical for mobile platforms. \n\nThe silicon MOSFET which is the workhorse of today\u2019s semiconductor industry has addressed this demand through relentless shrinking of its dimensions and steady reductions to its operating voltage. However, the benefits wrought by reducing the size of the transistor, which are detailed in Moore\u2019s law, are now under threat. If the threshold voltage of the silicon MOSFET were reduced to enable a scaling of the operating voltage, there would be an exponential increase in the off-state\ncurrent and a corresponding explosion in energy loss. This is a prominent concern for circuit designers because the sub-threshold leakage power is as significant as the active power in microprocessors.\n\nThe high sub-threshold leakage power stems from the inability of the MOSFET to provide steep switching from the on-state to the off-state.  This limit has driven efforts to look for alternative devices delivering steeper switching to extend supply voltage scaling without compromising performance. Within this effort, one steep switching device that is piquing the interest of many is the tunnel FET (TFET). In this work, we explore III-V compound semiconductors based GaAs1\u2212xSbx/InyGa1\u2212yAs Hetero-junction Tunnel Field Effect Transistors (HTFETs) for realizing energy-efficient complimentary logic. Both n-channel and p-channel HTFETs are fabricated and characterized, exhibiting best in class on-current and on-off current ratio at |Vds|=0.5V.

Moreover, we also investigate HTFET circuit design elements and benchmark its performance against corresponding implementation in sub-threshold Si-FinFET technology.

It is well known that periodic structures comprising metallic patches or apertures behave as artificial dielectrics, and screens that resemble frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) can be used as artificially synthesized materials to replace conventional dielectrics. Several designs have been developed for some applications where metamaterials were engineered by utilizing arrays of small patches or apertures to realize desired electromagnetic behavior for antenna applications, thus improving their performance. \n\nThis dissertation begins with an innovative approach for engineering artificial materials or commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) materials to achieve any dielectric constants that we need to implement flat lens design, which does not suffer from the shortcomings of metamaterials, typically required in designs based on transformation optics (TO). We refer to this technique as \u201cdial-a-dielectric\u201d (DaD). The DaD method is the one in which we tweak the dielectric constants of the artificial material by placing square patches on top of dielectric rings, to achieve the desired dielectric constants. We investigate the use of the proposed technique for synthesizing artificial dielectrics to the design of metasurfaces (e.g., reflectarrays) that have wider bandwidths than those of the present designs, which also utilize resonant elements that rely on resonant inclusions (e.g., narrow bandwidth, dispersion, and loss).  \n\nNext, we introduce an alternate design that extends the DaD-based lens design procedure to the dielectric-only reflectarray problem. This reflectarray design is realized by printing dielectric blocks on a PEC ground plane. The proposed reflectarray design gives a linearly increasing gain variation compared to the bandwidth as typically reported in the literature (i.e., 10% for the designs based on the conventional approach).\n\nThis dissertation further explores the design of a flat lens, which utilizes multilayer frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) in free space. The lens can be space-qualified since, unlike conventional designs for lenses, it does not need to use dielectric materials. We further describe a systematic procedure for realizing the requisite radially varying phase shifts, by using locally periodic multilayer FSSs to realize a lightweight, low-profile and low-cost design. \n\nNext, we present a novel approach for designing a low-cost phase-shifting device based on the use of reconfigured FSS screens, which have relatively low insertion loss and are easy to fabricate. Our goal is to provide an arbitrary phase shift to the antenna element of an array that it would require for precise control of the beam-pointing to communicate with a satellite. \n\nLastly, offset-fed-metal-only reflectarrays realized by using cross-slot and cross/cross-groove phasing elements, which are 2D and 3D FSS elements, respectively, are presented. These reflectarray designs are suitable for space applications in which the use of dielectrics is not desired. These FSS elements are chosen such that they can be 3D-printed. We also compare the performances of reflectarrays with the existing metal-only reflectarray design to show the efficacy of the proposed method. The design investigated shows the improved gain, aperture efficiency, and low-profile features.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16153], "author_name_tesi": "Pandey, Shaileshachandra V", "last_name_ssi": "Pandey", "middle_name_ssi": "V", "first_name_ssi": "Shaileshachandra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Raj Mittra", "Dr. Ram Narayanan", "Dr Jim Breakall", "Dr. MICHAEL T LANAGAN", "Dr. MICHAEL T LANAGAN"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Raj Mittra, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. Ram Narayanan, Committee Chair", "Dr Jim Breakall, Committee Member", "Dr. MICHAEL T LANAGAN, Committee Member", "Dr. MICHAEL T LANAGAN, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FSS", "Artificial Engineered material", "Lens", "Variable phase-shifter", "Space-qualifiable Lens", "Metal-only Reflectarray", "Dielectric-only Reflectarray", "DaD Lens", "Dual-band Metal-only reflectarray"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Comparative Genomics Provides Insights into Herpesvirus Transmission, Spread, and Virulence", "id": "15255uup104", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15255", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Herpesviruses are widespread in the nature infecting almost every animal\nspecies. They are significant pathogens for human health and agriculture.\nHerpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) causes millions of chronic infections in humans,\nwhereas Marek\u2019s disease virus 1 (MDV-1) is a herpesvirus of poultry of great\neconomic importance. Clinical outcomes of HSV-1 infections are diverse, ranging\nfrom surface lesions, keratitis, to severe and potentially lethal encephalitis.\nSimilarly, MDV-1 causes nervous system disease and lymphomas in chickens\nwith mortality approaching 100% in absence of vaccination. Both HSV-1 and\nMDV-1 are alphaherpesviruses and contain a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)\ngenome as their genetic material. Using high throughput sequencing (HTS) and\ncomparative genomics, this dissertation seeks to explore the genetic basis of\ntransmission, spread and virulence of these viruses.\nIn this dissertation, transmission of HSV-1 between individuals has been\nexplored using transmission events between father-son and mother-neonate pair.\nComparative genomics of these genomes showed that at the consensus level\nHSV-1 genomes can be identical even after multiple cycles of latency and\nreactivations. However, we observed that at the population level the parental and\ntransmitted virus can be quite different. HSV-1 isolates obtained from the fatherson\npair were further characterized phenotypically using a murine animal model.\nBy examining a series of phenotypic properties, we concluded that parental and\ntransmitted viruses can also preserve their phenotypes over decades.\nTransmission and spread of MDV-1 in the field was depicted by\nsequencing viral isolates form poultry farms in central Pennsylvania. This study\npresented the first case of MDV-1 genomes obtained directly from chicken\nfeathers and poultry dander without the use of cell culture. We showed that these\ngenomes were highly identical at the consensus level, but differed at the\npopulation level, corroborating the findings from transmission events of HSV-1.\nThis study was also important in laying foundation for studying MDV-1 genomics\nusing field samples. We further extended comparative genomics of field samples\nof MDV-1 to understand the evolution of virulence in MDV-1. To this effect, we\nsequenced 64 spatially and temporally separated field isolates of MDV-1 and\nexplored the role of recombination in emergence of highly virulent isolates over\ntime. We found that paths to emergence of virulence in field isolates of MDV-1 is\ncomplex and could be explained by multiple recombination events between field\nisolates.\nWe also employed comparative genomics to identify genetic markers of\nvirulence in HSV-1 and MDV-1. In HSV-1, we identified amino acid variations in\nthe viral protein VP22 that reliably distinguish low-virulence isolates from highvirulence\nisolates of HSV-1. To understand the biological importance of these\namino acid residues in determining HSV-1 virulence, I have initiated the process\nof engineering viral mutants. These recombinant viral mutants can then be tested\nagainst the parental virus using in vitro and in vivo assays. Similarly, through\ncomparison of field isolates of MVD-1 we have identified nucleotide substitutions\nthat distinguish MDV-1 isolates of different pathotypes.\nDespite their widely recognized clinical and veterinary importance, there is\na paucity of knowledge concerning the evolution and genetic basis of virulence\nfor herpesviruses. Understanding the genetic diversity of parental and\ntransmitted virus is invaluable to getting a comprehensive picture of a\ntransmission event. Likewise, assessing the genetic diversity of clinical and field\nsamples gives insights into the genetic variation in the circulating viral strains.\nInformation obtained from these studies can be used to develop vaccines and\ntherapeutics that account for the diversity present in the circulating strains.\nSimilarly, identification of genetic markers of virulence can be used to gauge\nvirulence level based on viral genotype providing a powerful tool for future\ndiagnostics and prediction of clinical outcomes. Understanding how and why field\nisolates of MDV-1 became more pathogenic is of significance not just for poultry\nindustry, but also in the wider context of combating increased incidence of drug\nand vaccine resistance among other pathogens.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16936], "author_name_tesi": "Pandey, Utsav ", "last_name_ssi": "Pandey", "first_name_ssi": "Utsav", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Moriah Louise Szpara", "Moriah Louise Szpara", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Istvan Albert", "Andrew Fraser Read", "Timothy Charles Meredith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Moriah Louise Szpara, Dissertation Advisor", "Moriah Louise Szpara, Committee Chair", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Member", "Istvan Albert, Committee Member", "Andrew Fraser Read, Outside Member", "Timothy Charles Meredith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Herpes Simplex Virus", "Marek's Disease Virus", "Bioinformatics", "Molecular Biology", "Virology", "Genomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "RELATING MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF DRY AND GRANULATED PHARMACEUTICAL POWDER FORMULATIONS WITH TABLET QUALITY PARAMETERS", "id": "9779", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "586", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mechanical properties of powders are very important to understand various unit operations such as storage, flow, granulation, compaction, and mixing. Pharmaceutical tablets are formed by compressing powder formulations consisting of ingredients such as filler, binder, lubricant, disintegrant, and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). These powder formulations are sometimes granulated to improve flow and compression property as well as to prevent segregation of ingredients specially the API. Tablet quality is important for industries involved in compaction such as pharmaceutical, food, ceramic, and cosmetic. The important tablet\u2019s mechanical quality parameters include hardness, strength, and friability. These are important with respect to tablets\u2019 handling, performance during operations such as packaging and transportation. If the tablet quality can be predicted based upon the fundamental mechanical property of the powder prior to its manufacture, powder industries will save significant amount of time and money. Binder plays an important role in the tablet quality; therefore, there is a definite need to understand and evaluate its effect. Therefore, the goal of the research was to predict the tablet quality based on the mechanical behavior of the powder formulations prior to manufacturing of the tablet with an emphasis on the effect of binder.\nThe formulations used for the research were composed of Avicel (filler), Methocel (binder), Magnesium stearate (lubricant), Ac-Di-Sol (disintegrant), and Acetaminophen (active pharmaceutical ingredient). Three different levels of methocel (binder): 0 (none), 5, and 10%, were used in powder formulation. The proportion of other four ingredients were maintained at same level, i.e., Avicel: Acetaminophen: Ac-Di-Sol: Magnesium stearate:: 0.90:0.05:0.03:0.02. Hydrostatic triaxial compression (HTC) and conventional triaxial compression (CTC) tests were conducted using a cubical triaxial tester (CTT) for both dry blended and wet granulated formulations at different binder contents. Modified Cam-clay constitutive equation parameters such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, compression index, spring-back index, shear modulus, and failure strength were determined using data obtained from HTC and CTC tests. Tablets at binder contents of 5 and 10% and without binder were formed at 70 and 90 MPa. Diametral strength, axial penetration strength, indentation hardness, and friability tests were conducted to quantify the tablets\u2019 quality parameters. Relationships between the mechanical properties of dry blended and granulated pharmaceutical powder formulations and tablet quality parameters were developed. \nFor dry blended formulations, at 10 MPa/min loading rate, the bulk modulus increased with increase in the isotropic pressure and binder content in all cases. At 20 MPa/min, the bulk modulus was maximum at 0% binder followed by those at 10 and 5% binder content. Increase in bulk modulus with increase in the binder content was also observed for granulated formulations at both loading rates of 10 and 20 MPa/min.\nIn case of dry formulations, the compression index value increased with pressure; whereas, for granulated formulations, at 10 MPa/min loading rate, the compression index values at 10% binder content increased with pressure. At 5% binder, the compression index decreased and then increased. At 20 MPa/min loading rate, the compression index decreased and then increased for both binder contents. \nIn all cases, the spring-back index value increased with pressure. In case of dry blended formulations at 10 MPa/min loading rate, the spring-back index value decreased with binder content. At 20 MPa/min, the spring-back index value for dry powder formulations was lowest at 0% binder content followed by 10 and 5% binder contents. In case of granulated formulations, at both loading rates, the spring back index for 10% binder content was higher than for 5% binder content. \nThe shear modulus increased with increase in the confining pressure in all cases including dry and granulated formulations. In case of 20 MPa/min loading rate also, the shear modulus increased with increase in the confining pressure in all cases. \nVarious tablet quality parameters such as diametral strength, axial penetration strength, indentation hardness, and friability were evaluated. Diametral strength, axial penetration strength, and indentation hardness, values were higher at 90 MPa than at 70 MPa compression pressure for all binder contents. These parameters increased upto 5% binder content; thereafter, very little or no change was observed when binder content increased from 5 to 10%. This shows that increase in binder after 5% only had marginal effect on tablet quality parameters. Furthermore, binder content of around 5% appears to be optimum for tablet formation for ingredient and proportions used in this study. In case of granulated formulations, the values increased slightly when binder changed from 5 to 10%. Friability of tablets was higher for tablets formed at 70 MPa compared to those formed at 90 MPa compression pressure for all binder contents for both dry and granulated formulations. The friability decreased with binder content upto 5%; thereafter, it increased when binder content increased from 5 to 10% for dry blended formulation. In case of granulated formulations, the friability decreased when binder content increased from 5 to 10%. The friability for granulated formulations was less than for dry blended formulations.\nStatistical relations were developed between tablets\u2019 quality parameters and the powder mechanical properties at different binder contents and loading conditions. The regression equations between each tablet quality and powder property having r2 value more than 0.8 were selected for prediction. For dry formulations, spring-back index and compression index were found most suitable for predicting diametral strength, indentation hardness, and friability. In case of axial penetration strength, compression index, spring-back index, and shear modulus at higher loading rate had good relation (r2 > 0.8) for tablets formed at 90 MPa. For tablets formed using granulated formulations, compression index, spring-back index, and bulk modulus were found most suitable for predicting diametral strength, axial penetration strength, indentation hardness, and friability. An elastic energy-based approach was successfully used to explain the relationship of tablet quality parameters with spring-back index.\nBulk modulus values increased and spring-back index values decreased with binder content for dry formulations at 10 MPa/min loading rate. Bulk modulus increased with binder content at 10 MPa/min while decreased at 20 MPa/min loading rate for granulated formulations. Spring-back index increased with binder content for granulated formulations. All tablet quality parameters changed upto 5% binder content; thereafter, only marginal effect was observed. For granulated formulations, tablet quality parameters were only marginally different from each other at 5% and 10% binder contents.\nIn summary, the mechanical properties of dry and granulated pharmaceutical powder formulations at different loading conditions and binder contents were determined. Tablets were formed using the same formulations and quality parameters were quantified. \t\nStatistical relationships were successfully developed between powder property and tablet quality. Based on the results it can be stated that the powders\u2019 fundamental mechanical properties can be used to predict the quality of the tablet.

With the impact of globalization, low skilled jobs and high wages have vanished, leaving behind a workforce with a deficit of high-level skills. In order to improve the knowledge and skills of the workforce, the federal government has attempted to provide the workforce with four different training programs since the 1960s. The four programs- Manpower Development and Training Act, Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, Job Training Partnership Act, and Workforce Investment Act- have never been evaluated for training effectiveness. Although the federal government has spent millions of dollars each year funding these last three national training acts including the most current workforce investment act, the government has failed to conduct an evaluation study to look at the impact of training on the nation\u2019s human capital. Audits have been conducted by the General Accounting Office and have not determined the impact or return on investment of the money invested in the workforce.\n\tThe purpose of this study is to examine the impact of The Workforce and Economic Development Network in Pennsylvania (WEDnetPA) funded training program. This program is funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development. Although the program is marketed as WEDnetPA, the formal name of this program is Guaranteed Free Training (GFT). WEDnetPA is a network of thirty-three community colleges, universities, and colleges referred to as partners that work with eligible companies. This qualitative study is based on thirty-nine interviews with personnel from selected companies, four leaders from the same selected companies, and five WEDnetPA partners. Research questions focused on: 1) how WEDnetPA funded training impacted the knowledge/skill level of the workforce in selected companies in Pennsylvania 2) how selected companies that received WEDnetPA funded training place value on or measure the free funded training and 3) how selected companies managed transfer of learning with WEDnetPA funded training. Selected participants in the study were required to meet the following criteria: 1) receive WEDnetPA funded training in 2006 and/or 2007 2) be located in five of the workforce investment boards in Pennsylvania 3) represent small, medium, and large companies 4) received business operations and/or communication-teambuilding training that was classified as basic skills training in the WEDnetPA category for the pilot study and 5) classified in the advanced materials and diversified manufacturing and lumber-paper-wood industry clusters with regard to the final study.\n\tOverall, the WEDnetPA funded training program has provided numerous companies financial benefit and the opportunity to offer their workforce a variety of training that would not have been possible without the funding. Many companies have made big strides in improving processes and procedures and strengthening their competitive place in the global battle. The workforce has seen victory by obtaining promotions due to their new knowledge and skill sets and continued employment in their companies. In terms of the negative aspects, companies had suggestions for improvements for WEDnetPA. Some of the suggestions were directed at administration of the program as well as dollar amounts awarded and the regulations of the program. Recommendations for future research and practice are suggested for the WEDnetPA funded training program.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [331], "author_name_tesi": "Pane Whiteford, Anita ", "last_name_ssi": "Pane Whiteford", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anita", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William J Rothwell", "William J Rothwell", "David Lynn Passmore", "Wesley Edward Donahue", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William J Rothwell, Dissertation Advisor", "William J Rothwell, Committee Chair", "David Lynn Passmore, Committee Member", "Wesley Edward Donahue, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["training and development", "WEDnetPA", "workforce education", "measurement and value"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Impact of Asthma Self-management Education On Childhood Asthma Outcomes", "id": "24992", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11212", "abstract_tesi": "Asthma is one of the most common respiratory disorders in children.

Human glioma cells have modified iron metabolism, as well as an elevated level of the iron storage protein, ferritin. Previously it has been shown that the down-regulation of one of the ferritin subunits, H-ferritin, increases sensitivity of human glioma cells to the chemotherapeutic agent BCNU. In this dissertation, I tested the hypothesis that H-ferritin down-regulation increases radiosensitivity in glioma cells, explored the mechanism for the sensitization effect, and investigated the potential of targeting H-ferritin as an adjuvant therapy in glioma treatment.\nIn the first set of studies, the down-regulation of H-ferritin was achieved by liposomal transfection in human glioma cell line U251. Although H-ferritin down-regulation alone did not affect cell proliferation, the combination of down-regulation and high doses of radiation led to significantly enhanced toxicity. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the increased sensitivity I used a cell culture approach. The in vitro assay revealed that H-ferritin down-regulation was accompanied with disruption in iron metabolism, increased oxidative stress, and decreased stability of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2\u03b1. Furthermore, in the presence of ionizing radiation, down-regulation of H-ferritin was associated with decreased level of the phosphorylated form of ATM kinase. These effects are consistent with the radiosensitization effect observed.\nIn a second series of studies, the effect of H-ferritin down-regulation was evaluated in glioma stem cells (GSCs), a subpopulation of glioma cells that are preferentially resistant to therapies and are capable of self-renewal. Different from the cell line study, the down-regulation of H-ferritin resulted in an inhibition in GSCs proliferation. An increased level of PARP cleavage was observed, suggesting that induction of apoptosis may be the cause of this inhibition in proliferation. Although no significant oxidation damage was observed in GSCs with H-ferritin siRNA transfection, these cells demonstrated enhanced radiosensitivity, suggesting a different mechanism may be involved in GSCs radiosensitization. Moreover, in vivo study showed that tumors formed by GSCs can be sensitized to chemotherapeutic agent by H-ferritin siRNA transfection.\nFinally, I explored an active targeting strategy by developing the liposomes to enhance the transfection efficiency and specificity in vivo. Maleimide lipids were incorporated in the formulation of liposomes for IL-13 ligand conjugation for the purpose of targeting IL-13 receptor, a specific surface marker for human glioma. The characterization of the maleimide liposomes confirmed their quality. Both DNA complexation and ligand conjugation of the liposomes were demonstrated by biochemical analysis. Although the original formulation we developed was not efficient at gene delivery, the modified formulation with lower maleimide content significantly improved the delivery and expression of DNA plasmid, suggesting the potential of maleimide liposomes as transfection tools.\nIn summary, my dissertation project focused on the improvement of glioma treatment through targeting the iron management protein, H-ferritin. The data showed that down-regulation of H-ferritin sensitizes glioma cells to radiation, presumably through the induction of oxidation damage. In GSCs, the growth inhibition effect of H-ferritin down-regulation is more remarkable. My study also supported the potential of liposomes with ligand targeting as good candidates for delivery vehicles in gene therapy. The current project suggests that H-ferritin down-regulation is a promising adjuvant therapy in glioma treatment and that I have provided evidence of a novel method for efficient delivery.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11272], "author_name_tesi": "Pang, Min ", "last_name_ssi": "Pang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "James Robert Connor", "Thomas E Spratt", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby", "Richard Bernard Mailman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Dissertation Advisor", "James Robert Connor, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby, Committee Member", "Richard Bernard Mailman, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Glioma", "radiosensitization", "H-ferritin", "iron metabolism", "glioma stem cells", "liposomes"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Effects of hemodynamic forces on endothelial cell hydraulic conductivity", "id": "6133", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6993", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Starling\u2019s hypothesis that fluid movement across the microvascular wall is determined by the transmural differences in hydrostatic and osmotic pressures was tested using an in vitro model comprised of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) grown on a porous support.

The global osmotic pressure difference across the endothelial layers was thus either 0 or 20.3 cm H2O.  When the luminal concentration of BSA was changed from 1% to 5.5% at a hydrostatic pressure differential of 5, 10 or 20 cm H2O, no reverse flow (in the reabsorption direction) was observed even though the hydrostatic pressure differential was far below the global osmotic pressure differential. In another case, the hydrostatic pressure differential was dropped quickly from 20 to 5 cm H2O while a constant osmotic pressure differential was maintained by 5.5% BSA in the luminal reservoir.  A strong transient reabsoption flow was observed over a 30 second period which diminished to undetectable levels within 2.5 minutes; then a sustained steady state filtration flow was observed after 20 minutes.

Pure oscillatory shear stress of 0 \u00b1 20 dyne/cm2 had no effect in changing Lp. Furthermore, superposition of oscillatory shear stress on steady shear stress suppressed the effect induced by steady shear stress. Shear reversal was not necessary for the oscillatory shear stress to function. This phenomenon is very different from BAEC which showed a significant sustained increase in  Lp for steady shear stress and only oscillatory shear stress with shear reversal could exert an inhibitory effect on steady shear stress induced increase in Lp.\nIntracellular calcium was first investigated for its role in the signal transduction pathway between shear and Lp. The addition of BAPTA-AM (10 uM), an intracellular calcium chelator, reduced the baseline Lp by 40% over a period of 10 minutes, significantly different from 20% due to the \u201csealing effect\u201d over the same period, suggesting the involvement of a calcium pathway in the regulation of hydraulic conductivity. The transient increase in  Lp of HUVEC in response to 1 U/ml thrombin, that is known to be calcium dependent, was delayed by incubation with 10 uM BAPTA-AM for 30 minutes, confirming the requirement of calcium in the thrombin response. However, the transient increase of Lp by shear stress does not seem to be calcium dependent, because blocking of intracellular calcium pathway by using BATPA-AM had no effect in blocking the shear response of Lp. \nShear stress also increased nitric oxide (NO) production in HUVEC. However, the shear response of HUVEC Lp  did not seem to be NO dependent. Increasing NO concentration with SNAP (500 uM), an exogenous NO donor, had no effect on HUVEC Lp, while  decreasing of NO production with L-NMMA (100 uM), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, had no effect on shear response of HUVEC Lp. Other pathways than calcium and NO must be involved in the shear response.\nFinally the total content and phosphorylation state of the tight junction protein occludin was investigated under experimental conditions. 1 U/ml thrombin and 10 dyne/cm2 shear stress increased occludin phosphorylation significantly at time 30 minutes, which was consistent with the time profile of Lp in response to thrombin and shear, respectively. 10 \u00b1 15 dye/cm2 oscillatory shear stress, 500 uM SNAP, and 100 uM L-NMMA did not change occludin phosphorylation while they had no effect on Lp as compared with controls, suggesting that occludin phosphorylation is a determining factor for hydraulic conductivity. The total amount of occludin did not change after the application of steady and oscillatory shear stresses, but 1 U/ml thrombin decreased occludin total content at 30 minutes, suggesting that phosphorylation of occludin led to occludin degradation and Lp elevation. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6990], "author_name_tesi": "Pang, Zhengyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Pang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhengyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Norman R Harris", "Abdellaziz Ben Jebria", "James S Ultman", "John Michael Tarbell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Norman R Harris, Committee Member", "Abdellaziz Ben Jebria, Committee Member", "James S Ultman, Committee Member", "John Michael Tarbell, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["occludin", "hydraulic conductivity", "endothelial cell", "shear stress", "signal transduction pathways"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "The Role of Posttranscriptional Regulation in the Pathogenesis of Allergic Asthma ", "id": "14538rlp208", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14538", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Asthma is a highly prevalent disease characterized by chronic inflammation, airway\nremodeling, and mucus production.

These datasets are commonly stored and processed across multiple machines due to limited capabilities (such as memory and CPU) of single machines. However, many available analysis tools are still lacking in terms of an ability to fully utilize existing distributed-memory architectures. As these datasets are usually processed and analyzed in the form of graphs or meshes, we propose scalable and efficient approaches for graph and mesh computations for distributed-memory systems in this dissertation. Although graph and mesh computations are closely related regarding their parallelization approaches, some of their unique characteristics still need to be addressed separately. Thus, we organize the dissertation into two parts.  The first part is for distributed graph computations, and the second part is for distributed mesh computations.\n\nIn the first part of the dissertation, we focus on graph computations. First, we study a problem of Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) by analyzing and evaluating three well-known SSSP algorithms, i.e, Dijkstra's,  Bellman-Ford, and $\\Delta$-stepping algorithms. We implement these algorithms to run on distributed-memory systems based on a bulk synchronous parallel model. Their performances are evaluated and compared. Next, we propose our SSSP algorithm by combining advantages of these SSSP algorithms and utilizing a two-dimensional (2D) graph layout for our graph data structures. Then, we extend our study of the 2D graph data structures and optimization approaches to other well-known graph algorithms including breadth-first search, approximate diameter, connected components, and PageRank on various real-world graphs. Our objective is to implement an efficient graph framework for distributed-memory systems that works efficiently for many graph algorithms on various graph types. Finally, we propose graph coloring algorithms that are scalable and can be efficiently used for both graph and mesh applications.\n\nIn the second part of the dissertation, we focus on parallel mesh computations on distributed-memory systems. First, we propose a domain decomposition method for 2D parallel mesh generation based on the MeTis partitioner with angle improvements. Our method is fast and gives good subdomain quality in terms of subdomain angles and mesh quality. Next, we propose a general-purpose parallel mesh warping method based on a parallel formulation of a sequential, log barrier-based mesh warping algorithm called LBWARP. Our parallel algorithm utilizes a modified distributed graph data structure with a vertex ghosting technique resulting in an efficient mesh warping algorithm which employs minimal communication. Since the algorithm needs to solve a sparse linear system with three right-hand sides (for 3D meshes), i.e., are each for the final $x$-, $y$- and $z$-coordinates in the deformed meshes, we also provide three parallel sparse linear solvers that support multiple right-hand sides for users to choose from based on the size of the problem and the number of available cores. These solvers further improve the overall performance of the algorithm, especially when a sequence of multiple deformations is required.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14911], "author_name_tesi": "Panitanarak, Thap ", "last_name_ssi": "Panitanarak", "first_name_ssi": "Thap", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kamesh Madduri", "Kamesh Madduri", "Suzanne M.

Given the wide range of functions that proteins fulfill in nature, there is much interest in utilizing them for human needs in many areas, such as biofuels production, materials, and medicine. However, nature rarely provides a protein that is perfect for a specific human application, necessitating the use of engineering methods to improve or create desired properties. Computations are an essential tool for the de novo design of proteins. This dissertation focuses on the use of antibodies as a model protein system to develop de novo protein design methods.\nDue to their many useful experimental and medicinal applications, antibody structures and their natural mechanisms of generation have been extensively studied. They are an excellent system for learning de novo protein design principles, as their structures have many modular features and their functions are limited to binding, not catalysis. Antigen binding by antibodies is primarily driven by the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). Models of the possible backbone conformations of the CDRs (i.e. canonical structures) were generated. These models were used in the Optimal Complementarity Determining Regions (OptCDR) method to allow the de novo design of antibody CDRs to bind any specified antigen epitope. Next, a database of Modular Antibody Parts (MAPs) analogous to the human germline genes used to make antibodies was created and shown to be able to predict antibody structures with a high degree of accuracy. Analysis of calculations involving OptCDR, MAPs, and other work outside the scope of this dissertation suggested that the computational protein engineering methods currently in use needed to be improved. This led to the development of the Iterative Protein Redesign & Optimization Suite of Programs for the (re)design of proteins.

This unstable vibration phenomenon can be described as an instance of \u201cpower hop\u201d, a type of dynamic instability also seen in agricultural tractors, wheeled construction vehicles, and other off-highway vehicles (OHVs). A model that can adequately predict dynamic instability is a necessary first step in developing controls solutions that might be able to mitigate or even prevent unstable motion from occurring.\n\nThe 3-DOF model describes a rear-wheel-drive (RWD) mining haul truck operating on a non-deformable, sloped surface. Analytical stability criteria are derived through closed-form eigenvalue analysis of the equations of motion while neglecting all damping terms. Numerical stability analysis studies parameter sensitivity for a representative haul truck with a 250 ton payload capacity in two payload scenarios: operation at empty vehicle weight (EVW) and operation at 100% payload capacity, or gross vehicle weight (GVW).\n\nResults show that the 3-DOF predicts dynamic instability. By utilizing a stability margin, the results further show that there are numerous different operating point configurations that could potentially lead to dynamic instability. Of the 33 million cases tested in each of the two different payload scenarios, 21% are deemed potentially unstable for the empty truck and 38% are deemed potentially unstable for the loaded truck. Furthermore, potentially unstable cases exist over the full range of parameters simulated. The analytical stability criteria derived from the undamped equations of motion do not always correlate with the numerical eigenvalue analysis of the full set of equations of motion that include all damping terms.\n\nInstability is shown to be heavily dependent on road grade, tire stiffness and damping properties, the location of the vehicle\u2019s center of gravity, and forward travel speed. The model mainly predicts instability on severe road grades and at high speeds. A result not seen in previous studies of power hop in agricultural tractors is the prediction of dynamic instability when a vehicle travels downhill. While instability on uphill grades primarily occurs when the rear axle is stiffer than the front axle, the opposite is observed on downhill grades. Increased tire damping is shown to reduce the likelihood of instability in both loading scenarios and on all grades.

Machine learning is not only a new paradigm for building software and systems, it is bringing social disruption at scale. There is growing recognition that ML exposes new vulnerabilities in software systems, yet the technical community\u2019s understanding of the nature and extent of these vulnerabilities remains limited. \n\nIn this thesis, I focus my study on the integrity of ML models. Integrity refers here to the faithfulness of model predictions with respect to an expected outcome. This property is at the core of traditional machine learning evaluation, as demonstrated by the pervasiveness of metrics such as accuracy among practitioners. \n\nA large fraction of ML techniques were designed for benign execution environments. Yet, the presence of adversaries may invalidate some of these underlying assumptions by forcing a mismatch between the distributions on which the model is trained and tested. As ML is increasingly applied and being relied on for decision-making in critical applications like transportation or energy, the models produced are becoming a target for adversaries who have a strong incentive to force ML to mispredict. \n\nI explore the space of attacks against ML integrity at test time. Given full or limited access to a trained model, I devise strategies that modify the test data to create a worst-case drift between the training and test distributions. The implications of this part of my research is that an adversary with very weak access to a system, and little knowledge about the ML techniques it deploys, can nevertheless mount powerful attacks against such systems as long as she has the capability of interacting with it as an oracle: i.e., send inputs of the adversary\u2019s choice and observe the ML prediction. This systematic exposition of the poor generalization of ML models indicates the lack of reliable confidence estimates when the model is making predictions far from its training data. \n\nHence, my efforts to increase the robustness of models to these adversarial manipulations strive to decrease the confidence of predictions made far from the training distribution. Informed by my progress on attacks operating in the black-box threat model, I first identify limitations to two defenses: defensive distillation and adversarial training. \n\nI then describe recent defensive efforts addressing these shortcomings. To this end, I introduce the Deep k-Nearest Neighbors classifier, which augments deep neural networks with an integrity check at test time. The approach compares internal representations produced by the deep neural network on test data with the ones learned on its training points. Using the labels of training points whose representations neighbor the test input across the deep neural network\u2019s layers, I estimate the nonconformity of the prediction with respect to the model\u2019s training data. An application of conformal prediction methodology then paves the way for more reliable estimates of the model\u2019s prediction credibility, i.e., how well the prediction is supported by training data. In turn, we distinguish legitimate test data with high credibility from adversarial data with low credibility. \n\nThis research calls for future efforts to investigate the robustness of individual layers of deep neural networks rather than treating the model as a black-box. This aligns well with the modular nature of deep neural networks, which orchestrate simple computations to model complex functions. This also allows us to draw connections to other areas like interpretability in ML, which seeks to answer the question of: \u201cHow can we provide an explanation for the model prediction to a human?\u201d Another by-product of this research direction is that I better distinguish vulnerabilities of ML models that are a consequence of the ML algorithms from those that can be explained by artifacts in the data.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16643], "author_name_tesi": "Papernot, Nicolas ", "last_name_ssi": "Papernot", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nicolas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick D.

Descriptive screening criteria for IOR methods are used to select the appropriate recovery technique according to the fluid and rock properties. The existing screening guidelines neither provide information about the expected reservoir performance nor suggest a set of project design parameters that can be used towards the optimization of the process. \nIn this study, artificial neural networks are used to build two neuro-simulation tools for screening and designing miscible injection, waterflooding and steam injection processes. The tools are intended to narrow the ranges of possible scenarios to be modeled using conventional simulation, reducing the potentially extensive time and energy spent in modeling studies and analysis.\nA commercial reservoir simulator is used to generate the data supplied to train and validate the artificial neural networks. The proxy models are built considering four different well patterns with different well operating conditions as the design parameters. Different expert systems are developed for each well pattern. The screening networks, or forward application, predict oil production rate and cumulative oil production profiles for a given set of rock and fluid properties, and design parameters. The inverse application provides the necessary design parameters for a given set of reservoir characteristics and for the specified (desired) process performance indicators.\nThe results of this study show that the networks are able to recognize the strong correlation between the displacement mechanism and the reservoir characteristics as they effectively forecast hydrocarbon performance for different reservoir types undergoing diverse recovery processes. The inverse proxy models are able to predict the operation conditions at the same time that accurately provide the complete oil production profiles. Both neuro-simulation applications are built within a graphical user interface to facilitate the display of the results. \nThe project design tool-box helps in the quantitative project assessment if proper combinations of expected project abandonment time and total oil recovery are provided for the same reservoir.

Following an introduction, chapter 2 describes the qualitative and quantitative enzymatic activity of protein arrays on PS-b-PMMA thin film and shows that the deposited proteins retain their characteristic catalytic properties even after surface immobilization. Comparative protein adsorption behavior of proteins on different polymer thin films is discussed in Chapter 3, showing that the PS-b-PMMA is better than homopolymers PS or PMMA and polymer blend PS/PMMA thin films. Chapter 4 describes the method of creating high quality ZnO NR array and further discusses a highly sensitive and effective telomeric repeat elongation (TRE) assay by exploiting the fluorescence signal enhancing ability of ZnO NR platforms. This result shows that the novel ZnO-base TRE assays can be successfully used for detecting active telomerase. As telomerase is a useful biomarker in cancer diagnosis and screening, our ZnO NR-based TRE assays may prove to be not only useful in basic biological research but also in clinical testing. In Chapter 5, ZnO platforms are further exploited in ultrasensitive detection of disease biomarkers cytokines. The detection sensitivity achieved by using ZnO NR method is in the subfemtogram per milliliter level, which is 3-4 orders of magnitude more sensitive than the conventional assay detection limits. This detection sensitivity is achieved without the need for indirect enzyme reactions of specialized instrumentation.

Implantation of electrode arrays in the brain is a complex and invasive undertaking that requires excision of skull bone, removal of dura mater and piercing of pia mater meningeal layer. Typically, neuronal spiking events are detected by their relatively large amplitudes as compared to the rest of the signal or by their characteristic shapes. In order to improve microelectrode\u2019s recording performance, researchers have experimented with multiple electrode substrates, insulation materials and implant strategies. However, all the currently available electrode systems have limited clinical applicability because they produce highly variable recording outcomes and most fail to record neural activity beyond one year. It has been hypothesized that this variability is modulated by implantation trauma and tissue response associated with presence of foreign material in the neural tissue. Development of optimal electrode structures and implant strategies has been impeded by an absence of objective techniques to quantify and monitor the state of tissue-electrode interface in order to understand its degradation and effectively compare different electrode platforms.\nThis dissertation documents the development of novel approaches to help the processes of implantation, neuronal spike detection-quantification, and real-time interface monitoring. It reports an objective and innovative algorithm that utilizes information on multiple electrodes of an array to improve neuronal spike detection and measurement that can be used to quantify the recording performance of the interface. In doing so it also achieves significant reduction is downstream data processing. Minor addition to standard implantation techniques is reported that uses collagenase enzyme enabled disruption of the meningeal layer in order to reduce implantation trauma and electrode insertion forces as well as improve chronic recording. The technique can also help in the development and deployment of flexible biocompatible electrodes.  In the last part of this dissertation, the safety of employing magnetic resonance imaging as a non-invasive imaging modality for real-time tracking of the longitudinal tissue changes around the electrode is demonstrated. It is shown that neural firing events are consistently detected even after numerous imaging sessions thereby pointing to the viability of the tissue close to the uninsulated recording site of the microelectrode. Taken together, these contributions lay the ground-work for a multitude of studies to realistically measure electrode performance and better understand interface degradation thereby enabling improved identification and incorporation of modifications to electrode structure, implantation and monitoring processes with the aim of extending microelectrode functionality.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3430], "author_name_tesi": "Paralikar, Kunal J", "last_name_ssi": "Paralikar", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Kunal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ryan Clement", "Ryan Clement", "Andrew Webb", "Alistair J Barber", "Nadine Barrie Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ryan Clement, Dissertation Advisor", "Ryan Clement, Committee Chair", "Andrew Webb, Committee Member", "Alistair J Barber, Committee Member", "Nadine Barrie Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microelectrode array", "microelectrode insertion force", "collagenase", "neural implants", "brain-machine interface", "common average referencing", "inter-electrode correlation", "common-noise", "multi-unit recording", "Spike detection", "Biomedical MRI", "neurophysiology", "MRI heating", "Immunohistology"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE FROM \nEXHAUST GASES BY AMINE SPRAYS\n\n", "id": "11209", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5701", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new method for carbon dioxide capture is illustrated here without the use of contacting mechanisms like membranes and scrubbers.

First the flow over a sphere is analyzed and the drag coefficient and Nusselt number is compared with published data which matches within 5%. The properties of (MEA) and MEA carbamate are simulated using the Gaussian software which are used for the evaporation and the reaction analysis. In evaporation study, the evaporation of water droplets is analyzed and compared with published data using the discrete phase model (DPM) in FLUENT. The analytical and the CFD results matched within 10%. Amine evaporation model was then analyzed to measure the evaporation from the amine droplets in order to find out the feasibility of this model which shows that the amine droplet evaporation is very low compared to water droplet evaporation due to its low saturation vapor pressure. Finally the reaction is simulated in laminar and turbulent regimes with and without the presence of other exhaust gases like H2O, N2, O2 and CO. Shrinking core model has been used to simulate the reaction. The results prove that the method of CO2 capture using amine sprays is possible even in practice in turbulent flow regime.

The current capacity only meets 86.4% of population demand even though Indonesia is ranked 10th in global coal reserves and 4th in geothermal potential. According to Indonesia\u2019s 35,000 MW power plan, the government is making an effort to increase energy consumption from coal and renewable energy by 2025. Coal and biomass power plants play an important role in the generation of electricity in Indonesia. Approximately 25% of Indonesia\u2019s energy consumption is from coal, and power generation is continually moving towards cleaner methods, such as gasification and utilization of renewable energy. Due to high volcanic and tectonic activities, it is predicted that more than 27,000 MW of potential untapped geothermal energy is available in Indonesia. Combining several of the most advanced clean technologies could change the foreseeable focus of power generation methods. Coal-based, gasification combined cycle power plants integrated with supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2)-based geothermal systems could potentially generate electricity with high efficiency and low carbon emissions, without the intermittency associated with solar and wind power.\n\nThere is an increased need for carbon dioxide sequestration from fossil fuel plants, due to rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 levels. Ready-to-sequester carbon dioxide is available from a coal based, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plant with high efficiency. This CO2, while being sequestered, can also be used as a heat transfer medium in a geothermal power generation system in Indonesia. This thesis examines the novel concept of utilizing CO2 from a coal-based IGCC power plant as a heat transfer medium to extract renewable geothermal energy in order to offset the energy required for compression in the CO2 sequestration process. The Darajat geothermal field in Indonesia has a high reservoir temperature that is available at relatively shallow depths. Based on earlier work, it is assumed that 10% of the carbon dioxide is sequestered within the reservoir while drawing thermal energy from a 2.6 km depth, to generate power using a direct CO2 turbine and a binary power plant. All 680 kg/s of supercritical CO2 are distributed evenly among 10 injection wells in the reservoir to be used as a heat transfer medium, and for partial sequestration. The carbon dioxide stream from the 10 production wells and the compressed supercritical CO2 from the IGCC plant are recirculated back to the injection wells. Heat rejection from the CO2 produced is accepted by the Organic Rankine Cycle to generate power. The IGCC plant CO2 output from the pre-combustion and post-combustion processes is matched with the amount of CO2 sequestered to maintain constant circulation for the geothermal plant. ASPEN Plus\u00ae software was used to simulate the geothermal power plant, circulation system, carbon dioxide heat extraction from the reservoir, and each fluid necessary to drive a closed loop Organic Rankine Cycle.\n\nAmong the working fluids examined, isobutane, n-butane, R134a, and R245fa, the most suitable for the Darajat system, which has a 200\u00b0C reservoir temperature, was isobutane. This study also discusses the energy generated from a carbon dioxide turbine and a recuperated Organic Rankine Cycle by varying the temperatures and pressures of carbon dioxide injection based on an existing Darajat geothermal reservoir located in Indonesia. Power generated by a direct CO2 turbine and a binary power plant is compared with the 17.4 MW of power required to compress the CO2 for sequestration. CO2 utilization in the supercritical phase is found to be more advantageous than subcritical CO2 for power generation when using a direct CO2 turbine. A deeper, 3.6 km injection point for the Darajat-Enhanced Geothermal System yields 18.3 MW with approximately 15 years of lifetime, while a natural Darajat geothermal system with the existing wells can potentially improve the technical feasibility with a larger CO2 flow rate for additional power generation.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14395], "author_name_tesi": "Pardede, Fabiola Marella", "last_name_ssi": "Pardede", "middle_name_ssi": "Marella", "first_name_ssi": "Fabiola", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarma Pisupati"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarma Pisupati, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["geothermal", "carbon dioxide", "supercritical", "Indonesia", "IGCC", "utilization", "sequestration", "simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF MICROWAVE METHODS FOR MEASURING BLOOD PERFUSION IN TISSUE USING A FLOW MIMICKING PHANTOM SETUP", "id": "v405s9361", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12479", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Blood perfusion is an essential constituent in the physiology of a biological tissue, having an essential role in the transportation of oxygen, nutrients, and pharmaceuticals to the tissue. Evaluation of skin perfusion is an important issue in the clinical medicine area such as the treatment of peripheral vascular diseases. Despite its significance, there is no widely acceptable method of noninvasively measuring local absolute perfusion without expensive radiological imaging devices. Therefore, in this thesis, a method is designed and proposed to use microwave heat for noninvasively measuring blood perfusion. Here, a microwave antenna is used to heat a tissue. Then the temperature signature of the tissue while cooling provides a measure of perfusion. A complete system would be made up of two parts, i.e., a microwave source for heating and a radiometric system, for temperature measurement of the target tissue. The focus of this project is on the microwave heating system. Although, a preliminary radiometry system was also tested. In order to achieve the main objective of the measurement of blood perfusion in tissue, a phantom setup has been developed. This setup includes dual-mode microwave antennas (two annular slot antennas on a single substrate) of two frequencies, precisely 0.9 GHz and 3.5 GHz. The 3.5 GHz antenna is used to feed a custom made radiometer fabricated utilizing a commercially available C band satellite low noise block. The 0.9 GHz antenna has been designed to heat a porous medium, (a soaked sponge) placed under it. This porous medium mimics a real tissue to provide more realistic results. To mimic perfusion during the testing, water flows through the sponge similar to the blood flow in a real body tissue. A thermistor is placed inside the sponge to measure the temperature variation for the experiment. Also, a flowmeter is used to precisely set flow levels between zero to a few mL/min (e.g., 5 mL/min) which corresponds to the expected rate of blood perfusion within tissues. The temperature in the setup is raised by different amounts, typically 0.2 \u00b0C to 0.5 \u00b0C in different experiments to observe results. The sponge is irradiated by 0.9 GHz microwave power at a range of 1 - 5 W.\nMeasurements were performed with different sponge thicknesses, and with or without the radiometer in place. Circulation within the sponge was improved by boring a hole through it. Consistent thermistor readings were obtained without the radiometer. However, when the radiometer was used, readings for both the thermistor and radiometer were not consistent. This is speculated to be due to thermal interference caused by the DC electrical power consumed by the radiometer.\nThe annular slot antennas used in the setup were designed by using ANSYS HFSS (ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, Pennsylvania). For radiometry, different frequencies enable RF reception from different depths in the tissues, as the penetration depth of the microwaves decreases as the frequency increases. To understand flow distribution in the developed blood perfusion measurement system, the flow in the setup was also simulated by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling software, i.e. ANSYS CFX (ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, Pennsylvania).  To further study the experimentally observed microwave heating, the power absorption pattern of the antenna is exported from HFSS as the local specific absorption rate (SAR) in the tissue. This power absorption pattern of the antenna is in turn imported in CFX to be utilized in the simulation. This process would help in verifying the procedure, which has been developed for the measurement of blood perfusion, by comparing the results of simulation with those obtained from the tests performed on the phantom setup. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12566], "author_name_tesi": "Pardeshi, Jayendrasingh R", "last_name_ssi": "Pardeshi", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Jayendrasingh", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mohammad Reza Tofighi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mohammad Reza Tofighi, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microwave heating", "microwave radiometry", "blood perfusion measurement", "bioheat transfer", "temperature decay", "microwave heating", "temperature decay curve", "microwave flowmetry", "perfusion measurement"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Local and broad scale changes in North American small mammal community structure: the late Pleistocene through the late Holocene\n", "id": "10393", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4145", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new late Quaternary fauna from Don\u2019s Gooseberry Pit in the Black Hills of South Dakota provides the first continuous late Pleistocene through late Holocene paleobiological record for the North American Northern Great Plains.

These faunas ranged in age from the last Full Glacial to the late Holocene. Late Glacial faunas were more diverse than late Holocene faunas. Glacial sites were also more taxonomically similar along an East-West gradient. This finding suggests that this gradient steepened during the transition into the Holocene. Heterogeneous environments during the last glacial could produce such patterns, and are also consistent with the presence of late Pleistocene non-analog faunas. These results indicate that North America not only experienced extinctions of organisms at the end of the last glacial, but that some late Pleistocene habitats were also wiped from the modern landscape. These findings provide relevant details about how future climate change may affect patterns in terrestrial biodiversity.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4123], "author_name_tesi": "Pardi, Melissa Irene", "last_name_ssi": "Pardi", "middle_name_ssi": "Irene", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Russell W Graham", "Russell W Graham"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Russell W Graham, Thesis Advisor", "Russell W Graham, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["multivariate analysis", "paleoecology", "Holocene", "Pleistocene", "glacial", "small mammals", "non-analog"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Randomness of Restricted Value Martingales, Selection Rules, and Graph Sequences", "id": "13948jjp307", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13948", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation we consider the classical notions of stochasticity and randomness as they pertain to several areas of mathematics.  We look at three main topics: martingales, selection rules, and graphs.\n\nFirst, we discuss the notion of martingales and focus our attention onto restricted value martingales; this allows us to make some insights into the notion of $A$-valued randomness for a set $A$ of real numbers.  Martingales are the classical mathematical representation of a betting strategy; they are defined in a way that nicely accommodates the notion of ``win your bet if you are successful and lose your bet if you are unsuccessful.''  By looking at restricted value martingales, we are able to focus on betting strategies that only allow wagers of certain amounts.  Bavly and Peretz defined notions of anticipation and evasion to relate the relative strengths of restricted value martingales; this provides a natural way to compare $A$-valued randomness and $B$-valued randomness for different sets $A, B \\subseteq \\R^+$.  Essentially, $A$ evades $B$ when there is an $A$-martingale that can succeed against any countable set of $B$-martingales, and otherwise $B$ anticipates $A$ -- to get the similar notion of single evasion one only needs to consider a single $B$-martingale.  Bavly and Peretz characterized the evasion/anticipation relationships when $A$ is bounded and $B$ is bounded away from $0$, as well as when $B$ is well-ordered, however the question of what happens when $B$ has $0$ as an accumulation point remained open.  We look at various geometric sequences for our set $B$ to help answer this question with regard to single evasion/single anticipation.\n\nSecond, we consider selection rules and how they relate to normality and randomness.  Traditionally, a selection rule indicates how to select a subsequence from a given binary sequence based on the initial segment of the sequence that has already been viewed.  Clearly one must ask what sort of properties are preserved under the application of a selection rule, however there are two equally important ways to formulate this question: for a fixed set of sequences what selection rules always output an element of that set when applied to an element of that set, and for a fixed set of selection rules what properties of sequences are preserved?  Von Mises made the intuitions of these questions rigorous with the notions of kollektivs and admissible selection rules.  We focus on sequences and selection rules defined in terms of computability, normality, Martin-L\\\"{o}f randomness, and the strong law of large numbers.\n\nLastly, we apply selection rules to graphs and graph sequences as well as discuss several notions of randomness for graphs.  Graphs as mathematical objects are intuitively more structurally complicated than binary sequences, however both graphs and sequences are useful to consider in the context of information content.  As a result, it makes sense to look at any probabilistic notion that applies to binary sequences -- stochasticity, normality, randomness -- as it applies to graph objects.  We define selection rules for graphs and show that homogeneous countably infinite graphs are preserved under selection by a certain class of selection rules.  We also consider several possible characterizations of randomness for graphs.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15335], "author_name_tesi": "Pardo, John Jacob", "last_name_ssi": "Pardo", "middle_name_ssi": "Jacob", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jan Reimann", "Jan Reimann", "Stephen Simpson", "Manfred Denker", "Martin Furer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jan Reimann, Dissertation Advisor", "Jan Reimann, Committee Chair", "Stephen Simpson, Committee Member", "Manfred Denker, Committee Member", "Martin Furer, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Randomness", "Selection Rules", "Restricted Value Martingales", "Normality", "Graphs"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Income inequality and crime across nations reexamined", "id": "7184", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5046", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many scholars believe that income inequality is a major causal factor affecting the\nhomicide rate across nations. Indeed, many empirical studies have found a positive\nrelationship between income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, and the\nhomicide rate. These prior studies, however, have some limitations that cast doubt on the\nrelationship between income inequality and homicide. The current dissertation, divided in three research papers, addresses these limitations.\nThe first paper presents a cross-national analysis based on a sample of 63 nations\nthat isolates the effects of income inequality and poverty on the homicide rate. The\nevidence indicates that income inequality is unrelated to the homicide rate, once poverty\nis adequately measured. Poverty is positively associated with the homicide rate. The\nanalysis also suggests that the negative relationship between social welfare and the\nhomicide rate observed in previous studies is attributable to poverty reduction, not\nincome inequality reduction. \nThe second paper presents a re-analysis of the International Crime Victim Survey\ndata. It is based on a sample of 122,491 respondents across 28 nations and tests whether\nrelationships between income inequality and physical assault, robbery, burglary, and theft\nare observed when some limitations of prior studies are addressed. These limitations\ninclude (1) the measurement of poverty, (2) the measurement of crime, (3) model\nspecification in aggregate vs. multilevel analyses, (4) measurement error with capital-city\nsamples, (5) and the analysis of sub-samples of nations instead of the full sample of\navailable nations. The evidence indicates that nations\u2019 levels of income inequality are not\nassociated with the frequency of any of these crimes. Nations with greater levels of\npoverty, however, have more frequent robberies, burglaries, and thefts, but not physical\nassaults. \nThe third paper utilizes Heckman selection regressions to detect and correct\nsample selection biases in cross-national analyses of the WHO homicide data and the\nICVS data. The results indicate that while the level of development and the level of\nsocio-political freedom are strongly associated with the probability that nations will be\nincluded in the substantive samples, these selection effects do not produce substantive\nbiases. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5022], "author_name_tesi": "Pare, Paul-Philippe Pare ", "last_name_ssi": "Pare", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Paul-Philippe Pare", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard B Felson", "D Wayne Osgood", "George Farkas", "C Shannon Stokes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard B Felson, Committee Chair", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "George Farkas, Committee Member", "C Shannon Stokes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Criminology", "homicide", "ICVS", "income inequality", "poverty"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ORIENS, BASKET AND PYRAMIDAL CELLS DURING IN VITRO\nSEIZURE-LIKE EVENTS IN CA1 OF THE RAT HIPPOCAMPUS\n\n", "id": "10902", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5328", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Network activity in the brain is shaped by interactions between cells. There is limited knowledge about such interactions in pathological conditions like epilepsy. Previous results from our laboratory showed unique interplay between pyramidal cells and oriens lacunosum-moleculare interneurons in rat hippocampal CA1 during in vitro seizure-like events (SLEs). To further investigate the interactions between different sub-types of interneurons and pyramidal cells, we performed simultaneous dual and triple whole cell patch and extracellular recordings in pyramidal, basket and oriens cells in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Triple immunofluorescence confirmed the identity of patched cells. We measured spike frequency, spike and subthreshold correlation between these cells before, during and after single seizure-like events (SLEs) and during the inter-seizure intervals (ISIs). We confirmed our previous findings and found a distinctly different firing pattern between the perisomatically-innervating basket cells and the dendritically-innervating oriens cells during 4-aminopyridine induced SLEs in the presence of low magnesium. At the pre-ictal stage of the SLE the subthreshold correlation between pyramidal and basket cells is strong; oriens cells show high firing frequency, whereas the basket cells show a gradual increase. At the start of the SLE, the previously strong subthreshold correlations between pyramidal and basket cells decrease; all 3 cells show increased firing rates with basket and oriens cells reaching their maximum firing rates. Following this, subthreshold correlations for all 3 cells decrease; oriens cells go into depolarization block that is characterized by total spike failure, whereas pyramidal and basket cells continue firing. SLE termination is defined by conditions returning to pre-ictal dynamics. During the ISI all three cell types increase their firing activity at different times before onset of the subsequent seizure. \nOur findings further emphasize the importance of cell-type specific differences in interactions between excitatory and inhibitory cells during SLEs. Other similar cellular dynamics may be representative of the hippocampal circuitry under conditions that cause general hyperexcitability. We also show a significant gradual increase in spike rates in both the inhibitory and excitatory cells, starting at least a minute before seizure onset. These findings expand on the current knowledge of seizure formation patterns and can be used in studies of seizure prediction models. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5323], "author_name_tesi": "Parekh, Ruchi ", "last_name_ssi": "Parekh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ruchi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Schiff", "Steven Schiff", "Bernhard Luscher", "Bruce Gluckman", "Byron C Jones", "John R Cressman", "Jokubas Ziburkus"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Schiff, Dissertation Advisor", "Steven Schiff, Committee Chair", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Member", "Bruce Gluckman, Committee Member", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member", "John R Cressman, Committee Member", "Jokubas Ziburkus, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["4-aminopyridine", "hippocampus", "seizures"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "From Bacterial Adhesion to Biofilm Formation: Impact of Humic Acid and Quorum Sensing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7481", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4102", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Biofilms are surface-associated bacterial populations prevalent in engineered and natural settings. Biofilms cause fouling on industrial equipment, infection of medical implants, and can be utilized in bioremediation. A better understanding of biofilm formation will generate more effective biofilm control strategies. Initial bacterial adhesion (the first stage of biofilm development) was studied in the presence of humic acid. It was determined that changes in the concentration of humic acid on silica do not affect Escherichia coli adhesion. Based on this evidence and other reports that showed bacterial adhesion is not strongly affected by external surface chemistries, it was concluded that studying the events following bacterial adhesion could garner more insight into biofilm formation. For many species quorum sensing is necessary for proper biofilm formation; thus the effect of quorum sensing signal diffusion on biofilm development was examined. Set-backs in creating engineered biofilms prompted the investigation of the effect of signal diffusion on quorum sensing alone. \n<p>\nQuorum sensing is almost always regarded as a population density effect in three-dimensional bulk samples of bacteria. Two-dimensional samples of Vibrio fischeri cells adhered onto glass surfaces were created to examine the effect of local population densities on quorum sensing. The two-dimensional bacterial populations allowed for the measurement of both time and distance effects on quorum sensing, which were previously very challenging to access in typical three-dimensional bulk samples. Thus, quorum sensing was considered in terms of signal diffusion. A diffusion model guided the experiments and showed that for a given cell spacing (density) and diffusion time there exists a \u201ctrue quorum\u201d\u2013 a number of cells necessary for quorum sensing. The experiments showed that quorum sensing occurs locally in surface samples and is a function of cell density as well as diffusion time. With proof that quorum sensing occurs locally, engineered biofilm experiments were revisited. Adhesion force measurements of small isolated biofilms served as preliminary tests of the \u201ctrue quorum\u201d concept. Diffusion in quorum sensing and that there exists a \u201ctrue quorum\u201d are important to consider for biofilm formation.

While functional microelectromechanical systems provide several advantages, their reduced length scales also pose several formidable problems in terms of powering and actuating such devices. One promising means to address this problem is to incorporate small amounts of high-energy-density energetic materials on-board microscale systems, and use the stored chemical energy for power and actuation, which is known as micropyrotechnics. The reactive properties of materials change significantly as their dimensions shrink to the nanoscale domain, and the high reactivity of nanoscaled/nanostructured materials can be exploited to form a new class of energetic materials known as nanoenergetic materials (nEMs), which are capable of sustaining a reactive wave propagation at sub-millimeter length scales. A nEM of significant interest in this regard is nanoporous silicon (PS), which is capable of high energy densities, efficient chemical energy conversion even at small length scales, and monolithic integration onto microscale devices. This work deals with understanding the behavior of porous silicon-solid oxidizer composites, which is required for successful micropyrotechnic applications. \n\nAs a part of this research effort, PS was prepared from silicon substrates with different dopant atom types and concentrations, and was characterized using SEM, BET, and sound speed measurements. Energetic composites were prepared by depositing oxidizers (sodium, magnesium, or calcium perchlorate salts) within the nanoscale pores. The reactive wave propagation within the energetic composites was characterized by high speed imaging and spectroscopic temperature measurements using multiwavelength pyrometry. The interaction between the condensed phase and the gaseous medium was studied in a high speed shadowgraphy system used to visualize the density gradients in the gas. Thermal analysis by simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to characterize the interfacial reactions between PS and the oxidizer. The experimental results were combined with thermochemical equilibrium calculations and reaction models to understand the reactive wave propagation in PS composites.\n\nA detailed combustion analysis of energetic PS composites indicated that heavily doped P or N-type silicon substrates (resistivity between 0.001 to 0.005 \u03a9-cm) yield PS substrates which always exhibit low reactive wave propagation speeds on the order of 1 m/s. PS composites prepared from heavily doped N-type substrates were found to yield higher reactive wave propagation speeds than PS prepared from heavily doped P-type substrates, which is a consequence of the difference in the microstructure of the PS formed. Changing the amount of oxidizer within the pores of PS etched from heavily doped silicon substrates was found to not affect the reactive wave propagation speeds or temperatures obtained. A reaction model incorporating thermochemical equilibrium calculations and diffusion considerations showed that the inhomogeneity of PS-oxidizer composites is important, despite pore diameters being on the order of a few nanometers. Further, one of the significant problems associated with PS composites, the deposition of oxidizer within the pores, was shown to be less important than the specific surface area and microstructure of PS in terms of the reactive wave propagation.\n\nPS prepared from low doped P or N-type substrates (with resistivity between 1 to 20 \u03a9-cm) was found to exhibit reactive wave propagation speeds on the order of 100 to 1000 m/s. The high speeds in the case of PS prepared from low doped N-type substrates were found to be a consequence of randomly forming micro-crack patterns. PS etched from low doped P-type substrates exhibited the highest reactive wave propagation speeds (~1000 m/s) and were capable of driving strong shock waves in the gaseous medium above the PS. Activation energy estimations from thermal analysis, and sound speed measurements were used to narrow down the mechanisms responsible for the high speed reactive wave propagations as a combination of heat transfer through the condensed phase and permeation of hot gaseous products within the porous layers, or reactive wave propagation assisted by high speed crack propagations in crystalline PS.\n\nA novel technique to control the reactive wave propagation speeds in nEMs was developed, and successfully demonstrated using PS. Standard microfabrication techniques such as photolithography and plasma etching were used to create organized microscale structures in PS, which resulted in a two-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the reactive wave propagation speeds (from 2 m/s to 500 m/s). The creation of controlled microscale structures in PS results in the formation of hierarchical structures which organize the reactive material (the nanoscale features) in specific geometric configurations (imposed by the microscale features) conducive to effective permeation of the gaseous reaction products, which results in enhanced reactive wave propagation rates.

Accordingly, many studies on Korean immigrants have focused on health-related issues on senior citizens, academic achievement of children of immigrants, or identity establishment of adolescents. Although previous research studies provided remarkable understanding, there are only limited studies on how first generation Korean immigrants utilize formal or informal learning in their acculturation process. Furthermore, the shaping and reshaping of first generation Korean immigrants\u2019 identity in new social setting are not yet fully understood. \nThis qualitative study used narrative inquiry to investigate life history of four first generation Korean American women who came to America between their early 20s and mid-30s. The study sought specifically to understand first generation immigrants\u2019 acculturation process, shaping and reshaping identity, practice of culturally embedded learning approach, and negotiating identity in the process of finding \u201cplace\u201d in new social setting. Data were collected through semi-structured, in-depth interviews and analyzed according to narrative analysis procedures, methods of reflection, and writing.\nThis study revealed that participants\u2019 acculturation process was selective, and the selection was based on retaining their pre-established self-image, identity, and social status they had possessed in Korea. As a method of adjusting to the new situation to comply with their \u201calready set\u201d identity, they attempted formal and informal education. The participants found informal learning was more challenging than formal learning.

We need comprehensive Cyber-infrastructure supporting genomics and phylogenetics to help fungal biologists and plant pathologists reap the benefits of such data. Advances in sequencing technology also have changed the methods of addressing fundamental research questions about fungal and Oomycete biology. Among pathogenic eukaryotic organisms, Fusarium and Phytophthora are targeted mainly due to their practical importance in agricultural and environmental health and sustainability and/or human health. Phytophthora Database (PD; http://www.phytophthoradb.org/), an online platform, was developed to support accurate and rapid identification of newly isolated Phytophthora and to help characterize and catalog the diversity and evolutionary relationships within the genus. Its sequence database has grown from sequences of 1-9 loci from ~1,500 isolates (representing 82 species) in 2008 to sequences of 1-12 loci from ~2,500 isolates (>130 species).  At the same time, the Cyber-infrastructure for Fusarium (CiF; http://www.fusariumdb.org/) was designed to support archiving and utilization of rapidly accumulating data and knowledge for genus Fusarium. The CiF consists of FUSARIUM-ID, Fusarium Comparative Genomics Platform (FCGP), and Fusarium Community Platform (FCP). The FUSARIUM-ID archives phylogenetic marker sequences from most known species along with information associated with characterized isolates and supports strain identification. FCGP provides a comprehensive resource for Fusarium genomics, including multiple functional database and visualization tools including a genome browser and phylogenetic tree viewer. Based on the constructed genomics and phylogenetics platforms, analysis of the species boundaries in the Fusarium oxysporum species complex has been addressed. Species boundaries can be recognized using different species concepts such as the morphological, biological, and phylogenetic species concepts. All these concepts are compatible with the evolutionary species concept. In particular, the phylogenetic species concept has been widely accepted and applied to species recognition in fungi and the genus Fusarium. Previously, phylogenetic hypotheses concerning this species complex were inferred using two loci in various strains of F. oxysporum, but a well-resolved species tree has yet to be defined. In this study, high-resolution phylogenetic analyses were conducted using 40 genomic regions evenly distributed across F. oxysporum chromosomes. Using the sequenced genomes of members of the F. oxysporum species complex, 40 multi-locus markers were selected and used to build phylogenetic trees individually and collectively. Individually constructed phylogenies for 24 loci show the same pattern of topology as the collectively constructed 40 multi-locus phylogeny; however, phylogenies for 12 loci show different topology in phylogenetic trees. Also, four individually-constructed phylogenies show very low bootstrap support on most branches, creating un-resolved trees. Analysis of polymorphic sites at the 40 multi-locus regions shows 89.3% similarity between the Fusarium oxysporum species complex and Fusarium verticillioides, and 96.3% similarity among members of the Fusarium oxysporum species complex. We noticed two distinct groups within the Fusarium oxysporum species complex, however, and Fusarium oxysporum strain II5 (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp cubense) was generally separated from 10 other Fusarium oxysporum species complex strains, suggesting it might be another group of the F. oxysporum species complex. This ongoing study demonstrated the utility of the data and tools in the Fusarium Comparative Genomics Platform (FCGP) in conducting comprehensive phylogenetic analyses.

While existing research has provided ample evidence on how why financial frauds are damaging to the social networks, research had been limited on how firms can recover afterwards. The first study in this dissertation focuses on the repairing of the network itself. I investigate the factors that can potentially expedite the network repair process, enabling the firm to regain its network size more quickly.

Overall network compositional changes showed significant concave curvilinear effects, indicating that a balanced change is important in improving performance after financial fraud. Specific types of tie changes such as losing negative reputation ties and gaining high-visibility ties also showed significant impact on subsequent performance, providing partial support for the proposed hypotheses.

Among the potential variables, expression abundance is one of the most important factors for determining protein evolutionary rates; the variation in gene expression appears to contribute to the evolutionary divergence and phenotypic diversity among species and individuals. Here we perform studies to characterize variation in gene expression patterns on the inactive X chromosome, and across duplicate genes in mammals. Specifically, several questions are addressed in greater detail in this dissertation. First, what genomic signals determine the expression status of genes on the inactive X chromosome? Second, does selection operate differently on genes that escape inactivation vs. genes that are inactivated? Third, do genomic features and motifs predict candidate X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) genes? Fourth, what drives the rapid expression divergence observed between human paralogs? To investigate these issues, we use genome-scale gene expression data and bioinformatic analyses. We find that (1) the majority of the sequences enriched in the vicinity of inactivated genes are found within L1 repeats (indicating an involvement of L1 repeats in X chromosome inactivation), and these sequences capture most of the genomic signal determining inactivation; some unique or overrepresented motifs in boundary regions (indicating that they are candidates for the boundary elements separating genes with different X inactivation profiles) are also found; (2) escape genes experience stronger purifying selection than inactivated genes at both the protein-coding and gene expression levels, and this effect largely results from the importance of function and dosage of escape genes; (3) sequence motifs that are mutually exclusively overrepresented in either XLMR or non-XLMR genes effectively capture genomic signals to distinguish between them; and (4) turnover of transcription start sites, structural heterogeneity of coding sequences, and divergence of cis-regulatory regions between duplicate gene copies play a pivotal role in determining the expression divergence of duplicate genes. Results from these studies provide valuable insights into the regulation of inactive X expression and understanding the X chromosome inactivation\nmechanism, and will further aid in our understanding of long-range control of gene expression on the X chromosome. Moreover, they provide important information for understanding human transcriptome heterogeneity, complexity, and evolution.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1254], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Chungoo ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chungoo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Laura Carrel", "Francesca Chiaromonte", "Webb Colby Miller", "Claude Walker Depamphilis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Dissertation Advisor", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Chair", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member", "Francesca Chiaromonte, Committee Member", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Member", "Claude Walker Depamphilis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["X CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION.

Scalability is the NoC's most valuable asset, which makes it ideal for larger designs. However, the NoC architectures have intrinsic challenges from various aspects such as reliability issues stemming from the deep sub-micron technology, and more stringent requirement for high-performance and low-power consumption for multi-core chips. A plethora of research has been conducted in these areas and along this line, in this thesis, I present a set of techniques targeting high-performance, energy-efficient, and reliable NoC architectures.\nThe advent of deep sub-micron technology has exacerbated reliability issues in on-chip interconnects. In particular, single event upsets, such as soft errors, and hard faults are rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with. This spiraling trend highlights the importance of detailed analysis of these reliability hazards and incorporation of comprehensive protection measures into all Network-on-Chip (NoC) designs. In this thesis, I examine the impact of transient/permanent failures on the reliability of on-chip interconnects and develop comprehensive counter-measures to either prevent or recover from them. In this regard, I propose several novel schemes to remedy various kinds of error symptoms, while keeping area and power overhead at a minimum. The proposed solutions are architected to fully exploit the available infrastructures in an NoC and enable versatile reuse of valuable resources.\nOn the other hand, increasingly diminishing feature sizes have rendered the interconnect as the primary bottleneck in terms of both latency and power consumption in on-chip systems. It is, therefore, imperative to optimize the network infrastructure to maximize performance. Research has primarily focused on architectural improvements within the router and the development of deadlock avoidance/recovery schemes. The latter tend to rely on fairly complex algorithms, which are sometimes infeasible to implement in NoCs due to their resource-constrained nature. In this thesis, I introduce a new NoC topology and architecture which injects data into the network using four sub-NICs (Network Interface Controllers), rather than one NIC, per node. The proposed scheme achieves significant improvements in network latency and energy consumption with only negligible area overhead and complexity over existing architectures. Most importantly, this implementation is inherently deadlock-free, thus eliminating the need to rely on specialized, resource-hungry algorithms for deadlock avoidance. \nIn an effort to improve network performance, I also propose a dynamic path management scheme that exploits network traffic information during switch arbitration. Consequently, flits transferred across frequently used paths are expedited by traversing a reduced router pipeline. This technique also allows pipeline bypassing for frequent paths, further improving the performance while incurring only minimal area / power overhead.\nRecent introduction of 3D chip design methodologies encourages 3D NoC architecture. Since three dimensional (3D) integration has emerged to mitigate the interconnect delay problem, exploring the NoC design space in 3D can provide ample opportunities for designing high performance and energy-efficient NoC architectures. However, without proper countermeasures against its inherent flaws such as thermal problem and increased vulnerability to error sources, its advantage would be despoiled. In this thesis, I propose a 3D stacked NoC router architecture, called MIRA, which unlike the 3D routers in previous works, is stacked into multiple layers and optimized to reduce overall area requirements and power consumption. I discuss the design details of a four-layer 3D NoC and its enhanced version with additional express channels, and compare them against a (6\u00d76) 2D design and a base line 3D design. The proposed multi-layered NoC routers can outperform the 2D and na\u00efve 3D designs in terms of performance and power. \nIn summary, the overall aim of this research is to design high-performance, energy-efficient, and reliable on-chip networks considering advanced technologies applicable to NoCs.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1590], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Dongkook ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dongkook", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "George Kesidis", "David Jonathan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das, Committee Chair", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "George Kesidis, Committee Member", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Network-on-Chip", "on-chip interconnection", "low-power", "reliability", "router architecture"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ULTRASONIC TRANSDERMAL GLUCOSE MONITORING AND INSULIN DELIVERY USING CYMBAL TRANSDUCER ARRAYS\n\n", "id": "9994", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1878", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As a practically portable ultrasound system for transdermal drug delivery, cymbal transducer arrays have shown promise in several in vivo experiments using small animals.  The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of the cymbal transducer array as a pre-clinical application for transdermal insulin delivery and glucose sensing.  In order to achieve this goal, several aspects have been investigated, such as the feasibility of ultrasonic transdermal insulin delivery and glucose sensing in large animals, and a closed-loop feedback controller for regulating glucose levels.  To evaluate further the practicability of the cymbal transducer array as a pre-clinical application, in vivo experiments with transdermal insulin delivery were performed in large pigs (~ 200 lbs).  The results of the ultrasound exposure group indicate that the glucose level decreased to  -74 \u00b1 5 mg/dl at 60 minutes and continued to decrease to -91 \u00b1 9 mg/dl at 90 minutes.  In addition to the insulin delivery, the cymbal transducer array has been used in determining the glucose concentration of interstitial fluid.  From the perspective of application in humans, the in vivo studies using large pigs were designed to determine the feasibility of the cymbal transducer array in ultrasonic transdermal glucose sensing.  After 5 minutes of ultrasound exposure at Isptp = 100 mW/cm2, the glucose levels determined by the ultrasound system and glucose meter were 127 \u00b1 16 mg/dl and 131 \u00b1 5 mg/dl, respectively.  Based on the results of transdermal insulin delivery and glucose sensing in large pigs, the ultrasound systems for both applications were combined using a closed-loop feedback controller.  Four in vivo experiments were designed with large pigs to demonstrate the feasibility of the combined ultrasound system in noninvasive glucose control.  Based on the glucose level measured by ultrasound and biosensors at 20-minute intervals, the ultrasound system of insulin delivery was shown to regulate the glucose level.  During the 120-minute experiments, glucose levels were controlled in the range of 104-137 mg/dl as determined by the ultrasound system.

In order to systematically analyze how and what the participants had learned through participating in the activities of the MA, I employed Cultural and Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) as a useful theoretical framework for revealing informal learning.\nI collected data primarily through in-depth semi-structured interviews, field observations, and documents during my five months\u2019 internship as a labor counselor in the Bucheon Migrant Worker\u2019s House which as a Korean NGO, had been working for supporting migrant workers in Korea.\nSix Myanmarese male migrant workers actively participated in three activities of the MA: Culture Sharing and Exchange, Labor Counseling, and Political Awareness Building. \nI found five essential features of the participants\u2019 lived experiences as members of their ethnic community: actively taking responsibility and self-sacrifice, living with a strong sense of political vocation, getting confidence to survive in Korean Society, live while embracing various differences, escaping from daily routine and connected to a new world and dream. \nThrough this study, I also got the strong sense that through participating in the MA, six Myanmarese male migrant workers had become social and political activists beyond the typical boundary of ordinary migrant workers in Korea who were depicted as passive and oppressed beings in many recent studies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2345], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Hyungmin ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyungmin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Michael Schied", "Fred Michael Schied", "Ian E Baptiste", "Pong Suet Ling", "David Post"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Michael Schied, Dissertation Advisor", "Fred Michael Schied, Committee Chair", "Ian E Baptiste, Committee Member", "Pong Suet Ling, Committee Member", "David Post, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["migrant workers", "informal learning", "cultural historical activity theory(CHAT)", "migrant experiences", "phenomenology"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "MODEL-BASED COMPARTMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE KINETICS OF RETINOL AND BETA-CAROTENE IN HUMANS: \nSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN DESIGNING AND BUILDING MODELS FOR RETINOL PLUS EXPANDED MODELS FOR BETA-CAROTENE\n\n", "id": "11905", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2408", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vitamin A is an essential nutrient that is needed for visual function, growth and development, immune function, and reproduction. Dietary vitamin A can be obtained from two sources: preformed vitamin A in animal products (e.g., eggs and dairy) and provitamin A carotenoids, mainly &#946;-carotene in plant products (e.g., dark-green leafy vegetables and orange- or yellow-colored fruit). Kinetic studies using a mathematical modeling approach have added to our understanding of whole-body vitamin A metabolism over the past several decades. In particular, model-based compartmental analysis of retinol kinetics has deepened our knowledge about vitamin A metabolism, homeostasis, and dynamics in both humans and animal models. Here I discuss statistical considerations in designing and building improved compartment models for vitamin A kinetics in humans as well as the application of compartmental analysis to investigate the bioconversion and kinetics of &#946;-carotene metabolism.\nIn chapter 1, I review the literature including 1) previous studies that applied mathematical modeling, especially model-based compartmental analysis, to studies of vitamin A metabolism and kinetics; 2) &#946;-carotene metabolism and early studies of &#946;-carotene kinetics; and 3) statistical considerations including computer software for compartmental analysis, robustness testing, and the experimental design of vitamin A kinetic studies.  \nIn chapter 2, I discuss fixing fractional transfer coefficients in a compartmental model for vitamin A kinetics (fractional transfer coefficients are the model parameters that quantify movement into and out of compartments). One challenge related to advancing compartmental models for vitamin A metabolism in human subjects is between-subject variability in absorption of the orally-administered isotope dose. Fractional standard deviations (FSDs) related to the early stage of absorption of vitamin A showed high inter-individual variability in the compartmental model developed by Cifelli et al.. Cifelli\u2019s compartmental model (\u201coriginal model\u201d) was applied to data collected from nine American subjects after an oral dose of [2H8]retinyl acetate (data were from Tang et al.) using the Windows version of the Simulation, Analysis and Modeling (WinSAAM) software. Then, I modified the original model so that transfer coefficients for absorption were fixed (\u201cfixed parameter model\u201d) and analyzed the same kinetic data. The fixed parameter model provided a good data-model fit and none of the values for kinetic parameters were significantly different from those based on the original model. A population correlation coefficient matrix generated by Extended Multiple Studies Analysis (EMSA) in WinSAAM showed that no pairs of correlation coefficients were greater than 0.8, a threshold for numerical identifiability. I conclude that the fixed parameter model for vitamin A kinetics, with just five adjustable parameters, is simpler and more useful for studying vitamin A kinetics in human subjects without significantly affecting the accuracy of fitting the data. \nIn chapter 3, I discuss optimization of blood sampling times in vitamin A kinetic studies. One of the most important issues for an experiment using compartmental analysis in human subjects is determining the optimal times for blood collection. I investigated the hypothesis that a reduced number of blood samples would be sufficient to develop a useful compartmental model, using both a theoretical data set generated using a geometric progression and a real data set for the nine American subjects studied by Tang et al. (5 males, 4 females). Sensitivity analysis was conducted using WinSAAM to determine the most sensitive data point(s) for each parameter and eliminated the less sensitive data points. Then, I modeled the theoretical data set using the fixed parameter model for full (27 data points) and reduced data points (8 data points) to evaluate the model with reduced number of data points. Using the reduced number of samples did not change the data-model fit and the kinetic parameters for the reduced model were not significantly different from those based on the full theoretical data set. Same process was employed as for analysis of the theoretical data set using an actual data set. I decreased the number of blood samplings in original study (20 to 22 samples) to nine based on sensitivity analysis. Three samples were needed for the absorption stage before reaching the peak, one sample to define the peak of the curve, two to define vitamin A turnover, and three to describe the terminal slope. Similar to the results for the theoretical analysis, modeling the reduced data set did not significantly affect model-predicted fractional transfer coefficients or other kinetic parameters compared to the full data set model.\nIn chapter 4, I study the bioconversion of &#946;-carotene to retinol in human subjects using model-based compartmental analysis. A compartmental model was developed for retinol derived from two different sources of &#946;-carotene: [2H]&#946;-carotene contained in Golden Rice and pure [2H8]&#946;-carotene. I initially proposed a compartmental model for &#946;-carotene-derived retinol kinetics with two delay elements, one for intestinal bioconversion and the other for post-absorptive bioconversion of &#946;-carotene. After testing the initial model for each individual\u2019s data (n = 12), it was evident that there was both intestinal- and post-absorptive conversion in some subjects, whereas others did not show discernible post-absorptive bioconversion. The absorption efficiency for a single dose of &#946;-carotene ranged from 7.0 to 47.8 % in the subjects who received pure &#946;-carotene and 22.7 to 55.9 % in the subjects who provided Golden Rice derived &#946;-carotene. High between-subject variability was observed in the efficiency of bioconversion, ranging from 6.9 to 54.5 %. Individual subject bioconversion rates predicted by model-based compartmental analysis were similar to published values for conversion factors for both Golden Rice &#946;-carotene and pure &#946;-carotene. \nIn chapter 5, I present a model for &#946;-carotene metabolism developed from the data on &#946;-carotene and &#946;-carotene-derived retinol kinetics in two female subjects who received an oral dose of [2H8]&#946;-carotene using model-based compartmental analysis. To describe the kinetics of intact &#946;-carotene, the model includes one compartment for chylomicrons (remnant) &#946;-carotene, one for plasma non-chylomicron lipoprotein &#946;-carotene, and one for &#946;-carotene in the liver. Irreversible loss of &#946;-carotene from the system occurs directly from plasma in the proposed model. For retinol derived from &#946;-carotene in the enterocytes, the model includes one compartment for liver retinol, one for plasma retinol bound to retinol-binding protein, and one extravascular vitamin A pool that exchanges with plasma. The model predicted that 43 and 28 % of the &#946;-carotene dose was absorbed and that 82 and 66 % of the absorbed &#946;-carotene dose was taken up as intact &#946;-carotene by subjects 1 and 2, respectively. Total bioconversion for subjects 1 and 2 was 12.8 and 15.8 % and approximately 60 % of conversion occurred in the intestine for both participants. Only 10 % of extravascular &#946;-carotene was converted to liver retinol via post-absorptive conversion for both subjects. \nIn summary, following a review of the literature in chapter 1, chapters 2 and 3 focus on statistical considerations in designing and building a compartmental model for vitamin A metabolism. I proposed a simplified model using fixed fractional transfer coefficients and evaluated the model in chapter 2. I showed that a model in which certain parameters are fixed provides improved numerical identifiability and thus holds promise for advancing compartmental modeling of vitamin A kinetics in humans when the dose must be administered orally. Optimized blood sampling times were determined in chapter 3 with an aim to develop a protocol with a minimum number of blood samples for vitamin A kinetic studies in human subjects. I confirmed that a useful compartmental model could be developed based on data from a reduced number of blood samples. Chapters 4 and 5 present results on the bioconversion and kinetics of &#946;-carotene in human subjects using model-based compartmental analysis. A compartmental model for the retinol derived from a &#946;-carotene dose was developed and used to calculate bioconversion efficiency of &#946;-carotene to retinol in chapter 4. The proposed model showed that, in some subjects, there may be both intestinal- and post-absorptive bioconversion, whereas others may have little or no discernible post-absorptive bioconversion. In chapter 5, a compartmental model was developed to describe the kinetics of &#946;-carotene. The model included both kinetics for retinol converted from &#946;-carotene and intact &#946;-carotene. \nOverall this work contributes to our knowledge of the whole-body kinetics of retinol and &#946;-carotene metabolism in humans. I showed that the application of advanced modeling strategies such as simplifying a model by fixing hard-to-quantify parameters and optimizing sample collection times to reduce the required number of blood samples will allow for the continued advancement of compartmental models for vitamin A metabolism in humans. I also developed enhanced models for &#946;-carotene metabolism that add to our knowledge about the bioconversion of &#946;-carotene to retinol and better describe the whole body metabolism of &#946;-carotene and &#946;-carotene-derived retinol in humans. The application of model-based compartmental analysis to nutritionally-interesting compounds allows investigators to generate unique information and thus advance knowledge.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2392], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Hyunjin ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyunjin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Henry Green", "Michael Henry Green", "A Catharine Ross", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher", "Michele Shaffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Henry Green, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Henry Green, Committee Chair", "A Catharine Ross, Committee Member", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Committee Member", "Michele Shaffer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bioconversion of beta-carotene to retinol", "kinetics of retinol and beta-carotene", "model-based compartment analysis", "numerical identifiability"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "MODELING AND CONTROL OF A HIGH-SPEED SOLID-ROTOR SYNCHRONOUS RELUCTANCE FLYWHEEL MOTOR/GENERATOR\n", "id": "7577", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3210", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents a control system for a high-speed solid-rotor synchronous reluctance flywheel motor/generator. The objective of this research is to derive a model for a solid-rotor synchronous reluctance machine and provide a control scheme based on the model which has stable performance at high speed. The control system should be robust with respect to parameter deviation caused by phenomena such as nonlinear magnetics, rotor temperature variation, and inaccurate measurement. This project also includes the development of an LC filter design to improve the thermal performance of the system.\n\nA dynamic model for a synchronous reluctance machine with a conducting rotor has been developed and an open-loop current regulator for high-speed operation has been designed based upon this model. The machine dynamic model is similar to an induction machine model, yet includes a magnetic saliency of the rotor. The model is then used to calculate command voltages for a desired current in an open-loop current regulator. Techniques for parameter extraction and discrete-time models for digital implementation are presented. Experimental results consisting of a 120kW discharge of a flywheel energy storage system validates the performance of the controller.\n\nThe feedforward controller includes machine parameters, and the performance inherently relies on the correctness of these values. However, inductance and resistance parameters will vary due to flux saturation and temperature, respectively. Although a feedforward control scheme is simple, fast and effective, a direct influence which deteriorates control performance can be seen on the controller's output if the parameters are varied. Hence, a feedback compensation method has been investigated to handle the possible deviation of the parameters, and to improve the feedforward controller's robustness. A systematic approach to designing a feedback compensator for the feedforward controller is presented. Also, a stability analysis for the feedback-compensated system has been performed. Improved current tracking performance can be seen in the experimental results.\n\nThe flux-linkage/current relationships of the machine are one of the major nonlinearities to be handled in a machine controller. A more precise modeling of nonlinear magnetics becomes essential for control purposes and for understanding the limitations imposed by them. The feedforward controller can handle more diverse operating conditions by incorporating a better model of the machine dynamics. Therefore, a more accurate model to represent the nonlinear magnetics for the feedforward controller has been developed. The performance improvement by the modified model has been shown through the experimental results.\n\nAlthough synchronous reluctance machines with solid rotor construction have advantages in certain high-speed applications such as flywheel energy storage systems, the solid rotor allows the flow of eddy currents, which results in heat generation. A three-phase LC filter can reduce rotor losses due to the switching harmonics. The design and control of a high-speed synchronous reluctance drive with a three-phase LC filter has been investigated. A two-phase dynamic model of the drive which incorporates the LC filter dynamics is presented. The model is used to predict rotor losses due to switching harmonics generated by the three-phase inverter using phasor analysis. A feedforward current regulator is utilized, which is modified to include the effects of the LC filter. Experimental results validate the proposed approach.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3198], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Jae Do ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jae Do", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Heath Hofmann", "Kwang Yun Lee", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Charles E Bakis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Heath Hofmann, Committee Chair", "Kwang Yun Lee, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["magnetic nonlinearity compensation", "feedforward control", "model-based control", "energy storage system", "flywheel", "synchronous reluctance motor", "rotor current time harmonic analysis", "LC filter design"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Examination of the impact of family size on investment in children's education and educational achievement in Kenya", "id": "25878", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11428", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine whether the theory of the Quality-Quantity tradeoff of children applies in the Kenyan context.

In order to develop a cost-effective product family and product platform more proactively, designers need to investigate methods for incorporating cost information into platform-based product development.\nThere are two basic approaches to platform-based product development: (1) bottom-up approach and (2) top-down approach.

This work will contribute to efforts to determine which cognitive processes underlie language abilities, and how these processes are influenced by language experiences in bilingual environments. The findings may serve to further determine which cognitive processes could identify language impairment in bilingual children and determine whether bilingualism would be beneficial for bilingual children with language impairment.\nTypically developing children at two different locations, State College and Toronto, participated in the cross-sectional study. One group of these children was 22 monolinguals (N = 15 in State College and N = 7 in Toronto). The other group was 20 bilinguals (N = 7 in State College and N = 13 in Toronto). Accuracy and reaction times were obtained from three cognitive tasks: the Serial Reaction time task, Attention Network Test, and Visual Choice Decision task. Each task was used to measure procedural learning, attention, and processing speed ability, respectively. \nHierarchical linear regression models suggested that Procedural Learning predicted Core Language Score and Concepts and Following Directions scores in the bilingual group but not in the monolingual group. Among the three attentional network measures, Orienting predicted Word Classes-Receptive across groups in a similar manner. Processing Speed predicted Recalling Sentences in monolingual children but not in bilingual peers. These cognitive processes did not differ by language experience, in comparison between the two groups. However, a post hoc analysis suggested that within the bilingual group, variability of dual language exposure explained processing speed but did not explain the other measures. \nWe conclude that dual language experience changes the relationship between cognitive processes and language abilities but some cognitive processes such as procedural learning might be less modified by language experience than other cognitive processes such as processing speed. The future studies should focus on whether procedural learning can be used to identify language impairment and whether an advantage of processing speed could be observed in bilingual children with language impairment. These lines of research would help us to develop diagnostic tools as well as intervention in bilingual settings.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10185], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Ji Sook", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "Sook", "first_name_ssi": "Ji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Sciences and Disorders", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carol Anne Miller", "Carol Anne Miller", "Kathryn D R Drager", "Krista M Wilkinson", "Judith Fran Kroll", "Elina Mainela Arnold"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carol Anne Miller, Dissertation Advisor", "Carol Anne Miller, Committee Chair", "Kathryn D R Drager, Committee Member", "Krista M Wilkinson, Committee Member", "Judith Fran Kroll, Committee Member", "Elina Mainela Arnold, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cognitive processes", "linguistic abilities", "bilingualism", "procedural learning", "attention", "processing speed", "Serial Reaction Time"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Phylogenomic Variations and Host Adaptations of the Classical Bordetellae", "id": "17575", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8373", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding host adaptation, virulence phenotypes, and evasion of host immunity by different bacterial species and/or strains lays the groundwork for shedding light on the mechanisms behind bacterial diversity.  It will also suggest approaches to prevent new emerging infectious diseases and to design better vaccines for both humans and animals.  This dissertation investigates the genetic basis for bacterial diversity in virulence and host-pathogen interactions, using a unique set of subspecies referred to as the classical bordetellae.  These lineages are very closely related but differ in host ranges and disease symptoms.  Using comparative genomic and phylogenomic analysis, we studied seven newly sequenced genomes with four previously published genomes of the classical bordetellae (Chapter 2).  We predicted the total genome (pan-genome) of the classical bordetellae, showing substantial diversity of genome content in these closely related pathogens.  The diversity may contribute to their host specificities to different animals, including humans, and virulence phenotypes.  We also discussed multiple evolutionary mechanisms, such as mutations, loss of genes, and horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which likely contribute to host adaptation and evasion of host immunity.  Focusing on smaller gene clusters important for pathogenesis, we investigated the similarity and diversity of the Type I through Type VI secretion system loci (T1SS-T6SS) compared to other bacteria, as well as within the classical bordetellae (Chapter 3).  In addition, we identified protein candidates that are functionally associated with these secretion systems without known orthologs in other bacteria.  Understanding the functions of these proteins will likely help us comprehend the Bordetella-specific functions of these secretion systems in pathogenesis.  It will also help us find target virulence factors as treatment possibilities.  In addition, diversity of secretion systems in the classical bordetellae strains may contribute to host adaptation and virulence phenotypes, as each species uses unique sets of secretion systems.  Different evolutionary mechanisms, such as mutation, recombination, and HGT, are driving the evolution of these virulence factor loci.  Lastly, we not only predicted recombination\u2013mediated HGT as the mechanism of classical bordetellae O-antigen diversity, but we also confirmed the biological selective advantage of these diverse O-antigen serotypes in in vitro and in vivo experiments (Chapter 4).  This interdisciplinary analysis suggests that HGT has allowed for multiple Bordetella species/strains to circulate in host populations and to evade protective immunity against differing O-antigen-induced antibodies.  In summary, this dissertation contributes to linking genomic differences, evolutionary mechanisms, and biological selective pressures that may contribute to the diversity of bacterial characteristics, such as host specificity, pathogenesis, and evasion of immunity.  This work has important implications to the advancement of public health and agricultural sustainability, because our interdisciplinary analysis sheds light on bacterial speciation, diversity, and host adaptation, not only within the classical bordetellae but also in all pathogens.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8286, 8287, 8288, 8289], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Jihye ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jihye", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill", "Eric Thomas Harvill", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Webb Colby Miller", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Edward G Dudley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Chair", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Member", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Member", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bordetella", "Genomes", "Host adaptation", "Bacterial diversity", "Horizontal gene transfer", "Virulence"]}]
