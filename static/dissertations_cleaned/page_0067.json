Due to the capability of fuzzy techniques to analyze subjective and uncertain matters, fuzzy set theory is an extremely useful tool for analyzing transportation user perception.  To amplify the strength of the fuzzy approach for analyzing transportation user perception, several critical issues related to applying fuzzy techniques were reviewed, and existing fuzzy methods were adapted for use in the analysis of transportation problems.  These new methods included procedures to determine fuzzy membership functions and to generate fuzzy rules\nThis dissertation details the procedures followed to accomplish these tasks.  First of all, appropriate types of fuzzy techniques, a fuzzy aggregation method and fuzzy inference system, identified from information about the various fuzzy set theories were selected based on a review of the related literature, studies related to transportation user perception, and previous fuzzy applications.  Based on the selected fuzzy techniques, generalized fuzzy approaches for analyzing transportation user perception were developed.  To develop these fuzzy approaches for transportation analysis, several details related to how each of the fuzzy approaches is applied were investigated.  First, the relevant methods used to construct fuzzy membership functions for analyzing transportation user perception were identified.  The use of these methods was illustrated by a series of real world applications as well.  Second, the application of the fuzzy inference system, which is the most commonly used technique in fuzzy application studies, was explained.  The appropriate ways to determine the structure of the fuzzy inference system and to generate the fuzzy rules were developed based on an understanding of the problems associated with analyzing transportation user perception.  Third, a comparison was conducted between the perception of users from the general public and transportation experts.  To investigate the applicability of using the opinions of groups of experts regarding the service quality of transportation systems as the surrogate of the opinion of groups of transportation users, statistical comparisons between the two were conducted.\n\tTo improve the developed fuzzy approaches and increase their applicability, two different transportation case studies using each of the two developed fuzzy approaches were conducted.  The service quality of variable message signs (VMS) based on driver perception was evaluated using the fuzzy aggregation method.  Existing survey results regarding the service quality of VMS were re-analyzed, and the overall satisfaction of the service of the VMS were aggregated.  Experts\u2019 opinions of crash factors associated with design and operational aspects of medians were incorporated using a hierarchical fuzzy inference system to evaluate median safety.  Through the developed system, the degrees of median safety for real roadway segments were evaluated.  Then, they were compared with observed median crash data.\n\tFinally, two preliminary methods of validating fuzzy results were used, direct validation and indirect validation.  An experimental study evaluating the service quality of signalized intersections was conducted to apply the direct validation.  Using the observed crossover median crashes (CMC), the indirect validation method was applied.  Based on these two preliminary validations, the developed fuzzy approach was found to be a suitable method for analyzing what drivers generally perceive from transportation systems when the unique characteristics of humans as transportation users is considered.\n\tIn conclusion, since transportation user perception is affected by many factors and the magnitude of the effect of each factor on transportation user perception is different between factors and between users, analyses considering those differences can produce better results in solving many types of transportation problems.  For analysis of transportation user perception, the developed fuzzy approach can appropriately analyze user perception and produce more accurate and conceptually realistic results.\n\tThe basic concepts and specific procedures of the fuzzy approach developed herein can help to analyze appropriately transportation user perception.  More accurate and realistic analysis of transportation user perception is enormously important for providing better transportation service to the public.  The developed fuzzy approach enables designers and system operators to understand transportation user perception more thoughtfully, which can lead to a transportation system that is more conducive to providing service that leads to greater user satisfaction. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1585], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Dongmin ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dongmin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Martin T Pietrucha", "Eric Todd Donnell", "Sunil Sinha", "Charles Edward Antle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Martin T Pietrucha, Committee Chair", "Eric Todd Donnell, Committee Member", "Sunil Sinha, Committee Member", "Charles Edward Antle, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Transportation User Perception", "Fuzzy Sets"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Simulation and Control of a Helicopter Operating in a Ship Airwake", "id": "6756", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1601", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes a study in simulation and control of a\nhelicopter operating in proximity to a ship.

The current research employed psychophysiological, behavioral, and self-report measures in order to better understand the consequences of emotion regulation for a sample of Asian and European Americans.  In a within subjects design, participants watched emotionally evocative films and were asked to engage in expressive suppression or amplification of their emotional responses.  There were no group differences in level of emotion displayed when asked to suppress emotional reactions, however, when asked to amplify their reactions, the European Americans more readily displayed their emotion than Asian Americans.  Physiological reactivity and recovery results generally supported predictions regarding the benefits of suppression for Asian Americans and the utility of expression for European Americans. These findings suggest further cross-cultural work is needed to better understand the variety of consequences of emotion regulation strategies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12784], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Elizabeth A.", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janet K.

While there exists a great deal of research on multilingual writers\u2019 learning of academic writing, studies on textual negotiation practices and mobilization of rhetorical strategies in relation to dispositions are relatively less studied. To this end, I examine trajectories of multilingual writers learning academic writing in English, particularly how the students\u2019 rhetorical attunement\u2014\u201can ear to, or a tuning toward, difference and multiplicity\u201d (Lorimer Leonard, 2014, p. 228)\u2014is fostered in a writing classroom. Guided by Language Socialization (Duff, 2010), classroom as ecology (van Lier, 2004), and a translingual orientation to language and literacy (Canagarajah, 2013c), the study aims to answer the following research questions:  \n1.\tHow do the teacher\u2019s dispositions toward academic writing influence multilingual students\u2019 rhetorical attunement? \n2.\tHow do the students in the study negotiate linguistic, cultural, and rhetorical differences in their writing?\n3.\tWhat is the relationship among the students\u2019 negotiation practices, writing outcomes, and the process of rhetorical attunement?\nData was collected in an EAP class at an intensive English program at a research university in the Northeast U.S. in Fall, 2015. Following ethnographic methods, the data includes classroom observations, fieldnotes, audio- and video-recorded classroom interactions, semi-structured interviews, drafts of student writing, other instructional materials, and researcher journals. Interviews and fieldnotes were analyzed through a grounded approach (Strauss & Corbin, 1998) with a constant comparison method. The classroom interactions were analyzed through discourse analysis (Bloome et al., 2008), and the drafts of the student writing were analyzed focusing on negotiation strategies (Canagarajah, 2013c) and rhetorical features (Selzer, 2004). Based on the analysis, I argue: 1) The instructor\u2019s translingual disposition can positively influence students\u2019 rhetorical attunement; 2) the students negotiate differences by mobilizing their previous and evolving literacy practices and knowledge, guided by their own dispositions to language and literacy; and 3) the students\u2019 negotiations shape their rhetorical attunement.

This technique produces either two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) images with high resolution and contrast predominantly in soft tissues non-invasively, therefore, providing physiological information that other imaging modality cannot offer. The quality of a MRI image often depends on the signal to noise ratio (SNR), and the high SNR can be sacrificed to achieve either higher resolutions or shorter acquisition times. Therefore, MR research is striving for the highest achievable SNR in the images. There are two major ways to achieve higher SNR: 1) the use of higher static magnetic fields (B0), or 2) the use of optimized radiofrequency (RF) resonator for the image acquisition. However, the optimization of RF resonators at higher B0 becomes harder as the working frequency of the RF resonator increases proportional to B0 (radiation losses, lumped element losses, coil to cable interactions, low quality factors, and dielectric effect becomes problematic at high frequencies).\nThis dissertation describes conventional RF resonator designs and new concepts of RF resonators at a very high magnetic field of 14.1 T. Proton MRI will be conducted on selected biological applications requiring the RF resonator to operate at 600 MHz. The fabrication of conventional coils \u2013 a surface coil, a birdcage coil, and scroll coils \u2013 is described in the earlier chapters (chapter 2, 3, 4). These coils were fabricated to image the mouse eye in vivo, the mouse brain in vivo, and fixed 3D printed cell strands respectively. Simultaneous imaging concept is also elaborated in chapter 4. In the later chapters (chapter 5, 6), two unconventional design RF resonators \u2013 a dielectric resonator, and a patch antenna \u2013 were fabricated, tested, and compared with state of the art RF resonators to investigate the possibility of substituting the conventional RF resonators. These two designs provided higher homogeneity but less SNRs.

To date, however, all research into the field of aluminum combustion has taken place at relatively low pressures, either near atmospheric or pressures found in rocketry environments, which are orders of magnitude less than the pressures to be found in a post-detonation environment such as with thermobaric weaponry. To address this lack of data, a ballistic compressor was modified to produce peak pressures of 100,000 psi and maximum heating rates exceeding 106 K/sec to simulate a post-detonation environment.\n\nA series of tests was run with 9 and 32 \u03bcm Al particles, both with and without a nickel coating. The two sizes of particles were chosen to explore the effect of diffusion versus kinetically controlled combustion at high pressures. Previous research indicated that a nickel coating on aluminum particles lowered the ignition temperature, and the Ni-coated particles were to determine if this held true at higher pressures. These tests were run at peak test pressures of 20,000, 40,000, and 60,000 psi.\n\nThe results of the testing regimen demonstrated that the nickel coating did indeed lower ignition delay when compared with the uncoated particles, and overall had higher observed intensities. The 9 \u03bcm particles also had a substantially shorter ignition delay than their 32 \u03bcm counterparts. The 20,000 psi experiments produced notably lower observed light intensities in the 32 \u03bcm uncoated particles than the 40,000 psi tests, indicating that many more particles were burning at the higher pressures. The fact that the Ni-coated 32 \u03bcm particles had high observed light intensity values in both the 20 and 40,000 psi tests indicates that the nickel coated particles can burn at much lower pressures.

The first part considers the regularized total least squares problems. Constructing linear systems are an appropriate approach in understanding and modeling inverse problems which arise in many fields in engineering and science. A least squares solution is a proper method to solve the overdetermined linear system when noise is included only in the observed data. However, when the data matrix is contaminated by noise as well as the observed data, Total Least Squares methods are more appropriate. Additionally, a regularization technique is considered when the data matrix is ill-conditioned, otherwise Total Least Squares produces a noise-dominant output. Thus, to solve ill-posed linear systems arising from inverse problems, we develop methods for regularized Total Least Squares problems.\n\nFirst we consider the Total Least Squares problems with Tikhonov regularization. Golub, Hansen, and O'Leary [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 21 (2000), pp. 185-194] show that the problem of finding the Total Least Squares solution is equivalent to the solution of the two parameter\nlinear system. Our method derives two nonlinear equations from the two parameter linear system, applies a Newton method with a nonsingular Jacobian matrix that is computed inexpensively. Another approach combines two projection methods for the two-parameter Newton iteration for the higher dimensional problems. Specifically, the first fixes the subspace dimension of the projection before the beginning the iterations by using Bidiagonal Reduction, and the second expands the subspace dynamically during the iterations by employing a generalized Krylov subspace expansion.\n\nNext, we consider another kind of regularization, which is denoted as a dual regularized Total Least Squares problem. Unlike the Tikhonov regularization which constrains the size of the solution, a dual regularized Total Least Squares problem considers two constraints; the one constrains the size of the error in the data matrix, the other constrains the size of the error in the observed data. Our method derives two nonlinear equations similar to the two-parameter Newton iteration method. However, since the Jacobian matrix is not guaranteed to be nonsingular, we adopt a trust-region based iteration method to obtain the solution.\n\nIn the second part, template tracking problems are considered. Template tracking is the procedure of finding an image patch in each frame that is most similar to the given template. To improve the accuracy of the template tracking, appearance vectors are used to model appearance and illumination variations. This estimation involves computing the principal components of the augmented image matrix at each frame. Since computing the principal components is very expensive, we adopt the truncated bidiagonalization and the Truncated URV decomposition as alternatives to computing the principal components. In the experiments, we show that two methods are attractive alternatives in fast template tracking problems, especially when the size of the template image matrix grows.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8856], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Geun Seop", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "Seop", "first_name_ssi": "Geun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jesse Louis Barlow", "Padma Raghavan", "Dr Robert Collins", "Vishal Monga", "Raj Acharya"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jesse Louis Barlow, Dissertation Advisor", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Dr Robert Collins, Committee Member", "Vishal Monga, Committee Member", "Raj Acharya, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Total Least Squares", "Regularization", "High Resolution Image Reconstruction", "Newton method"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Selected antecedents of customer loyalty within a restaurant loyalty program: Perceived control, privacy concern, perceived value of a loyalty program, and willingness to disclose information\n", "id": "8977", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2356", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objectives of this study were to examine a conceptual model of information disclose and customer loyalty with respect to the sensitive level of information, perceived control, privacy concern, and perceived value of a loyalty. Data for the study were collected using an online survey distributed to customers who made a reservation for dinner at a student managed restaurant and 300 participants completed the online survey. The data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses including analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, multivariate analysis of variance, regression analyses and the structural equation modeling. The findings indicated 1) customers\u2019 willingness to disclose and perceived value of a loyalty program are the determinants of customer loyalty (e.g. behavioral intent and relative attitude); 2) willingness to disclose is affected by perceived control (e.g. perceived cognitive and decisional control), privacy concern and perceived value of a loyalty program; 3) privacy concern is affected by the sensitivity level of information and perceived cognitive control; and 4) perceived value of loyalty program is affected by information privacy concern.\nThe implications of the findings for restaurant managers are that they can collect more disclosure-based information in a restaurant loyalty program by controlling the sensitivity level of information and providing a loyalty program which has a high perceived value. Also, restaurants may provide customers with more control over the way that companies use personal information to collect disclosure-based information.\nFor future research, the generalizability could be improved by recruiting participants from a restaurant which practices CRM with a loyalty program.

One effective treatment is cardiac ablation, which shows a high rate of success in treating paroxysmal AF. As a prevailing modality for this treatment, catheter ablation using radiofrequency has been effective, but there is measurable morbidity and significant costs and time associated with this invasive procedure for permanent or persistent AF. To address these issues, a transesophageal ultrasound applicator for noninvasive cardiac ablations has been designed, developed and evaluated in this dissertation. Focused ultrasound for thermal ablation has gained interest for decades due to its noninvasive characteristics. Since the esophagus is close to the posterior of the left atrium, its position makes it attractive for the incision-less surgery of the selected area of the heart using ultrasound. The overall goal of this study is to bring an applicator as closely as possible to the heart in order to effectively deliver ultrasound energy, and create electrically isolating lesions in myocardial tissue, replicating the currently used Maze procedure. The Maze procedure is a surgical operation that treats AF by creating a grid of incisions resulting in non-conductive scar tissue in the atria.\n  The initial design of an ultrasound applicator capable of creating atrial lesions from the esophagus, involved evaluating sound pressure fields within layers of the esophagus and myocardium. Based on the multiple factors of the simulation results of transducer arrays, current transesophageal medical devices, and the throat anatomy, a focused ultrasound transducer that can be inserted into the esophagus has been designed and tested. In this study, a two-dimensional sparse phased array with flat tapered elements was found to be adequate as a transesophageal ultrasound applicator. The spatially sparse array uses 64 active elements operating at a frequency of 1.6 MHz sampled from 195 (15 by 13) rectangular elements. With this applicator, the size and position of the ablation targets can be controlled by changing the electrical power and phase to the individual elements for ultrasound beam focusing and steering. The magnetic resonance-compatible probe head housing is 19 mm in diameter and incorporates an acoustic window. For the verification of the suggested design, a prototype array with an acoustic impedance matching layer was constructed, and tested using exposimetry and ex vivo experiments. Experimental results indicated that the array could focus and steer the beam with an angle within \u00b110\u00b0 inside the tissue. Also, the array can deliver sufficient power to the focal point to produce ablation while not damaging nearby tissue outside the target area. The results demonstrated a potential application of the ultrasound applicator to transesophageal cardiac surgery in atrial fibrillation treatment.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2388], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Hotaik ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hotaik", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nadine Barrie Smith", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "Thomas B Gabrielson", "Keefe B Manning", "Anthony A Atchley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nadine Barrie Smith, Committee Chair", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member", "Thomas B Gabrielson, Committee Member", "Keefe B Manning, Committee Member", "Anthony A Atchley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["focused ultrasound", "transesophageal ablation", "atrial fibrillation", "HIFU"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A MODIFIED 3&#969; METHOD FOR THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY MEASUREMENT OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL NANOSTRUCTURES", "id": "9099", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2406", "abstract_tesi": "We present a new analytical model for thermal conductivity measurement of one-dimensional nanostructures on substrates.

Such instruction is believed to lead learners to systematic understanding of the target features faster and more efficiently. This study reports on a classroom implementation of innovative language lessons on English phrasal verbs in order to support this view. The design of the lessons is based on Vygotskyan pedagogical theory, concept-based instruction, the key concepts of which are materialization, verbalization and internalization (Vygotsky, 1981, 1983, Gal\u2019perin, 1969). The content of the lessons comes from cognitive linguistic notions, in particular conceptual metaphor (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) and image schema (Johnson, 1987). \nClass instruction was designed to highlight the systematicity of the semantics of phrasal verbs and to reinforce learners\u2019 conceptual understanding with various learning activities. Six 50 minute class sessions introduced students to the semantics of three particles, out, up and over. A total of 23 international teaching assistants were enrolled in the course taught at a North American research university. Participants\u2019 performances in various tasks including in-class tests and homework assignments were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively to investigate learner development.  The quantitative data consists of multiple-choice tests that assessed whether students were capable of choosing an appropriate phrasal verb in a series of varied sentential contexts. The qualitative datasets were collected from following tasks: verbalizations, definitions and two explanation tasks. The tasks were not only designed to reveal effect of instruction, but also to reinforce the learning process.        \nThe analyses of the various data sets showed that CBI enhanced understanding for the majority of students meanings of phrasal verbs in a more systematic manner and to properly externalize that understanding. Their performance significantly improved and the guessing rate decreased. Transfer to new items and particles also occurred. In addition, their explanations became semantically rich and image-oriented. Their explanations indicated that the SCOBAs (Schemas for the Orienting Basis of Action) developed to accompany the explanation of the metaphorical properties of phrasal verbs were clearly instrumental for understanding the motivated nature of particle use. \nThe overall encouraging results point to the need for meaning-oriented grammar instruction that draws learners\u2019 attention to the conceptual bases of grammatical features including seemingly arbitrary phrasal verbs and other idiomatic expressions. This type of instruction is more advantageous in that it can promote conceptual understanding, theoretical thinking and practical application.

However, there are some limitations for these kinds of materials to implement into high frequency (20-100 MHz) ultrasound transducers, arising from the inability to fabricate fine scale features and degraded electrical properties with increasing frequency. Therefore, this thesis deals with two important topics. One is the improvement of the mechanical properties of relaxor-PTs to enable the fabrication of high frequency transducers using these materials. The second is to understand the mechanism of degraded electrical properties of these materials with increasing frequency. \nThis thesis first presents the synthesis and characterization of fine (~1 microns) grained PMN-PT polycrystalline ceramics. Fine grain versions of piezoelectric materials have proven to be a great promise for high frequency transducers because of their benefits, such as improved mechanical strength and property stability at high frequency range. This thesis also includes the investigation of size and/or frequency dependent properties of various relaxor-PTs to study their applicability to high frequency ultrasound transducers. The compositions studied in this work include binary PMN-PT polycrystalline ceramics and single crystals, as well as modified ternary based PMN-PT single crystals.\nThe characterization of electrical properties of relaxor-PTs as a function of thickness and/or frequency showed that fine-grained PMN-PT ceramics provide greater mechanical strength and improved property stability at small thicknesses less than 50 microns, which correspond to >40 MHz ultrasound frequencies. For single crystals, binary PMN-PTs were found to exhibit significant property degradation in terms of dielectric and piezoelectric properties with decreasing sample thicknesses. In contrast, modified ternary based PMN-PT single crystals showed promise for a use in high frequency ultrasound transducers, with no performance degradation with decreasing sample thicknesses down to 40 microns. Analyses for thickness dependent permittivity at high temperatures and domain observations revealed that the thickness dependent properties of relaxor-PTs are closely related to the domain size with respect to the associated macroscopic scale of the samples.\nThe influence of dicing damage on the properties was further studied and discussed through the investigations of 1-3 relaxor-PT composites, which were fabricated by dicing-fill technique. It was found that 1-3 composites showed further property degradation compared to monolithic relaxor-PTs at the same thickness level. X-ray diffraction pattern revealed that diced surface was covered with heavily stressed and damaged surface layer, which implies that surface damage created by dicing could be the origin of property degradation of 1-3 composites.

A 1-3 composite has proven to be an effective material design for transducer applications due to several benefits offered by this structure, such as high electromechanical coupling, low parasitic vibrations and low acoustic impedance. However, a conventional 1-3 composite has been limited for use in high power ultrasonic transducers due to its inherently low mechanical quality factor, Qm, giving rise to power loss and internal heating under high power operation. \nVarious piezoelectrics and polymers were explored for the design of high Qm (low loss) 1-3 composites. \u201cHard\u201d lead zirconate titanates (PZT4 and PZT8), acceptor modified (Bi,Na)TiO3 (BNT) and BaTiO3 (BT) based ceramics were found to be promising active piezoelectric components owing to their high Qms. The passive polymers were selected based on the desired properties for high power composites - low elastic loss, low elastic modulus and high thermal conductivity. Various piezoelectric ceramics and 1-3 composites were characterized using various measurement techniques, including constant vibration velocity, linear frequency modulation, isothermal testing, pulse-echo response, and radiated output power measurements.\nThe results showed that although the overall electromechanical properties of BNT based ceramics were lower than those of BT and PZT based ceramics, the higher stability in Qm under high drive conditions allowed for comparable dynamic strain to that of PZTs at high fields. BT based ceramics, on the other hand, showed comparable small signal properties to PZT8 ceramics, being on the order of ~190 pC/N of d33 and ~1000 of Qm, but showed a significant performance degradation at high fields. The origin of this difference between BNT and BT based ceramics is believed to be related to the domain stability under high drive conditions, evidenced by high coercive field levels, being >35 kV/cm and ~7 kV/cm, respectively. \nFor 1-3 composites, a low loss polymer (Spurr resin) offered an improved Qm, being on the order of ~400, ~200, and ~150 for PZT8, PZT4, and BNT based composites, respectively. In contrast, the Qm of composites with high thermal conductivity polymers (>1 W/m.K) were found to be lower (Qm <100) due to the effects of high elastic modulus and loss factor of the passive components.

Among all candidates, solar energy is very promising owing to its clean and renewable nature. In order to convert the solar energy into useful form such as electricity or hydrocarbon fuel, photoactive materials and devices are commonly used. However, their conversion efficiency is always problematic. \n\tIn this dissertation, utilization of the solar energy with three different devices incorporating sculptured thin films (STFs) was demonstrated: (1) electricity generation by dye-sensitized solar cells adopting sculptured Pt nanowire counter electrodes, (2) TiO2 photocatalytic film with columnar Cu cocatalyts, and (3) sculptured SnS thin film solar cells. \n\tFirst, Pt STFs were fabricated for dye-sensitized solar cells with 5\u00b0 obliquely incident vapor flux by electron beam evaporator. Pt STFs exhibit more desirable features for more functional counter electrodes than that in conventional Pt planar counter electrodes. Higher root mean square surface roughness of 44.4 nm and lower charge transfer resistance of 0.121 \u2126\u2022\u33a0 were measured for Pt STF than the root mean square surface roughness of 19.1 nm  and  charge transfer resistance of 0.578 \u2126\u2022\u33a0 for Pt planar films .These improvement in morphology and electrochemical properties led enhanced photocurrent density and conversion efficiency (9.766 mA/cm2, 5.1 %).\n\tSecond, Cu cocatalysts were sculptured directly on porous TiO2 catalyst films. Varied lengths of Cu columns were grown and methane production rate from carbon dioxide and water was evaluated under AM 1.5 illumination.  The methane production rate showed a maximum of 124.3 ppm\u2022cm-2\u2022h-1 with 160 nm Cu column films. This maximum corresponds to the point where the absorption peak at ~600 nm that is attributed to plasmonic effect by Cu STFs.\n\tThird, SnS thin films were deposited by radio frequency magnetron sputter. Deposited SnS thin films were characterized in structural, optical, and electrical manner.  Surface morphology and growth pattern of the films were varied, depending on variation of deposition parameters such as power, pressure, throw distance and substrate heating. This variation was related to the energy of deposition modes that is possibly explained by mean free path and mean speed of the vapor flux. Also, the deposition rate is related to diffused vapor flux. The optical properties of the SnS thin films were investigated by spectroscopic ellipsometry. Obtained absorption coefficient was >104 cm-1 even in the range of  >1000 nm wavelength. The calculated direct bandgap and indirect bandgap of SnS thin films were ranged from 1.33 to 1.55 eV and from 1.07 to 1.39 eV, respectively. In the investigation of electrical properties by using transport length method, it is found that the SnS films with lower root mean square roughness exhibited lower resistivity while more structured SnS film showed higher resistivity. In addition, the photoresponse was observed under AM 1.5 illumination. SnS thin film solar cells were fabricated in the two different types of thin film solar cells and electrochemical solar cells. The SnS electrochemical solar cells showed photovoltaic behavior and improved voltage, fill factor and efficiency (Voc= 0.38, FF=0.26 and \u03b7=0.0025 %) were measured with the incorporation of the sculptured SnS thin films.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9101], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Hyeonseok ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyeonseok", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark William Horn", "Mark William Horn", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Jeffrey Brownson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark William Horn, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark William Horn, Committee Chair", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Chair", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Brownson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sculptured thin films", "CO2 conversion", "solar cells"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Interns\u2019 Professional Knowledge Development and Professional Identity \n\nFormation in Online Peer-led Dialogue\n\nInterns\u2019 Professional Knowledge Development and Professional Identity Formation in Online Peer-led Dialogue\n\n", "id": "11501", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2284", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to make interns-central members who directed a change the nature of the conception of professional development in an online peer-led dialogue.

Remarkably, both receptors are highly enriched in the mushroom bodies and the central complex of the brain, where both locations have been found to be key neural substrates for associative learning and memory. Furthermore, OAMB is expressed in the thoracico-abdominal ganglion, the female reproductive system, and mature eggs in the ovary. To explore OAMB\u00a1\u00afs role in conditioned courtship as a natural form of associative learning and female reproduction, null and various hypomorphic oamb mutants were generated by P-element mediated dysgenesis. oamb null mutants were found to be viable without gross anatomical defects and oamb females displayed normal courtship and copulation behaviors. oamb null mutant males were also normal in acquisition, but were impaired in short-term memory retention for conditioned courtship behaviors. Transgenic OAMB-AS expression, driven by pan neuronal elav-GAL4, rescues the memory deficit of oamb in short-term memory retention for conditioned courtship, suggesting that neuronal OAMB-AS is crucial for this behavior.\noamb null mutant females have been found to be sterile. To investigate the tissue type(s) and intracellular effectors that OAMB mediates ovulation, the GAL4/UAS binary system was employed. Transgenic oamb females, with adults ubiquitously expressing either OAMB-K3 or -AS driven by heat shock-GAL4, were fecund, indicating that OAMB plays a physiological, and not a developmental, role in ovulation. Neural OAMB expression, however, is deficient for inducing ovulation in oamb null mutant females. To identify OAMB\u00a1\u00afs functional site, the enhancer GAL4 line oamb-RS-GAL4 was generated so that GAL4 could be specifically expressed in the reproductive system. Remarkably, strong oamb-RS-GAL4 expression was detectable in the oviduct epithelial cells, where endogenous OAMB is found. oamb females, with transgenic OAMB-K3 or -AS expression driven by oamb-RS-GAL4, were fully fertile, suggesting that OAMB is crucial in oviduct epithelial cells for regulating ovulation. To identify for downstream OAMB signaling molecules involved with ovulation, transgenes expressing constitutively active Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKIICA), CaMKII inhibitor peptide ala, and dNOS-IR were expressed by oamb-RS-GAL4 in adult oviduct epithelial cells. Ovulation defects of oamb females were rescued by transgeneic CaMKIICA expression in adult oviduct epithelium. CaMKII inhibitor peptides ala and dNOS-IR driven by oamb-RS-GAL4, however, reduced female fecundity in a heterozygous background. Therefore, CaMKII and possibly nitric oxide are major downstream signaling molecules of OAMB for regulating ovulation. These studies provide significant insight into the physiological and cellular mechanisms involved with octopamine function in associative learning and memory as well as for the female reproductive system.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2179], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Hyun-Gwan ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyun-Gwan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kyung An Han", "Richard W Ordway", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Graham Hugh Thomas", "David Scott Gilmour"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kyung An Han, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Chair", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["octpamine receptor", "OAMB", "Conditioned courtship", "Ovulation", "CaMKII"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "COMBUSTION INSTABILITY MECHANISMS \nIN A LEAN PREMIXED GAS TURBINE COMBUSTOR\n", "id": "9762", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2291", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An experimental study was conducted to identify the combustion instability mechanisms of flame-vortex interactions and equivalence ratio fluctuations and to characterize the combined effects of the two mechanisms on self-excited unstable combustion in a swirl-stabilized lean-premixed gas turbine combustor. The combustor was designed so that the fuel injector location and the combustion chamber length could be independently varied. In addition, the fuel and air could be mixed upstream of the choked inlet to the combustor, thereby eliminating the possibility of equivalence ratio fluctuations. Experiments were performed over a broad range of operating conditions and at each condition both the combustor length and the fuel injection location were varied. Dynamic pressure in the combustor, acoustic pressure and velocity in the mixing section, and the overall rate of heat release were simultaneously measured at all operating conditions, and two-dimensional flame images were taken to visualize stable and unstable flame structures. \nTwo distinct instability regimes were observed, one near 220 Hz and the other near 340 Hz. It was found that the lower frequency regime is closely related to the maximum gain frequency of the flame at forced response measurements, while the high frequency regime is related to the quarter-wave frequency of the mixing section. It was also found that the strength of the instability changed significantly as the fuel injection location was varied, while the phase of the acoustic pressure and velocity fluctuations in the mixing section did not change. A time series of pressure and CH* chemiluminescence signals suggested the constructive and/or destructive coupling of the two mechanisms. \nExperimental data on the premixed cases were analyzed to identify the combustion instability mechanism due to flame-vortex interactions, and the time lag and the characteristic frequency analyses were found to be useful. Based on the fact that the time lag only describes the phase relationship between parameters, the characteristic frequency analysis was introduced to account for the system gain as the other factor for the instability. The maximum gain frequency in the forced flame response measurement (fmax.gain \u00a1\u00d6 220 Hz) and the quarter-wave frequency of the mixing section (fmix \u00a1\u00d6 340 Hz) were found to be characteristic frequencies for the combustor configuration. As a result, two conditions were identified as the requirements for the observed instability due to the flame-vortex interactions: i) the time lag should be satisfied: Rayleigh\u00a1\u00afs criterion and C\u00a6\u00d3v \u00a1\u00d6 1, and ii) the acoustic frequency of the combustor, facs, should be close to either fmax.gain or fmix. Spectrograms drawn from the measured combustor pressure signals for varying combustor length have confirmed that the proposed instability mechanism of the flame-vortex interaction is valid.\nIn the analysis of the combustion instability mechanism of equivalence ratio fluctuations, a new way of assessing the equivalence ratio fluctuation convection time in the combustor, \u00a6\u00d34(t), was successfully used to explain the instability characteristics for varying fuel injection locations at a given operating condition. In self-excited combustion instability of lean premixed flames, the resultant effect of equivalence ratio fluctuations at the flame was highly dependent on the velocity oscillations at the dump plane. The comprehensive experimental results for premixed and partially premixed cases confirmed that the flame-vortex interactions interact with the equivalence ratio fluctuations, and both of them contribute to driving the instability characteristics in partially premixed conditions. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2271], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Hyung Ju ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyung Ju", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Deborah A Levin", "Vigor Yang", "Richard A Yetter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca, Dissertation Advisor", "Domenic Adam Santavicca, Committee Chair", "Deborah A Levin, Committee Member", "Vigor Yang, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["combustion instability", "gas turbine combustor", "lean premixed", "turbulent combustion", "flame-vortex interactions", "equivalence ratio flucutaitons"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The allocation of public health resources to address disparities of care", "id": "19131", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9103", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Providing comprehensive health care services to all the members in a community is important for the achievement of health equity and for increasing a community members\u2019 quality of life. However, there are many disparities that exist in health care services that affect not only individuals but also the entire community. Two important reasons for disparities in health outcomes are a lack of access to care and a lack of insurance coverage. To address this issue, public awareness and understanding of which groups are most vulnerable, and which interventions are most effective is important. In this thesis, we develop effective interventions to reduce disparities in community health settings. \nFirst, we develop an integrated model to examine the impact of both increasing the current government budget for Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in Pennsylvania and expanding Medicaid through relaxing the income eligibility limits. We consider the geographic and demographic differences in our model, to consider the tradeoffs between these two policies. The objective of this research is to develop a methodology that will aid in finding a balanced investment between FQHC expansion and relaxing Medicaid eligibility to improve both access (by increasing the number of FQHCs) and coverage (by FQHC and Medicaid expansion). We develop a utility-based framework that we use in a multi-criteria optimization model. The comparison is achieved by integrating these models with publically available data sets that allow for specific estimations of healthcare need. \nOral health has been identified as having the greatest disparities for children\u2019s overall health. In the second part of the thesis, we study the consequences of access that lead to these disparities for children\u2019s oral health outcomes. We examine the association between differences in insurance types and oral health outcomes. Specifically, our goal is to determine the factors that would best address the disparity gaps. Differences in oral health outcomes due to insurance comprehensiveness would imply that Medicaid-based policies could be effective at addressing oral health disparities.\nFinally, we develop an integrated dental supply and demand estimation model for Medicaid children. The model is based on several factors at the county level including income, population density, and number of dentists. The model is tested using county-level data from the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS). We use the supply and demand model to assess the two interventions of expanding Medicaid eligibility and increasing Medicaid reimbursement fees in order to increase oral health utilization, which is the key goal of the Oral Health Initiative of the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. Furthermore, using a non-linear programming model we develop, we find the optimal balanced investment between those two interventions for each state in the model. The framework developed can be used by policy makers to determine the best way to meet the Oral Health Initiative.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8929], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Hyunji ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyunji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Griffin", "Harriet Black Nembhard", "Jose Antonio Ventura", "Madhu Reddy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Griffin, Dissertation Advisor", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Committee Member", "Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Member", "Madhu Reddy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Health disparity", "FQHC location", "Medicaid", "oral health", "utilization", "policy", "supply", "demand", "optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Two Topics: A Jackknife Maximum Likelihood Approach to Statistical Model Selection and a Convex Hull Peeling Depth Approach to Nonparametric Massive Multivariate Data Analysis with Applications", "id": "7145", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2349", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation presents two topics from opposite disciplines:\none is from a parametric realm and the other is based on nonparametric methods.\nThe first topic is a jackknife maximum likelihood\napproach to statistical model selection and the second one is a convex\nhull peeling depth approach to nonparametric massive multivariate\ndata analysis.  The second topic includes simulations and applications \non massive astronomical data. \n \nFirst, we present a model selection criterion, minimizing the Kullback-Leibler \ndistance by using the jackknife method.\nVarious model selection methods have been developed to choose\na model of minimum Kullback-Liebler distance to the true model, \nsuch as Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion \n(BIC), Minimum description length (MDL),\nand Bootstrap information criterion. Likewise,\nthe jackknife method chooses a model of minimum Kullback-Leibler distance\nthrough bias reduction. This bias, which is inevitable in model selection\nproblems, arise from estimating the distance between an unknown true model \nand an estimated model. \nWe show that (a) the jackknife maximum likelihood estimator is \nconsistent to the parameter of interest, (b) the jackknife estimate of the \nlog likelihood is asymptotically unbiased, and \n(c) the stochastic order of the jackknife log likelihood estimate is \n$O(log log n).$ Because of these properties,\nthe jackknife information criterion is applicable to problems of choosing a \nmodel from non nested candidates especially when the true model is unknown. \nCompared to popular information criteria which are\nonly applicable to nested models, the jackknife\ninformation criterion is more robust in terms of filtering various types of \ncandidate models to choose the best approximating model.  However,\nthis robust method has a demerit that the jackknife criterion is unable\nto discriminate nested models.\n\n\nNext, we explore the convex hull peeling process to develop \nempirical tools for statistical inferences on multivariate massive data.\nConvex hull and its peeling process has intuitive appeals for robust\nlocation estimation. We define the convex hull peeling depth,\nwhich enables to order multivariate data. \nThis ordering process\nbased on data depth provides ways to obtain multivariate quantiles including \nmedian. Based on the generalized quantile process, we define\na convex hull peeling central region, a convex hull level set, and\na volume functional, which lead us to invent one dimensional mappings,\ndescribing shapes of multivariate distributions along data depth. \nWe define empirical\nskewness and kurtosis measures based on the convex hull peeling process.\nIn addition to these empirical descriptive statistics, we find \na few methodologies to find multivariate outliers in massive data sets.\nThose outlier detection algorithms\nare (1) estimating multivariate quantiles up to the level $alpha$, \n(2) detecting changes in a measure sequence of convex hull level sets, \nand (3) constructing a balloon to exclude outliers.

A vitrified biological specimen can be examined in its hydrated native state using cryo-EM and the three-dimensional (3D) molecular structure can be reconstructed by single-particle image processing. Recent technological advances in the field have significantly improved the quality of the outputs so that cryo-EM 3D maps are now reaching atomic resolutions. \n\tIcosahedral viruses have been advantageous objects for single particle cryo-EM analysis because of their large molecular sizes and the high degree of symmetry, which facilitate the alignment of noisy particle images. Innumerous 3D reconstructions have been generated with icosahedral averaging for various viruses of different forms, revealing many molecular mechanisms that the virus capsids undergo during their lifecycles. The symmetry averaging, however, can obscure asymmetric structures on the virus capsids, which are related with biological functions of the capsids. As many biological reactions occur asymmetrically, especially virus-host interactions, sometimes it is necessary to examine the structures asymmetrically. The main purpose of this thesis is to explore the asymmetric features of icosahedral viruses by developing and exploiting the single particle image processing techniques. \n\tHuman papillomaviruses and enteroviruses are icosahedral viruses that infect millions of people around the world and cause serious diseases, including various cancers and neurological diseases. Using single particle cryo-EM methods, the work presented here on these clinically important viruses has focused on the virus interactions with cellular components, including neutralizing antibodies and virus receptors. In reality, conformational changes on the virus capsids and molecular interactions between viral and cellular parts do not happen symmetrically as the environment surrounding the virus is not symmetric. Thus, in order to investigate physiologically accurate 3D structures, the icosahedral symmetry imposed during the image processing should be abandoned to recover the asymmetry of viruses interacting with host proteins. Different approaches were applied to solve these issues in each of the presented studies. \n\tCryo-EM 3D reconstructions of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) in complex with Fab molecules were generated for the clinically important HPV16-specific neutralizing antibody, H16.V5. During the analysis of the 3D maps new conformational epitopes of H16.V5 as well as its mechanism of neutralization were elucidated. In another experiment, conformational changes of the virus capsids were observed under a highly-concentrated condition and after binding of the antibody. The arrangement of the pentavalent and hexavalent capsomers caused steric hindrance between two Fab molecules binding on each capsomer and resulted in breaking the icosahedral symmetry. Binding dynamics of the two competing Fabs confirmed a hyperstabilization model of neutralization by H16.V5.\t\n\tEnterovirus 71 (EV71) was incubated with a neutralizing antibody (MA28-7), a receptor (PSGL-1), or a drug (NF449) to study the binding modes of the target molecules. The cryo-EM analyses revealed the binding sites of the molecules, a mechanism of neutralization, and a mechanism of strain-specificities of the antibody and of the receptor. Specifically, the results elucidated how a single amino acid residue, VP1-145, determines the MA28-7 and PSGL-1 binding phenotypes of the virus. The three molecules bound at the positively charged surface on the icosahedral 5-fold vertex where symmetry averaging can result in the most extreme build-up of noisy artifact. Because of the steric hindrance, only one molecule, instead of five, could bind on each vertex, breaking the icosahedral symmetry. Moreover, partial occupancies of the bound molecules weakened the cryo-EM densities and made the structural analyses difficult; therefore, different methods were applied to investigate the symmetry-mismatched components, depending on their molecular sizes. In addition, an atomic model of EV71 strain 1095 was built de novo into the cryo-EM reconstruction, completing the atomic structures of the three most prevalent EV71 groups for the residue VP1-145. Two studies were conducted in different time frames with traditional and innovative cryo-EM technologies. The results of each study demonstrate the recent transformative improvements of cryo-EM hardware and software. \n\tThe coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) was locally stimulated by incubating with full-length receptors embedded in lipid bilayer discs, called nanodiscs. This novel approach resulted in the first high-resolution asymmetric 3D structure of a picornavirus entry-intermediate, also called an \u201cAltered particle\u201d (A-particle). The resulting structure was significantly different from previously characterized A-particles since the asymmetric binding of the receptor induced global capsid expansion as well as local conformational changes at the site of interaction, including multiple channels and extrusions of the viral proteins. Interpretation of the results opened new gates for studies of picornavirus entry mechanisms and led to a new model that proposed global and local capsid stimulations resulted in different A-particle structures. Remarkably, by imposing icosahedral symmetry, an atomic resolution 3D map was generated from the asymmetric particles with severe local conformational changes. This should raise an alert to the researchers in the field as to the risks of applying icosahedral averaging exclusively to study viruses.\n\tStudying asymmetric structures in the icosahedral virus capsids required different approaches using various programs and algorithms. Imposing icosahedral symmetry has been simple but not using the symmetry or reversing the imposed symmetry was not an easy task. Compatibility between different programs was also limited. To handle the issue, therefore, we developed a new C++ function for RELION, the most commonly used software for high-resolution single particle analysis, and applied it to solve the asymmetric structure of the CVB3 A-particle.

Many of these studies,in particular those related to concrete structures, however, have also reported a lack of ductility in the strengthened element due to premature debonding failure at the concrete-FRP interface. The possibility of preventing or delaying the premature debonding of\nconcrete-FRP interfaces has lead to the investigation and development of new anchor\nsystems for externally bonded FRP applications. In this study, performance of Uwrap as an anchorage system was studied. Experimental and numerical procedures were proposed to characterize the effect of the Uwrap in the performance of externally bonded FRP reinforced concrete elements (EBFS).\nTwo key factors were found pertaining to the externally bonded FRP system with the Uwrap. The first factor is the stress concentration at the corner of the Uwrap. The stress concentration at the corner region of the Uwrap was the main cause of the rupture failure of the Uwrap. The second factor is the frictional effect between the debonded surfaces under the region of the Uwrap after the onset of the debonding. Based on these two key factors, a frictional bond-slip model of the concrete-FRP interface was proposed in this study in order to predict the anchor effect of the Uwrap. The developed FE analysis with the proposed frictional bond-slip model well predicts the bond behavior under the Uwrap locations.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3186], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Jae Ha ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jae Ha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Maria Lopez De Murphy", "Maria Lopez De Murphy", "Andrew Scanlon", "Bohumil Kasal", "Charles E Bakis", "Ivica Smid"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Maria Lopez De Murphy, Dissertation Advisor", "Maria Lopez De Murphy, Committee Chair", "Andrew Scanlon, Committee Member", "Bohumil Kasal, Committee Member", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member", "Ivica Smid, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Finite Element Model", "Rehabilitation", "Concrete", "FRP", "Anchor", "Fracture mechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Nucleosome Structure and Dynamics Investigated with Single-Molecule Methods", "id": "zk51vg76b", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12870", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nucleosomes are the repeating units that comprise chromatin, the DNA-histone complex that holds the genetic information in eukaryotic cell nuclei. Eukaryotic DNA wraps around a histone octamer protein core forming a superhelical structure, thereby being packaged into the nucleosome. The nucleosome imposes a physical barrier to nuclear transactions that require access to DNA including transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Therefore, nucleosomes must at least in part disassemble during these transactions. It is widely accepted that nucleosomes undergo dynamic changes in order to allow for regulated access to genes. These changes include structural changes that lead to regulated nucleosome disassembly or exchanges of histones with histone variants that trigger cascading biochemical events on the nucleosome. These changes are often strongly coupled to post- translational modifications of histones and DNA methylation. Histone chaperones and nucleosome remodelers can facilitate these nucleosome dynamics by depositing or evicting histones in and out of the nucleosome. Understanding the nature of these dynamical changes in the nucleosome and how they are coupled to chemical modifications to the nucleosome are crucial to understanding eukaryotic gene regulation mechanisms.\nIn this dissertation, I present my PhD research on the structure and the dynamics of nucleosomes based on single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. In Chapter 1, following the introduction of the nucleosome and chromatin structure, the processes that alter the structure and dynamics of nucleosomes and the theory of FRET are reviewed. In Chapter 2, experimental methods and materials used for the research is reviewed. In Chapter 3, the mechanism of the nucleosome structure transition upon the incorporation of a histone variant CENP-A is presented. In Chapter 4, the dynamics of nucleosome disassembly mediated by the histone chaperone Nap1 and the effects of histone acetylation on the dynamics are detailed. In Chapter 5, nucleosome disassembly during transcription elongation and the effects of Nap1 on elongation kinetics are discussed.

In the R&D contest, firms compete in two stages. In the first stage, firms choose which approach they will investigate, after which they endogenously select optimal effort level given firms' choice of approach in the second stage. There are compatibility externalities if they choose the same approach. However, there is also greater probability of simultaneous\ndiscovery which may cause harmful results to both firms. We examine 2 situations with different payoff structures by considering the Bertrand R&D game and the equal sharing R&D game. The equilibrium avenue choice in each game depends on the size of compatibility externality and it may exhibit too much differentiation or too much duplication. The equilibrium effort choice conditional on duplication is inefficiently high in the equal sharing R&D game, while the equilibrium effort choice is efficient when firms choose different research avenues. The result of the excess differentiation and the efficient investment choice in the Bertrand R&D game suggest that the lump-sum investment subsidy may need to be implemented in the US wireless mobile phone industry to reduce inefficiency involved\nin excess differentiation without distorting efficient investment choice.\n\nIn the second essay \nwe consider firms' R&D choice problem where firms may choose the same research approach only through forming a research alliance. When firms agree on forming a research alliance, they play an equal sharing R&D game for the stand-alone value of R&D success, while they split the network value of R&D success according to a certain proportion specified under the research alliance contract. Since firms share the network value of R&D success, firms have an incentive to free-ride on the other firm's investment. But, due to the payoff structure in which firms rreceive rewards for its second discovery, firms also have excessive incentive for investment. The interplay of such conflicting incentives result in non-monotonic inefficiency in equilibrium investment choice. Especially it turns out that the excessive incentive for investment outweighs the insufficient incentive for investment when compatibility externality is low enough, which results in excess duplication in site choice.\n\nIn the third essay\nwe consider firms' dynamic R&D project choice problem in the presence of compatibility externality. Firms which engage in R&D based on risky fundamental technologies (sites) face two kinds of uncertainties: the uncertainty involved in the fundamental technology (whether a treasure is buried in the site) and the uncertainty involved in its own R&D activity (whether R&D succeeds given that a treasure is buried in the site investigated). Each firm carries out two activities in the site that it chooses: production and research. There exists compatibility benefit in both per-period production revenue and the per-period R&D reward when firms choose the same site. Such\ncompatibility benefit which the firms can't internalize and the nature of competition in the prospective product market interplay to result in over-duplication or over-differentiation in site\nchoice in the equilibrium. The result of our numerical analysis of the two period game shows that the information benefit through experimentation causes the social optimum and the equilibrium in the two period game to be non-myopic where they involve in differentiation in site choice more often than in the one period game.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3177], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Jaehee ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jaehee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Mark John Roberts", "Gustavo Ventura", "Susan H Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Mark John Roberts, Committee Member", "Gustavo Ventura, Committee Member", "Susan H Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["standardization", "compatibility externality", "R&D"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Techniques for Down-selecting Numerical Weather Prediction Ensembles", "id": "15236", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7702", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ensembles of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are valuable forecast- ing tools for a number of applications. Because the spread in the ensemble predictions is correlated to forecast uncertainty, NWP ensembles quantify the uncertainty of the prediction. Ideally NWP ensemble spread should accurately represent uncertainty in the low-level mean wind for forecasting applications such as wind energy and atmospheric transport and dispersion. To adequately sample the probability density function (PDF) of the forecast atmospheric state, all relevant sources of uncertainty ought to be ac- counted for, including model error. Multi-physics ensembles can be used to account for the kind of model error that arises from imperfect knowledge of physical processes. This study presents the first known objective methodology to guide users in choosing which combinations of physics parameterizations to include in an NWP multi-physics ensemble.\n\nFor this work two NWP multi-physics ensembles are built using the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (ARW-WRF) model. For Part 1, I construct a 24-member ensemble for 48-h forecast periods over a summer season. For Parts 2 and 3, I build a 42-member ensemble for 48-h forecast periods every fifth day for winter, summer, and a transition season. Verification for Part 1 focuses on surface temperature and wind components at forecast lead times from 12-48 h. Both surface and low-level (925, 850, and 700 hPa) temperature and wind components are used in Parts 2 and 3.\n\nIn Part 1, I introduce the down-selection methodology using principal component analysis (PCA) over a summer season. PCA yields a down-selected 14-member ensemble that has similar performance to the full 24-member ensemble, as measured by root-mean square error (RMSE), and continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). In Part 2, I compare the performance of a refined PCA technique with two additional down-selection techniques, K -means cluster analysis (KCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) over a winter season. All three techniques yield down-selected ensembles of 10-11 members that perform equally well as the full 42-member ensemble, using RMSE, CRPS, and the normalized reliability index (RI). In Part 3, I explore the dependence and performance of the HCA clustering and down-selection results on seasonality and length of training period, and also examine spread-skill distributions of the full and subset ensembles. For the full and down-selected ensembles throughout this work, the ensemble PDF is also statistically dressed, or calibrated, using Bayesian model averaging (BMA).\n\nUsing statistical down-selection techniques such as those outlined here allows for a small multi-physics ensemble with a few intelligently chosen members to represent model error and the forecast PDF just as well as a multi-physics ensemble that is four times as large. This approach saves computing resources, allowing NWP ensemble modelers to use those resources for other important aspects, such as increasing resolution or representing additional sources of uncertainty.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7635], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Jared Armand", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "Armand", "first_name_ssi": "Jared", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sue Ellen Haupt", "Sue Ellen Haupt", "George Spencer Young", "David R Stauffer", "Marcelo Chamecki", "Derrick J Lampkin", "Leonard Joel Peltier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sue Ellen Haupt, Dissertation Advisor", "Sue Ellen Haupt, Committee Chair", "George Spencer Young, Committee Chair", "David R Stauffer, Committee Member", "Marcelo Chamecki, Committee Member", "Derrick J Lampkin, Committee Member", "Leonard Joel Peltier, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["numerical weather prediction/forecasting", "ensembles", "statistical modeling", "model evaluation/performance", "down-selection"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Role of Early-Age Concrete Properties and Construction Loading on Slab Serviceability\n\n", "id": "7766", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3278", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The slab is modeled using a shell element in the commercial finite element software package ABAQUS/Standard.

Further, the parent-offspring tie is one of the longest-lasting ties middle-aged parents experience across their life span. The nature of relationships with spouses and offspring has resulted in extended periods of support and affective connections between family members in adulthood.\nMy dissertation consists of three papers that utilize dyadic perspectives from both husbands and wives with regard to their relationship to each other and to their adult offspring in adulthood. Papers one and two used middle-aged couples from the Family Exchange Study, a study of exchanges of support and quality of relationships between parents and adult offspring. \nUsing both spouses\u2019 accounts concerning exchanges of support with offspring and their relationships with offspring, paper one looked at how much parents report imbalance in support for each offspring and then examined whether this imbalance in support contributed to parental feelings of ambivalence towards offspring. The results show that parents felt greater ambivalence when there was a larger imbalance in support for each offspring. In addition, this linkage was moderated by their feelings of stress and rewards in helping offspring. In addition, similar connections were observed between imbalance in support and parental ambivalence towards offspring between husbands and wives. \nPaper two examined the linkage between parents and children in their report of relationship quality using both variable and typological approach. Analyses were conducted using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM), which takes into account the interdependence of observations between partners. Results show that parents who reported higher satisfaction in parent-child relationships also reported higher marital satisfaction. Conversely, parents who reported lower satisfaction in parent-child relationships reported lower marital satisfaction. This effect did not differ by parental gender. Results from the typological approach revealed somewhat diverse family patterns, families with similar valence and families with dissimilar valence across parent-child and spousal relationships. Different family patterns also had implications for the mental health of couples. \nFinally, paper three examines how one spouse\u2019s activity restriction resulting from illness is related to one\u2019s own and his or her spouse\u2019s well-being. Using data from a baseline of the psychosocial intervention study of patients with Osteoarthritis (OA) and their spouses, the paper investigated whether activity restriction (AR) is associated with depressive symptoms of both patients with OA and spouses and also whether marital satisfaction moderates such associations. To account for the interdependent reports of both spouses, APIM was conducted. Results reveal that higher levels of AR predicted higher depressive symptoms for both patients and spouses. Furthermore, marital satisfaction was found to buffer the relationship between levels of AR and depressive symptoms. Significant partner effect found between spouses\u2019 AR and depressive symptoms suggest the interdependent nature of marital context. \n\tIn sum, my dissertation aims to extend our knowledge of how middle-aged couples experience their family lives as a spouse and a parent. Together, these studies demonstrated the shared family experiences of middle-aged couples and the implications of involvement in the lives of adult children and spouse on individuals\u2019 well-being. Further, this study underscores the importance of considering both spouses\u2019 perspectives in examining qualities of relationship between marital and parent-adult offspring relationships. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7607], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Jeong Eun", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "Eun", "first_name_ssi": "Jeong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit", "Steven Howard Zarit", "Lynn Margaret Martire", "Jon F Nussbaum", "Michael J Rovine", "Douglas Coatsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit, Dissertation Advisor", "Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Chair", "Lynn Margaret Martire, Committee Member", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member", "Douglas Coatsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Middle aged couples", "marital satisfaction", "family system", "dyadic analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Role of Branding in the keepin' it REAL Substance Use Prevention Curriculum\n\n\n\n", "id": "11157", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3186", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While branded health messages are often effective in promoting healthy behaviors, it is not clear how this strategy produces protective effects.

The proposed algorithm does not need an explicit dynamic model of the system but computes partial derivatives of the dynamic function numerically from the time series data of observation to estimate the adjoint variable and the Hamiltonian. The additional necessary conditions for optimality, constant Hamiltonian over time span, are used as the tracking condition to find an optimal trajectory. A candidate optimal trajectory is searched by the Legendre transformation which interprets the geometric information of the current control trajectory on the Lagrangian surface. The implication of this approach is the elimination of the need for the dynamic model or the system identification process as we only derive necessary partial derivatives out of current observations. This enables us to find a near optimal trajectory quickly without the explicit dynamic model or the full system identification process. The estimated Hamiltonian approach is verified first with several problems whose dynamic models are known. After then, the model-free algorithm is applied for several problems where the dynamics are still unclear. First case is real world applications where the observation data is obtained by experiments or from historical record. These applications include a recent hot manufacturing process called Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST) and a socio-economic policy problem of water usage management by price controls. In this case, approximated dynamic models based on collected empirical data are used for the simulated iterations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm only use the observation output and shows iterative candidate searching history which converges toward an exact solution or a certain trajectory with decreasing total cost. Second case is a simulated feedback control algorithm called distributed arrival time control (DATC) which is well known for its fast searching capability of a near optimal queueing sequence that minimizes tardiness error from due dates.

They are promising because they often contain features that appear to be useful for learning (Squire, 2004), eliciting behavioral or attitudinal change (Yee, 2007) or encouraging new perspective taking, empathy, and new ways of thinking (Thomson, 2006; Gee, 2005).  As of yet, not much research yet exists on how to effectively use this form of technology to support identity development, raise awareness about social issues, or foster positive social or personal change (Thomson, 2006).\n\nIn this Design-Based Research (DBR) dissertation study, I propose and test a specific Serious Game design that I call Identity Supportive Games (ISGs).  Specifically, I design and test two game prototypes that allow players to explore Asian-American identities and issues in relation to ethnic stereotypes.  Many misconceptions and myths persist regarding Asian-American issues (e.g., the effects of seemingly positive stereotypes such as the \u201cModel Minority\u201d image that depicts Asian-Americans as intelligent overachievers who rarely fail).  In reality, these stereotypes and self-beliefs can lead to problems including identity crisis (Erikson, 1968), mental illnesses and depression (Cohen, 2007), poor self-esteem and self-image (Mok, 1998; Sue & Sue, 2004), decreased academic performance (Steele, 1997), decreased opportunities (Cheng & Thatchenkery, 1997), and pigeonholing (Sue & Sue, 2006).  With this in mind, this study sought to investigate how Serious Games can help people support, understand, and define their self-identities and to explore the influence of ethnic minority stereotypes.  \n\nThe results indicate that the games (1) were effective in educating players about the reality of Asian American issues; (2) changed perceptions of Asian culture; and (3) changed perceptions of self-identity.  Qualitative data also provided evidence of how the games allowed for identity reflection, definition, and support; promoted more sophisticated understandings (e.g. the subtle implications of seemingly positive stereotypes); and promoted the learning of facts and new perspectives on Asian culture.  This work also informed design principles for social issue Serious Games, especially in terms of strategies to promote attitudinal and learning outcomes in this genre of digital games.\n\nThe issues explored run parallel to those of similar groups in other contexts, such as other ethnic minorities in schools and the workplace, as well as women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.

The basic fundamentals of coupled mode theory are presented and used to distinguish LPFGs from fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs).  A three-layer model is then used to demonstrate the feasibility of the tunable filter design.  The model results show that an LPFG with a thin cladding (~35-40 \u00b5m) will have an enhanced sensitivity to changes in the ambient index and will have a single resonant band in its output spectrum.  The results of the three-layer model are experimentally verified, but unexpected LPFG tuning behavior is observed when a high index indium tin oxide (ITO) overlay is coated on the fiber.  The ITO overlay, which had been omitted in the three-layer model, is shown to induce cladding mode transitions in the fiber as the ambient index is increased.  These transitions significantly affect the tuning performance of an LPFG, and a new four-layer model, which includes the overlay, is developed to more accurately predict an ITO coated LPFG\u2019s tuning behavior.  The four-layer model is used to confirm and quantify the effects of mode transitions.  The measured data from a number of ITO coated LPFGs is then compared to the model data to see how well the model predicts the tuning behavior of real LPFGs fabricated in our lab.  By making a few adjustments to the model constants to account for variations in the fabrication processes, the model is made to fit to the various data sets.  The tuning performance of one LPFG fabricated in our lab nearly matched the performance of the ideal-case LPFG predicted by the model.  However, the errors that are consistently introduced by our equipment during fabrication prevented us from replicating the sample and proved to be the limiting factor in our research effort.  Although we were unable to produce a working, electro-optically tunable filter prototype, this research effort was not pursued in vain.  The four-layer model presented in this thesis is a comprehensive analytical tool that can be used to predict both the tuning range and peak depth of a tunable LPFG that has been coated with a high index overlay.  Using the model as a guide, we fabricated an ITO coated LPFG whose resonant peak tuned in excess of 200 nm when the ambient refractive index was increased by 0.01.  To the best knowledge of the author, this is the highest sensitivity reported for an LPFG to date.  In addition to the tuning performance, the resonant peak remains within 1 dB of its maximum depth for nearly 150 nm of the tuning range.

The Dirac surface states induced by strong spin-orbit interaction can be modified by breaking time-reversal symmetry that protects the surface state. We study the modified surface states of topological insulators by introducing magnetism by doping magnetic atoms or interfacing a magnetic layer to the surface. Also, we explore potential spintronics applications of topological insulators by utilizing magnetic tunnel junctions to evidence the inherently spin-polarized texture of the topological insulator surface state. For this dissertation research, single crystalline topological insulator thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy have been employed. From the motivation of breaking time-reversal symmetry in the surface state, the first experiments study the structural, magnetic, and magneto-transport properties of a magnetically doped, three-dimensional topological insulator, bismuth telluride doped with Mn. We observed ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature up to 17 K in films with ~2-10% Mn concentrations. The observed ferromagnetism is independent of carrier density in the Mn-doped bismuth telluride films, suggesting that it is not mediated by charge carriers. The next topological insulator system with magnetism is a hybrid topological insulator/ferromagnet heterostructure as a new approach for topological insulator hybrid systems using a dilute magnetic semiconductor Ga1-xMnxAs. A highly resistive Ga1-xMnxAs with out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy is cleanly interfaced with a topological insulator Bi2-xSbxTe3-ySey by molecular beam epitaxy. Magneto-transport measurements on a top-gated heterostructure device show a crossover from positive magneto-conductance to negative magneto-conductance as well as a systematic emergence of an anomalous Hall effect as the temperature is lowered or as the chemical potential approaches the Dirac point. The results are possibly interpreted as the modification of the surface state at the interface by the adjacent, ferromagnetic Ga1-xMnxAs layer. The last topological insulator system with magnetism is a topological insulator channel with a magnetic tunnel junction on it. We seek a potential role of topological insulators in spintronics as generators of carrier spin polarization. Electrical detection of the inherent spin polarization of the topological insulator surface state was demonstrated using a permalloy/Al2O3 magnetic tunnel junction on a (Bi,Sb)2Te3 channel. The observed hysteretic spin signals occurring at the magnetic switching field of the ferromagnet permalloy layer can be interpreted as the projection of the current-induced spin polarization on a topological insulator surface onto the magnetization of the ferromagnet via tunneling.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10173], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Joon Sue", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "Sue", "first_name_ssi": "Joon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth", "Nitin Samarth", "Jainendra Jain", "Jun Zhu", "Suman Datta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth, Dissertation Advisor", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Chair", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Member", "Jun Zhu, Committee Member", "Suman Datta, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Topological insulator", "surface state", "magnetism", "ferromagnetism", "spintronics", "molecular beam epitaxy"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "ROLE OF NF-&#954;B-ASSOCIATED FACTORS IN T CELL DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION\n", "id": "11604", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2704", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The immune system is a defensive mechanism that protects an organism from disease by identifying and neutralizing invading pathogens.  The proper functioning of the mammalian immune system requires participation and cooperation of different immune cell types, with the ability to distinguish self from non-self.  Despite its protective functions, the immune system can also be a double-edged sword, as aberrant activation of the immune system can cause chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases.  Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanism by which immune responses are generated and regulated.  Various intracellular signal transduction pathways and transcription factors are involved in the activation and regulation of immune responses.  \nNF-&#954;B is a key transcription factor in the immune system that regulates the development, function, homeostasis, and survival of various immune cells.  NF-&#954;B activation typically occurs after a stimulatory signal received at the cell surface is relayed to NF-&#954;B through complex intracellular signaling pathways.  Therefore, the outcome of NF-&#954;B activation is critically determined by the function of molecules involved in the NF-&#954;B signaling pathways.  This thesis addresses the role of NF-&#954;B-associated molecules in the development, differentiation, and function of T cells.  Our studies show that CYLD, a negative regulator of NF-&#954;B activation, is critical for development of natural killer T (NKT) cells.  In addition, Carma1, a key molecule involved in the T cell receptor-mediated NF-&#954;B activation, is required for the development of suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs).  Lastly, p105, a NF-&#954;B precursor molecule with NF-&#954;B inhibitor function, plays an important role in the regulation of T cell homeostasis and prevention of chronic inflammation.  The major findings are summarized below.\n\n1.\tCYLD regulates IL-7 signaling and ICOS expression in the development of natural killer T cells.  Natural killer T (NKT) cells modulate immune responses against pathogens and tumors.  Utilizing CYLD-deficient mice, we show that CYLD, a deubiquitylase that negatively regulates NF&#954;B activation, plays a critical role in NKT cell development.  Unlike most of the known regulators of NKT cell development, CYLD is dispensable for NKT cell maturation but is required for the survival of immature NKT cells.  The survival defect of immature NKT cells was associated with decreased expression of ICOS, a costimulatory molecule required for the survival and homeostasis of NKT cells, and signaling attenuation of an NKT-survival cytokine, IL-7.  CYLD positively regulate ICOS expression and IL-7 signaling by preventing hyper-activation of NF-&#954;B in immature NKT cells.  Thus, CYLD regulates NKT cell development through a mechanism involving modulation of IL-7 signaling and ICOS expression.\n\n2.\tCarma1 regulates development of regulatory T cells in the thymus.  Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in the preservation of self-tolerance and prevention of autoimmunity.  We show that Carma1, a signaling molecule involved in the T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated NF-&#954;B activation, is essential for development of Tregs in the thymus.  Carma1 deficiency leads to attenuation of IL-2 signaling, a cytokine that is critical for the development of Tregs in the thymus.  This IL-2 signaling defect in Carma1-knockout mice is associated with low expression of IL-2 receptor &#946; subunit (IL-2R&#946;).  Thus, Carma1 regulates thymic Treg development through modulation of IL-2 signaling via the IL-2R&#946;.  \n\n3.\tNF-kappa B1 p105 regulates T cell homeostasis and prevents chronic inflammation.  NF-&#954;B transcription factors are regulated by a family of inhibitors called I&#954;Bs.  NF-&#954;B1 precursor, p105, contains I&#954;B-like domain in their C-terminal and can function as NF-&#954;B inhibitors.  In this study, we show that p105 plays an important role in the regulation of T cell homeostasis and prevention of chronic inflammation.  Mice that express mature NF-&#954;B1, p50, in the absence of p105, spontaneously develop T cell-mediated intestinal inflammation.  Consistent with the inflammatory phenotype, p105-deficient mice have increased frequency of memory/effector T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs.   Additionally, p105 deficiency renders CD4+ T cells more resistant to Treg-mediated suppression, while promoting differentiation of inflammatory Th17 CD4+ helper cells.  Therefore, p105 plays critical roles in the regulation of T cell homeostasis and differentiation and the control of chronic inflammation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2699], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Joon Hyung ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Joon Hyung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Charles Norbury", "Shao Cong Sun", "Christopher Charles Norbury", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "Barbara Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Charles Norbury, Dissertation Advisor", "Shao Cong Sun, Committee Chair", "Christopher Charles Norbury, Committee Chair", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Member", "Barbara Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CYLD", "NFkappaB", "NKT", "Treg"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Revisiting Louisiana Drug Interdiction:\nDrug Profiling in the Louisiana Justice System\n\n", "id": "8164", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3280", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Drug profiling in Louisiana State Police Crime Control Unit (LSP-CPU) and the deputies of the St, Martin Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office (SMSO) has been through an in-depth analyses by Ruiz and his colleagues (Bowling, Ruiz, & Reynolds, 2008; Ruiz, 2000; Ruiz & Woessner, 2006).

In the first two chapters, I study a new noncooperative coalitional bargaining model in which each player can buy out other players with upfront transfers. Chapter 1 considers general transferable utility environments and studies players' strategic alliance behavior. In Chapter 2, I extend the model to network-restricted environments in which players can communicate only with their neighbors and they can trade their communication links. Chapter 3 analyzes mechanisms with referrals where each agent's social network is private information.\n\nChapter 1: I introduce a noncooperative coalitional bargaining model with buyout options. The model enables us to investigate players' strategic alliance behavior and gradual agreement phenomena. The main theorem characterizes conditions for a strategic delay: If there is both a strict subcoalition with a strictly positive worth and a player with a strictly positive marginal contribution to the grand-coalition, then forming an efficient coalition is delayed with positive probability for a sufficiently high discount factor. Two special results are established. First, in a general transferable utility environment, a grand-coalition equilibrium is impossible when players are sufficiently patient, unless it is a unanimity game. Second, in legislative bargaining, allowing vote buying causes a non-minimal winning coalition, if both a veto player and a non-veto player coexist. As an application, I characterize an equilibrium payoff vector in three-player simple games.\n\nChapter 2: I introduce a noncooperative multilateral bargaining model for a network-restricted environment, in which players can communicate only with their neighbors. Each player can strategically choose the bargaining partners among the neighbors and buy their communication links with upfront transfers. I characterize a condition on network structures for efficient equilibria: An efficient stationary subgame perfect equilibrium exists for all discount factors if and only if the underlying network is either complete or circular. I also provide an example of a Braess-like paradox, in which the more links are available, the less links are actually used. Thus, network improvements may decrease social welfare.\n\nChapter 3: I study mechanisms for environments with asymmetric contact information. Each agent has a connection type, which determines his neighbors, in addition to a payoff type, which represents a preference over allocations. The participants and the feasible allocations are endogenously determined by agents' strategic referrals. First, I generalize VCG mechanisms, in which the mechanism designer compensates each agent for his marginal contribution. Alternatively, I introduce multi-level mechanisms, in which each agent is compensated by the agents who would not be able to participate without his referrals. I characterize conditions for these mechanisms to be individually rational, budget surplus, and incentive compatible in both fully referring their neighbors and truthfully telling their preferences.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10132], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Joosung ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Joosung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Sona Nadenichek Golder", "Edward James Green", "Vijay Krishna", "Neil Wallace"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Dissertation Advisor", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Sona Nadenichek Golder, Committee Member", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Member", "Neil Wallace, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Coalitional Formation", "Multilateral Bargaining", "Mechanism Design", "Network", "Referral Program"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "GROWTH OF MULTIFERROIC OXIDES BY MOLECULAR-BEAM EPITAXY\n\n\n", "id": "11504", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3194", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multiferroic materials, which simultaneously exhibit ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, have attracted a great deal of attention due to their physical origin and potential application in novel electronic devices.

When such data are released, it is necessary to prevent sensitive information pertaining to individuals from being disclosed. In statistical disclosure limitation, we must maintain a balance between disclosure risk and the data utility needed to make valid statistical inferences. One method for achieving this balance is to release partial information about the original data. In practice, many agencies release data summarized in the form of marginal sums or conditional probabilities. Sampling methods for multi-way contingency tables given a set of observed marginal sums have been studied in diverse ways; yet, there is almost no literature about sampling of tables given a set of observed conditional probabilities. In this thesis, we focus on a set of conditional probabilities instead of marginal sums. We propose MCMC simulation schemes coupled with tools from algebraic statistics to sample tables from the sets of possible tables given observed conditional values. We also propose a simple extension to the case given a combination of observed marginal totals and conditional values. These algorithms can be used to compute posterior distribution and assess data utility and disclosure risk in the context of statistical disclosure limitation. We demonstrate the proposed algorithms with simple examples and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, proposed sampling algorithms can be used for releasing synthetic contingency tables. We study both the disclosure risk and data utility associated with proposed synthetic tabular data releases. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3185], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Juyoun ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Juyoun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aleksandra B Slavkovic", "Aleksandra B Slavkovic", "Donald Richards", "Murali Haran", "Yuri Zarhin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aleksandra B Slavkovic, Dissertation Advisor", "Aleksandra B Slavkovic, Committee Chair", "Donald Richards, Committee Member", "Murali Haran, Committee Member", "Yuri Zarhin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Algebraic Statistics", "Monte Carlo)", "Stochastic Computation and Simulation Methods (MCM", "Categorical Data Analysis", "Contingency Tables", "Statistical Disclosure Limitation Method"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Mentor teachers' perception of motivation toward their personal learning and toward their attitude about teaching in an elementary professional development school", "id": "28795", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12578", "abstract_tesi": "This study explores the motivations and attitude changes of three mentor teachers who work at an elementary school in the State College Area School District as a part of a professional development school (PDS) partnership with Florence State University (pseudonym).

Moreover, recent large-scale network and high-dimensional data show the following common properties which present new challenges for existing statistical methods: i) the data come from different resources and have heterogeneous relations or dependencies; ii) the hidden structures may change over time as relations and dependencies are rarely static; and iii) the data are often collected in large-scale dynamic fashion. Hence, this dissertation focuses on modeling and learning large-scale dynamic networks and exploring the heterogeneous dependencies of high-dimensional data.\n\nDynamic networks modeling provides an emerging statistical technique for various real-world applications. It is a fundamental research question to detect the community structure in dynamic networks. However, due to significant computational challenges and difficulties in modeling communities, there is little progress in the current literature to effectively find communities in dynamic networks. In this dissertation, we introduce a novel model-based clustering framework for dynamic networks, which is based on (semiparametric) exponential-family random graph models and inherits the philosophy of finite mixture modeling. To determine an appropriate number of communities, a composite conditional likelihood Bayesian information criterion is proposed. Moreover, an efficient variational expectation-maximization algorithm is designed to solve approximate maximum likelihood estimates of network parameters and mixing proportions. By using variational methods and minorization-maximization techniques, our methods have appealing scalability for large-scale dynamic networks. Finally, the power of our method is demonstrated by simulation studies and real-world applications.\n\nGraphical models have been widely used to investigate the complex dependence structure of high-dimensional data, and it is common to assume that observed data follow a homogeneous graphical model. However, observations usually come from different resources and have heterogeneous hidden commonality in real-world applications. In this dissertation, we introduce a novel regularized estimation scheme for learning a nonparametric mixture of Gaussian graphical models, which explores the heterogeneous dependencies of high-dimensional data. We propose a unified penalized likelihood approach to effectively estimate both nonparametric functional parameters and heterogeneous graphical parameters. We also present a generalized effective EM algorithm to address both non-convex optimization in high dimensions and the label-switching issue. Moreover, we prove both the ascent property and the local convergence hold for our proposed algorithm with probability tending to 1 and also verify the asymptotic properties of the local solution for our model under standard regularity conditions.

The global objective of this study is to examine caregivers\u2019 perceptions of sit-down family restaurants that implement healthy eating initiatives. This dissertation applies the two concepts of consumer empowerment and perceived corporate social responsibility to uncover the underlying dimensions of caregivers\u2019 perceptions. The present study proposes that caregivers will have high willingness to visit sit-down family restaurants that provide healthful children\u2019s foods and nutrition information. The increased willingness results from increased feelings of empowerment and perceptions of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Furthermore, the impact of healthy eating initiatives on empowerment and perceived CSR depends on how concerned caregivers are about children\u2019s eating.\nThis study investigated the proposed hypotheses using a between-subjects experimental design by manipulating the existence of healthful children\u2019s foods and nutrition information on real menus. The results suggest that caregivers have high willingness to select restaurants when restaurants provide healthful children\u2019s menu items and nutrition information and that willingness is mediated by empowerment and perceived CSR. Specifically, the effects of healthful children\u2019s foods are partially mediated, and those of nutrition information are completely mediated by consumer empowerment and perceived CSR. Furthermore, when restaurants provide healthful children\u2019s foods, caregivers who are highly concerned about children\u2019s eating tend to feel more empowered and perceive that restaurants are socially responsible more often than those who are less concerned. Caregivers\u2019 concerns about children\u2019s eating do not moderate the impact of nutrition information on perceptions.\nThe present study\u2019s inquiry into caregivers\u2019 perceptions contributes to theoretical knowledge about the influence of healthy eating initiatives on consumers\u2019 dining behaviors, especially those involving their children.

A steam reformer can be combined with fuel cells for an on-board or on-site hydrogen production and fuel cell conversion to electricity. These fuel cell systems may preferentially use liquid hydrocarbon fuels such as jet or diesel fuel as feedstocks due to the high gravimetric and volumetric energy density of liquid fuels. A major challenge of these systems is to overcome sulfur poisoning of reforming catalysts caused by sulfur compounds inherently present in liquid fuels. There are two ways to resolve the sulfur poisoning problem, the use of a desulfurization processor and the development of sulfur tolerant reforming catalysts. This dissertation focuses on sulfur tolerant catalysts. Sulfur tolerant catalysts either facilitate a compact reforming system by removing a desulfurization unit or further improve the sulfur tolerance of reforming reactions with a desulfurization unit. \nRecent experimental results demonstrate that addition of Ni to Rh catalysts provides a higher sulfur tolerance than pure Rh catalysts. Characterizations using TPD and XPS prove that the sulfur tolerant Rh-Ni catalysts exist as a bimetallic form, however it necessitates a further study of the sulfur tolerance mechanism. This dissertation examines the mechanistic source of sulfur tolerance for bimetallic Rh-Ni catalysts using the density functional theory (DFT) methods, ab initio thermodynamics, and microkinetic modeling. This dissertation considers four metal surfaces including pure Rh, pure Ni, and binary Rh1Ni2, Rh2N1i with (111) and (221) facets for flat and stepped surfaces, respectively. As methane formation during steam reforming is most sensitive to sulfur poisoning, the kinetics of CO dissociation is analyzed on four metal surfaces by comparing sulfur-free and sulfur-poisoned conditions. Various sulfur poisoning species are also examined to find the thermodynamically favorable poisoning path using ab initio thermodynamics. The steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbon is modeled using propane steam reforming reactions. The potential energy surface along elementary steps of propane reforming is constructed using Br\u00f8nsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations.

This dissertation addresses the general issue of the development in infancy of goal-directed arm movements under the influence of different sources of informational constraints.  More specifically, the main focus was to investigate the role of environmental constraints including object properties, visual and audition feedback of the arm trajectory on the development of prehension during infancy.\n\tIn Experiment 1, it was found that as infant age increased (10 \u2013 14 weeks) through the phases of object-oriented movements, the distinguishing feature was that there was a decrease in movement jerk (when normalized to a dimensionless quantity), which reflects the increasing ability to adaptively modulate arm movements.  This change in the dynamic characteristics of the object-oriented arm movements precedes the onset of goal-directed reaching movements and is hypothesised to reflect a critical variable in the infant developmental process of learning to reach in prehension.\nIn Experiment 2, the influence of auditory feedback on the development of reaching movements in infancy was investigated at 10-14 weeks of age.  The results showed that before the onset of reaching, the amplitude of the arm movement increased when the auditory feedback was provided.  Also, at the point of reaching onset, the number of reaches increased when the auditory feedback was presented.  Together, these results showed that before the onset of reaching, infants are able to use auditory feedback to explore the possibilities for action, and that subsequently the primitive form of these object-oriented arm movements is developed into more skilled and goal-directed reaching movements. \nIn Experiment 3, we addressed the question of whether the development of prehension was influenced by the visual information of the hand trajectory and object properties at reach onset, 6 mo and 1 yr of age.  It was found that age of onset of reaching for an object was earlier when the visual feedback of the hand trajectory was available.  However, the effect of the visual feedback of the hand trajectory diminished after reach onset; there were no significant difference in terms of movement speed and smoothness at 6 mo and 1 yr of age.  Infants also reached for the larger object earlier and with higher velocity than for the smaller object.  Collectively, these results reveal the distinct roles of visual information of the hand trajectory and object property on the development of prehension during the infancy. \nIn sum, the results of the experiments highlight the importance of exploratory behavior in early infancy and how exploratory behavior prior to the onset of reaching movements can be channeled through the vision and auditory information feedback.  These findings are consistent with the perspective that the development of motor skill is influenced by the interactions among the organism, task and environment constraints.  The weightings of the constraints as boundary conditions change at a certain developmental time in the emergence and mastering of the movement patterns. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4480], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Mei-Hua ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mei-Hua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell", "Karl Maxim Newell", "John Henry Challis", "Rick Owen Gilmore", "Cynthia Bartok"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell, Dissertation Advisor", "Karl Maxim Newell, Committee Chair", "John Henry Challis, Committee Member", "Rick Owen Gilmore, Committee Member", "Cynthia Bartok, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["visual feedback", "infancy", "Reaching", "auditory feedback"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "AESTHETIC EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN: PUBLIC/IN-BETWEEN SPACE, \nHAPPINESS AND IDENTITY\n\n\n", "id": "12247", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4426", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the essential structure and nature of aesthetic education as a public/in-between space for children to accomplish happiness and reveal their identity. The term aesthetic refers to the ways in which we perceive the world through sensory perception as well as the ways in which we attend fully to the particulars of our experiences. Aesthetic education, then, enables students to perceive the world through their sensory perception and to be fully conscious of the world in which they are immersed. The public/in-between space created by aesthetic education allow people to express their own voices, negotiate with others by interacting with them in intersubjective relationships, become conscious, think more deeply, and develop critical perspectives. \nAs political beings who perform certain actions and speak in certain ways, we human beings need a space where we can reveal ourselves and interact with others. By doing so, human beings can recognize who they are in their relationships with others and achieve happiness in terms of political meaning. Happiness relates to political human characteristics in the public space\u2014namely, how we humans can live with others who are different (e.g., with different opinions and perspectives) harmoniously in a community through speech and action. Thus aesthetic education can be achieved in the public/in-between space, where others\u2019 uniqueness and differences are revealed through interactions involving speech and action.\nThis study investigated how students interact with teachers and other students in aesthetic education in both the public/in-between space. A hermeneutic phenomenological case study was conducted in Ms. Valenza\u2019s art class of the Kingsley Montessori School, Boston, where aesthetic education occurs in the classroom.\nData gathered from observations and interviews with students and the teacher was analyzed (Chapter 4). The context of the class overall was based on the observations; interviews with students and the teacher were analyzed according to significant statements, formulated meanings, and cluster themes. After establishing cluster themes from the formulated meanings, a description of cluster themes was presented. Based on this analysis, the findings and discussion were provided (Chapter 5). I discussed the themes more deeply in light of the literature review, my prior experiences, and research that expands the horizon of and provides insights into aesthetic education. \nAesthetic education as public/in-between space provides a way to enable multiple people to live in harmony within the community by speaking and acting as political beings and without sacrificing their differences. This study reveals important aspects of aesthetic education by investigating how students interact with teachers and with other students in aesthetic education in both the public/in-between space. By doing so, this study emphasizes the value of aesthetic education for children in art education as a means to help students make their lives meaningful by living as subjects who think critically in a democratic society and visual culture. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4396], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Min Jung ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min Jung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine M Thompson", "Christine M Thompson", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius", "Charles Richard Garoian", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christine M Thompson, Dissertation Advisor", "Christine M Thompson, Committee Chair", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius, Committee Member", "Charles Richard Garoian, Committee Member", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aesthetic Education", "Public/In-between Space", "Happiness", "Identity", "Consciousness", "Sensory Perception", "Hermeneutic Phenomenology"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "SPEECH SILENT/UNVOICED/VOICED\nCLASSIFICATION WITH HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "8473", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5014", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Robust silent/unvoiced/voiced (SUV) classification in noise is still considered a difficult speech processing problem.

Classic research in comparative functional morphology suggests that the musculoskeletal architectural parameters (such as muscle fascicle length, pennation angle, muscle thickness, and moment arm) of many animals allow them achieve maximal performance.  This correspondence of form and function has been demonstrated in animals such as the cheetah, the fastest running animal, and the frog, one of nature\u2019s best jumpers,\nWhile muscle architecture and joint structure have been shown to influence function in animals, the relationships between musculoskeletal architecture and muscle function are not well established for many human movements.  Previous investigations have established that fascicle length, pennation angle, and muscle thickness influence muscle function through the force length and force velocity properties of muscle.  Muscle moment arm, however, has received less attention.  Muscle moment arm affects the force-, moment-, and power-generating capacity of a muscle such that a muscle with a smaller moment arm may operate on more favorable regions of the force length and force velocity curves, although mechanical advantage may be sacrificed to do so.\nHuman locomotor performance is often evaluated using gait analysis, but the influence of musculoskeletal architecture on variables measured in the gait laboratory has received little attention.  The overall goal of this dissertation was to investigate the link between musculoskeletal architecture and locomotor performance in sprinters and older adults, populations that have obvious functional demands.  In vivo measurements of lateral gastrocnemius muscle and ankle joint structure were made, as well as assessments of locomotor performance through gait analysis.  Our findings suggest that sprint performance may be enhanced by shorter plantarflexion moment arm and longer toes as demonstrated by in vivo measurements using ultrasonography and a simple computer simulation of the sprint push-off.  Those two musculoskeletal architecture parameters permit generation of greater forward impulses which is essential during the acceleration phase at the start of a sprint race.\nReductions in ankle plantarflexor function with advancing age, in the form of decreases in strength and power, have been shown to correlate with slower gait in the elderly.  Our findings show that plantarflexor moment arm is a strong predictor of gait velocity in elderly individuals who walk slowly.  In addition, several musculoskeletal architectural parameters of the lateral gastrocnemius were found to correlate with ankle kinematic, kinetic, and spatiotemporal gait parameters during gait at slow, preferred, and fast speeds in elderly individuals.  These specific results suggest that age-related changes in muscle and joint architecture may be associated with declines in mobility, specifically walking, through their influence on plantarflexion rangle of motion and plantarflexor moment and power.  The studies of sprinters and older adults in this thesis provide insight and understanding into the influence of musculoskeletal architecture on plantarflexor function.  It is hoped that these findings will lead to targeted training protocols that will improve locomotor performance and quality of life for the elderly.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5836], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Sabrina Sien Man ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sabrina Sien Man", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Robert Barry Eckhardt", "Andris Freivalds", "Jinger Gottschall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Chair", "Robert Barry Eckhardt, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "Jinger Gottschall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sprinting", "elderly gait", "muscle architecture", "moment arm"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on the Role of Ideals and Morality in Consumer Decisions", "id": "21104", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9723", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Consumers\u2019 desire to be their ideal self or communicate their ideal self-images to others generates various motivations affecting their decisions. Importantly, consumers\u2019 concerns with morality often motivate or regulate their pursuit of their ideal self. Building on these ideas, three essays demonstrate the important role of ideals and morality in different consumer decision contexts.\nIn the first essay, I explore how consumers with high moral identity respond to donation requests from charities. Though moral identity tends to have a positive effect on prosocial behavior, moral identity decreases donations to charity recipients who are responsible for their plight due to perceived injustice of donating to these recipients. However, donations to these recipients can be enhanced when individuals with high moral identity recall their own moral failings and feel empathy for the recipients.\nIn the second essay, I explore how consumers make price decisions in Pay-What-You Want pricing schemes. Consumers generally have strong self-interest motivation to save money when they can set their own price, but their concerns with being fair to the seller or communicating ideal social images of prestige and wealth to other consumers constrain their self-interest seeking and lead them to offer higher prices to the seller.\nIn the third essay, I propose that social benefits of conspicuous consumption will not accrue when money spent on conspicuous consumption is acquired without adequate effort of one\u2019s own and is thereby perceived to be unfair. Especially when consumers place greater value on justice, they evaluate another person who engages in conspicuous consumption using money acquired without fair effort more negatively.

The differential aeration hypothesis attributes localized corrosion to a spatial separation of local anodes and local cathodes.  The former occurs in the region of a given system (e.g. within a crevice or crack) that has the least access to a cathodic depolarizer (e.g. O2).  The latter occurs in the region (e.g. on an external surface) with the greatest access to a cathodic depolarizer.  This hypothesis, combined with the natural law of charge conservation, yields the measurements of the electron coupling current that flows from local anodes to local cathodes, which contains valuable information concerning the processes that occur within local anodes.\nA simple crevice corrosion monitor was developed to monitor crevice corrosion in 1018 mild steel, Type 304 stainless steel, and Type 410 stainless steel in deionized water and in NaCl solutions with and without the addition of a chemical corrosion inhibitor.  The monitor, which measures the electron coupling current that flows from the crevice to the external surface, followed the evolution of crevice activity in a manner that can be understood in terms of the cathodic process that occurs on the external surface and the partial anodic process that develops within the crevice, due to the accumulation of H+ and Cl-.  The crevice initiation time is typically very short, but varies depending upon chloride concentration and, possibly, inhibitor concentration.  After initiation, the coupling current increases over time, passing through a maximum, then decreasing and eventually changing sign, from positive to negative, which indicates crevice inversion.  This inversion is attributable to the gradual build-up of H+ within the crevice to the extent that proton reduction within the crevice becomes the principal cathodic reaction in the system, while the anodic reaction moves to the external surface.  In addition, amines are effective corrosion inhibitors of crevice corrosion of mild steel and stainless steels in NaCl solutions by forming a protective inhibitor film, thereby inhibiting the cathodic reaction occurring on the external surface, provided that they are present in sufficiently high concentrations.\nThe shape evolution of sensitized Type 304 stainless steel surface cracks in boiling water reactor primary coolant circuit piping at 288 \u00b0C was explored as a function of environmental variables\u2014such as electrochemical potential, solution conductivity, flow velocity, and multiplier of standard exchange current density for O2 reduction\u2014using the coupled environment fracture model (CEFM).  For more accurate prediction of crack growth rate, Shoji\u2019s approach for calculating crack tip strain rate, together with a precise treatment of the stress intensity factor for semi-elliptical surface cracks, has been integrated into the CEFM.  This revised CEFM accurately predicted the dependence of crack growth rates on the stress intensity factor and offers an alternative explanation for the development of semi-elliptical cracks to those suggested by fracture mechanics alone.  Moreover, the CEFM predicted that the minor axis of the ellipse should be oriented perpendicular to the surface, in agreement with observation.  The development of the observed semi-elliptical cracks with the minor axis perpendicular to the surface is therefore attributed to the dependence of the crack growth rate on the electrochemical crack length.\nThe CEFM, which has been used extensively to predict intergranular stress corrosion cracking in sensitized austenitic stainless steel components in the heat transport circuits of nuclear power reactors, has been modified and calibrated to predict crack growth rates in Al-Mg alloys in marine environments, and Alloy 22 in saturated NaCl solutions.  Calibration involves optimization of the CEFM on measured crack growth rate data of the materials of interest and, after extracting values for essential parameters, calculation of crack growth rate data as a function of independent variables of interest.  The customized CEFM provided quantitative predictions of the effects of O2 concentration, electrochemical potential, stress intensity factor, flow velocity, multiplier of the standard exchange current density for O2 reduction, and conductivity on crack growth rates in lightly sensitized AA5083-H321 in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solutions.  The importance of external environment properties\u2014such as conductivity, oxidant/reductant concentration, and the kinetics of cathodic reactions on the surfaces external to the crack\u2014has been confirmed.  Crack growth is attributable to a sequence of micro-fracture events at the crack front. Micro-fracture frequency is determined by the mechanical conditions that exist at the crack tip and are governed by the stress intensity.  Micro-fracture dimension is determined by hydrogen-induced fracture.  The crack growth rate is the product of these two quantities.\nAnother area of exploration is the crack shape evolution of surface stress corrosion cracks in lightly sensitized AA5083-H321 in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solutions.  Evolution of semi-elliptical surface cracks is attributable to the dependence of the crack growth rate on the electrochemical crack length, rather than on variation in the local stress intensity along the crack front.  Accordingly, the evolution of the semi-elliptical shape depends upon environmental variables\u2014such as electrochemical potential, solution conductivity, flow velocity, and multiplier of standard exchange current density for O2 reaction.  The CEFM for lightly sensitized AA5083-H321 also predicts that the local stress intensity along the crack front, assuming constant load conditions, has an impact on the crack shape evolution after a certain time, due to the large differences in stress intensities at the edge and the center of surface cracks.  Nevertheless, the CEFM predicts that all the aspect ratios at failure examined in this study fall within the range of 0.7 to 0.9, which indicates a crack that is semi-elliptical in shape, with the long axis parallel to the surface.\nTheoretical aspects of the stress corrosion cracking of Alloy 22 in contact with a saturated NaCl solution was explored in terms of the CEFM, which was calibrated based upon available experimental data.  Crack growth rate was predicted as a function of stress intensity, electrochemical potential, temperature, and electrochemical crack length.  The CEFM for Alloy 22 predicts that the crack growth rate increases with temperature, passing through a maximum at about 80 \u00b0C, and that its electrochemical potential increases with temperature.  Based upon the dependence of the crack growth rate on the electrochemical crack length, the evolution of a semi-elliptical surface crack in a planar surface under constant loading conditions over the course of one million years was demonstrated.  One million years is the service horizon for some high level nuclear waste repositories of the Yucca Mountain type.  The CEFM suggests that stress corrosion cracking is possible in Yucca Mountain-type repositories, provided that the crack can nucleate.  It predicts that a crack could penetrate the 2-cm thick outer shell of the waste package in a time of 1057 years at the selected temperature (110 \u00b0C), suggesting that through-wall cracking in the outer shell of the waste package is dominated by the crack initiation.\nThe CEFM\u2019s success in explaining the stress corrosion cracking of aluminum alloys and Alloy 22, supports the notion that internal and external environments are strongly coupled.  Moreover, the CEFM, which was originally developed to describe intergranular stress corrosion cracking in sensitized stainless steels is equally applicable for describing the stress corrosion cracking in lightly sensitized aluminum alloys and Alloy 22.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8755], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Sang-kwon ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sang-kwon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald", "Digby D Macdonald", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare", "James Hansell Adair", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald, Dissertation Advisor", "Digby D Macdonald, Committee Chair", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["the coupled environment fracture model", "localized corrosion", "crevice corrosion", "stress corrosion cracking", "coupling current"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Causal Discovery from Relational Data: Theory and Practice", "id": "14976sxl439", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14976", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Discovery of causal relationships from observational and experimental data is a central problem with applications across multiple areas of scientific endeavor. There has been considerable progress over the past decades on algorithms for eliciting causal relationships through a set of conditional independence queries from data. Much of this work assumes that the data instances are independent and identically distributed (iid). However, in many real-world applications, because the underlying data exhibits a relational structure of the sort that is modeled in practice by an entity-relationship model, the iid assumption is violated. Motivated by the limitations of traditional approaches to learning causal relationships from relational data, a relational causal model is recently introduced. The key idea behind the relational causal model is that a cause and its effects are in a direct or indirect relationship that is reflected in the relational data. Traditional approaches for reasoning with and learning causal models from iid data cannot be trivially applied in the relational setting. Against this background, this dissertation investigates a set of closely related research problems having to do with causal inference with relational data: (i) characterizing the conditional independence relations that hold in a given relational causal model, (ii) sound and complete learning of the structure of a relational causal model using an independence oracle, (iii) measuring the strength of conditional dependence and testing conditional independence among relational variables from relational data, and (iv) robustly learning the structure of a relational causal model from relational data.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16581], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Sanghack ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Sanghack", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vasant Gajanan Honavar", "Vasant Gajanan Honavar", "Clyde Lee Giles", "John Yen", "Bharath Kumar Sriperumbudur"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vasant Gajanan Honavar, Dissertation Advisor", "Vasant Gajanan Honavar, Committee Chair", "Clyde Lee Giles, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Member", "Bharath Kumar Sriperumbudur, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Causality", "Causal Model", "Graphical Models", "Relational Data", "Relational Model"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Critical signaling and ligand interaction mechanisms of the dopamine D1 receptor: Insight into effective pharmacotherapy", "id": "22522", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10080", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dopamine D1 receptor full agonists have been efficacious in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) animal models and PD patients. SKF-83959 is reported to be a functionally selective dopamine D1 receptor ligand with high bias for D1-mediated phospholipase C (PLC) versus D1-coupled adenylate cyclase (AC) signaling. The signaling bias of SKF-83959 is commonly accepted and proposed to explain D1-mediated behavioral activity in PD animal models, but there is substantial (although not all unanimous) literature that failed to account for SKF-83959-mediated PLC activation. Thus, we decided to conduct an in-depth pharmacological characterization of SKF-83959. Contrary to common assumptions, SKF-83959 is a partial agonist (not an antagonist) at AC in vitro and ex vivo. In addition, it shows partial agonistic activity for \u03b2-arrestin activation. SKF 83959 failed to show D1-mediated PLC signaling in a cellular expression system. We conclude that SKF-83959 is not a highly-biased functionally selective D1 ligand, and that its reported behavioral effects can be explained solely by its partial D1 agonism for canonical signaling pathway(s). \nCurrent dopamine D1 receptor full agonists have poor pharmacokinetic properties due to their intrinsic catechol moiety, and it is important to determine how novel non-catechol D1 ligands might be designed. To provide a scientific platform for structure-based drug design, we investigated the molecular interactions of the D1 receptor with several ergolines that have significant D1 activity and oral bioavailability, but not a catechol moiety. I focused on the conserved amino acids of the D1 receptor (T3.37, S5.42, S5.43, S5.46, F6.51, and F6.52) that are known to play a critical role in ligand interactions and/or receptor activation. Mutations to alanine (T3.37A, S5.42A, S5.43A, S5.46A, F6.51A, and F6.52A) on the D1 receptor were basically used to examine the role of the conserved amino acids in ligand interactions.\nA T3.37A mutation greatly decreased the D1 affinity and efficacy of the ergolines. However, a hydrogen bond-conservative T3.37S mutation markedly restored the loss of D1 affinity and efficacy suggesting the possible role of a hydrogen bond provided by T3.37. Unexpectedly, a S5.42A mutation increased the D1 affinity and efficacy for D1-mediated AC activation suggesting that this mutation may induce a favorable D1 receptor conformation for the ergolines. Although a S5.43A mutation failed to decrease the affinity of the ergolines consistently, a S5.46A mutation significantly decreased the affinity of the ergolines but to a small degree. Both the S5.43A and S5.46A mutations showed no significant effects on D1 efficacy of the ergolines. S5.42A/S5.46A and S5.43A/S5.46A double mutations elicited equal or greater effects than those of the single mutations. An F6.51A mutation dramatically decreased the D1 affinity of the ergolines, and an F6.52A mutation showed smaller, but significant decreases than the F6.51A mutation. The F6.51A mutation greatly decreased the ergoline efficacy for AC activation, but an aromatic-ring conserved F6.51W mutation markedly restored the D1 affinity and efficacy. This suggests the critical role of the hydrophobic and aromatic interactions provided by F6.51. Docking simulations illustrated that B-ring nitrogen of the ergoline agonists is located close to T3.37 and S5.46. In addition, the B-ring and the D-ring of the ergoline backbone are located close to F6.52 and F6.51, respectively.\nRotigotine is another non-catechol drug that has reasonable D1 receptor efficacy. S5.42A and S5.43A mutations greatly decreased the D1 affinity and efficacy of rotigotine, whereas a S5.46A mutation failed to make changes suggesting that S5.42 and S5.43 may provide hydrogen bonds for rotigotine. An F6.51A mutation decreased the D1 affinity and efficacy of rotigotine to a far greater extent than an F6.52A mutation indicating that hydrophobic and aromatic interactions of F6.51 are particularly important. Mutagenesis results with 5-OH DPAT and 7-OH DPAT also supported the interaction between the thiophene group of rotigotine and F6.51. The simulations showed that the hydroxyl group is located close to S5.42 and S5.43 and that the thiophene group interacts closely with F6.51. \nIn conclusion, we report that PLC activation by SKF-83959 is not a D1-mediated response, and that it is highly likely non-specific effects occurring at supra-pharmacological concentrations. Using AC activation (not PLC activation) as a functional end-point of D1 receptor signaling, we investigated the molecular interactions between the D1 receptor and non-catechol ligands (the ergolines and rotigotine). This study provides molecular mechanisms for the critical signaling and ligand interactions of the D1 receptor that may help design novel non-catechol D1 agonists.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9776], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Sangmin ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sangmin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Bernard Mailman", "Richard Bernard Mailman", "Kent Eugene Vrana", "John Ellis", "Thomas E Spratt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Bernard Mailman, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Bernard Mailman, Committee Chair", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Member", "John Ellis, Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dopamine D1 receptor", "SKF-83959", "funtional selectivity", "ergolines", "rotigotine", "structure-based drug design"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The role of usability, aesthetics, and cognitive style on user preference for interactive applications", "id": "11089", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5984", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding target users is a crucial issue in developing successful interactive applications. User preference needs to be given priority because it directly reflects a user&#8223;s feelings toward applications&#8223; attributes and ultimately influences his or her decision to purchase or use an application with satisfaction. The present study focuses on a better understanding of user preferences based on perceived usability and perceived aesthetics. For this, previous empirical studies on the relationships among perceived usability, perceived aesthetics, user performance, and user preference are reviewed with the consideration of occurrence of actual use. Also, findings of the past studies are summarized and are discussed in terms of relationships of interest, variable measurements, experimental domains, types of participants, manipulations of usability and aesthetics factors, performance measures, and possible reasons of conflicting findings for a specific relationship. These factors are interrelated and are affected by each other in an experimental context. On the basis of the review and the discussion of the previous studies, several suggestions for future research (including our experiment in this study) are made to confirm or clarify existing findings by considering various influential factors, and a conceptual model for user preferences based on usability and aesthetics is constructed to show the processes of users&#8223; preference-making before and during/after actual use and to emphasize mutual influences and feedback loops in user experience.\nTo contribute to the comprehension of user preferences, we introduce a new methodology that simultaneously considers usability, aesthetics, cognitive style, and occurrence of actual use in a more concrete setting. Seventy-three engineering students participated in an experiment using four simulated systems with different levels of usability and aesthetics. The results showed that, before actual use, user preference was significantly affected by the aesthetics factor but marginally affected by the usability factor. On the other hand, after actual use, user preference was significantly influenced by both the usability and the aesthetics factors. Regardless of the occurrence of actual use, user preference was highly correlated with both perceived usability and perceived aesthetics, which were strongly interrelated. The occurrence of actual use had significant effects on perceived usability, perceived aesthetics, and user preference. In addition, before actual use, the effect of the aesthetics factor on user preference was significantly different between imagers and verbalizers, but that of the usability factor was not. The difference between imagers and verbalizers with respect to the effect of the aesthetics/usability factor on time performance was not sufficiently demonstrated, nor was the difference between the two cognitive styles with regard to the effect of the aesthetics/usability factor on user preference after actual use. The interaction effect between cognitive styles and actual use on user preference was not adequately significant. The findings provide several implications in understanding users&#8223; preference-making and in establishing design and marketing strategies for target users of interactive applications.

We treat the five functions together, to provide near-optimal solutions, considering overall supply chain performance. All of these algorithms use distributed feedback control of continuous variables and therefore can be modeled using differential equations, making them amenable to control theoretic techniques. Performing a variety of computational experiments, we show how operational performance of supply chains can be enhanced through unified controls that pool flexibilities and redundancies across these functions. \nThe contribution of this research can be summarized as follows. We develop analytical models of five supply chain functions to characterize real-time dynamics that span from sensors that monitor the health of manufacturing machinery to distribution of finished goods to customers. Dynamic models for five supply chain functions are developed based on theories of nonlinear and discontinuous differential equations, in order to characterize real-time dynamics in a unified manner. Furthermore, we develop multi-function servo control algorithms which iteratively adjust continuous control variables based on feedback obtained from simulation. The dynamic models serve as a unified mathematical framework, consisting of a system of differential equations for design, analysis, and optimization of these five supply chain servo control algorithms.\nSuch a unified approach allows pooling of flexibility and redundancy across supply chain functions, and thus offers potential for significant improvements in operational performance. Applying unified control to the Assemble-to-Order (ATO) production system, average 8.94% improvement in terms of due date deviations of assembly jobs and 86.31% improvement in inventory discrepancy can be obtained, compared to the conventional production system approach. Computational experiments on the unified control of machine capacity, maintenance scheduling, and production scheduling indicate that approximately 10 ~ 20% performance difference is observed compared to the optimal approach, but a much faster rate of convergence, below 0.2 CPU time for almost all cases, is guaranteed by the unified control approach. Such computational tractability of the unified control approach facilitates real-time simultaneous control of various supply chain functions. We apply the unified control approach for solving the capacitated open vehicle routing problem with time windows (COVRPTW), considering just-in-time delivery and greenhouse gas emissions as important performance metrics, and achieve in 1 ~ 9% discrepancies for both metrics compared to optimal solutions, while keeping extremely short computational time for large scale problems.

As a result, the behavior of such an information network can be controlled through resource allocation as well as algorithm selection. We study an information network that characterizes such trends. The service provided by the network is to produce a global solution to a given problem, which is an aggregate of partial solutions of individual tasks. Quality of service of the network is determined by the value of global solution and the time taken for generating global solution. In this thesis we design a scalable adaptive control mechanism along the lines of model predictive control to support the survivability of such networks by utilizing resource allocation and algorithm selection. To address adaptivity we model stress environment by quantifying resource availability through sensors. We build a mathematical programming model with the resource availability incorporated, which invokes optimal control actions as a function of both state and stress environment. The programming model is then decentralized through an auction market. By periodically opening the auction market, the system can achieve desirable performance adaptive to changing stress environment while assuring scalability property.

The objective of my research was to increase our understanding of the functional morphology of the sex pheromone olfactory pathways of these species, focusing on the portion occurring at the level of the antennal olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and their axonal projections into specific glomeruli in the antennal lobe of the brain. \nMy research showed that each type of ORN that responds to a particular pheromone-related compound and housed in specific sensillar types projects with nearly 100%  fidelity to a particular glomerulus in the macroglomerular complex (MGC) of the antennal lobe in both species.

This purpose is achieved by developing two independent methods: 1) an analytical formulation of the pressure gradient for an arbitrary moving source and 2) a time-domain moving equivalent source method. \n\nFirst, the analytical formulation for the pressure gradient is developed to fulfill the boundary condition on a scattering surface to account for arbitrary moving incident sources. A semi-analytical formulation was derived from the gradient of the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FW-H) equation. This formulation needs to calculate the observer time differentiation outside the integrals numerically. A numerical algorithm is developed to implement this formulation in an aeroacoustic prediction code. A new analytical formulation is presented in the thesis. In this formulation, the time differentiation is taken inside the integrals analytically. This formulation avoids the numerical time differentiation with respect to the observer time, which is computationally more efficient. The acoustic pressure gradient predicted by these two formulations is validated through comparison with available exact solutions for a stationary and moving monopole sources. The agreement between the predictions and exact solutions is excellent. One of the advantages of this analytic formulation is that it efficiently provides the boundary condition for the acoustic scattering of sound generated from an arbitrary moving source, such as rotating blades, which undergoes rotation, flapping and lead-lag motions. The formulation is applied to the rotor noise problems for two model rotors (UH-1H and HART-I). For HART-I rotor, CFD/CSD coupling was used to provide unsteady aerodynamics and trim solutions of the blade motion. A purely numerical approach is compared with the analytical formulations. The agreement between the analytical formulations and the numerical method is excellent for both stationary and moving observer cases.\n\nThe formulation for the pressure gradient is first used to predict acoustic scattering in the frequency domain. The prediction is validated with the exact solution for acoustic scattering generated by a monopole source by a stationary sphere. A Bo105 helicopter and a notional heavy lift quad tilt rotor are considered to demonstrate a potential significance of acoustic scattering of rotorcraft noise. NASA's Fast Scattering Code is used for the frequency-domain scattering solver.\n\nSecondly, a new and efficient time domain acoustic scattering method using a moving equivalent source is developed to predict acoustic scattering in the time domain efficiently. The time-domain method provides entire frequency solutions in a single computation and is able to predict acoustic scattering of aperiodic signals. The method assumes an acoustically rigid surface for a scattering body and neglects the refraction effect by non-uniform flow around the scattering body. The pressure-gradient boundary condition is determined on a scattering surface and then the scattered field is calculated by using equivalent sources located within the scattering surface. Linear shape functions are used to discretize the strength of the equivalent sources in time and singular value decomposition is used to overcome potential numerical instability. The detailed numerical algorithm is addressed in the thesis. The method is more efficient numerically and easier to implement than other time-domain methods using a finite difference scheme or boundary integral equations because it is not necessary to find the solution in the entire domain, it uses a fewer number of equivalent sources than the surface mesh points, and it does not involve surface integrals. The method is validated against exact solutions for various cases including a single frequency monopole source, a dipole source, multiple sources, beat, and broadband noise sources. The predictions are found to be in excellent agreement with the exact solutions. The effect of the computational parameters including the number of surface mesh points, the number of equivalent sources, and the position of equivalent sources, etc, on the prediction is investigated and optimum parameters are presented. Acoustic scattering of sound from a moving source by a stationary body is studied to demonstrate scattering of an aperiodic signal. Acoustic scattering of sound produced by a moving source by a moving body is analyzed and the effect of the moving body on the scattered field is shown.\n\nThe numerical method is used to predict acoustic scattering of Bo105 helicopter rotor noise in the time domain.

Acoustic scattering of an impulsive noise is investigated to simulate main rotor BVI noise and its significance is addressed.

They are widely seen as extensions of the self, with users customizing them by way of accessories, such as charms, cases, purses and stickers, and features, such as ringtones and wallpapers, in an effort to give their phones a personal look. Such attempts at cosmetic customization are somewhat more prominent in Asian countries, and signal a distinctly aesthetic, rather than utilitarian, motivation. \nThis thesis examines the degree to which four aspects of cultural psychology\u2014social identity, other-directedness, value of self-expression and self-promotion\u2014predict aesthetic motivations for engaging in mobile phone customization. Furthermore, it explores psychological outcomes, such as emotional attachment to the mobile phone, deriving from such cosmetic customization for aesthetic purposes. \nCollege students (N = 551) from two cultures (e.g., individualistic: United States vs. collectivistic: South Korea) participated in an online survey. The results show that culture is directly related to other-directedness, which is in turn related to higher aesthetic motivations for cosmetically customizing mobile phones. They also suggest that cosmetic customization is driven by a desire to use the phone as a vehicle of self-expression rather than as a tool for self-promotion. Findings also show that the more users engage in cosmetic customization for aesthetic purposes, the more they are attached to their mobile phones\u2014a relationship that is mediated by the degree to which they perceive phones as reflecting the self. \nTheoretical and practical implications of these finding are discussed, followed by study limitations and directions for future research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5981], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Seoyeon ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seoyeon", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Media Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["S.

The spectrin subunit \u03b2Heavy-spectrin (\u03b2H) is part of the apical spectrin based membrane skeleton (SBMS) that is involved in epithelial migration/morphogenesis, plasma membrane integrity, and the stabilization of the ZA. Multiple lines of evidence previously suggested that \u03b2H modulates endosomal trafficking and that the C-terminal segment 33 of \u03b2H (\u03b2H33) is an essential region for this function. Sequence analysis revealed many conserved regions withing \u03b2H33, suggesting that this region of \u03b2H directly or indirectly interacts with many factors. Truncations that remove \u03b2H33 or overexpression of \u03b2H33 causes morphological defects potentially due to abnormal signaling by a trafficking defect. I have investigated the role of the \u03b2H33 and its interaction with three factors; Annexin B9, Rac1 signaling, and PP2A PR72. The interaction with Rac1 signalling was previously unknown.\nThe control of trafficking by \u03b2H involves its interaction with Annexin B9. Here I defined the binding sites between Annexin B9 and \u03b2H. I tested the role of Annexin B9 and \u03b2H in endosomal and DE-Cadherin trafficking using a new dominant negative version of \u03b2H and RNA mediated interference. Annexin B9 is required for efficient trafficking through the MVB and to maintain a high-fidelity apical-lateral boundary. DE-Cadherin is amongst the cargoes in this pathway. \u03b2H33 appears to be a focal point for these trafficking activities.\nPolarized signaling and cytoskeletal elements are required to establish apicobasal polarity as well as to create and maintain adherens junctions (AJ), which form at the boundary between the apical and basal domains. \u03b2H is recruited by the apical polarity determinant Crumbs to stabilize AJ, and Rac1 signaling is known to negatively regulate \u03b2H. \nHere I reported a reciprocal negative relationship between \u03b2H -spectrin and Rac1 signaling, which appears to represent the second point of a bistable switch wherein \u03b2H-spectrin also downregulates Rac1 activity consistent with \u03b2H inhibiting Rac1. Activation of Rac1 signaling by expression of the exchange factor Trio, is strongly enhanced by reducing \u03b2H levels, and heterozygosity for \u03b2H alleles results in a detectable increase in the levels of active Rac1. Sustained expression of a C-terminal fragment of \u03b2H (\u03b2H33) in the eye induces a dominant phenotype that is similar to expression of the dominant negative Rac1N17. Co-expression of \u03b2H33 and Trio suppresses this phenotype, as does knockdown of RacGAP50C. Loss-of-function alleles in pak, a Rac1 effector and negative regulator of \u03b2H, dominantly suppresses larval lethality arising from the loss-of-function karst (\u03b2H) alleles. Expression of constitutively active Pakmyr in the larval salivary gland induces expansion of the apical membrane and destabilization of the apical polarity determinant Crumbs. These effects resemble Rac1 activation and are suppressed by \u03b2H33. Thus, I concluded that \u03b2H is negatively regulated by Rac1 activation, but that Rac1 signaling is suppressed in the apical domain by \u03b2H, probably by its C-terminal domain. Such a system would be bistable with either Rac1 or \u03b2H predominant and may provide a mechanism for apical domain maintenance.\nA novel interaction between \u03b2H33 and a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase PP2A PR72 was identified by a former member of our laboratory. I mapped the specific interaction domains of the two proteins and demonstrated roles of PP2A PR72 in the regulation of apicobasal polarity. Through knockdown and overexpression experiments, I provided evidence that PP2A sustains the ZA. In addition, levels of the MVB markers Hrs and Vps16 are altered in a tissue specific fashion when PP2A is overexpressed or knocked down. This suggests that the effects of PP2A on the ZA may arise through modulation of the MVB and the recycling of ZA components in the \u03b2H/Annexin B9 pathway. I also demonstrate that PP2A modulation dramatically affects the distribution of cellular F-actin. \nTaken together, the results of this work suggest that \u03b2H has an important role in mediating the interplay of the three proteins (signals) by providing a physical scaffold as well as control of trafficking. \nSince all of the above scaffolds directly or indirectly interact with the C-terminus of \u03b2H, I initiated a project which will generate a useful system that will easily modify the C-terminus of \u03b2H. This C-terminal switchable system is based on attP-attB integration followed by the FLP-out system. Using the C-terminal switchable system, we will be able to handle mutagenesis of \u03b2H with the endogenous level of \u03b2H expression, moreover, the FLP-out system will allow for the comparison of mutant cells to wild-type cells side by side. In the first step to set up such a system, I generated a construct that for a homologous ends-out recombination at the karst locus and isolated a potential recombinant. This work will help future investigators to reveal the precise functions of the specific interactions scaffolded by the C-terminus of \u03b2H.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7594], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Seung Kyu", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "Kyu", "first_name_ssi": "Seung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Graham Hugh Thomas", "Graham Hugh Thomas", "Melissa Rolls", "David Scott Gilmour", "Lorraine C Santy", "Aimin Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Graham Hugh Thomas, Dissertation Advisor", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Chair", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Lorraine C Santy, Committee Member", "Aimin Liu, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Drosophila", "spectrin", "beta heavy", "polarity", "Annexin", "PP2A", "Rac1", "endocytosis", "karst", "protein phosphatase 2A"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Investigating the hydrophobic collapse and secondary structure formation of model polypeptides in aqueous salts solutions ", "id": "25017", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11023", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The first part of this thesis discusses the unique hydration of model polymers in H2O and D2O in order to expand the understanding of the relationship between hydrophobic hydration and solvent hydrogen bonding strength. Two model polymers, poly(dimethyl acrylamide) (PDMA) and poly(diethyl acrylamide) (PDEA), were compared. The uncollapsed state of PDMA was found to be more stable in H2O, while PDEA was more stable in D2O. To examine the origin of these phenomena, the effects of pH, solvent transfer, and ion-specificity on polymer collapse were investigated. Experiments were conducted utilizing light scattering, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Raman with multivariate curve resolution (MCR). Among the variables tested, the dominant effects were found to be highly dependent on the nature of the model polymer and its interaction with the solvent. PDMA was found to be less hydrophobically hydrated than PDEA and real proteins.\nThe second part of this thesis describes the specific effects of calcium ions on the secondary structure of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs). Two ELPs, V-120 and V5A2G3-120, were employed in this study. The phase transition temperatures of these ELPs were measured by light scattering measurements and correlated with spectroscopic signatures from circular dichroism (CD). At molar concentrations of calcium chloride, the amount of \u03b2-turn structure was found to increase more for V5A2G3 than V-120. This may be due to the fact that V5A2G3 has a fewer number of valine residues in its polypeptide sequence.

However, there are several challenges that must be overcome for their commecial development. The energy conversion efficiency of dye cells is still far below the level of silicon photovoltaic cells despite an enormous worldwide effort over the past two decades. The widely used N719 dye absorbs the light weakly in the 550 \u2013 700 nm region. If red photons that are not absorbed by the dye can be utilized in DSSC, it will be possible to achieve a much higher efficiency. Several dyes with strong red absorbance have been reported, but because they have lower excited-state excess free energy, they typically have a lower quantum yield for charge injection. Instead of developing additional dyes, this dissertation introduces a novel way to enhance the device efficiency by designing a DSSC with a layer of titania inverse opal photonic crystals (PCs) that enhances light collection. The efficiency of DSSCs increased from 6.5 to 8.3% using titania PCs. This improvement derived from increases in both the short circuit photocurrent and open circuit photovoltage of the cell. Additionally, the enhancement is very sensitive to the degree of physical contact between the PC and nanocrystalline titania layers, and a few hundred nm gap between the layers is sufficient to decouple the two layers optically.   \nAnother issue that prevents DSSCs from commericialization is the use of volatile solvents in the electrolyte. This presents challenges for manufacturing and long term stability for outdoor applications. Hence, a novel solvent system, phosphazene-based nonvolatile electrolytes is examined to replace volatile solvents. Electrolytes based on hexa [methoxyethoxyethoxy cyclophosphazene] (MEE trimer) with dissolved LiI, NaI, NH4I, and 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium (PMII) and I2 were examined. The anion conductivities were highest in the PMII system and decreased in the order PMII > NH4I > NaI > LiI. Photovoltaic measurements of DSSCs containing these electrolytes agree with the anion conductivity measurements. In addition, polyphosphazene-plasticizer blends with a dissolved PMII/I2 electrolyte gave better performance in DSSCs than equivalent poly(ethylene oxide)\u2013plasticizer electrolytes. The efficiencies of these DSSCs are currently low (~1.9%) mainly due to a slow mass transport of I-/I3-. This dissertation addresses the primary loss mechanisms and proposes possible ways for improving polyphosphazene-based cells. \nThe structure of the dye-sensitized solar cell can be modified to carry out the photoelectrolysis of water, producing H2 and O2. However, the quantum efficiency of the current dye-sensitized water splitting system is quite low, mainly due to fast charge recombination between photoinjected electrons in TiO2 and the oxidized dye at the surface. This study assesses the limitations of the current system, and investigates different insulating materials as a thin overlayer, for instance ZrO2 and Nb2O5 on the TiO2 electrode to improve the efficiency of the system. Having a thin layer of insulating materials increased the photocurrent and slowed charge recombination as confirmed by flash photolysis/transient absorption measurements. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5973], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Seunghyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seunghyun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Harry R Allcock", "Nicholas Winograd", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Chair", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Member", "Nicholas Winograd, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dye-sensitized solar cells", "photonic crystals", "non-volatile electrolytes", "dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical water splittin", "core-shell electrodes"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Symmetry Group Extraction from Multidimensional Real Data\n", "id": "10321", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5986", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Symmetry is an important characteristic of an object or a group of objects.

In this dissertation, we study {em Symmetry-based Recognition} from multidimensional real data.\nThe contribution of this dissertation is two-fold (1) a set of novel symmetry group detection algorithms and (2) a set of applications validating the efficacy of the real world symmetry detection algorithms.\nAt the algorithmic level, we propose two novel symmetry group detection algorithms. First, we generalize reflection symmetry detection to a curved glide-reflection symmetry detection problem from real, unsegmented images. Second, we present an effective algorithm for affinely skewed rotation symmetry group detection from real-world images using a frieze-expansion (FE) method that transforms rotation symmetry group detection into a simple one dimensional translation symmetry detection problem. Experimental results for both symmetry detection algorithms on 400+ images demonstrate, quantitatively, superior performance of the proposed algorithms over existing methods.\nAt the application level, we focus on two aspects. First, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for symmetry-driven shape matching and object recognition, where we can incorporate a new symmetry group descriptor into any conventional system. Statistically significant enhancement of shape matching performance over the best state of the art methods on the MPEG-7 data set is observed in our initial experiments. Second, we define and analyze spatiotemporal patterns of human body motion in terms of symmetry distances.

A single incident of child abuse resulted in a critical and eruptive reactions in Korea, and the discussions generated a tremendous amount of concerns. These concerns for children, as we will see in this thesis, would never have been expressed in the 1920s, when children\u2019s rights discourse occurred for the first time of Korean history. Previous definitions of child abuse and exploitation were different from current definition. Even though children were beaten, this was widely accepted as social norm. The gap between the concerns and the status of children\u2019s rights between the 1920s and today seems to be large. How did this change occur? This thesis focuses on the evolution of children\u2019s rights discourses in Korea to answer that question. After considering evidence provided from news articles between 1920 and 1989, the views of children and children\u2019s rights prior to ratification of the Convention on the Right of the Child may have been affected by a domestic child right movement and the United Nations during and after the international child right movements such as the Pledge to Children\u2019s right of 1957, the Declaration on the Right of the Child in 1959 and the announcement of International Year of the Child in 1979. With the combination of the positive impression from the western cultures, and the familiar idea of ensuring children\u2019s rights, the discourse in Korea evolved to create a fertile field for the cultivation of ideas about children\u2019s rights.

This thesis draws on Vygotskyan sociocultural theory to examine two American undergraduate students\u2019 (John and Kevin) language learning processes, beginning in the classroom, during study abroad, and finally upon their return to their home institution. The analysis is based on a longitudinal, ethnographic database\u201418 diaries, 430 photographs, field notes, course materials, regularly recorded interactions in classrooms, tutoring and study abroad settings (125 hours), and interviews with the two participants and their families, teachers, classmates, and host parents in China (60 hours).

The dissertation then contrasts the two students\u2019 multimodal, multisensory processes of learning table etiquette in Chinese homestays. It shows that learning everyday practices and associated language in the homestay abroad is an uneven, challenging process, but students and hosts can collaboratively transform problems into learning opportunities. Finally, the dissertation looks at Kevin\u2019s failed attempt to study Chinese in an upper-level Chinese course offered at his U.S. home institution. The analysis of his classroom interaction, assignments, and interviews indicates that study abroad returnees may enjoy various advantages in the classroom, but that reintegration into home-based language programs can also present significant challenges both for students and for teachers.

This study assessed how and to what extent the use of private tutoring services was influenced by student achievement, school quality, students\u2019 views of college entrance, and students\u2019 background. Of key importance, the study focused on exploring how students\u2019 \u201cprestige-oriented views of college entrance\u201d could be identified as a major factor to explain South Korean students\u2019 dramatic use of shadow education. \nPrior studies have mostly pointed out the matters related to low-quality formal schooling as the causes of Korean students\u2019 growing use of shadow education. Recently, High School Equalization Policy (HSEP) in particular has been mainly criticized for causing students\u2019 use of shadow education by lowering school quality. However, there has not been any empirical evidence that low-quality formal schooling influences the boosting of shadow education. It is also still arguable that HSEP lowered school quality and students\u2019 achievement. Furthermore, the existing perspective on the cause of shadow education alone does not sufficiently explain why quite a high percentage of students answered in some reports that they used shadow education because of a \u201cfeeling of uneasiness.\u201d \nConcerning the cause of students\u2019 reliance on shadow education, this study focused on socio-psychological factors complexly connected with social and cultural characteristics. This study hypothesized that students\u2019 and parents\u2019 distinctive \u201cprestige-oriented views of college entrance,\u201d which might be the core of Koreans\u2019 \u201ceducation fever,\u201d would be a major contributing factor to their use of shadow education. Based on the perspective from institutional theories, this study also hypothesized that students\u2019 use of shadow education would not only be affected by status competition but also by the social climate in which shadow education is a taken-for-granted practice throughout the school system. \nData were drawn from the Korean Education and Employment Panel [KEEP] conducted by the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training in 2004. Four sets of independent variables (i.e., students\u2019 grades, school quality, their prestige-oriented view of college entrance, and family backgrounds) and one dependent variable (i.e., average monthly expenditure on shadow education) were developed from the KEEP data. Multiple Regression analysis was used. \nAnalysis results showed that parent expenditure on shadow education was not accounted for that much either by students\u2019 grades or by school quality. Instead, the most positive influential relationship was found between \u201cprestige-oriented views of college entrance\u201d and parent expenditure on private tutoring. \nThese findings reflect the impact of the distinctive social and cultural features of Korean society on students\u2019 use of shadow education. The intense importance Korean students place on attending a \u201cprestigious\u201d college or university leads them to invest heavily in shadow education. The results also indirectly imply that shadow education might be so embedded in the culture of South Korean schooling that students\u2019 failure to participate in it might lead to feelings of uneasiness. \nThis study has significance for first examining the impact of students\u2019 grades and school quality on shadow education expenditure. This study is, most of all, meaningful as a first attempt to identify a new construct, \u201cprestige-oriented views of college entrance,\u201d as a major factor explaining South Korean students\u2019 excessive reliance on shadow education.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5975], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Soojeong ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Soojeong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William L Boyd", "Roger C Shouse", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Nona Ann Prestine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William L Boyd, Committee Chair", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Member", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Nona Ann Prestine, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["private tutoring expenditure", "shadow education", "Prestige-Oriented view of college entrance", "school quality", "student achievement", "education fever"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Spending Too Little Time or Perceiving Too Little Time?: Linking Time Use, Perceived Time Adequacy, and Well-being of Employed Parents", "id": "26277", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11801", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Contemporary employed parents experience ever increasing challenges in combining work and family roles. One of the primary issues is a lack of time; yet, it is unclear whether parents actually spend too little time in a role or perceive having a less than adequate amount of time for the role (i.e., perceived time adequacy). This dissertation compiles two studies that investigate potential predictors and outcomes of time use and perceived time adequacy. Study 1 used computer-assisted personal interviews of employed mothers (N=440) to understand work and family factors that contribute to relative patterns of time use and perceived time adequacy. Study 2 used daily telephone diaries of employed parents (N=102) to examine the effects of time use and perceived time adequacy on daily well-being. \nStudy 1 revealed three latent profiles based on time use and perceived time adequacy for work and parenting roles: \u201cWork Oriented,\u201d \u201cRole Balanced,\u201d and \u201cParenting Oriented.\u201d The \u201cWork Oriented\u201d profile was characterized as spending more time at work but perceiving lower time adequacy for work, spending less time with children and perceiving lower time adequacy for children, whereas \u201cParenting Oriented\u201d profile showed the opposite pattern. The \u201cRole Balanced\u201d profile exhibited average levels of the four time dimensions. Mothers in the \u201cWork Oriented\u201d profile had greater demands and fewer resources across work and family domains than those in the \u201cParenting Oriented\u201d profile. Longitudinally, increases in work-to-family conflict across 12-months predicted greater odds of moving toward Work Oriented profile, whereas decreases in work-to-family conflict predicted greater odds of moving toward Parenting Oriented profile. \nStudy 2 demonstrated that, on days when parents perceived lower time adequacy for their child, partner, and self they reported less positive affect, more negative affect, and greater physical symptoms independent of the effects of time spent in the role. Moreover, the combination of spending less time and perceiving lower time adequacy in each role had particularly negative effects on daily well-being. This study added a possibility of manipulating the experience of time through a workplace intervention that was designed to increase temporal resources. The workplace intervention improved well-being for parents who spent more time with their family. \nOverall, this dissertation suggests that stressful demands and limited resources in work and family contexts deplete employed parents\u2019 perceived time adequacy for family, which takes a toll on their daily well-being. Future work should continue to examine how to increase employed parents\u2019 time with family that can lead to their better well-being and further positive family relationships. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11260], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Soomi ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Soomi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Manuel Almeida", "David Manuel Almeida", "Susan Marie Mc Hale", "Ann Caverly Crouter", "D Wayne Osgood"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Manuel Almeida, Dissertation Advisor", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Chair", "Susan Marie Mc Hale, Committee Member", "Ann Caverly Crouter, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Daily well-being", "latent profile analysis", "perceived time adequacy", "time use", "work-family conflict", "workplace intervention"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Essential roles of ZnT2 in breast development and function during lactation: Translational studies in cells, mice and humans\n", "id": "28701", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12263", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Successful breastfeeding provides compelling advantages to the growing infant and nursing mother. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months. However, only 47% of infants in the United States are breastfed at 6 months and of those, only 14% are exclusively breastfed as recommended. Moreover, 50% of mothers wean early due to concerns about insufficient milk volume or quality. Increasing the number of breastfed infants to 60% is projected to save the US $300 billion per year in health care costs. Therefore, understanding the biological factors that regulate lactation will allow us to address breastfeeding challenges and have substantial impact on human health and disease.\nSuccessful breastfeeding requires breast expansion and differentiation during pregnancy, termed lactogenesis I or newly defined as secretory differentiation, and the active milk production and secretion after birth, a process initially referred to as lactogenesis II and now defined as secretory activation. The breast or mammary gland undergoes unique developmental processes that are regulated by a combination of hormones and growth factors to induce the physiological changes that occur during the transition from a non-secreting proliferative tissue into a highly differentiated secretory organ during lactation.  Once differentiated, the secretory epithelium must be maintained in order to ensure milk production and offspring survival. A multitude of complex regulatory molecules that are involved in these morphological changes, such as prolactin, estrogen and progesterone have been well studied. However, there is little understanding of non-hormonal factors that regulate mammary gland development and function during lactation.\nZinc (Zn) is required for >300 cellular functions, including proliferation, apoptosis, cell signaling and differentiation, which are all cellular processes that are critical for breast development and function. During lactation, an extraordinary amount of Zn is redistributed from the body to the breast and transferred into milk, ranging from 1-3mg of Zn per day. The Zn transporter ZnT2 (SLC30A2) is responsible for importing Zn into secretory vesicles that traffic to the cell membrane to efflux Zn into milk. Studies from our lab and others found that genetic variation in ZnT2 is common in women and many of these variants lead to reduced milk Zn concentration and can lead to increased risk for severe neonatal Zn deficiency. Therefore, understanding the role of ZnT2 in mammary gland biology has major implications for both infant and maternal health. In addition to providing Zn for secretion into milk, we have evidence that ZnT2 plays a critical role in mammary gland function. Here, we propose that ZnT2 is a critical factor that modulates the mother\u2019s ability to secrete milk. The primary goal of my dissertation research is to understand the physiological role of ZnT2 in the mammary gland during lactation and to determine the functional consequence of ZnT2 dysregulation on breast health and milk composition. \nIn Study 1, we used nulliparous and lactating ZnT2-null mice to demonstrate that the loss of ZnT2 1) impairs mammary expansion during development; 2) reduces mammary gland differentiation and impairs secretion during lactation; and 3) compromises milk composition and offspring survival. Collectively, our observations indicate that the role of ZnT2 extends well-beyond Zn secretion into milk and that ZnT2 is critical factor regulating normal breast differentiation and milk secretion during lactation.  This study provides novel consequences of ZnT2 function in mammary gland biology.\nIn light of the observations in Study 1, we next aimed to determine how the loss of ZnT2 impairs mammary gland differentiation during lactation. In Study 2, we found that without the ability to sequester Zn via ZnT2, Zn accumulates in the cytoplasm and degrades a key epithelial polarity factor, PTEN, which consequently impairs lumen formation, disrupts tight junction formation and prevents differentiation of mammary epithelial cells into alveoli-like mammospheres. Moreover, we show that the loss of ZnT2 disrupts cell surface localization of the principal lactogenic hormone receptor, prolactin receptor, and its downstream Jak2/STAT5 signaling. This study suggests that tight regulation of ZnT2 and Zn metabolism plays an important role in regulating epithelial polarity and mammary differentiation via mechanisms dependent on PTEN activity and prolactin signaling. \nSurprisingly, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms in the mammary gland responsible for milk secretion during lactation. Vesicle acidification by the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) proton pump creates a pH gradient that permits exocytosis of secretory components. Therefore, in Study 3, we determined that ZnT2 is required for vesicle acidification and milk secretion in the mammary gland. We found that ZnT2 is directly associated with the two domains  (V0 and V1) of V-ATPase to allow complex assembly and to acidify vesicles for the secretion of milk constituents from mammary epithelial cells. Our study is the first to show that Zn transport is coupled to proton gradient formation, and is critical for milk secretion. \nFew studies have explored the role of nutrigenomics in lactation. Previous studies from our lab show that genetic variation in ZnT2 is common and one particular variant, S288 was detected in 12% of women. In Study 4, we characterized the functional consequence of S288  variant in breastfeeding women and in cultured cells. Compared to mothers expressing wild-type ZnT2 (T288), we found that these mothers have altered breast milk composition that implies breast dysfunction. Through studies in vitro, we demonstrate that the S288 variant is highly phosphorylated, increases ER Zn accumulation and ER stress, and induces oxidative stress in mammary cells. This study suggests that genetic variation in ZnT2, and nutrigenomics in general, may have important implications for breast function and suggests that factors in breast milk may be useful as bioreporters of breast (dys)function and lactation performance.\nCollectively, my dissertation work focuses on understanding the role of ZnT2 in the mammary gland during lactation in cultured cells, transgenic mice and breastfeeding women. Using a ZnT2-null mouse model, I found that ZnT2 is a critical non-hormonal factor regulating normal breast development and milk secretion during lactation. In studies in vitro, I found that ZnT2-mediated Zn transport is key to regulating vesicle acidification, epithelial polarity, and mammary differentiation.  Finally, I characterized the functional consequence of a common ZnT2 variant on human milk composition and identified novel markers of breast dysfunction. Together, these studies implicate ZnT2 as a major modulator of mammary gland biology and the ability to successfully breastfeed, which have major implications towards improving our understanding of mammary gland Zn metabolism and lactation physiology with respect to maternal and infant health and disease.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11649], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Sooyeon ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sooyeon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shannon Leanne Kelleher", "Troy Ott", "Francisco Javier Diaz", "Kevin John Harvatine", "David I Soybel", "Donna Hope Korzick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Dissertation Advisor", "Troy Ott, Committee Member", "Francisco Javier Diaz, Committee Member", "Kevin John Harvatine, Committee Member", "David I Soybel, Special Member", "Donna Hope Korzick, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["zinc biology", "mammary gland", "lactation", "nutrigenomic"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Virulence of Erwinia amylovora:Hunting down its determinants using transposon mutagenesis of a highly virulent strain, HKN06P-1 ", "id": "12403", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5484", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The gram-negative bacterium Erwinia amylovora is the causal agent of fire blight, the most destructive bacterial disease of apple and pear trees.

Especially, applications to the ionic materials as energy materials are subject to great interest due to their importance in alternate energy source.  In the present dissertation, three examples using CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagram) and first-principles calculations to aid materials design for energy applications are presented:\ni) (La1-xCax)FeO3-&#948; perovskite is a potential candidate material for gas separation membrane. The defect chemistry and the energetics of (La1-xCax)FeO3-&#948; are studied owing to their importance in understanding its electrochemical performance. The interactions of multi-component and mul-tiple-defects are modeled using oxygen nonstoichiometry and the experimental phase equilibrium data.  The calculated phase diagrams are in good agreement with experiments, and based on the models developed, the defect chemistry and the underlying energetics of (La1-xCax)FeO3-&#948; perovskite under various service conditions are predicted in terms of gas composition, pressure, temperature, and Ca content. The developed models hence provide guidance on operational pa-rameters of membranes, solid oxide fuel cells and other applications involving (La1-xCax)FeO3-&#948; perovskite. \ni) LiBH4, owing to its high hydrogen density (18wt%), has been widely studied as a possible candidate for the hydrogen storage material.  However, it desorbs hydrogen gas at a relatively high temperature (400 oC), and it is believed that strong ionic bonding is the main reason.  Since the hydrogen atoms form covalent bond with boron atom, its effect is questionable, and as an effort to elucidate doping effect on the hydrogen desorption temperature, divalent metal-dopants,\nMg, Ca, and Zn, on the stability of LiBH4 is studied.  Using the model parameters, their dehy-driding reactions are estimated in an effort to elucidate the energetically-preferred reaction me-chanism of metal with LiBH4.\niii) LiFePO4 is a promising electrode material for Li-ion battery.  Phase transformation and elec-trochemical cell potential during insertion/deinsertion of Li+ ions are crucial properties which dictate the use of this material as an electrode. By using first-principles calculations, discharge voltage and enthalpy of formation are obtained, and phase diagram of the LiFePO4-FePO4 pseu-do-binary system and cell voltage change at a given condition are predicted by thermodynamic modeling.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5839], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Sung Hoon ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sung Hoon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Zi Kui Liu", "Zi Kui Liu", "Long Qing Chen", "Clive A Randall", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Zi Kui Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Zi Kui Liu, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ionic materials", "energy", "CALPHAD", "first-principles"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "An Examination of Anxiety and Overeating Among African American Women: Can Spirituality or Cultural Identity Act as Mediators?", "id": "17679", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8501", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "                    ABSTRACT\n\n     College students are confronted with a variety of stressors including managing academic coursework, navigating relationships, as well as adjusting to campus life.

Leaf infiltration with the calcium ionophore A23187 triggered strong PR gene expression specifically in cpn1-1 mutant plants grown under permissive conditions while co-infiltration of the calcium chelator EGTA attenuated this effect.

These problems range from failure to provide preventive, chronic or acute health care services almost half the time they are needed to mistakes in the inpatient hospital setting which are estimated to result in 44,000-96,000 preventable deaths annually.  The Institutes of Medicine (IOM) groups these quality problems into three categories:  1) failure to provide health services of proven benefit (i.e. underuse); 2) the delivery of medical care in the absence of evidence that it could help the patient receiving care (i.e. overuse); and 3) failure to execute clinical care plans and/or procedures properly (i.e. misuse).  \nMany analysts believe that misaligned medical care demand and supply incentives are an important causal component of quality problems in the U. S. health care system.  This thesis is organized into three papers that examine demand and supply side quality incentives in HMOs and similar health plans.  HMOs have historically exhibited greater potential to bring about changes in medical care delivery, are often involved in the coordination of health services among different providers and utilize a variety of clinical and non-clinical arrangements designed to incentivize quality improvement in hospitals and physician organizations.\nMany government and private purchasers of insurance now provide public reports of health plan quality to prospective consumers.  It is hoped that these reports will sensitize consumers to quality differences among health plans and help to realign medical care producer incentives for quality.  The first paper (chapter 2) of this thesis makes use of mandates in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA97) requiring the collection and public reporting of clinical quality information of Medicare + Choice (now Medicare Advantage) health plans.  This paper examines whether changes in insurance competition among Medicare HMOs caused by the BBA97 caused improvements in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes quality during the period 1998-2002.  \nPublicly reporting quality information is viewed by many policy makers as an important component in realigning producer incentives for quality improvement.  The Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) alone, contains over 60 measures of the quality of clinical care provided under HMOs and similar health plans.  These measures are often collapsed into composites of health plan quality in report cards used to inform consumers.  However, the methods used to derive HEDIS composites varies widely and analysts have found instances where ratings assigned to health plans using different methods are contradictory.  The second paper develops composites of HMO quality measures and examines statistical relationships among alternative approaches used to combine health plan quality measures.\nSome analysts have argued that government reimbursement may be necessary to incentivize quality improvement in health insurers such as HMOs.  Others have argued that improving quality may result in savings resulting from reductions in medical expenditures.  To date, only a few studies have examined this question and consequently, understanding about the cost of improving health care quality in HMOs is limited and may inadequately account for member case severity differences or differences in the relationship between a plan and its network physicians.

And 3) to identify the factors that lead to differences in morning grooming time for women. Considering the requirements of work, social norms and manners, mate-selection preferences, it is found that several different factors result in divergence in grooming time for women. Make-up time has shown to be the most time-consuming activity in daily grooming. Thus I use the grooming time category from the American Time Use Survey as an approximation to make-up time in this analysis. First, I examine morning grooming time for three different groups: employed men, employed women and non-employed women, while considering parenting effects on both workday and non-workdays. The analysis shows that employed women spend an average of 43 minutes on grooming in the morning on workdays and more on non-workdays. Grooming time for non-employed women however, does not differ too much. Parenting effects contribute to a decrease in grooming time in the all three groups discussed in the paper. Second, from the examinations of the time allocation patterns among both employed woman and employed mothers, the time source for make-up activities in each group is observed, which is mainly from sleeping, household activities, socializing and relaxing, and caring for and helping household members. Finally, the analysis shows how other factors such as race, occupation, marital status, parental status, and employment status significantly influence morning grooming time for women.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6776], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Ya-Ning ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ya-Ning", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Relations and Human Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Drago", "Samanthi Gunawardana", "Jennifer Lynn Hook"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Drago, Thesis Advisor", "Samanthi Gunawardana, Thesis Advisor", "Jennifer Lynn Hook, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["make up", "cosmetics", "grooming", "time use"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Production and Location Choices of Firms in the Taiwanese Electronics Sector \n", "id": "7425", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6773", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Increases in wages and the appreciation of the New Taiwanese dollar since the mid-1980s have significantly altered the environment in which firms operate and survive. In particular, as more countries have liberalized their trade and foreign investment policies, Taiwanese firms have been pressured to respond to the increased international competition for the pool of foreign investment funds.\n\nThis thesis uses micro data from Taiwanese electronics industry to present two firm strategies in response to competition from other\nlow-wage countries: identify low-cost production sites and change product mix. Chapter 1 introduces the background and evolution of the Taiwanese electronics industry. Chapter 2 presents a theoretical model which captures the different incentives of Taiwanese multinationals investing in high- and low-income countries, and an empirical analysis of the link between firm\nheterogeneity and location choices. Chapter 3 empirically analyzes the product choices of Taiwanese multi-product plants during the 1990s.\n\nChapter 2 examines the extent to which the location decisions of Taiwanese multinationals reflect underlying patterns of firm productivity. In the theoretical model, heterogeneous firms in a\nmiddle-income country decide on the optimal production locations for serving three geographically separate markets: domestic,\nforeign high-income and foreign low-income. The model shows that the equilibrium decision of a firm depends on its fixed investment cost of establishing foreign subsidiaries, production costs, transportation costs, market size and its own productivity level. The empirical work in this chapter is based on firm-level data in\nthe Taiwanese electronics industry in 2000. Firms are decomposed into four different categories: non-FDI, investors in China only, investors in the USA only, investors in both China and the USA. I use a multinomial logit model to link firms' location choices with their productivity, controlling for country, industry and other\nfirm characteristics. The findings indicate that more productive firms engage in outward FDI, with the most productive ones investing in both China and the USA. Due to smaller fixed investment costs in China relative to the USA, Taiwanese\nmultinationals investing only in the USA are more productive than those investing only in China.\n\nChapter 3 examines the diversification strategies of multi-product plants in the Taiwanese electronics sector during the 1990s. Using plant-level and product-level data, I first examine if\nmulti-product plants benefit from scope economies arising from joint production. Next, I introduce a dissimilarity index to capture the technological gaps between each pair of products\nwithin a multi-product plant. This index is used to analyze how multi-product plants choose their product mix in the face of increased competition. I find no evidence of scope economies. The\nfindings suggest that multi-product plants whose products have bigger technological gaps are more likely to give up some product lines. Moreover, multi-product plants are shown to exit markets\nwhere production technologies are farthest away from their primary products.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6771], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bee Yan Aw", "Mark John Roberts", "James R.

Recently, the proliferation of Internet technology and globalization of business environment give rise to the advent of dynamic virtual alliances among complementary companies, thereby forming an extended virtual enterprise. Resource scheduling and rescheduling of multiple projects carried out in this situation cannot be effectively supported by existing centralized project scheduling approaches, mainly due to its dynamic and decentralized nature. The need for\nsupporting such organizationally, geographically, and computationally distributed multiple projects (DMP) calls for a novel solution approach, which is distributed, collaborative, and flexible. In this research we have developed a market-based approach to address the DMP problem.\n\nIn the market-based DMP scheduling approach, the agents - representing project managers, tasks, resource managers, and resources - constitute a dynamic virtual economy, where multiple local markets are established and cleared over time. Like any other resource-constrained scheduling problem, the DMP scheduling problem also has to handle precedence constraints and resource constraints. In each local market, resource time slots are evaluated throughout by a combinatorial auction mechanism, generating resource-feasible local schedules for each resource. Meanwhile, in order to generate precedence-feasible schedules for each project, a tatonnement type procedure is applied to the temporary economy, which is a set of local markets. This iterative mechanism, called P-TATO, generates convergent and globally efficient DMP schedules. P-TATO is run in a multiagent based information system infrastructure. We design and implement the multiagent system (MAS) for the DMP control economy. The MAS design and implementation issues - including individual agent model, agent communication, and DMP control ontology - are thoroughly discussed. The solution qualities are verified through an intensive empirical analysis. The analysis results support the high levels of solution quality and computational efficiency of the mechanism.\n\nOur approach can be directly applied to many project-oriented, decentralized scheduling problems. In addition, our problem formulation can also be considered as a decentralized extension of general resource allocation or scheduling problems. Application of our problem-solving model to other decentralized resource allocation and scheduling applications, including military logistics, supply chain management, and survivability analysis of networks are potential areas of future research.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6844], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Yong-Han ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yong-Han", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Natarajan Gautam", "Timothy William Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Chair", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Member", "Natarajan Gautam, Committee Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["resource control", "distributed multiple projects", "multiagent", "market-based control"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Robust planning and execution", "id": "14049yxl5250", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14049", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Uncertainties in a system environment have an adverse impact on the system. The system will yield suboptimal results, inhibit real-time adjustments, and may incur excessive costs for redesign. One of the most common managerial strategies to deal with such uncertainties is to incorporate redundant buffers in planning to absorb changes in system parameters, but more often than not, this strategy leads to waste of resources. Robust optimization is a method to deal with such parameter uncertainties. It postulates the worst case scenario and obtains a solution that provides a protection against the uncertainty. Plans designed for the worst tend to be overengineered; in many cases, when uncertain parameters are revealed, the degree of uncertainty turns out to be no greater than estimated. This effect may lead to underutilization of resources and inflated costs.\nHere we present methods for robust planning and execution in various applications. We first consider the problem of scheduling operating rooms for surgeries. In order to avoid allocation of excessive resources and limit the conservativeness of the robust solution, we apply a cardinality-based robust approach. This enables us to control the level of protection in accordance with the solution quality. Experimental results based on real hospital data indicate that our method outperforms the practical gap-based approach in terms of both overtime and underutilization. \nWe next suggest a robust productivity index (RPI) to measure organizational performance in a dynamic environment. Compared to the traditional productivity index, it can be used for monitoring time-dependent performance and detecting exceptions. Efficiencies of service providers are evaluated based on panel data on youth outcomes from a selected community prevention program. The results suggest that our approach not only recognizes patterns of productivity progression, but also enables classification of the innovators. \nLastly, we study the real-time adaptive control and monitoring algorithm of an adaptive Work in Process (WIP) method. The simulation results suggest benefits of the algorithm as a decision support tool for managing work-in-process and throughput level. Convergence and robustness of the algorithm are also investigated. \nFor each of these applications, the proposed method is validated and supported in an appropriate manner with detailed discussion of accuracy.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14537], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Yooneun ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yooneun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vittaldas V.

Prospective studies have shown that dark chocolate/cocoa intake is associated with a decreased risk of CVD events [2, 3]. Consistent results were observed in the previous randomized controlled trials in which the consumption of dark chocolate/cocoa improved endothelial function and blood pressure [4, 5]. Almonds are a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids, plant protein, and minerals. Previous intervention studies have demonstrated that almond consumption has lipid lowering effects [6, 7]. However, the combined consumption of dark chocolate/cocoa and almonds has not been investigated in a controlled-feeding setting. \nWe hypothesized that the individual and combined consumption of dark chocolate/cocoa and almonds would favorably affect CVD risk factors; the effects will be greatest when both dark chocolate/cocoa and almonds were consumed compared with a control diet. A randomized, 4-period, crossover, controlled-feeding trial was conducted in 31 overweight and obese participants with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Each treatment period was 4 weeks long, followed by a 2 week compliance break. Participants consumed each of 4 isocaloric, weight maintenance diets with 1) no treatment foods (Average American Diet, AAD), 2) 42.5 g of almonds/day (ALD), 3) 18 g of cocoa and 43 g of dark chocolate/day (CHOC), or 4) both foods (CHOC+ALD) for 4 weeks. \nThe concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and LDL-C were lower after the ALD compared with the AAD (P < 0.05). The CHOC+ALD decreased apolipoprotein B (ApoB) compared with the AAD (P < 0.05); however, the CHOC did not affect any of lipids and lipoproteins. For LDL subclasses, the ALD decreased large, buoyant LDL particles by -5.7 % (LDL1+2) whereas the CHOC+ALD decreased small, dense LDL particles (LDL3+4) by -12.0 % (P < 0.05). There were no treatment effects on blood pressure, endothelial function and markers of oxidative stress. Percentage reductions in Framingham 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk score from baseline were significant after the ALD (-16.98 \u00b1 4.37%, P < 0.01) and CHOC+ALD (-10.77 \u00b1 4.37%, P < 0.05). \nNone of the treatment diets influenced C-reactive protein (CRP). Participants were divided into low and high inflammatory groups, using median CRP value at baseline (1.2 mg/L). There were significant interaction effects between treatment and baseline CRP status for ApoB (P = 0.04), diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.01), and LDL oxidation (P = 0.03). The level of ApoB was significantly decreased from baseline after the AAD, ALD, and CHOC+ALD in individuals in the low inflammatory group; however, there were no changes in ApoB in those in the high inflammatory group. The reductions in diastolic blood pressure were observed after the AAD (P = 0.01), ALD (P < 0.001), and CHOC (P < 0.001) in those with a low CRP, but not in those with a high CRP (P > 0.05).  Furthermore, the lag time of LDL oxidation tended to increase after the CHOC+ALD (P = 0.08) in individuals in the low CRP group whereas there were no changes in the LDL oxidation in those in the high CRP group. \nOur study demonstrates that consumption of almonds alone or combined with dark chocolate improves lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein profiles, which results in decreasing Framingham 10-year CHD risk scores. Furthermore, CRP modulated diet-induced metabolic changes.

In this study, the World of Warcraft community has been used as an environment for natural learning. There was one subject, who was a 21-year-old male adult and had a high interest in playing World of Warcraft but had minimum motivation for learning English as a second language. For over one and a half years, he participated in World of Warcraft. His verbal interaction was taped and transcribed. His speech was analyzed from the time he began playing the game to the end of the study. The findings showed that there were five stages in his language development. In the first stage, the subject used deleted routines, which were incomplete in both grammar and meaning. In the second stage, he could use routines that were grammatical and meaningful. But this did not mean he had developed grammatical knowledge. Instead he used routines as single units. In the third stage, he began to notice subcomponents of routines, so-called \u201cchunks.\u201d In the fourth stage, the subject realized how to combine chunks with other chunks or chunks and routines, and consequently he constructed new sentences. This stage reflected that he \u201cnoticed\u201d chunks among routines, but he did not show enhancement of his grammatical knowledge because his sentences did not require grammatical complexity. Before he moved to the fifth stage, he often committed grammatical errors. This resulted in the occurrence of negative feedback from other players, which brought him to raise his grammatical consciousness. In the final stage, or fifth stage, the subject could construct compound and complex sentences. Also, he could build interrogative sentences with interrogative pronouns and make passive-voice sentences, which means he was able to\niv\ncreate grammatically complex sentences. With these findings, we have interpreted how the subject enhanced both grammatical and language developments. That is, we could argue that his developments were ascribed to a natural learning environment (see, Krashen, 1982), namely the game World of Warcraft. His primary concern over the game itself (see, Skehan, 1998) made him notice (see, Robinson, 2003) his preferable language forms, which are routines and chunks (see, Lewis, 2000). Also, because he had no teacher and no language materials in World of Warcraft, we could say that his developments of language and grammar came from his socialization (see, Mitchell & Myles, 2004) in the World of Warcraft community. Grammar emerged in the fourth and fifth stages. This result suggests when and how L2 teachers can most effectively teach grammar. For this, L2 teachers should keep in mind that in the fourth stage, the subject received many instances of negative feedback from other players and that the negative feedback raised his grammatical consciousness. Despite all of the positive findings, we have to concede that the subject\u2019s language developments were only appropriate for small talk. His sentences were basically simple and short, though he showed some compound and complex sentences in the last stage. Also, his grammatical knowledge was limited, though he knew how to make subordinate clauses, interrogative sentences, passive-voice sentences, etc. Natural learning, as in World of Warcraft, can become too nondirectional (see, H. D. Brown, 2007a). If a learner loses all interest in playing the game, we are afraid of their automatic loss of language learning. However, this research has important implications for L2 classrooms. That is, an L2 student can learn his or her target language if he or she is given a proper environment. Without the teacher\u2019s help, the L2 student can\nv\ngrow in the direction that enhances his or her ability to speak up to a certain level, but the student needs the teacher\u2019s help to get beyond that level. Another implication is that \u201croutines\u201d are a basic element in language development. We hope that the \u201croutine\u201d concept gives L2 teachers a sense of what to teach and how to teach it in their classrooms. In this respect, we would like to say that this research is of great significance in the English-education market.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9740], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Yunjoon ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yunjoon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamie Myers", "Jamie Myers", "Scott P Mcdonald", "Matthew Edward Poehner", "Michael Grant Schmierbach"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamie Myers, Dissertation Advisor", "Jamie Myers, Committee Chair", "Scott P Mcdonald, Committee Member", "Matthew Edward Poehner, Committee Member", "Michael Grant Schmierbach, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["language development", "language acquisition", "ESL", "MMORPG", "video game", "online game", "world of warcraft"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTI-ATHEROGENIC EFFECTS OF 9E,11E-CONJUGATED LINOLEIC ACID\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "8198", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6919", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a mixture of dietary fatty acids that has various beneficial effects including a reduction of cancer, atherosclerosis and inflammation in animal models.

Although 9E,11E-CLA is a weak ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), it was not able to explain the uniqueness of 9E,11E-CLA regulating IL-1Ra. Coactivator recruitment by CLA isomers showed their distinct properties as selective receptor modulators for PPARgamma and RXRalpha. IL-1Ra, an endogenous antagonist of IL-1 signaling, is induced by various factors. We hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory effects of 9E,11E-CLA are mediated via the induction of IL-1Ra in RAW cells; consequently, influencing atherogeneic-related gene regulation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) which is a commonly used in vitro model for endothelial biology. IL-1Ra protein levels were decreased in RAW cells by siRNA to determine the importance of IL-1Ra in the anti-inflammatory effects of 9E,11E-CLA. Blocking IL-1Ra abrogated the capability of 9E,11E-CLA to decrease LPS-induced IL-1alpha and IL-6 mRNA levels, but IL-1beta was not affected which suggests the importance of IL-1Ra in regulating the anti-inflammatory property via 9E,11E-CLA. A response element for 9E,11E-CLA in the IL-1Ra promoter sequence was not detected, but we identified that the IL-1Ra induction by 9E,11E-CLA is different than the LPS induction of IL-1Ra. Blocking the PI3K pathway via LY294002 and the mTOR pathway via rapamycin abolished the 9E,11E-CLA induced-IL-1Ra, which indicates the PI3K/mTOR pathway is responsible for the induction of IL-1Ra by 9E,11E-CLA. Since atherogenesis is an inflammatory disease, anti-inflammatory agents can be beneficial to decrease atherogenic-related genes; therefore, potential anti-atherogenic effects of 9E,11E-CLA were measured in HUVEC. We observed that 9E,11E-CLA decreased atherogenic-related genes such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MCP-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, and CCR-2 in HUVEC. The alteration of the adhesion molecules by 9E,11E-CLA results in a decrease of cell-to-cell interaction; however, recombinant IL-1Ra did not alter the adhesion activity of RAW and HUVEC. HUVEC treated with siIL-1Ra RAW-conditioned media induced significantly higher levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MCP-1, and E-selectin than cells treated with control media. These results suggests that factors secreted from siIL-1Ra RAW cells enhance the adhesion molecules, and 9E,11E-CLA's anti-atherogenic effect may be secondary to IL-1Ra level alteration. These studies revealed not only 9E,11E-CLA itself, but also factors secreted from siIL-1Ra RAW cells affect the atherogeneic-related factors in HUVEC. Taken together, 9E,11E-CLA has anti-inflammatory effects and potential anti-atherogenic properties in in vitro models which may suggest a therapeutic use in the in vivo models.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6916], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Yunkyoung ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yunkyoung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Peter J Gillies", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Peter John Hudson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Chair", "Peter J Gillies, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mTOR", "anti-inflammatory", "anti-atherogenic", "CLA", "PI3K"]}]
