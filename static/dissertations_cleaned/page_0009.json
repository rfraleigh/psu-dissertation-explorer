Our group is investigating the\nprotein-surface interactions influencing material-induced blood plasma coagulation with the goal of contributing towards the rational development of biomaterials with improved\nhemocompatability. Traditional biochemical theory of contact activation imparts specific\nactivating abilities to negatively-charged hydrophilic surface. However, recent studies have\nindicated a need to revise this view as activation of blood factor XII (FXII), a contact\nactivation protein, is not specific to negatively-charged surfaces. The central hypothesis of this dissertation proposes that all material surfaces are potential activators of the intrinsic coagulation cascade, but protein adsorption moderates the molecular interactions of contact activation. Measurements of FXII activation in buffer solutions in the presence of mixed thiol self-assembled monolayers suggest a minimum of FXII activation for surfaces with wettabilities nearing 45 dyne/cm. From direct measurement of kallikrein activation at test surfaces we observed that contact activation reactions involving FXII, high-molecular weight kininogen, and prekallikrein are not specific to negatively-charged hydrophilic surfaces, lending further support for the role of protein adsorption-competition at procoagulant surfaces. Preliminary investigations into contact activation of blood plasma coagulation\npatterned thiol-modified surfaces suggest spatial chemical heterogeneity influences blood\nplasma coagulation. In summary, the studies described in this dissertation underscore the\nneed to view all materials as potential activators of the intrinsic coagulation cascade with protein adsorption moderating interactions of contact activation proteins.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3117], "author_name_tesi": "Bauer, James William", "last_name_ssi": "Bauer", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Alan Siedlecki", "Christopher Alan Siedlecki", "Erwin A Vogler", "William Joseph Weiss", "Ira Joseph Ropson", "Alan J Snyder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Alan Siedlecki, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Alan Siedlecki, Committee Chair", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Chair", "William Joseph Weiss, Committee Member", "Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Member", "Alan J Snyder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["blood plasma coagulation", "contact activation", "factor XII", "self assembled monolayers"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Root dynamics in response to abiotic and biotic stressors in Vitis", "id": "7837", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6213", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Root system potential growth rate was examined in response to soil moisture heterogeneity.  Root dynamics were studied using genetically identical grapevine shoot systems (Vitis vinifera cv Merlot) on genetically distinct root systems that promote high and low shoot vigor under three different levels of water stress severity.  We utilized minirhizotrons to examine a more vigorous rootstock (1103P) and a less vigorous rootstock (101-14 Mgt) in an Oakville, CA vineyard with high soil clay content.   Our results demonstrated that compared to a lower vigor root system, a grape root system of higher vigor exhibit greater morphological plasticity in response to heterogeneous moisture supply but similar tolerance as indicated by root survivorship in dry soil. The lower-vigor vines also developed more root biomass over several years, especially under conditions of no irrigation.  Similar root lifespans in wet and dry soil suggested the possibility that hydraulic redistribution was a source of water transfer from areas of high soil moisture to those of low soil moisture through the plant during periods of low evaporative demand.  We hypothesized that hydraulic redistribution prevented an appreciable reduction in root water potential and contributed to the prolonged root survivorship in dry soil.  With thermocouple psychrometers, we measured water potentials of roots of the same plant with its roots system split into an irrigated pot and an unirrigated pot. We found reduced root survivorship was directly associated with plants in which hydraulic redistribution was reduced by 24 h light.  Electrolyte leakage in dry roots was twice that compared to those in wet soil of the same plant.   Our study demonstrated that besides a number of ecological advantages to protecting tissues against desiccation, internal hydraulic redistribution of water is a mechanism allowing extended root survivorship in dry soils.  Plants with fast growth rates are hypothesized to be more tolerant of herbivory than slower growing plants.  Our data on root systems that differ in potential growth rate supported the hypothesis proposed for leaves, that phylloxera insect infestation was proportional to number of growing tips. Lifespans of uninfested roots were similar for both root systems; however, the infested roots of the faster-growing root system were shorter than that of the slow-grower. The fast-growing rootstock had an older age structure due to the mortality of young root tips.  We did not find a trade-off between potential growth rate and relative rate of root infestation in these cultivars, but our study indicates that a fast-growing root system may more readily shed infested roots.

It endeavors to incorporate how humans trade off values to be received in the future versus value received immediately into economic analysis.  Discounting has emerged as a key factor in assessments of climate change and other long-term environmental issues.  However, the traditional time-only discounting neglects important spatial influences on how values are compared.  This dissertation presents what is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive effort to incorporate space into discounting as a theoretical, empirical, and applied concept.  New discounting theory is presented that examines major reasons for discounting across time and finds that these reasons also hold for discounting across space.  The theoretical work culminates in a new conceptualization of discounting that handles discounting across space as well as time while clarifying the philosophical basis for what is and is not discounting.  New empirical research on discounting examines how humans discount across space and time and assesses the extent to which human values can be described in terms of discounting.  This empirical research indicates that discounting by humans has strong spatial components and also that discounting is fundamentally limited as a paradigm for describing human values.  Finally, new applied research illustrates how space-time discounting can advance our understanding of important societal issues through analysis of three cases of climate change adaptation.  These cases \u2013 crop indemnity payments, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the nexus between climate change, migration, and conflict \u2013 show the importance of space-time discounting to cases of project evaluation, cooperation, and conflict.  For example, the crop indemnity payments finds that when we do not account at all for space in project evaluations, or when we account for space with too coarse of a resolution, then our project evaluations can be significantly inaccurate.  Taken together, this dissertation\u2019s theoretical, empirical, and applied work show the importance of space to discounting as both an intellectual construct and a concept with very tangible practical significance.  In short, the inclusion of space into discounting suggests major transformations to both the science and policy of discounting.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5534], "author_name_tesi": "Baum, Seth Daniel", "last_name_ssi": "Baum", "middle_name_ssi": "Daniel", "first_name_ssi": "Seth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Ewart Easterling Iii", "Brenton Yarnal", "Klaus Keller", "Nancy A Tuana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Ewart Easterling Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "Brenton Yarnal, Committee Member", "Klaus Keller, Committee Member", "Nancy A Tuana, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Discounting", "Spatial Discounting", "Climate Change", "Ethics", "Moral Psychology", "Welfare Economics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "From possession to obligation: modal grammaticalization and variation", "id": "18764", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8873", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous studies of grammaticalization and semantic change have found evidence of a crosslinguistic tendency for lexical verbs of possession to develop modal meanings (Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca 1994; Heine and Kuteva 2002).

In the process, the grammaticalizing form is considered as part of a variable context, in which it alternates with several other modal constructions.\n\nThe investigation outlined here is aimed at delineating and quantifying the processes at work via text-based, measurable evidence, and accomplishes two objectives. The first is to survey the grammaticalization of the [tener que + Infinitive] construction itself, assessing the factors involved its semantic development, such as semantic bleaching and abstraction, internal structural changes, increases in its token frequency, and its distribution among ever larger numbers of distinct lexical verb types. Second, the individual form is considered as part of a variable context, in which it alternates with several other modal constructions. Utilizing variationist methodology (Sankoff 1988) in the analysis of the construction\u2019s diachronic advancement provides a theoretical and empirical perspective whose benefits have only begun to be explored by researchers of grammaticalization (Poplack 2011). \n\nFrom a corpus of written texts and transcribed interviews representing Spanish from the 12th to the 20th centuries, a total of 5168 tokens were extracted. These were analyzed through an operationalization of various factors conditioning the occurrence of the tener que construction; the results find that grammatical person, aspect, and polarity are all influential in the selection of the innovative [tener que + Infintive] over alternative forms (haber de, deber (de), haber que). In the nine centuries considered here, the tener que construction develops from an effectively nonexistent particular usage of the lexical possession verb tener \u2018to have\u2019 to eventually become the predominant periphrastic modal expression used to express obligation. The systematic methodology used here to trace its development provides quantitative detail not found in previous accounts of the evolution of [tener que + Infinitive]. Furthermore, the results of this study confirm several predictions made by theoretical descriptions of grammaticalization, call into question certain claims about Spanish obligation expressions, and present a fresh perspective on the arrangement of conditioning factors that shape the modal domain of obligation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8717], "author_name_tesi": "Bauman, Joseph Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Bauman", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rena Torres Cacoullos", "John Lipski", "Philip Baldi", "Barry Richard Page Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rena Torres Cacoullos, Dissertation Advisor", "John Lipski, Committee Member", "Philip Baldi, Committee Member", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Language change", "language variation", "grammaticalization", "Spanish", "linguistics", "historical linguistics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Called to Serve: The Military Mobilization of Undergraduates", "id": "9915", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4012", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\tThe purpose of this study was to answer the following research question: What is the process by which undergraduate students, recalled for military duty, prepare for mobilization, separate from their institution and then re-enroll upon their release from active duty, and how is this process affected by meaning? Using the grounded theory tradition, 24 participants were interviewed who had stopped-out of college for the purposes of military deployment. Deployments ranged from 12 to 20 months and generally required a withdrawal from college for a similar amount of time. Of the 24 participants, four were women and one was African American. Interviews were conducted and the subsequent data coded for categories and concepts. \n\n\tFindings revealed a three-phased undergraduate military mobilization process. Phase 1 involved the time leading up to one\u2019s mobilization where participants struggled to balance their student identity with their military identity. Phase 2 encompassed the time immediately before mobilization to the time immediately before returning home, toward the conclusion of one\u2019s deployment. Individuals in Phase 2 were entirely immersed into the military culture for this extended period and largely disconnected from their student identities. Of those interviewed, only one participant remained truly connected to her undergraduate institution throughout her entire deployment. Also during Phase 2, conditions and events while \u201cin country\u201d greatly influenced the success with which participants transitioned home. Phase 3 involved the return and transition back to home, school, and civilian life.  During this phase, individuals struggled to shake off the reflexive actions and prolonged stress from their time \u201cin the box.\u201d Participants described numerous challenges, from reacting to loud noises and certain smells, to reaching for their weapon and driving in the middle of the road. Two individuals expressed thoughts of suicide. Student identities, initially on a reasonable balance with one\u2019s military identity, were largely pushed aside in Phase 3. Member checks and peer audits supported the validity of the three phases, and the concepts contained within. \n\n\tConclusions from this study included the need for institutions to take more notice of its student-veteran population. Institutions should connect with all military personnel, whether deployed or not, in an effort to build meaningful relationships. For those who must stop-out of college for military duty, the institution should remain connected during this time. Colleges could consider identifying individuals willing to serve as \u201cstudent-veteran mentors\u201d who could then facilitate these connections during deployment. Additionally, universities must be ready to offer a full range of personal, academic and transitional support to the veteran upon his or her return home. Finally, institutions should consider starting a student-veterans group, thereby offering peer-assistance to fellow veterans on the campus. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3985], "author_name_tesi": "Bauman, Mark Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Bauman", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dorothy H Evensen", "Dorothy H Evensen", "Robert D Reason", "Robert M Hendrickson", "Kathleen Bieschke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dorothy H Evensen, Dissertation Advisor", "Dorothy H Evensen, Committee Chair", "Robert D Reason, Committee Member", "Robert M Hendrickson, Committee Member", "Kathleen Bieschke, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["student", "veteran", "student development", "student veterans", "Iraq", "Afghanistan", "mental health", "grounded theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECT OF ARCHEAN OCEANS ON CYANOBACTERIA, GREEN SULFUR BACTERIA AND THE RISE OF OXYGEN\n", "id": "19339", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9339", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Growth of a common marine cyanobacterium, freshwater cyanobacterium, and a green sulfur bacterium was examined under different oxygen, sulfide, and ferrous iron concentrations.

In addition, increasing oxygen provides no discernable advantage to cyanobacteria, suggesting it is unlikely cyanobacteria evolved and proliferated in Fe+2-rich oceans.

Misregulation of gene expression disrupts development and drives many disease states. While cells modulate gene expression through a variety of processes, transcription is thought to be the most critical and highly regulated process in gene regulation. Ultimately, all transcription regulatory signals converge at the core promoter. Here, I investigate the function of the conserved Drosophila core promoter element Motif 1. Most of our knowledge of transcription initiation comes from studies on promoters with a TATA box and Initiator. While these studies have yielded invaluable information, most promoters lack this combination of elements. Thus, our knowledge of the mechanisms that drive initiation from promoters with different core promoter elements is limited. \t\n\nIn order to better understand alternative mechanisms of initiation, I investigated ribosomal protein (RP) gene transcription in Drosophila. I focused on RP genes for several reasons. First, Motif 1 is enriched at RP gene promoters in Drosophila. Second, TBP is not required for transcription of RP genes. Third, in all higher eukaryotes examined, the TCT motif replaces the Initiator sequence at RP gene transcription start sites. Finally, RP genes represent a well-defined gene-regulatory network and are thought to be coordinately expressed. For these reasons, the RP genes offer a compelling model system to study alternative initiation mechanisms and the coordinate transcription of gene networks. Here, I demonstrate that Motif 1 and M1BP are required for RP gene transcription. Additionally, I found that M1BP works at RP genes by recruiting the TBP-related factor 2 (TRF2) to RP gene promoters. My data shows for the first time that TRF2 is recruited to promoters by sequence-specific binding factors. This resolves a long-standing question in the field since TRF2 does not bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, I show that the largest subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID associates with all RP gene promoters in vivo. Thus, while previous reports called into question TFIID\u2019s role in initiation at TCT motif-containing RP genes, this finding further attests to TFIID\u2019s key role in transcription. \n\nI also identify an M1BP interacting protein called GFZF and investigated its function. I show that GFZF is a glutathione S-transferase (GST) and that it is essential for transcription activation. These results provide the first example of a transcription factor with GST activity. GFZF has appeared in a number of genetic screens that implicate it in processes as disparate as hybrid inviability and positive regulation of RAS/MAPK signaling. Because little was known about GFZF\u2019s molecular function, the authors of these reports explained and interpreted GFZF\u2019s appearance in these screens in complex and unclear terms. My findings suggest GFZF\u2019s involvement in these disparate cellular processes results from its association with over 1800 housekeeping gene promoters. Many of these housekeeping genes are directly involved in the processes that were being investigated. The knowledge of GFZF\u2019s molecular and cellular function should guide future interpretations when GFZF appears in large-scale screens. Finally, while it remains unclear why a transcription factor possesses a functional GST domain, I discuss ways that a transcription factor with GST activity might function in gene regulation.

However, these studies did not take into account the effects of defective activation on CD8 T cell differentiation and effector function that are unrelated to the absence of miRNAs. In our study, we used a novel mouse model in which only a subset of CD8 T cells in an otherwise WT environment lacks Dicer after optimal activation. For this, we used dicerfl/fl granzyme B-cre mice in which dicer is only deleted after successful activation and Granzyme B expression. Our study revealed that the diminished peak effector size of dicer-/- CD8 T cells is due to lack of sustained antigen-driven proliferation in the later stages of effector expansion and that lack of miRNAs only after optimal activation does not lead to defective migration or effector function as reported previously. Furthermore, we show that dicer-/- CD8 T cells exhibit increased contraction resulting in a severely diminished memory pool, even though the balance of terminal effector and memory CD8 T cells is skewed towards CD127Hi memory precursor effector cells (MPECs).

The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-17) was used to measure these factors.   The Michigan Organizational Assessment Questionnaire (MOAQ) was used to measure job satisfaction and turnover intention.  Short-answer questions were used to gather information about job resources that positively and negatively affect work engagement, as well as the perceived availability of those resources.  The dependent variable was work engagement, as defined by vigor, dedication, and absorption.  The independent variables were demographics, factors related to the nursing position, and job satisfaction.  \n\tData were gathered online from nurses in the Pennsylvania State Nurses\u2019 Association (PSNA) database using a 42-question survey, self-response questionnaire.  Quantitative measures were analyzed using the SPSS explore program. Grounded theory qualitative analysis methods were used for short-answer responses (Auerbach & Silverstein, 2003). Two types of analysis were used to answer the research questions: (a) block multiple regression, and (b) grounded theory qualitative analysis.  \n\tThe results suggested that (a) job satisfaction is the single most important variable (based on beta values) in explaining variability in scores for the three dimensions of work engagement.  Nurses reporting higher levels of job satisfaction also reported higher levels of absorption, vigor, and dedication. The regression analysis in this case showed that age is a significant independent variable for overall work engagement (\u03b2=.234), and specifically for the factors of absorption (\u03b2=.249) and dedication (\u03b2=.294).  Because the significance figures are positive, they show that the older the respondent, the stronger the relationship between age and work engagement.  The factors that respondents believed increase engagement were having an impact, team (strong relationship with their immediate peers, physicians and leadership), and variety (expanded job opportunities, uniqueness of the types of patients).  The factors that decreased engagement were workload, lack of impact, and politics (internal).  The resources most important for performing the job effectively were effective management, information/data, and continuing education.

This dissertation focuses on examining student readiness for school and the early childhood educational contexts that may foster greater levels of readiness among students at kindergarten entry.\n\tUsing the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study \u2013 Kindergarten Cohorts of 1998-1999 and 2010-2011, I begin by estimating change in readiness between two nationally-representative cohorts of kindergarten students to assess whether students who are enrolled in kindergarten in 2010-2011 are more ready for school than students enrolled in kindergarten in 1998-1999.  I focus this analysis on examining the between sociodemographic group differences in readiness for each cohort and observe whether all or some groups are making progress in decreasing gaps in readiness.  Specifically, I examine between group differences by race/ethnicity, student gender, maternal education, family structure, and household income, finding that school readiness disparities are converging for some racial/ethnic groups and some family structure types. But unfortunately, the convergence in trends between most groups was not fast enough to eliminate disparities by 2010-2011.  For most groups, including across measures of socioeconomic status, the disparities between groups has remained constant over time. \n\tIn the second part of the analysis, I examine the relationship between the educational climate created by state-level early childhood policy and two of the primary goals of early childhood policy: to increase student participation in early learning opportunities and to increase student\u2019s readiness for school. With regards to greater odds of student enrollment in organized care, living in a state with greater per pupil spending is not associated with increased odds of enrolling in care.  However, living in a state that offers unrestricted or restricted access to state-funded pre-k is associated with higher odds of enrollment than living in state that offers no access to pre-k, net of confounders.  Analyses in this chapter also suggest that the relationship between living in a state that offers access to state-funded pre-k and organized care enrollment may be different for students from different racial or ethnic groups.\n   When examining the relationship between early educational climate, as measured by state policy, and student readiness for school, this study finds that living in a state where quality requirements of state-funded pre-k programs are high and a greater proportion of four-year-old students in the state are enrolled in state-funded pre-k are positively associated with math and verbal readiness, as students in states that have a high number of quality requirements (7+) and a greater proportion of students served by state-funded pre-k programs have higher cognitive readiness scores.  But students in states where more per pupil funding is needed to reach the benchmarks of a high quality program have lower math and verbal readiness scores than their peers in states where no funding or less funding is needed.  Again, these results vary between racial/ethnic groups, with some students benefiting more from these state-level policies than others.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11274], "author_name_tesi": "Baumgartner, Erin Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Baumgartner", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Erin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle Lynn Frisco", "Valarie Elizabeth King", "Emily Kate Greenman", "Katerina Bodovski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle Lynn Frisco, Dissertation Advisor", "Valarie Elizabeth King, Committee Member", "Emily Kate Greenman, Committee Member", "Katerina Bodovski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["school readiness", "early childhood", "sociology", "stratification", "race", "education policy", "education"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF AN ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE SURVEY", "id": "21284", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9931", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Background: Awareness and use of e-cigarettes (e-cigs) has increased significantly in the last five years, but little is known about the experiences, satisfaction, opinions and important e-cig characteristics for e-cigs users. \nMethods: We used an Internet survey of 8814 ever-users of e-cigs during December 2012 to October 2013. A random sample (N=200) was selected from participants (N=1177) who completed all open-ended questions on use of, and opinions about e-cigs and their qualitative responses were analyzed. \nResults: Most respondents were men (69%) from the United States (86%). They had used e-cigs for the 6 months (median) and daily use was around 15 times (median, around 15 puffs or last for 10 minutes). Approximately 79% were former smokers, while 21% were currently smoking traditional cigarettes occasionally or on a daily basis. Respondents used e-cigs for various reasons; most common were to quit smoking, as a safe alternative to use nicotine, feasibility in using at smoke-free places or around other people. Positive effects were health (improved breathing, less coughing, overall positive health) and psychological (feeling good, no craving) benefits. Respondents enjoyed the throat sensations with e-cigs and the availability of the various flavors.  The most common side effects were dryness of mouth and throat irritation. Respondents raised some concerns about possible toxicity, about future regulation and legal status, and also recommended need for long-term study on safety profile of e-cigs. \nConclusions:       E-cig users reported e-cigs helped them to quit smoking and to have positive effects on their health, but several other respondents also raised concern about addiction potential, toxicity and use by first time users.

Simple biomechanical and computer models suggest that shorter pfMA facilitates energy storage in the Achilles tendon and force generation by the plantarflexors, but no experimental data have been published in support of these modeling results.  Though previous investigators found that sprinters possess significantly shorter pfMA than non-sprinters, they did not identify a mechanism responsible for this difference. If sprinters have uniquely shaped joints that provide them with a competitive advantage, this may provide insight to helping individuals with movement disorders. The purpose of this dissertation was to investigate potential mechanisms that link pfMA and locomotor performance.\t\nThe first study was designed to identify if ankle joint kinematics differ between sprinters and non-sprinters, and if so, how talocrural geometry affects joint kinematics. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the foot and ankle in sprinters and non-sprinters were acquired. We found that sprinters have longer forefoot bones and shorter pfMA than non-sprinters. Unlike previous studies that used indirect measurements to link pfMA with function, we identified that the center of rotation (CoR) of the talocrural joint was more posterior in sprinters. These findings are the first to document a difference in ankle joint kinematics in functionally different, but otherwise healthy, adults. \nThe second study analyzed the three-dimensional geometry of the talocrural joints in sprinters and non-sprinters to determine if CoR differences could be explained by joint structure. We found that sprinters have a less conforming talocrural joint than non-sprinters, which may facilitate muscle force for the task at hand. \nThe third study investigated the relationship between pfMA and ankle strength in untrained healthy young men. We found that pfMA is positively correlated with ankle strength at all rates of plantarflexion (R2 = 0.323 \u2013 0.494). Although these findings do not agree with computer simulations that show short pfMA as protective against torque loss at fast speeds, it is possible that musculoskeletal structure in untrained young men is adapted for submaximal activities and not maximal force generation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to link muscle moment arm and joint strength.\nThe fourth study directly compared several methods for measuring pfMA in vivo that have been reported in the literature but have not yet been validated. These measurement techniques can be categorized into two subtypes: geometric methods, which use MR imaging or external measurements; and tendon excursion (TE) methods, which use an ultrasound probe to track the Achilles tendon as it slides during joint rotation. These methods were compared to a highly reliable and commonly used pfMA measurement technique. We found that geometric measures of pfMA have better agreement with the CoR method. \nIn conclusion, this dissertation is the first study to link pfMA and ankle strength. Previous reports found relationships between pfMA and locomotor performance but were unable to identify a mechanism responsible for differences in function. We also found that shorter pfMA in sprinters are explained by differences in ankle CoR. Three-dimensional analysis of the talocrural joint suggests that a more mobile ankle joint in sprinters may place the foot in a more advantageous position to generate force. While the findings of this dissertation fills some gaps in the literature, they raise further questions about how the musculoskeletal system adapts to geometric constraints and functional demands placed on the system.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7913], "author_name_tesi": "Baxter, Josh R", "last_name_ssi": "Baxter", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Josh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Jinger Gottschall", "Henry Joseph Sommer Iii", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Chair", "Jinger Gottschall, Committee Member", "Henry Joseph Sommer Iii, Committee Member", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["moment arm", "ankle", "plantarflexor", "joint torque", "sprinting", "musculoskeletal variability", "talocrural", "center of rotation", "humans"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A comparative study of the U.S. and Korean film industries: history, structure, and finance\n\n\n", "id": "8827", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4866", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project is a comparative case-study of the U.S. and Korean (South Korea) film industries along historical, structural, and financial dimensions.  The genesis of this thesis came through an overall fascination with the film industry globally as nations compete and cooperate with each other, as well as contend with the dominance of the U.S. film industry.  It uses the industrial organization model focusing primarily on \"market structure.\"  Further, it applies A.J. Scott\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds bipartite (major, independent) and tripartite (major, subsidiary, independent) models of the U.S. film industry.  The analysis is mainly descriptive being informed by historical development.  To elaborate on market structure, samples of studio/mainstream and independent films were collected in both the U.S. and Korean film industries.  The samples were analyzed along production company affiliation, distribution affiliation, sources of funding, and other elements.\n\nChapter one introduces the project and the research questions.

In the United States over the past 30 years, childhood obesity rates have increased almost three-fold.  School environments are seen as an important location to model healthy lifestyle practices and teach our nation\u2019s youth  nutrition education.  In an effort to help schools improve children\u2019s nutrition and physical activity habits, The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-265) was established. This act requires all local education agencies (LEAs) that sponsor school meals programs to develop local wellness policies (LWPs) to address the issue of childhood obesity.  Among the mandated requirements of the LWP were nutrition education, physical activity goals, nutritional guidelines to address foods offered on the school campus, and the inclusion of six mandatory committee members in the development process: school board member, school administrator, food service representative, student, parent, and public member.  \n\nObjective\nNutrition education is effective as a prevention and intervention method to address childhood obesity.  The objective of this study was two-fold.  The first objective was to observe which PSBA template nutrition education goals were included in the LEA\u2019s LWPs and the strength of these goals.  The second objective was to examine what predicts the strength (rigor) and number (comprehensiveness) of the nutrition education (NE) goal component in each LEA\u2019s LWP.   \nWe described the relationship of the demographic (includes LEA type, locale, and socioeconomic status) characteristics of LEAs, resources and assistance received by LEAs, the composition of the mandatory development committees, and the LWP overall policy comprehensiveness and rigor (strength) scores, excluding the NE goals, as predictors of number (comprehensiveness) and strength (rigor) of nutrition education (NE) goals.\n\n\nMethods\nLWPs were abstracted and analyzed from LEAs in Pennsylvania. Only LEAs that followed a traditional school day format were included in the analysis (n=721; including 539 public LEAs and 182 private LEAs).  An example template policy developed by Pennsylvania School Board Association (PSBA) and The Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) was used as the standard policy to which all Pennsylvania LEA\u2019s LWP were compared.  A 15-item Local Wellness Policy Checklist (LWPC), developed by PDE and containing the LEAs\u2019 responses to questions related to the LEA and the LWP development process, was also utilized.  Information about LEA sponsor type, committee member composition, and assistance resources were abstracted from the checklist for this study.  Variables used for multiple linear regression models in this study were abstracted from the LWPs and LWPCs of 721 LEAs.  SPSS17.0 statistical software package was used for all data analysis.          \n\n\nResults\nA descriptive analysis of the 721 Pennsylvania LEAs show that 539 (74.8%) were public LEAs and 182 (25.2% were private LEAs.  Public LEAs were mainly school districts (92.6%), and private LEAs were predominately Catholic religious LEAs (76.4%).  Public LEAs serve a mixture of elementary, middle, and high school students in numerous buildings, whereas private LEAs are mostly elementary schools located in one building only.  \nIn a descriptive analysis of the PSBA template nutrition education goals, we found that for both public and private LEAs the most commonly included NE goals were general and broad in policy language.  The least commonly chosen NE goals were specific goals; these goals were also most likely to be weakened in policy language when compared to the PSBA template goals.  Public and private LEAs chose similar PSBA NE goals to weaken in their policies, such as integrating nutrition education throughout the curriculum and disseminating nutrition education consistently throughout the school, family, community, and media.  Private LEAs were more likely than public LEAs to weaken NE goals.  \nWe also found significant differences between public and private LEA\u2019s development committee composition and their association with NE comprehensiveness and rigor in our analysis.  An association between development committee members\u2019 on the inclusion of NE goals and their strength (weaker or stronger than PSBA template goals) was only observed in private LEAs.  In terms of the number (comprehensiveness) of NE goals included, student, school administrator, and public member presence on the LWP development committee were associated with fewer NE goals; whereas, school board member and parent involvement were associated with more NE goals.  The only LWP committee member with an observed association with the NE rigor score was the school board member, whose involvement was associated with to less rigorous NE goals.  School foodservice representative was not found to be associated with the number or strength of NE goals in our analysis.  \nWe also found that overall policy factors were associated with NE comprehensiveness and rigor: LEAs with more comprehensive and rigorous overall policies were associated with more comprehensive and rigorous NE goals regardless of their LEA type (public or private), locale, socioeconomic status, or assessment tools utilized.  This may be due to a halo effect.  \nIn terms of demographic factors, locale and socioeconomic status factors were not associated with NE comprehensiveness or rigor scores for either public or private LEAs.  However, the use of outside resources (such as government grants or assessment programs) was associated with NE comprehensiveness and rigor. We observed that public LEAs that received STEPS assistance was associated with fewer yet more rigorous NE goals.  Finally, our research found that public LEAs that assessed the school environment prior to LWP development were associated with more comprehensive NE goal components, while using PANA assessment tool was associated with more rigorous NE goals.  \n\n\nDiscussion\nA federal mandate coupled with rigorous state policy review and the PSBA template policy was a successful strategy in Pennsylvania to help LEAs meet LWP wellness committee requirements and develop comprehensive and rigorous overall policy and nutrition education goals.   Variables predictive of NE scores for private LEA\u2019s LWPs were the development committee members involved in the LWP development, whereas public LEA\u2019s LWPs were more associated with the sources of external assistance.  Differences in how LEA types (public or private) approached the development of their local wellness policies and the strength of the NE goals included suggests that different approaches need to be made when informing public versus private LEAs of federal mandates and available resources of trainings, assessment tools, grants, and educational materials.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4510], "author_name_tesi": "Baylis, Megan Smith", "last_name_ssi": "Baylis", "middle_name_ssi": "Smith", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Claudia Kay Probart", "Claudia Kay Probart"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Claudia Kay Probart, Thesis Advisor", "Claudia Kay Probart, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Wellness Policy", "Nutrition Education", "Wellness Policy Development Committee", "Childhood Obesity", "Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 200"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "GEOSPATIAL ANALYSES FOR SOLAR ENERGY: IMPACTS OF PV PENETRATION ON ENERGY DEMAND AND PRICE", "id": "14603mzb187", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14603", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The success of PV energy systems in the future relies in large part on how the assessment of long term solar power potential is determined, and the impact of solar electric installations on the demand curve, congestion and locational marginal prices of a region.

In Model B, the temperature and the resulting efficiency change of the PV cells are defined according to deviations from the nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT), using equations from the literature.  These two models were executed for 236 cities across the USA by using second-generation Typical Meteorological Year (TMY2) data.

While mature techniques such as the Genetic Algorithm increase their application areas, researchers also try to come up with new algorithms by simply observing the highly tuned processes provided by the nature. In this dissertation, the well-known Genetic Algorithm (GA) will be utilized to tackle various novel electromagnetic optimization problems, along with parallel implementation of the Clonal Selection Algorithm (CLONALG) and newly introduced the Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) technique. The utility of the CLONALG parallelization and the efficiency of the WDO will be illustrated by applying them to multi-dimensional and multi-modal electromagnetics problems such as antenna design and metamaterial surface synthesis.\n\nOne of the metamaterial application areas is the design synthesis of 90 degrees rotationally symmetric ultra-small unit cell artificial magnetic conducting (AMC) surfaces. AMCs are composite metallo-dielectric structures designed to behave as perfect magnetic conductors (PMC) over a certain frequency range, those exhibit a reflection coefficient magnitude of unity with an phase angle of zero degrees at the center of the band. The proposed designs consist of ultra small sized frequency selective surface (FSS) unit cells that are tightly packed and highly intertwined, yet achieve remarkable AMC band performance and field of view when compared to current state-of-the-art AMCs. In addition, planar double-sided AMC (DSAMC) structures are introduced and optimized as AMC ground planes for low profile antennas in composite platforms and separator slabs for vertical antenna applications. The proposed designs do not possess complete metallic ground planes, which makes them ideal for composite and multi-antenna systems.

Such designs provide magneto-dielectric material properties over a certain frequency range, allowing miniaturization of planar antennas when used as substrates. Similarly, MIMDM slabs can be designed for the absorber applications, where design equations for synthesizing such absorber materials from MIMDM are established.\n\nFinally, small sized rotationally symmetric unit cells are designed and employed as planar electromagnetic bandgap structures for microstrip patch antenna mutual coupling reduction.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6963], "author_name_tesi": "Bayraktar, Zikri ", "last_name_ssi": "Bayraktar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zikri", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner", "Douglas Henry Werner", "Pingjuan Li Werner", "Victor P Pasko", "Brian Lewis Weiner", "Lyle Norman Long"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Chair", "Pingjuan Li Werner, Committee Member", "Victor P Pasko, Committee Member", "Brian Lewis Weiner, Committee Member", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["meta-surface", "artificial magnetic conductors", "wind driven optimization", "electromagnetic bandgap", "optimization", "magneto-dielectrics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "AN INVESTIGATION OF THE ARTIFACTS, OUTCOMES, AND PROCESSES OF CONSTRUCTING COMPUTER GAMES ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE IN A FIFTH GRADE SCIENCE CLASSROOM", "id": "10146", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "479", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Among educational researchers and practitioners, there is a growing interest in employing computer games for pedagogical purposes.

It also explored the nature of the artifacts developed and the types of knowledge represented therein. \n\nA case study (Yin, 2003) was employed within the context of a 5th grade elementary science classroom. Fifth graders designed computer games about environmental issues to present to 2nd graders by using Scratch software. The analysis of this study was based on multiple data sources: students\u2019 pre- and post-test scores on environmental awareness, their environmental knowledge, their interest in computer science, and their game design. Included in the analyses were also data from students\u2019 computer games, participant observations, and structured interviews. \n\nThe results of the study showed that students were able to successfully design functional games that represented their understanding of environment, even though the gain between pre- and post-environmental knowledge test and environmental awareness survey were minimal. The findings indicate that all students were able to use various game characteristics and programming concepts, but their prior experience with the design software affected their representations. The analyses of the interview transcriptions and games show that students improved their programming skills and that they wanted to do similar projects for other subject areas in the future. Observations showed that game design appeared to lead to knowledge-building, interaction and collaboration among students. This, in turn, encouraged students to test and improve their designs. Sharing the games, it was found, has both positive and negative effects on the students\u2019 game design process and the representation of students\u2019 understandings of the domain subject.

This study looked to provide a different perspective by examining the experiences of transfer students of color who have persisted and excelled at predominantly white four-year institutions that have selective admission criteria. Within this study student success was examined in and beyond the classroom. A sample of transfer students from two-year postsecondary institutions who excelled academically (as indicated by attaining a grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or higher) participated in leadership involvement opportunities, developed relationships with faculty and staff that resulted in beneficial personal and professional development, participated in enriching activities such as internships, and received various awards were selected. \nThis study attempted to address the lack of balance in previous examinations of the success of transfer students of color. The goal was to further understand the experiences of students who had persevered, flourished, and made the most of their college experience. The research sought to gain insight into, and understanding of the phenomenon of being a high-achieving student of color who transferred from a community college or a two-year institution setting to a selective predominantly white four-year institution.

These particles are of great environmental importance due to their ability to retain and transport nutrients and contaminants. Three studies were undertaken at different scales, which are documented in three manuscripts included in this dissertation \nThe first study examined the rate constants for goethite (\u00e1-FeOOH) crystallization from nano-particulate Fe hydroxide suspensions in the absence (0% Al) and presence (2% Al) of aluminum. One of the merits of this study was the application of a multivariate curve resolution analysis (MCR) of infrared spectra to environmentally important mixed Fe-Al hydroxide colloids in order to quantify goethite content in poorly-crystalline mixtures. Obtained rate constants were found to be equal to (7.64\u00b10.67)*10-7 s-1 for 0% Al and (4.5\u00b10.21)*10-7 s-1 for 2% Al hydroxides. Dissolution-precipitation mechanism was dominant in the process of goethite transformation to ferrihydrite. Further growth of goethite crystals took place either by aggregation mechanism to form polycrystalline  agglomerates or alternatively by Oswald ripening to form large single crystals. The presence of aqueous Al species \u201epoisoned\u201c goethite\u2019s surface by disrupting the formation of hydrogen bonds thus increasing the number of non-stoichiometric hydroxyls. The second study addressed changes of mineral composition in mixed Fe-Al hydroxide nanoparticles as a function of Al-substitution and reaction time. It was found that low Al concentrations (2-8 mol. %)  lead to formation of moderately crystalline Al-goethite upon ageing, while at medium Al concentrations (10-20%) colloidal suspensions remained stable for the duration of the whole experiment (54 days), goethite  formation was completely retarded, and less crystalline intermediate structure were formed. At 25% Al substitution, gibbsite Al(OH)3 microcrystalline structures appeared within the first days of experiment. In addition, to understand the mechanism of Al substitution in goethite, we explored the most energetically favorable arrangement of Al atoms within goethite by ab initio periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These calculations showed that Al may form Al-O-Al clusters as opposed to evenly distributed isolated Al atoms  (Al-O-Fe) in goethite structure. The third study was conducted to investigate the relative importance of Fe and Al hydroxide nanoparticles in migration and accumulation of these elements in soils. I approached this goal by studying soil water and coatings on mineral grains from Spodosol soil, which is characterized by intensive leaching of Fe, Al, and organic matter (OM) and their accumulation in Spodosol profile. While Fe, Al and Si were mostly transported as inorganic colloids, Al also showed close association with organic matter. Fe, Al, and Si have the highest mobility in organic-rich A and Bh horizons of the spodosol profile, which suggests that the presence of organic matter facilitates transport of these elements by stabilizing the inorganic colloids. The two major mechanisms of immobilization of Fe, Al, Si and OM are (1) polymerization of metal-OM complexes and (2) surface charge neutralization of OM-inorganic colloidal aggregates. Both of these processes presumably occur when the (Fe+Al) to C ratios in the colloidal fraction increase in Bh horizon. \nThe presented research findings contribute to our understanding of the fundamental properties of mixed Fe- and Al-hydroxide nanoparticles and also help to predict the interactions and environmental fate of natural nanocolloids in soil profile.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1685], "author_name_tesi": "Bazilevskaya, Ekaterina ", "last_name_ssi": "Bazilevskaya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ekaterina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carmen Enid Martinez", "Carmen Enid Martinez", "Douglas Archibald", "Edward John Ciolkosz", "James David Kubicki", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carmen Enid Martinez, Dissertation Advisor", "Carmen Enid Martinez, Committee Chair", "Douglas Archibald, Committee Member", "Edward John Ciolkosz, Committee Member", "James David Kubicki, Committee Member", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanoparticles", "iron and aluminum hydroxides", "rate constants of goethite crystallization", "ATR-FTIR", "Spodosols", "colloidal transport"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Principals' Perceptions of School Leadership in post-Katrina New Orleans\n\n", "id": "8284", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "769", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines the perceptions of public school principals in New Orleans, Louisiana during the period of extensive structural change in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

The cause of the tilt has been under investigation since.\n\tMany studies have been performed covering topics such as NEM mesh sizes, PARAGON radial discretization, the B1 approximation, and inter-layer axial leakage. It was found that the B1 approximation, used to adjust for the critical neutron spectrum, had the most significant effect on the axial reaction rate distribution. However, this effect was not consistent between cases and it was decided that the B1 approximation should not be used.\nThe results of the original axial leakage study suggested that there was an issue with the original implementation of the axial leakage routine in the code. Upon investigation, it was found that the energy treatment in the axial leakage routine needed to be updated. This effort is currently in progress as of the writing of this thesis. Specifically, the fine group energy structure for the axial leakage source is to be reconstructed using the previous iteration energy spectra.

It has been shown that freshwater AOM proceeds with nitrite and nitrate.  However, before this study the only known electron acceptor in marine AOM was sulfate.  The work of this study helps to illuminate some of the requirements of marine AOM in the Eel River Basin (ERB), CA, focusing on the methane source and electron acceptors which allow for this globally significant process to proceed.  \n     In Chapter 2, I use a finite difference thermal history model to indicate areas within the ERB that are capable of thermogenic methane production.  Using the model results, I propose a correlation between areas with high rates of hydrocarbon production, methane seep location, and thus the areas within the ERB where high rates of AOM occur.  The results of this study not only provide a potential link between geophysics/tectonics and microbiology, but also provide target areas within the ERB that could be used for microbiologic studies.  Chapters 3 and 4 are incubation studies, targeted at understanding the role of electron acceptors, using sediment from methane seeps in the ERB.  Methane oxidation is monitored by measuring the incorporation of 13C, from 13CH4, into the carbon dioxide in the headspace.  In Chapter 3, I examine how the rate of AOM changes at varying sulfate concentrations, with a focus on concentrations lower than 1 mM.  Although it is often stated that methane oxidation occurs in a 1:1 ratio with sulfate reduction, I find that at these low sulfate concentrations, methane oxidation and sulfate reduction are uncoupled, with methane oxidation rates sometimes an order of magnitude higher than sulfate reduction rates.  Our experimentally determined rates of AOM are then put into an early Earth atmospheric photochemical model where it is shown that AOM causes a faster rise of oxygen and faster re-rise of methane than models that do not contain AOM.   In Chapter 4, I test whether electron acceptors other than sulfate can be used in marine AOM.  My results show the first direct evidence that both manganese (in the form of birnessite) and iron (in the form of ferrihydrite) can be used in marine AOM.  Although the rates of manganese- and iron-dependent AOM are slower than sulfate-dependent AOM, these processes have the potential to gain more energy from methane oxidation.  In addition, manganese- and iron-dependent AOM have the potential to be significant processes on early Earth when sulfate levels were extremely low.  \n     Chapter 5 continues the study of manganese- and iron-dependent AOM using phylogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).  In addition we incubated the experiments demonstrating manganese-dependent AOM with 15NH4Cl, during which active cells incorporate the 15N, and measured target aggregates from the incubation using FISH coupled to secondary ion mass spectrometry (FISH-SIMS) to determine the active cells in our incubation.  Based on phylogenetic analysis, we find that both manganese- and iron-dependent AOM appear to be performed by distinct microbial assemblages and/or mechanism as compared to sulfate dependent AOM.  SIMS analysis of aggregates in the manganese incubation indicate that mixed and mixed-cluster aggregates (of archaea and bacteria) and archaea of sarcina morphology are active and thus are likely responsible for manganese-dependent AOM. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1763], "author_name_tesi": "Beal, Emily J", "last_name_ssi": "Beal", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Howard House", "Christopher Howard House", "Kevin Patrick Furlong", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "Katherine Haines Freeman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Howard House, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Chair", "Kevin Patrick Furlong, Committee Chair", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Member", "Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermal history", "Anaerobic Methane Oxidation", "early Earth", "ferrihydrite", "birnessite", "sulfate"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Predictors of marriage and dissolution\namongst cohabiting couples\n", "id": "10772", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "608", "abstract_tesi": "This study assesses the relative risk of moving into a marriage relationship among cohabiting couples as opposed to dissolution.

Little consensus exists on what function cohabitation serves for young adults and what motivates (or inhibits) a transition to marriage from cohabitation. There exists a cohabitation paradox in which recent cohorts are showing higher rates of cohabitation, and higher rates of dissolution from cohabitation, which combine to produce higher rates of serial cohabitation; yet support for marriage remains extremely high and remains the desired relationship form. This dissertation explores this paradox by using the concept of a relationship pathway. By using data from multiple relationships and multiple partners, I am able to map out a complete premarital cohabitation history for a nationally representative sample of American young adults.\nBy leveraging these multiple relationships, I am able to examine three key aspects of a young adult\u2019s relationship path.  First I include partner information to examine the interplay between respondent variables and partner information and test dyadic theories of relationship cohesion and related gender roles. Second, I construct a frailty variable to parse out an individual\u2019s unique hazard for each relationship outcome and quantify how much influence an individual\u2019s enduring traits impact transition likelihood. Third, I conduct a latent class analysis to uncover relationship pathways within the data. \nI find that adding partner variables did not significantly add to a model\u2019s predictive power, suggesting that there was a high level of homogeny between a respondent and their partner. However, the frailty variable stayed stable throughout various model specifications, suggesting that a respondent\u2019s unique unobserved traits are uncorrelated with the observed variables in this study. This monograph discovered 5 distinct cohabitation pathways that young adults take on their way to marriage and find that cohabitation serves very different purposes among these groups. However, there are strong similarities in the transition hazards between classes, suggesting a common underlying process.\nI find strong evidence that cohabitation experiences are driven by a person\u2019s enduring traits and find strong selection effects into individual cohabitation pathways. I also find support for marital search theory, with longer partner searches and an improving partner pool both associated with higher chances of marriage.

The first study identifies the pertinent empirical literature on the topic of interest and provides a unifying conceptual framework with reference to each study\u2019s focus and quality measures.  The second study investigates the finance-quality relationship within Department of Defense hospitals.  The third and final study follows a similar investigative approach with federally funded community health centers serving as the unit of analysis.\n     The purpose of the first study was to uncover the existing empirical literature as it pertains to the relationships between healthcare organizational finances and quality of care.  Based on these findings I was able to develop the bases for predictions about how health care organization finances would affect quality within other organizational contexts.  Eventually only 16 empirically rigorous studies on this topic were drawn from the available literature between 1980 and 2005.  Collectively, these articles indicate that organizational expenses, net margins, and asset and liability management all affect healthcare outcome quality. There is less evidence about how organizational finance factors affect structural or process quality.  \n     The purpose of the second study was to empirically test the association between financial resources and health care quality in Department of Defense hospitals.  Financial and organizational data from the 2003 Health Care Survey of Defense Department Beneficiaries (HCSDB) and 1999-2003 data from the Department of Defense Medical Expense Performance Reporting System (MEPRS) are used.  I employ a measure of military treatment facility fiscal margin to predict seven Consumer Assessment of Health Plan Satisfaction (CAHPS) quality dimensions.  Ordinary least squares regression analysis and multilevel modeling are the primary statistical methods.  Results indicate a significant and positive association between organizational finances and quality outcomes.  This indicates that organizations with more financial flexibility may be more adept at meeting or exceeding patient care expectations.\n     The purpose of the third study was to determine the nature of the finance-quality association within the ambulatory care context.  The number of federally funded health centers has increased significantly due to a major Bush administration expansion initiative.  As the number of health centers has increased, however, questions remain about financial capacity to provide quality care.  In this study, I hypothesize that health centers with greater fiscal margins will provide preventive and primary care to a greater proportion of their patients. Seven years (1998-2004) of data are used from the Health Resources and Services Administration\u2019s Uniform Data System, to test the association between organization finances and four process quality dependent variables, inclusive of two preventive care measures (e.g., percent of patients receiving PAP smears and percent under routine health supervision) and two well child/mother measures (e.g., % receiving first trimester care and % receiving post partum care).  Multilevel modeling is the primary statistical method.  Results indicate a significant and positive cross sectional association between organizational financial margins and percentages of patients receiving preventive health care.  Findings are less supportive or negatively oriented when primary care is the dependent variable of interest. Based on our findings, health center net revenue may be responsible for initial preventative care improvements, but appears less supportive of primary care service enhancement.  Surprisingly, however, I also find the preventative care advantages gained from higher comparative net revenues to diminish while primary care (i.e., post partum care) services are enhanced over time.\n     In sum, this series of investigations addresses a significant gap in the health services literature pertaining to organizational financing and health care quality for three reasons.  First, this research is the first known application of multi-level modeling in research applied to the finance-quality relationship, providing perspective on how organizational finances influence health care quality over time.  Second, Department of Defense hospitals and federally funded community health centers are under studied organizations that comprise essential portions of the nation\u2019s health care safety net.  Third, with the recognized shortcomings in health care quality on a national scale and U.S. health care costs exceeding $1.7 trillion each year \u2013 and growing \u2013 there has never been a more appropriate time to investigate the finance-quality relationship (CMS, 2006; AHA, 2006).  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [724], "author_name_tesi": "Beauvais, Brad Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Beauvais", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Brad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Rebecca Wells", "Dr Jami Delli Fraine", "Susan Diane Brannon", "Dr Joeseph Vasey", "Dr Frank Lawrence"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Rebecca Wells, Committee Chair", "Dr Jami Delli Fraine, Committee Chair", "Susan Diane Brannon, Committee Member", "Dr Joeseph Vasey, Committee Member", "Dr Frank Lawrence, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Quality", "Health Care", "Finance"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Innate Immune Response to Ectromelia Virus Infection:  Early Effector Mechanisms and Cell Types\n", "id": "12339", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3462", "abstract_tesi": "Our body has many mechanisms in place to deal with foreign pathogens.

Several key tools are available that allow for the efficient study of a peripheral challenge in this model such as resistant and susceptible strains of mice and virus encoded HRM.\n\tUsing the ECTV model of a peripheral challenge in mice, we intent to further analyze the innate immune response.

Furthermore, the substrate, which is a mixture of compost and delayed-release supplements, has been refined for maximum mushroom production, and although widely adopted by mushroom producers around the world, this system is environmentally problematic (odor emissions, nutrient-rich run-off, and substrate disposal limitations) and these problems will only intensify with urban sprawl. \nIn this study, grain-based mushroom production systems were evaluated as a potential alternative to the traditional compost-based system for A. bisporus. Two types of grain-based systems were developed and called\u2013 \u201cSatellite Mushroom Production System\u201d (SMPS), and \u201cComplete On-site Mushroom Production System\u201d (COMPS). Mushroom producers adopting the SMPS, would use a substrate primarily composed of commercial grain spawn, whereas mushrooms producers adopting the COMPS would use a subsrate composed of cereal grains mixed with oilseed (grain/oilseed). Both systems were tested and refined for mushroom production and substrate bioefficiency (BE). Furthermore, the theoretical designs and the direct costs for mushroom production for each system were developed and calculated. \nFor the SMPS, the factors influencing mushroom production were: adding a layer of water-holding materials below the commercial grain spawn substrate, heat-sterilizing casing with the addition of activated carbon, and type and level of delayed-release supplement used. Overall, the highest yield of mushrooms for a commercial grain spawn substrate was 14.28 kg/m2 with a corresponding BE of 177% and was obtained for a treatment containing 5% S41- an underlying layer of perlite (2000 ml) and cased with a heat-sterilized casing containing 25% activated carbon. The design of SMPS entails different steps that start with mixing of the substrate ingredients, transferring the substrate to trays, and subsequent steps are comparable to traditional compost-based systems. Based on the cost model developed for the SMPS, the cost of production/unit weigh of mushroom is $4.00/kg. This is much higher than the market cost of A. bisporus and mushroom producers would not make a profit. \nFor the COMPS, the factors that were tested for mushroom production using grain/oilseed substrate were type of cereal grain used, type and rate of oilseed added, pre-conditioning the substrate with Scytalidium thermophilum (a mushroom compost thermophile), and moisture content in the grain portion of the substrate. Furthermore, two additional mushroom producing species (A. blazei and Pleurotus eryngii) were grown on the grain/oilseed substrate to determine whether the grain-based system could be extended to the production of other mushroom forming species. \nFor A. bisporus, adding oilseeds to a basal substrate composed of millet grain increased yield and a 15% amendment of soybean gave the highest yield (16.9 kg/m2 with a corresponding BE of 205%). Furthermore, preconditioning the substrate with S. thermophilum improved yield on oat based-substrates and decreased spawn-run time for all grain/oilseed substrates. Moisture contents ranging from 50-65% seem adequate for mushroom production, whereas the peak in yield is observed between the 55% and 60% moisture levels.\nFor A. blazei and P. eryngii mushroom production, grain/oilseed substrate successfully supported mushroom production. For A. blazei, millet with 30% niger yielded 15.9 kg/m2, whereas, an oat/oilseed substrate provided the highest yield of 106 g for P. eryngii. Overall, the highest yield for A. bisporus was observed for a millet/ 5% soybean substrate with an additional amendment of 5% delayed-release supplement (Promycel Target\u00ae) which produced 21.3 kg/m2 with a BE of 273%. The system design is composed of an aseptic processing unit that converts the raw materials into a suitable mushroom substrate, and steps following the processing of the grain/oilseed substrate are comparable to the SMPS. Based on the cost model developed for the COMPS, the cost of production/unit weight of mushrooms is $1.40/kg, and this would provide mushroom producers with a profit. \nBased on findings from this research, developing an alternative commercial A. bisporus mushroom production system using grain-based substrates is a highly promising alternative to commercial compost-based system and its environmental problems. Yield from grain-based substrates is still lower than compost-based substrates but further refinement of the substrate ultimately will increase mushroom yield. A pilot-scale system is needed to test scale-up of this system for mushroom production on grain-based substrates. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3921], "author_name_tesi": "Bechara, Mark Anthony", "last_name_ssi": "Bechara", "middle_name_ssi": "Anthony", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Paul Walker", "Thomas Lehman Richard", "John Michael Regan", "Charles Peter Romaine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Chair", "Paul Walker, Committee Member", "Thomas Lehman Richard, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Charles Peter Romaine, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["non composted substrates", "agaricus bisporus", "cost modelling", "Pleurotus eryngii", "Agaricus blazei"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Description and analysis of the perceived knowledge, use and effectiveness of experiential learning in Pennsylvania 4-H Clubs", "id": "13961", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7190", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The National 4-H organization prides itself on \u201clearning by doing.\u201d The idea of learning through an experience is a major component of the experiential learning process, which stems from constructivist education theories.

Additionally, statistics point out that currently in the United States, more than 11 million children under the age of five are in some type of early-care and educational program for an average of 36 hours every week.  Approximately one-third of these children are in multiple programs so that parents can meet the demands for care during traditional and non-traditional working hours.\nIn this research study I wanted to listen to the \u201cvoices\u201d of early-care and education teachers as they define and describe their perceptions of what a high quality classroom looks like and the teaching practices that they identify and use within their classrooms. Since research also proposes that the educational level of the teacher makes a difference in the quality of their practices, I also wanted to explore their perceptions regarding higher education and their motivation to return to post-secondary education to obtain a degree.\n\tThe research study was guided by the following six research questions: a) How do early-care and education teachers define and describe a high quality classroom, b) what teacher practices do they identify as necessary in a high quality classroom, c) what influences their descriptions of high quality and their identification of the teacher practices that support high quality: i.e. educational attainment level, experience, or a combination of educational attainment and experience, d) do early-care and education teachers identify a higher level of education as an indicator of quality, e) what is the perception of early-care and education teachers regarding years of experience, and f) what are the perceptions and reactions of early-care and education teachers regarding the current expectation or requirement that in-service teachers obtain a degree (Associate or Bachelor)?\t  \nMultiple research tools such as open-ended interviews, field observations, informal surveys and reflection journals were used to gather data.

The majority of the participants did agree that some level of education is beneficial, such as, a Child Development Accredition Certificate (CDA), Associate in Applied Science (AAS) or Bachelor (BS/BA).  However, the participants pointed out that the focus of the degree program must be Early Childhood Education, preferably birth through age five years. \nLongevity or their years of experience within the field of early-care and education is highly important and viewed as valuable to the participants and should be positively recognized and validated at institutions of higher education.

Initial testing with a parallel plate electrode probe found that electrochemical measurements could only be performed if an aqueous phase was present between the electrodes to provide adequate ionic conductivity. Additionally, surface analysis of exposure coupons found that corrosion only occurred in localized regions where water had condensed or adsorbed onto the metal surface. These results led to the design of a flush mount probe that utilized an ion conductive membrane to provide electrolyte conductivity between the electrodes. This design allowed consistent measurements to be made without relying on natural wetting of the probe surface, which can be inconsistent and intermittent. Corrosion measurements were performed using linear polarization resistance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and electrochemical frequency modulation. Samples were exposed to scCO2-containing environments until steady-state corrosion behavior was observed.\nIt was observed with the prototype probes that the construction of the probe could have significant impact on the measured solution resistance and overall corrosion rate. Tests performed in supercritical CO2 at 50 \u00b0C and 10 MPa with 2000 ppm water vapor found corrosion rates between 10-4 and 10-2 mm y-1 for a black carbon steel sample. However, the charge transfer resistance measured using impedance spectroscopy was not found to vary greatly between probes. Kinetic corrosion rates using this value were between 0.05 and 0.1 mm y-1 for nearly all of the initial probes tested.\nTests were also performed in the bulk aqueous phase saturated with scCO2 using probes with and without the ion conductive membrane to determine its impact on the corrosion process. Samples of X65 carbon steel saw overall corrosion rates ranging from 1 to 5 mm y-1, similar to what has been reported literature from weight loss measurements. Greater consistency was observed in the charge transfer resistance, with the kinetic corrosion rate for nearly all probes falling around 5 mm y-1. No major difference in behavior was observed between probes with the membrane coating and those with a bare surface.\nThe final set of tests was performed with X65 carbon steel in scCO2 with 2000 ppm water vapor using probes with various membrane thicknesses. Both the overall corrosion rate and the charge transfer resistance were found to vary with the membrane thickness. Probes with thinner membrane coatings reported lower corrosion rates and larger solution resistance values. It is proposed here that the thickness of the membrane coating may have affected the thickness of the resulting aqueous film, with thicker membranes allowing for the formation of thicker layers of water on the probe surface. A reduction in the aqueous film thickness could have reduced the rate for replenishing carbonic acid in the water phase that is consumed in the corrosion process, which could have changed the solution pH and affected the charge transfer kinetics. Tests at 1000 ppm water saw a decrease in the observed corrosion rate, while tests at 3000 ppm did not differ from measurements at 2000 ppm water.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8109], "author_name_tesi": "Beck, Justin Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Beck", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Serguei Lvov", "Serguei Lvov", "Derek Elsworth", "Semih Eser", "Barbara Shaw"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Serguei Lvov, Dissertation Advisor", "Serguei Lvov, Committee Chair", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Semih Eser, Committee Member", "Barbara Shaw, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electrochemical measurements", "supercritical CO2", "corrosion", "ion conductive membrane"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Temperature impacts on mosquito population dynamics and malaria transmission", "id": "19835", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9433", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vector-borne diseases are inextricably linked to environmental conditions through the strong effects of the environment on general insect ecology. Malaria is the most important vector-borne disease for public health because of its wide distribution and the degree of morbidity and morality it causes. The connection between the environment and vector-borne diseases is exemplified by the linkage between malaria parasites and the mosquitoes that transmit them. Of all of the environmental conditions that affect mosquitoes, temperature is the one of the most important because it affects essentially every stage of the lifecycle. The influence of temperature on mosquito populations is highly complex, as the effects of temperature on various processes are non-linear and difficult to predict.  In addition, the development rate of the malaria parasite is also temperature-dependent for the part of its lifecycle that occurs within the mosquito vector. This further increases the effect of the environment on transmission.  As global climate changes, the importance of understanding the impacts of temperature on mosquitoes will become more critical to the management of epidemiological challenges.  \n\nThe work presented in this dissertation focuses on the effects of temperature on mosquito population dynamics, adult age structure and the potential for malaria transmission. To explore this line of questioning, I developed a stage-structured temperature-dependent delayed differential equation model. Using different temperature regimes, including constant, fluctuating, historic and future projected temperatures I analyzed the model to understand the effects of temperature on mosquito population dynamics, adult age structure and the potential for malaria transmission. The results indicate that temperature has a greater and more complex impact on adult mosquito abundance and survival than previously thought. For example, I show that the abundance of adults that have lived long enough to potentially vector malaria parasites cannot always be inferred from the overall adult abundance; the dynamics of these two groups can differ significantly. In addition, mean temperature, a metric that is commonly used for malaria and mosquitoes, is, alone, not sufficient to understand the population in an area; the variation and the type of variation around those mean temperatures can significantly influence dynamics and therefore the potential for malaria transmission. The model also illustrates that predictions about the impact of climate change on mosquito populations and transmission potential is best done at a local scale, as the consequences of changes in temperature can differ starkly over small geographic distances. \n\nOverall, the work presented in this dissertation shows the complexity and the importance of temperature to mosquito vector populations and provides a useful platform from which to answer further questions about temperature, mosquitoes and malaria. The model also demonstrates that understanding the dynamics of any vector population or any vector-borne disease requires a thorough understanding of the relevant insect ecology; the model, although developed for mosquitoes that vector the malaria parasite, can easily be adapted for use with other vectors.

Large-scale chromatin remodeling, manifested by the progressive condensation of chromatin marked by the repressive histone modification H3K9me2, is essential to establish cell-specific gene expression patterns during lineage commitment and cellular differentiation. Dysregulation of this large-scale regulatory mechanism has been linked to cellular transformation and oncogenesis in cancer cell lines, diverse solid tumors and hematopoietic cancers. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly malignant blood cancer and many of the recurrent gene fusions and driver mutations associated with AML are directly related to epigenetic regulation and chromatin higher order structure, suggesting broad genetic and epigenetic disruption in the pathogenesis of AML. \nWe conducted Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) to analyze genome-wide H3K9me2 distribution in primary AML patient samples, CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors, and mature granulocytes, and identified distinct genomic regions marked by significant bidirectional changes of H3K9me2, including domains persistently altered in AML patient samples. In addition, we showed that targeting the histone methyltransferase G9a, which is responsible for the majority of euchromatic H3K9me2, with a pharmacologically active inhibitor, reverses some of the changes observed in AML cells.  We performed ChIP-qPCR and transcriptional analysis of genes within the specific regions and in this thesis present evidence in support of the ChIP-seq analysis.

Animals that have adapted to handle the toxic chemistry in these environments thrive and form dense high-biomass communities.  In this thesis, stable isotopes were used to explore food web interactions in several seep-associated communities in the Gulf of Mexico.  We used collection techniques that capture the entire local community associated with the target foundation species and subsampled from this community for stable isotope analysis. Tissue stable isotope values in the reef-building cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa refuted a long-standing hypothesis that cold-water corals rely on primary production from seeps around which they occur.  They instead are probably taking advantage of the abundant carbonate rock substrate found at seeps. The communities associated with the corals also showed no indication of nutritional input from seeps. \nBathymodiolin mussel tissue &#948;13C values showed that biogenic methane dominates the methane at lower-slope seeps and extremely low &#948;15N values in one collection of Bathymodiolus childressi point toward an unusually abundant or isotopically depleted nitrogen source.  Very low &#948;13C values in the vestimentiferan tubeworms Escarpia laminata and Lamellibrachia sp. 1 support uptake of porewater dissolved inorganic carbon through their buried roots.  Consistent differences in &#948;15N between the co-occurring E. laminata and Lamellibrachia sp. 1 provide evidence for partitioning of inorganic nitrogen sources, a finding that has significant implications for the ecology and evolution of this taxonomic group.  Extremely variable &#948;34S values in vestimentiferans provide evidence that waste sulfate excreted from vestimentiferan roots is reduced to sulfide by microbial consortia in the vicinity of the individual root, ensuring a sulfide supply to the vestimentiferans\u2019 symbionts.  Tissue &#948;13C, &#948;15N, and &#948;34S values in heterotrophic animals collected with vestimentiferans, mussels, and vesicomyid clams showed that the majority of animals derive a significant portion of their nutrition from seep primary production.  \nThe &#948;13C values in the heterotrophs tracked the &#948;13C of their associated symbiotic fauna, which varied substantially between collection locations. This indicates that most of the animals feed locally and that the &#948;13C signature of the local hydrocarbon pool affect the &#948;13C values of the entire community.  The &#948;15N values of heterotrophs collected with mussels were significantly more depleted than those collected with vestimentiferans both overall and within sites.  This was consistent with an approximately 8\u2030 depletion in mussel tissue &#948;15N values compared to vestimentiferan &#948;15N values within the same sites.  Together, these data indicate a difference in the isotope compositions of the inorganic nitrogen sources in the two microhabitats.  The lack of isotope data for inorganic nitrogen at seeps prohibits further speculation into the underlying cause of this difference.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1782], "author_name_tesi": "Becker, Erin Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Becker", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Erin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "Katriona Shea", "Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Douglas Alan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Chair", "Katriona Shea, Committee Chair", "Tracy Lee Langkilde, Committee Member", "Douglas Alan Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["oil seep", "hydrocarbon seep", "Gulf of Mexico", "community ecology", "stable isotope", "methane", "food web", "trophic"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Fun in the Workplace on Experienced Fun, Work Engagement, Constituent Attachment, and Turnover Among Entry-level Service Employees", "id": "16033", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8029", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Employee turnover is a major problem for employers.

Are the relationships stable after controlling for other theoretically relevant structural conditions? Finally, are the relationships the same at two time points, as well as over time? I employ cross-sectional analyses of the static relationships in 1990 and 2000 and change-score analyses of the relationships over the two decennial periods. The latter analyses add to the limited body of research examining the dynamic relationships between deprivation and crime. I measure county-level structural characteristics based on 1990 and 2000 Census data and use ordinary least-squares regression models to predict total, violent, property, and homicide crime rates. I then regress differences in crime rates from 1990 to 2000 on differences in the independent variables to examine the dynamic relationships between structural conditions and crime. The results of the cross-sectional analyses universally support the conclusion that absolute deprivation has a stronger association with crime than does relative deprivation. However, the change-score analyses indicate that not only do changes in levels of relative deprivation have stronger relationships than changes in absolute deprivation with shifts in crime levels, but that these relationships are unexpectedly negative.

Much of the communities and crime research relies heavily on cross-sectional, non-spatial examinations of key relationships between concentrated disadvantage, social processes like collective efficacy, and crime outcomes. This is somewhat surprising given the theoretically important role of stability and change in ecological perspectives on crime. Key processes mediating the structure-crime relationship are inherently time-dependent, requiring time to develop (or weaken/strengthen) in response to changing structural conditions, while the influence they exert on crime-related outcomes similarly takes time to emerge (e.g. through building or limiting informal social control).\nUsing multiple years of decennial census data, information on neighborhood social conditions from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods Community Survey (PHDCN-CS), and homicide data collected by the Chicago Police Department, this dissertation combines these foci \u2013 historical time and geographical space \u2013 into an exploration of 1) how neighborhood histories of concentrated disadvantage influence neighborhood homicide rates; 2) how neighborhood histories of concentrated disadvantage influence neighborhood levels of collective efficacy; and 3) how the influence of change or stability in neighborhood concentrated disadvantage on neighborhood homicide rates is channeled through collective efficacy, an important theoretical mediator of the concentrated disadvantage-crime association.\nThe major findings fall into four general categories. First, the cross-sectional relationship between the level of neighborhood concentrated disadvantage and homicide rates significantly varies across Chicago neighborhoods in cross-section in 1990. The same was found for the relationship between the level of concentrated disadvantage and neighborhood collective efficacy. Second, in both cases the cross-sectional relationship became spatially invariant once a measure of historical within-neighborhood changes in concentrated disadvantage was added to the models. It appears that there are significant differences in homicide rates across neighborhoods which share a similar level of disadvantage in cross-section but have dissimilar histories of disadvantage in the preceding decades.\nThird, while the previous results suggest that within-neighborhood changes in concentrated disadvantage are \u201cdisruptive\u201d in terms of contributing to higher homicide rates and lower levels of collective efficacy, it also appears that within-neighborhood historical stability interacts with the cross-sectional level of concentrated disadvantage. The negative effects of high disadvantage are exacerbated under stable historical conditions, at least as far as being significantly related to higher homicide rates. It appears that the detrimental effects of high levels of disadvantage \u201caccumulate\u201d under stable conditions. However, this was not the case in when collective efficacy was the outcome modeled; it does not appear that the harmful effects of concentrated disadvantage on collective efficacy \u201caccumulate\u201d under stable historical conditions.\nFinally, it does not appear that the effects of within-neighborhood change (or stability) are mediated by the collective efficacy mechanism. While collective efficacy does mediate the cross-sectional relationship between concentrated disadvantage and homicide rates to some extent, it does not explain the spatial variation in the relationship. It is only after accounting for within-neighborhood change in the model that the cross-sectional relationship between disadvantage and neighborhood homicide rates becomes spatially invariant.\nThe key contribution of this research was to demonstrate that within-neighborhood stability and change in concentrated disadvantage plays an important role in the production of neighborhood collective efficacy, as well as significantly contributes to the prediction of neighborhood homicide rates. This realistic representation of neighborhoods as both spatial and temporal units adds to the growing body of work that considers neighborhoods from a developmental or life-course perspective. It should be extended by considering what other social processes \u2013 besides collective efficacy \u2013 may mediate the impact of within-neighborhood structural change, as well as with explorations of other sources of within-neighborhood change like immigration concentration.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9787], "author_name_tesi": "Becker, Jacob H.", "last_name_ssi": "Becker", "middle_name_ssi": "H.", "first_name_ssi": "Jacob", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Allen Kreager", "Derek Allen Kreager", "Barrett Alan Lee", "D Wayne Osgood", "Diane Krantz Mclaughlin", "Lori Burrington"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derek Allen Kreager, Dissertation Advisor", "Derek Allen Kreager, Committee Chair", "Barrett Alan Lee, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "Diane Krantz Mclaughlin, Committee Member", "Lori Burrington, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Neighborhoods", "Homicide", "Disadvantage", "Collective Efficacy", "Spatial Analysis", "Histories", "Criminology"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A RESOURCE DEPENDENCE PERSPECTIVE ON STATEWIDE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES ", "id": "0v8380566", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13004", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In 2009, $550 Million was disbursed through a Federal program, the State Health Information Exchange Cooperative Agreement Program (SHIECAP), to facilitate and expand the exchange of patient health data among healthcare organizations. This program created concurrent efforts in each state that recruited leadership and drafted strategy to surmount the sociotechnical barriers to offering patient data exchange. SHIECAP aimed to alleviate these barriers through a combination of funding and guidance. As of 2016, there has been growing interest in the local counterparts of SHIECAP, the Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), but there has been little research on the performance of the statewide SHIECAP organizations. This investigation applies Resource Dependence Theory to fill this gap, focusing on the relationship between the boards of directors and strategy of these organizations as they influence performance.  \nResource Dependence Theory argues that organizations recruit directors to their boards to gain access to critical resources necessary for their strategy. As resources required and strategies employed vary across contexts so do their boards. To study these boards within this data exchange context, this study uses mixed methods within an embedded case research design. In this design, quantitative analyses of 44 SHIECAP organizations provide evidence to test the predicted relationships between boards, strategy and performance.  An in-depth qualitative investigation of North Carolina is used to augment this analysis by capturing the mechanisms driving these predicted relationships. \nThis work finds a strong relationship of board size and composition predicting performance of SHIECAP Organizations, but does not find a similar relationship between strategy and performance, though this is partially expected due to the lack of alignment between boards and strategy in this context. The North Carolina Case offers further explanation of these results showing (1) performance is mediated by the actions of several organizations, (2) a weakness in the SHIECAP Strategy labels applied by ONC, and (3) the mechanism that drives performance of these organizations. \nThis melded approach provides three main contributions to Resource Dependence Theory.

The findings concurred with prior HIV/AIDS educational evaluations. In other words, these interventions, although they have had positive results in increasing HIV/AIDS preventive knowledge and to some degree the attitudes of the individuals being targeted for HIV/AIDS risk, have limited effects on risky HIV/AIDS behavior. For this sample, mass media interventions had no effect on behavior change, and social networks had both positive and negative effects on reducing HIV/AIDS risk behavior. The variables found to be consistent with HIV/AIDS risk reduction behavior (the ABCs) were the sociodemographic variables of education, age, and marital status, while interpersonal social networks had mixed effects. \nThe study then looked at a HIV/AIDS high risk group to see how the interventions were affecting their behavior, from whom they obtained their HIV/AIDS information and which sources they trusted, and their opinions concerning the reasons for high HIV/AIDS prevalence in their community. To investigate this aspect of the study, the Garifuna communities on the north shore of Honduras were selected because of their HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, which is estimated to be four times greater than that for the overall population of Honduras.

Prior studies showed that HIV/AIDS knowledge has increased among the Garifuna, but risk perceptions remain low and behavior change lags behind. \nFindings from the qualitative stage of this study suggest that even though the Garifuna may not follow the proscribed behavior change model that includes abstinence, fidelity, and condom use, individuals are adapting their sexual behavior to better protect themselves from the disease. They are now utilizing \u201cSexual Reconnaissance\u201d to investigate the HIV/AIDS risk of potential partners, to avoid the ABCs. \nDiscrepancies were found in perceptions between the in-depth interviews of the development agency personnel implementing the HIV/AIDS interventions and the Garifunas\u2019 reasoning about the high HIV/AIDS prevalence in their communities. The development agency personnel viewed the normative sexual behavior of the Garifuna as the reason for the high prevalence rates, while the Garifuna believed that outside influences were the reason. This discrepancy between the development agencies\u2019 and Garifunas\u2019 perceptions could be leading the Garifuna to distrust development agencies and affect the efficacy of HIV/AIDS interventions. Understanding current trends in behavior change among at-risk populations\u2014how individuals are actively attempting to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS, and the discrepancies in perceptions between the target at-risk group and the agencies implementing the interventions\u2014will greatly inform health prevention programs among the Garifuna and help to increase the efficacy of future interventions.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2676], "author_name_tesi": "Bedford, Jason G.", "last_name_ssi": "Bedford", "middle_name_ssi": "G.", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "Anastasia R Snyder", "Leif Jensen", "Leland Luther Glenna", "Edward A Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Dissertation Advisor", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Chair", "Anastasia R Snyder, Committee Chair", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "Leland Luther Glenna, Committee Member", "Edward A Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Garifuna", "HIV/AIDS", "Risk Perception", "Mixed Methodology", "Prevention"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Adolescent HIV Risk in South Africa: Multiple Perspectives on Sexual Behavior", "id": "13212pyb5129", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13212", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Adolescent Black and Coloured South Africans comprise a highly vulnerable segment of the population representing a substantial proportion of individuals with HIV/AIDS, both in their country and worldwide1\u20134.

The use of capacitance cell nuclear pressure transmitters in these high temperature environments degrades integrated sensing electronics and limits the transmitter\u2019s usable life.  An all-optical pressure sensor would remove the transducer interface and communication electronics from the sensing environment\u2014 extending the sensor\u2019s life and reducing sensor maintenance and lifecycle costs.\n\nThis paper presents the design and experimental evaluation of a fiber Bragg grating optical pressure transducer.  The primary transduction mechanism of this design relates pressure in a fluid filled pipe to sensing diaphragm strain using optical diaphragm strain measurements.  Similar to capacitance cell pressure transmitter designs, the proposed pressure transducer is susceptible to measurement bias induced by temperature perturbations.  To minimize measurement bias, a fiber Bragg grating temperature compensation sensor is used to calculate a temperature independent diaphragm strain measurement. \n\nThe transducer design was fabricated and thermal experiments were conducted while the sensing diaphragm was mechanically unconstrained in a thermal chamber.  During these experiments, the sensing diaphragm\u2019s temperature corrected strain was calculated while the ambient temperature was perturbed.  An experimentally developed coefficient of thermal expansion was found to improve the accuracy of strain temperature compensation.  Testing also showed that the time dependence of strain compensation caused the fiber Bragg grating sensing diaphragm to ultimately exhibit 4x the maximum temperature error expected from a capacitance cell pressure transmitter in the same environment.  \n\nThe assembled pressure transducer was experimentally evaluated using a hydraulic test system.  The transducer\u2019s sensitivity between 0 and 1,200 psig was experimentally determined to be 1.64 psi/\u03bc\u03b5.  A multi-step pressure experiment was conducted to confirm the transducer\u2019s measurement repeatability.  During this test, the maximum difference between pressure measurements made using the optical transducer and reference instrumentation was 44.3 psi.  The mean measurement difference for this test was 19.0 psi.  A capacitance cell pressure transmitter in similar conditions is expected to have an overall measurement accuracy of \u00b1 2.5 psi.\n\nThe largest source of measurement error from the fiber Bragg grating pressure transducer is likely to be the time dependent, transient response of diaphragm strain temperature compensation measurements.  Future development of the pressure transducer concept should focus on reducing temperature compensation errors.  Given this improvement, the proposed fiber Bragg grating pressure transducer has significant potential for nuclear power plant applications.

This is nowhere as clearly illustrated than in a 2011 movie, October Baby. By purporting to relate the \u201ctruth-based\u201d story of an abortion survivor, this film illustrates the ways that a post-feminist cultural context permits anti-abortion religious rhetoric to be highly marketable and lucrative. I situate an analysis of the film and the changing nature of anti-abortion discourse by providing historical context on the abortion issue, feminist gains during the twentieth century, and importantly, a discussion of the role of ultrasound imaging technology that has played a significant role in constructing notions of fetal personhood. In this way, I compare October Baby and its paratexts to another hugely successful, much earlier anti-abortion film, The Silent Scream, which foregrounded scientific and medical appeals. Conversely, October Baby backgrounds medicine and science and instead highlights religious and moral elements. Perhaps most importantly, October Baby engages in a euphemistic reframing of what \u201cchoice\u201d entails, shifting discussions from women\u2019s agency and control over their bodies to lesser choices associated with \u201cpost-abortive healing.\u201d This is a process that I term \u201csidelining.\u201d In fact, the film explicitly equates abortion with criminal activity through the integration of religious rhetoric.

They are revolutionizing the life sciences and will be the foundation of a promising century of innovations. In recent years, the development of new sequencing technologies has dramatically decreased the cost of genome sequencing. Less than twenty years ago, sequencing the human genome cost 3 billion dollars, and took about a decade to complete. Today, high-quality 30X full-genome coverage can be obtained in just one day for US$ 5,000, while sequencing just the ~21,000 human genes to the same depth costs only about US$ 500. The latter is sufficient for detecting most of the rare variants, along with other sources of genetic variability such as indels, copy-number variations, and inversions that are characteristic of complex diseases. The enormous quantity of information produced by these sequencing technologies provides the raw material for understanding the diseases, diversity, and evolution of species, and likely the power to predict them.\nNevertheless, the processing and analysis of this data remains challenging for all but the largest and most experienced research groups, and even the best results seem to lack predictive power for large populations. One of the challenges in this analysis is identifying the polymorphisms within species from the vast amount of raw data produced by the sequencing instruments. Fortunately, this and other data-processing steps are becoming more affordable as technology evolves. Once the gigabases of sequence data have been filtered to a few million intra-species DNA polymorphisms and a few thousand amino-acid variants, the computational requirements for their exploration are often relatively modest.\n\nAs part of my research, we have developed a set of tools that run on the Galaxy web server to perform such analyses. These tools facilitate understanding the population structure of focus species and developing testable hypotheses about phenotypic consequences of geneticiv polymorphisms. In particular, new tools are introduced to 1) assess the over-representation of genes of interest in several phenotype categories, 2) calculate the impact of genes of interest in a given phenotype, and 3) predict gene networks based on different attributes. In addition to avoiding the need for research groups to download and install all relevant software, a major benefit of using Galaxy for these, or indeed other, analyses is that reproducibility of published results is often enhanced. Moreover, these tools can be applied to polymorphisms identified by technologies other than sequencing, such as SNP genotyping microarrays.\n\nWe have applied these tools to the analysis of various population genomes, and have obtained very interesting results. We focused our analysis in genomes of endangered species, namely Polar bear, Bighorn sheep, Aye-aye, and Tasmanian devil. In Polar bears, hypothetical molecular adaptations to the extreme of life in the high Arctic were found. For example, mutations in the gene BTN1A1 associated to the high fat content of milk, and others that may allow a fine-tuning of nitric oxide production to control the trade-offs between oxygen consumption, heat production, and energy production. Similarly, we identified hypothetical adaptations in Desert Bighorn sheep that may allow them to tolerate water scarcity. These included mutations in genes involved in water homeostasis and renal retention (i.e.LASS6, XPNPEP1 and XPNPEP3). In Aye-aye, we found mutations in a population that might be involved in muscular adaptations to exploit the niche variability produced by landscape variation. In Tasmanian devil, the use of these tools resulted in four different hypothetical mechanisms that may produce or worsen the devastating Devil facial tumor disease (DFTD).\nTo validate our methods, we also applied our tools to model species or populations of commercial interest. For example, we detected a selective sweep in the genome of commercial broilers that overlaps the major QTL explaining differences in growth between broilers and layers. Other interesting findings include a 3' UTR mutation in the interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) in proximity to a conserved miRNA binding site for three patients with LGL leukemia. Thesev changes may increase the translation of the IL6R and result in aberrant expression of the STAT3 gene. Also, we found that 10% of the Landrace pig genome is ultimately derived from Asian boars, and this portion is enriched in immune-related genes.

In order to accomplish these objectives, I utilized a variety of qualitative, visual and participatory methods that elucidate the socio-spatial relations of power and knowledge production through a focus on women\u2019s everyday material practices.  I employed these methodological techniques over a period of nine months with women in two agrarian communities in northern Guanajuato, Mexico. \n\nThe conceptual framework that guides this study involves an integration of adaptive capacity scholarship with feminist standpoint theory, social reproduction, and feminist political ecology.  I will show how such integration provides useful tools to reframe and enrich our understanding of the processes that shape adaptive capacities.  Consequently, this study illustrates that while women possess a variety of knowledge and skills that are useful for adapting to uncertainty, the gendered dynamics of their socio-spatial relationships variably affect their ability to translate this knowledge into effective action.  In studying these dynamics, this project contributes to the literature on household vulnerability, risk and adaptive capacity in Mexico by illustrating how decision making, resource access and livelihood strategies are gendered processes.  By examining women\u2019s knowledge and experience with environmental and economic uncertainty, this dissertation deepens our knowledge of the limits and opportunities for adaptation.

To help focus the study, I utilized a conceptual framework based on the Contact Hypothesis (Allport, 1979) and on tourism impact literature to examine factors that influence interactions between indigenous tour guides and foreign tourists.  Data analysis revealed two distinct overarching themes.  The first focused on tourist and guide descriptions of the roles and relationships they experienced in their interactions; the second encompassed factors that influenced their interactions.  \nBased on the results relating to roles and relationships, I proposed extensions and amendments to Cohen\u2019s (1985), Weiler and Davis\u2019 (1993), and Howard et al.\u2019s (2001) models of guide roles to account for modified and additional roles experienced by indigenous ecotourism guides, and to encapsulate a tourist\u2019s role in the interaction.

Results also challenged previous assumptions of cultural dissimilarity as an impediment; the findings indicated that cultural differences can be a basis for, and facilitator of, guide-tourist interactions.  Hence, I proposed extensions and amendments to the Contact Hypothesis for use in a tourism setting to better capture interactions between indigenous tour guides and foreign tourists, and to reflect the complexities of such interactions.  \nIn addition, I offered practical implications for guide training and for tourist education and preparation.

The two methods used in this work are orthogonal projections to solve partial differential equations and the descriptor form to solve a system of differential algebraic equations.

Two sets of Legendre Polynomials are used, one that is orthonormal over the thickness of the battery, and another over the radius of the solid electrode particles. The orthogonal projection method is then benchmarked against the finite difference method to assess the benefits and drawbacks. It is shown that the orthogonal projection method is computationally faster than the finite difference method with very little loss in accuracy.

Every catchment/watershed/basin is under-gauged or completely ungauged for general applications in the fields of hydrology, ecology, and geochemistry.  Gauges, as related to surface water, are essential for water resources assessment as they allow the estimation of water budgets, support estimation of erosion rates, and aid in calibrating/validating hydrological models for water resources management in general.  This research constructs an integrated, multi-process model for estimating long-term stream flow in an ephemeral, ungauged semi-arid basin, the Rio Salado in central New Mexico.  The basin drains 3,575 square kilometers and includes seasonal channel flow from summer thunderstorms.  The basin is presently without a stream gauge, although stream flow records near the outlet to the Rio Grande are available from late 1947 to mid 1984. The focus of this research is to develop a strategy for supporting the physical model with an appropriate space-time data for geometry, physical parameters, and forcing for the model using available a priori data.  The development of the hydrologic conceptual model is critical for constructing the model and verifying its plausibility of the a priori simulation.  The conceptual model defines a list of rules that the simulation must follow, such as geometry, architecture, channel flow regimes, and water budgets. As part of this research, a geodatabase was developed to support the integrated model using an appropriate data model. It includes terrain, soil and hydrogeologic properties, historical time series of leaf area index, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, etc.   The study has implemented MODHMS (developed by HydroGeologic Inc.), a physically-based and spatially-distributed model with variably saturated subsurface flow, overland flow, and channel flow. A priori data is found to sufficiently populate the conceptual model for this modeling study, even though significant knowledge gaps and data uncertainties are known to exist. Additional qualitative/quantitative data were obtained by the aid of remotely sensed images. ASTER day and night temperature and reflectance products were used to identify ephemeral and perennial stream reaches.  The concept is based on apparent thermal inertia (ATI=1-albedo/temp day- temp night).  Remote sensing improved the hydrogeologic conceptual model and it further suggests that groundwater from ephemeral reaches in the lower Rio Salado drains to the south beneath the watershed divide, and discharges to the Rio Grande at San Acacia.  The last phase of the study used MODHMS to simulate 50-year scenarios of climate and land cover change on the water resources of the Rio Salado, as well as recovery from drought 2000 - 2007 also compared to ASTER. The results show climatic differences from the headwater to the outlet, as well and hydrologic response from soil parameter changes, as likely results from land cover change.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4838], "author_name_tesi": "Beeson, Peter Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Beeson", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy", "Christopher J Duffy", "Patrick M Reed", "Thorsten Wagener", "Douglas Alan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Chair", "Patrick M Reed, Committee Member", "Thorsten Wagener, Committee Member", "Douglas Alan Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["apparent thermal inertia", "geodatabase", "integrated hydrologic modeling", "water resources", "semi-arid hydrology"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Optimization of Hydrologically Linked Hydropower Systems with Multiple Owners through Water Payments", "id": "26685", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11575", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Before the advent of deregulated electricity markets in the 1990\u2019s, hydroelectric power production schedules were typically coordinated with the schedules of other generating technologies by utility companies to meet expected regional demand. However, the growing adoption of deregulated markets requires the development of new methods for determining optimal utilization of hydroelectric resources. Much work has been performed regarding the optimization of cascaded hydropower systems owned and operated by single entities. However, these works fail to address the complexity involved in optimizing a cascaded system with owners along the same river. In those instances, each plant is limited to operate with whatever water flow the upstream plants choose to make available. In this situation, system optimal operation results in higher net system revenue than individual optimization of each plant with whatever water flow is available. However, such an optimal system solution must also result in lower net revenue for some owners compared to the value they would obtain through individual optimization. Hence, a novel methodology is proposed in which individual optimization naturally leads to system optimization through the use of iteratively determined water payments to direct the release of water toward a more optimal utilization. The proposed method alternates between dynamic programming for individual optimization and gradient analysis to determine and update hourly, location-specific water values for modified release. The sequence is repeated until there are no further additions or modifications to the payment schedule that results in increased total revenue. The water values are based upon local and downstream revenue gradients with respect to the flow rate released by the upstream facility during each time period. The method is applied in this thesis to a hydropower system consisting of three connected hydropower facilities, successfully increasing the total gross revenue of each installation.

Each of these factors has been extensively studied throughout the northeast, but to date no studies have attempted to understand their interactions and overall influence on forest understories in the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province of Pennsylvania. This dissertation separates the relative importance of each of these factors using several approaches. In chapter 1, I use single-species occupancy models to better understand species-specific responses to soil chemistry and removal from deer browsing. In chapter 2, I use generalized joint attribute models to assess biotic interactions in the context of environmental predictors that explained occupancy of individual species in chapter 1. Chapter 3 culminates my research by presenting short-term (3-year) results from a full-factorial experimental manipulation of plant communities using liming (to improve soil chemistry), fencing (to exclude deer browsing), and herbicide application (to remove competing vegetation). My results highlight the importance of soil chemistry in shaping occupancy of plant taxa and indicate these relationships likely alter competitive interactions between species. Exclusion of white-tailed deer had no effect on occupancy, abundance, or flowering status of deer-preferred plants after 2 years, suggesting slow or limited recovery of these taxa immediately after protection from browsing. Additionally, short-term results from the experimental manipulation indicate that liming has positive effects on forest herb abundance and flowering status, and that competitive release has been achieved in response to herbicide application for non-competing vegetation. Overall, this study demonstrates that soil chemistry and competing vegetation interact to shape plant community composition, however, results should be considered preliminary. Continuous monitoring of these communities is necessary to better understand long-term trends in response to treatment and whether shifts in community composition persist through time.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16321], "author_name_tesi": "Begley-Miller, Danielle Rae", "last_name_ssi": "Begley-Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Rae", "first_name_ssi": "Danielle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Duane Diefenbach", "Duane Diefenbach", "Eric Burkhart", "Patrick Drohan", "Alan Taylor", "Marc McDill"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Duane Diefenbach, Dissertation Advisor", "Duane Diefenbach, Committee Chair", "Eric Burkhart, Committee Member", "Patrick Drohan, Committee Member", "Alan Taylor, Outside Member", "Marc McDill, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plant community ecology", "white-tailed deer", "soil chemistry", "competing vegetation", "understory plants", "tree regeneration"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "SPECTROSCOPIC CHARACTERIZATION OF HIGH-VALENT INTERMEDIATES IN CYTOCHROME P450 AND OTHER HEME ENZYMES\n", "id": "8116", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5224", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Our group is particularly interested in the oxygen activation chemistry performed by heme peroxidases and cytochrome P450s. We set out to study compound II in cytochrome P450 and peroxidases because the identity of this intermediate is still the subject of debate.  Spectroscopic studies on compound II in peroxidases have indicated that these intermediates are Fe(IV)oxo species.  X-ray crystal structures, however, have indicated long Fe-O bonds for the ferryl intermediates in horseradish peroxidase, cytochrome c peroxidase, catalase, and myoglobin suggesting that these intermediates are protonated.  To verify the X-ray crystal structure results, we performed both M\u00f6ssbauer and resonance Raman spectroscopies on the same sample of ferryl myoglobin.  Our experiments clearly supported the existence of only the Fe(IV)oxo species from pH 3.5 to 8.5.  This result implies that the pKa of ferryl myoglobin is less than 3.5 and suggests that the long Fe-O bonds from the crystal structures are a consequence of photoreduction and does not represent the true nature of the intermediate.\nAlthough ferryl myoglobin was not protonated over a wide pH range, we have shown that compound II in cytochrome P450s is protonated at physiological pH.  The ferryl intermediates in P450BM3, P450cam, and CYP158 were studied by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy in conjunction with DFT calculations.  As was observed in chloroperoxidase compound II, a large quadrupole splitting (and an Fe(IV)-like isomer shift) was obtained for the three intermediates.  The experimental M\u00f6ssbauer parameters also agreed well with the theoretically determined parameters for protonated ferryl models.  High-field M\u00f6ssbauer measurements on P450BM3 compound II also confirmed this assignment because this intermediate had an S = 1 spin state.\nBased on previous experiments concerning the reaction of heme enzymes with peroxynitrite, it was evident that peroxynitrite could be used as an oxidant to generate ferryl intermediates.  In our quest to study the electronic structure of P450 compound II, we utilized peroxynitrite as an oxidant to generate P450BM3 compound II.  On characterization of this intermediate using UV/visible, resonance Raman, and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopies, as well as DFT calculations, we determined that the PN intermediate in P450BM3 was not a ferryl intermediate, but rather an S = 0, ferric nitrosyl species.  We studied the reaction of peroxynitrite with five other thiolate-ligated heme proteins and found similar results; however, when the reaction was performed with horseradish peroxidase and cytochrome c peroxidase (histidine-ligated heme proteins) a ferryl intermediate was found. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5202], "author_name_tesi": "Behan, Rachel Koren", "last_name_ssi": "Behan", "middle_name_ssi": "Koren", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Thomas Green", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Carsten Krebs", "Patrick Cirino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Thomas Green, Committee Chair", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Member", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "Patrick Cirino, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ferryl", "heme", "cytochrome P450", "peroxynitrite"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Verbal and Imaginal Worry on Physiological and Subjective Functioning During Interoceptive Exposure", "id": "6858", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1853", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous research (Borkovec & Hu, 1990; Borkovec, Lyonfields, Wiser, & Deihl, 1993; Hazlett-Stevens & Borkovec, 2001; Peasley-Miklus & Vrana, 2000) has documented the inhibitory effects of worry on cardiovascular reactivity to subsequently presented fear-relevant stimuli.

Specifically, this project seeks to define the biochemistry between a circulating melanoma cell and an adherent neutrophil (PMN, in particular), and how the forces acting on the melanoma cell from the surrounding fluid, ability of the cell to deform, and adhesion to the PMN affect the mechanisms leading to melanoma cell metastasis.  Metastasis is the process by which a cancerous cell leaves a primary tumor site somewhere in the body, travels through the vasculature, and eventually leaves the vasculature to start a secondary tumor at a distant site.  To attempt to define the factors enabling a melanoma cell to metastasize, this biochemistry simulation tool will define the adhesion molecules present on the melanoma and PMN cell surfaces, and calculate their interactions as the melanoma cell moves past the PMN in a flow field.  Based on the proximity of the two cells, it may be possible for molecular bonds to form, which apply an adhesive force to the tumor cell.  Within the structure of a computational fluid dynamics solver, information is available to define many locations across each cell surface, where individual molecules can be simulated.  Within this work, a model will be defined for determining the biochemical rates of reactions between individual molecules, based on their local individual characteristics.  All models and computational routines will be made robust enough to allow for future modifications and additional considerations to be incorporated into the model, including an unlimited number of adhesion molecule types to considered, and the ability to redefine the values of parameters to represent different cell types, rather than specifically melanoma cell and neutrophils.  For the sake of this model, it is assumed that the neutrophil has already adhered to the endothelial surface, and therefore selectins (which aid in the initial interaction between white blood cells and the endothelium) were not simulated.  The melanoma cell in the model expresses ICAM-1 molecules on its surface, and the PMN expresses the B-2 integrins LFA-1 and Mac-1.  The PMN is fully rigid, but the melanoma cell is able to move with six degrees of freedom.  Computational fluid dynamics is performed using the in-house developed software NPHASE, in which routines describing the biochemistry have been embedded.  The biochemistry routines contain both adhesion, representing the ability of molecules to bond and adhere the cells to each other, and repulsion, which represents microvilli, which are not explicitly modeled, pushing the cells apart.

The level of detail required to accurately describe the dynamic behavior of the system at smaller length scales cannot be provided by solely using a description from larger length-scales, whereas describing larger length-scale behavior using descriptions from smaller length-scale models would be infeasible due to the associated computational overhead required.  Motivated by the above, multiscale models, which combine larger and smaller-length scale models that are intimately connected, have been developed.\n \nContinuous pressure on profit margins has resulted in the desire to improve efficiency to reduce costs, resulting in the need for optimization procedures.  Increases in computational efficiency and optimization strategies have allowed for optimization of complex materials processing problems requiring multiscale models to be pursued.  Multiscale optimization of such processes, however, is a problem with three levels of hierarchy in computation.  In the lower hierarchy, potentially computationally intensive simulations may need to be performed to model the properties of interest at both smaller and larger length-scales.  If bi-directional information is required, iterative convergence at all scales may be required; this serves as the intermediate hierarchy.  Finally, optimization (gradient-based and black-box) algorithms require several function evaluations, which in this case is at the top of the hierarchy.  With the need to perform numerous simulations, solving a multiscale optimization problem could quickly become intractable.  One promising idea to circumvent this computational intractability is to obtain the necessary information from linear interpolations whenever possible instead of using costly simulations.  This is the basic idea behind in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT).  Initially used in solving combustion chemistry problems, ISAT has been subsequently extended to stochastic systems and combined with black-box optimization for maximizing uniformity and minimizing surface roughness in a gallium nitride thin-film.\n\nImplementation and further refinement of these methods is investigated by modeling the deposition of a thin-film consisting of alternating gallium arsenide and aluminum arsenide layers (GaAs/AlAs.)  This example uses macroscale \u201cinputs\u201d from the reactor description to determine properties such as temperature, flow rates, and concentrations, and mesoscale kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to measure the previously characterized interfacial properties of the film.  The objectives of this problem are to minimize the interfacial step-densities between GaAs and AlAs layers, while also minimizing the temperature and the time spent in-between depositing species (termed annealing time,) as well the macroscopic objective of reducing spatial non-uniformity.  This problem only involves adsorption and therefore only requires uni-directional flow of information from the macroscale level to the mesoscale level.  Based on this model, we explore the methodology needed to accelerate the computational process by implementing ISAT for each optimization trial.  Using this methodology, a multiscale model for a GaAs/AlAs thin-film deposition process was developed for optimization of the interfacial properties, and used within an efficient optimization framework to identify optimal steady-state process conditions for the process.  Finally, by implementing this methodology using the Nelder-Mead and Hooke-Jeeves pattern search algorithms, we were able to identify a range of optimal process conditions for minimizing the time with no organometallic flux at the wafer surface and for no organometallic flux at the inlet.  With our methodology, we did so while reducing computation time and balancing improvements in step density and thickness uniformity with preferred processing conditions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1055], "author_name_tesi": "Behrens, Christopher Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Behrens", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Antonios Armaou", "Antonios Armaou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Antonios Armaou, Thesis Advisor", "Antonios Armaou, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["multiscale methods", "optimization", "complex materials processing", "computational efficiency"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Extending the Functional Theory of Communication and Decision-making in the Virtual World:  A Study of the Relationship of Modality and Cultural Background to Satisfaction, Creativity, and Decision Quality in Virtual Team Interaction", "id": "26766", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11844", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In today's globally interconnected world, work is accomplished across time and space, bringing together different expertise, cultures, values, and ideas.

This research attempted to integrate these disciplines in such a way as to provide a better understanding of how communication processes in these sorts of teams is affected by culture and technology.\n\nThis study investigated how the Functional Theory of group communication operated in the intercultural, virtual world.  It assessed how various technologies (text and audio) interacted with cultural issues to affect the process and behavior during the communication process, as well as key outcomes of creativity, quality of decision, and satisfaction of the participants.  Chinese and U.S. dyads participated in a decision-making exercise using text or audio and answered a questionnaire about the process to determine satisfaction.  In addition, the dialogue was coded and analyzed to determine whether and, if so, how the dyads followed the steps required by Functional Theory.  Finally, the communication was analyzed by a panel of experts to judge creativity and quality of decision.  These results were then cross checked with satisfaction data to help reveal which technology in intercultural dyads yields the best outcomes (creativity, quality of decision and satisfaction) and how the Functional Theory applies.\n\nThe results indicated that in the intercultural context, teams following the five steps required by the Functional Theory had the highest levels of creativity and quality of decisions, although the satisfaction levels were higher in dyads in the audio condition in which the sequence addressed by Functional Theory was applied.  The dyads that did not follow the sequence suggested by Functional Theory had the lowest levels of creativity and quality, whether in the text or audio condition.  The Chinese reported higher levels of satisfaction overall than did their U.S. counterparts, although the U.S. participants dominated discussion in all cases.  In terms of the five functions encompassed by the theory, the audio dyads spent relatively more time on Functions 2 and 4 to develop mutual understanding and criteria for decision making than did the text dyads, which were more likely to focus on Functions 3 (developing alternatives) and 5 (making a decision).  Gender analysis yielded interesting results.  In the audio condition, U.S. females dominated the discussion related to Function 2, whereas U.S. males did so in the case of utterances related to Function 5.  In same-sex gender pairings, greater emphasis was placed on Function 2, and in mixed gender pairings on Function 5.

Regression analysis found minimal relationships between RFI scores and HEDIS results, suggesting that the scores had limited ability to discriminate plan quality.  On average, plans in both the QIA and RFI datasets realized improvements in key diabetes indicators.  However, it is not feasible to determine how much of this improvement can be attributed to the QI or DM initiatives.

The gene responsible for encoding SERT is solute carrier 6 family A4 (SLC6A4). A number of different genetic polymorphisms are hypothesized to regulate SERT function and expression, including the 43-base-pair insertion/deletion promoter polymorphism called the serotonin transporter linked-polymorphic region (5 HTTLPR). Being coded for in both peripheral cells and the brain by the same gene, SERT is the primary target for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class of antidepressants and has been implicated in the etiology and treatment of a number of anxiety and depressive disorders. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent disorder that is estimated to have an economic cost of approximately 83 billion dollars annually in the United States. While there are a number of effective treatments for MDD, not every treatment works for every patient. Recent studies have shown that initial SSRI treatment is successful in only ~30% of patients. Furthermore, patients undergoing SSRI treatment often require a long duration of treatment (4-8 weeks) to achieve remission. With a low percentage of treatment success and delayed efficacy, a peripheral biomarker for treatment prediction would be highly advantageous. A biomarker is defined as an individual-specific factor or feature that delineates the presence of a disease or is predictive of treatment response. Pharmacogenetic studies relating SERT polymorphisms to MDD susceptibility and treatment response have yielded mixed results. To date, no peripheral biomarkers for predicting successful treatment of depression have been elucidated. Blood consists of a heterogeneous population of cells including erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets. While platelet SERT expression is well characterized, lymphocyte SERT expression is still debated. Lymphocytes that have been transformed with Epstein-Barr Virus (lymphoblasts; LCLs) for use in cell culture, however, have been shown to express SERT. In this thesis, we explore the use of peripheral blood cells in predicting SSRI treatment response in patients with MDD. First, we developed a flow cytometry assay using the fluorescent SERT substrate APP+ for assessing SERT function in mixed blood cell populations. Using this assay, we demonstrate that platelets, not lymphocytes, contribute to the majority of SERT function measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples. Next, we evaluated the use of LCLs for studying SERT function with respect to complex SERT genotype. We report that LCLs express SERT, but overall SERT function is minimal. Third, we investigated using cell-phone based fluorescence microscopy to measure platelet SERT function. This novel approach has the potential to revolutionize the translatability of fluorescence-based assays as individuals will be able to make functional SERT measurements at home instead of having to access expensive clinical instrumentation. Finally, we conclude with results from a pilot study using electrochemical techniques to measure SERT function in PBCs from individuals diagnosed with MDD who are undergoing antidepressant treatment. We find that SERT function is highly variable across normal and depressed individuals, with serotonin uptake in PBCs slightly lower in the depressed population on the whole. Furthermore, we detect SSRI-specific treatment-related decreases in PBC SERT function as early as one week after initiating treatment with S-citalopram. Based on this pilot study, we have formulated a central hypothesis for a large-scale clinical trial. We theorize that we can predict which individuals will ultimately respond to SSRIs based on pretreatment SERT function in platelets.

Each participant (n = 44) received three treatments and completed four improvisation assessments over a 22-day period.  The three treatment periods, each lasting six days, involved a rotation through the following: Treatment A \u2013 introductory improvisation instruction with no reflection, Treatment B \u2013 improvisation instruction with collaborative reflection and Treatment C \u2013 improvisation maintenance with no reflection.  Presentation order of the treatment sessions differed for each group to control for order effect.  \n    A three-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test the equality of means by comparing the multiple participant means over the four assessments.

Aside from being pervasive and persistent nuisances, both traffic congestion and agricultural water pollution are the consequences of missing markets that result in negative externalities. Effective and politically acceptable solutions have been illusive for both. This dissertation presents three essays that address the design of policies for externalities using traffic congestion and agricultural water pollution as contexts. \t\nThe first essay initiates a lab experiment of a market entry game (MEG). MEG models create a setting where many individuals must simultaneously choose between two options. One of the options has a large potential but uncertain payoff.  The other has a certain payoff that is independent of the others\u2019 choices. The first goal of this MEG is to test if simple policies, such as entry fees or subsidies, can be designed to induce optimal entry. To perform this test, the canonical MEG is revised by introducing uniform entry fees -- entry fees that are equal to all entrants. The second goal of the essay is to explore whether capacity uncertainty affects the choices.  A new treatment in which market capacity is introduced as a random variable is used to achieve this goal. This essay presents to two main findings. On one hand, uniformity proved to be effective by decreasing entry, although entry was statistically different from that theoretically predicted for almost all the sub treatments. The second finding is that average number of entrants is not affected by the uncertainty of the market capacity.  \nThe second essay presents an experimental test of a Pay-for-performance (PFP) mechanisms conducted with students and farmers. PFP are a class of policy instruments designed to increase (decrease) private voluntary provision of limited amounts of public goods (bads). This paper presents an artefactual field experiment conducted with farmers and students to examine the effects of strategic uncertainty on participation and efficiency of PFP mechanism. In this paper, we present an artefactual field experiment conducted with farmers and students. Subjects choose whether to participate in a 2-by-2 Bayesian game with private values (PVPG). Payoffs for those who choose to participate depend on the private value and others\u2019 participation choices, while the payoffs from nonparticipation are certain. Two PVPG experimental tasks with different feedback conditions and two treatments with High and Low participation payments were played by every subject. Participation was increased by High participation payments but less frequently than theoretical predictions. Subjects coordinated the efficient action profile at frequencies larger than those predicted by theory. Farmer and student groups presented similar participation levels but farmers with the same risk aversion profile as students chose to participate less frequently. This essay reveals the limits of generalizing the outcomes of the findings achieved in lab experiments with students to other populations of subjects. \nFinally, the third essay describes a naturally occurring field experiment in Lima, Peru to assess if and how taxi drivers transfer congestion costs to customers. The experiment involved collaborators hailing taxis and negotiating fares at different times of day between specific locations with alternative route choices as treatments. A total of 1100 trips were conducted following the same bargaining protocol and the randomly assigned route treatments, from which taxi fares, travel times and routing decisions were collected. Results show that taxi drivers request fares that discriminate between routes that take longer travel times, but do not request enough to prevent earnings per minute from decreasing. Fares for congested trips are one third lower than metered fares constructed estimates. Insufficiency of fares increment during peak collaborators hours could be generated by either highly competitive market conditions, failure to perceive longer travel times or a combination of both.  Customer waiting time and proportions of taxis over total traffic support the idea that drivers might perceive peak traffic hours as a competitive market therefore only partially transferring the cost of congestion into fares.  These results highlight that unregulated taxi systems are successful at generating incentives for taxi drivers to make optimal routing decisions.  However, they fail to improve traffic miscoordination because taxi driver misperceptions are left uncorrected. Real time routing and taxi market information technology could be used to improve the overall use of traffic network capacity.\nTheoretical models of diverse problems, such as traffic congestion, use of common pool resources, and entry in newly created markets, share common characteristics. For example voluntary participation in new markets and traffic routing decisions are both essentially binary decision problems in which subjects can learn to coordinate by interacting but they might also fail to coordinate.  Experimental economic research on binary decision choice settings has found that individuals usually behave in noisy ways, not predicted by theory.  The theoretical models in this dissertation are used just to construct the framework guiding the experimental design.  The experiments allow us to observe how subjects act when facing these problems. Finally, the econometric analysis allows us to test if theoretical implications are satisfied by the observed behavior.\nThe dissertation combines of three types of experiments, ranging from traditional laboratory experiments to naturally occurring field experiments, allowed me to observe how different experimental methods, with different subject samples and different degrees of control over external variables, could be used as tool to study different markets with externalities. This dissertation highlights how a combination of different methodologies, conducted over different pool of subjects, be it students, farmers or taxi drivers, should be used to better understand how individuals perceive and choose to act when the actions of other subjects affect their earnings. \n \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8394], "author_name_tesi": "Bejarano, Hernan D", "last_name_ssi": "Bejarano", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Hernan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle", "James Samuel Shortle", "David Gerard Abler", "Richard C Ready", "N Edward Coulson", "Elena Katok"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle, Dissertation Advisor", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Chair", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "Richard C Ready, Committee Member", "N Edward Coulson, Special Member", "Elena Katok, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Externalities", "Environmental Markets", "Behavioral Economics", "Experimental Economics", "Game Theory", "Bargaining", "Mechanism Design"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Modular Optimization Code Package:MOZAIK", "id": "8729", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3351", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation addresses the development of a modular optimization code package,\nMOZAIK, for geometric shape optimization problems in nuclear engineering\napplications. MOZAIK\u2019s first mission, determining the optimal shape of the D2O\nmoderator tank for the current and new beam tube configurations for the Penn\nState Breazeale Reactor\u2019s (PSBR) beam port facility, is used to demonstrate its\ncapabilities and test its performance.\nMOZAIK was designed as a modular optimization sequence including three\nprimary independent modules: the initializer, the physics and the optimizer, each\nhaving a specific task. By using fixed interface blocks among the modules, the\ncode attains its two most important characteristics: generic form and modularity.\nThe benefit of this modular structure is that the contents of the modules can\nbe switched depending on the requirements of accuracy, computational efficiency,\nor compatibility with the other modules. Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s discrete\nordinates transport code TORT was selected as the transport solver in the\nphysics module of MOZAIK, and two different optimizers, Min-max and Genetic\nAlgorithms(GA), were implemented in the optimizer module of the code package.\nA distributed memory parallelism was also applied to MOZAIK via MPI (Message\nPassing Interface) to execute the physics module concurrently on a number of\nprocessors for various states in the same search. Moreover, dynamic scheduling was\nenabled to enhance load balance among the processors while running MOZAIK\u2019s\nphysics module thus improving the parallel speedup and efficiency. In this way,\nthe total computation time consumed by the physics module is reduced by a factor\nclose to M, where M is the number of processors. This capability also encourages\nthe use of MOZAIK for shape optimization problems in nuclear applications because\nmany traditional codes related to radiation transport do not have parallel\nexecution capability.\nA set of computational models based on the existing beam port configuration of the Penn State Breazeale Reactor(PSBR) was designed to test and validate the\ncode package in its entirety, as well as its modules separately. The selected physics\ncode, TORT, and the requisite data such as source distribution, cross-sections,\nand angular quadratures were comprehensively tested with these computational\nmodels. The modular feature and the parallel performance of the code package\nwere also examined using these computational models. Another outcome of these\ncomputational models is to provide the necessary background information for determining\nthe optimal shape of the D2O moderator tank for the new beam tube\nconfigurations for the PSBR\u2019s beam port facility.\nThe first mission of the code package was completed successfully by determining\nthe optimal tank shape which was sought for the current beam tube configuration\nand two new beam tube configurations for the PSBR\u2019s beam port facility. The performance\nof the new beam tube configurations and the current beam tube configuration\nwere evaluated with the new optimal tank shapes determined by MOZAIK.\nFurthermore, the performance of the code package with the two different optimization\nstrategies were analyzed showing that while GA is capable of achieving\nhigher thermal beam intensity for a given beam tube setup, Min-max produces an\noptimal shape that is more amenable to machining and manufacturing.\nThe optimal D2O moderator tank shape determined by MOZAIK with the current\nbeam port configuration improves the thermal neutron beam intensity at the\nbeam port exit end by 9.5%. Similarly, the new tangential beam port configuration\n(beam port near the core interface) with the optimal moderator tank shape\ndetermined by MOZAIK improves the thermal neutron beam intensity by a factor\nof 1.4 compared to the existing beam port configuration (with the existing D2O\nmoderator tank). Another new beam port configuration, radial beam tube configuration,\nwith the optimal moderator tank shape increases the thermal neutron\nbeam intensity at the beam tube exit by a factor of 1.8.

In this dissertation, we develop different algorithms for first and second steps. For the first step, three different identification algorithms (identification with Lasso, Parsimonious model identification of single input single output systems, and Parsimonious identification of multi input multi output systems) are proposed which can utilize intensive longitudinal behavioral data to identify model parameters, interpolate the missing data, and quantify the uncertainties in the model. Then, for the second step, we provide a detailed step-by-step explanation of how control engineering methods can be used to design a robust adaptive intensive intervention. Finally, the methods are evaluated via simulation.\n   The performance of identification algorithms is demonstrated with synthetic behavioral data. The simulation results illustrate how the designed robust adaptive intensive intervention can produce improved outcomes with less treatment by providing treatment only when it is needed. The methods are robust to model uncertainties as well as to the influence of unobserved causes. As a result, these new methods can be used to design robust adaptive interventions that function effectively yet reduce participant burden. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10957], "author_name_tesi": "Bekiroglu, Korkut ", "last_name_ssi": "Bekiroglu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Korkut", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Minghui Zhu", "Kenneth Jenkins", "Stephanie Trea Lanza", "Necdet S Aybat"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Dissertation Advisor", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Chair", "Minghui Zhu, Committee Member", "Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member", "Stephanie Trea Lanza, Committee Member", "Necdet S Aybat, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adaptive Intervention", "Robust Treatment Design", "System Identification", "Atomic Norm", "min-max Structured Robust Optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Adipose-derived Signals Induce Hyperplasia of the Mammary Epithelium in Response to 10e12z Conjugated Linoleic Acid Initiated Adipose Dysfunction", "id": "9378", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "683", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) are a group of dietary fatty acids that are widely marketed as weight loss supplements.

COX-2 was not directly responsible for 10e12z CLA-induced alterations in lipid storage and differentiation, but it did induce epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) ligands in a prostaglandin F2&#945; (PGF2&#945;)-dependent manner. Inflammation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and activation of EGF receptors are consistent with activation of proliferative signaling that occurs in breast cancer.  Therefore, the influence of 10e12z CLA-induced adipocyte-derived factors on the mammary epithelium was examined.  Wild type mice fed 10e12z CLA exhibited increased ECM remodeling and decreased mammary adipose content.  Proliferation in the mammary gland was also increased two-fold by these treatments as measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into DNA.  10e12z treated adipocytes in vitro recapitulated both the increased proliferation and invasion seen in vitro.  Gene expression profiles of mammary glands from mice fed 10e12z CLA matched profiles of adipocytes, but not mammary epithelial cells, or macrophages grown in vitro.  These results demonstrated that 10e12z CLA altered the expression of adipokines in the mammary fat pad, and that these factors govern the response of other tissues to 10e12z CLA.  Although this isomer is reported to possess anti-carcinogenic activities the results of these investigations demonstrate that 10e12z CLA exerts maked effects on adipose-epithelial interactions and therefore, caution is advised with regard to consumption of this fatty acid as a dietary supplement.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [678], "author_name_tesi": "Belda, Benjamin  John", "last_name_ssi": "Belda", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vanden Heuvel", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Curtis John Omiecinski", "Gary H Perdew", "Raghu Sinha", "Andrea Marie Mastro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vanden Heuvel, Dissertation Advisor", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Chair", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Committee Member", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Raghu Sinha, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adipose", "epithelium", "COX-2", "invasion", "PGF2-alpha", "proliferation", "Dietary fatty acid"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Rhetorical Verse: Persuasion in Early Twentieth-century American Poetry", "id": "22428", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10145", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Between 1900 and 1940 in America, rhetorical verse\u2014poetry with explicit hortatory goals and persuasive ends most often responding to specific political exigencies\u2014became a popular rhetorical tool of the political left.  However, through a number of cultural, political, and academic phenomena in the 1940s and 1950s, the artistic status of poetry would come to far overshadow its persuasive potential.  As a result, poetry became the domain of the literary critic, leaving a robust tradition of rhetorical verse in the early decades of the twentieth century unstudied by historians of rhetoric.\n\nThis project traces an early twentieth-century American tradition of rhetorical verse by examining the poetic response to three controversial court cases: the trial of Arturo Giovannitti in 1912, the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1918, and the trial of the Scottsboro boys in 1931.  Approaching a combination of archival and published material from a historiographical perspective, I contend that the poetry which responds to these trials represents an important example of how the political left often turned to rhetorical verse as a medium for their persuasive aims.  Furthermore, I contend that the poems surrounding these trials display common features of rhetorical verse such as simplistic aesthetics, heavy end rhymes, and shared schemes and tropes drawn from the rhetoric of the labor movement.  Nevertheless, as this project works to establish these commonalities, it also examines how rhetor-poets chose to deviate from these characteristics and how that effected the persuasive ability of the poems.\n\nAs a result of its aesthetic simplicity, much rhetorical verse can be and has been dismissed as \u201cbad\u201d poetry.  However, reading these poems as rhetorical texts opens rich new ways of rehabilitating a tradition of verse that balances artistic and persuasive qualities in a complex manner.  In sum, I use a rhetorical historiographic approach to examine an understudied tradition of rhetorical verse as a major form of leftist rhetoric in early twentieth-century America.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9836], "author_name_tesi": "Belk, John Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Belk", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheryl Jean Glenn", "Cheryl Jean Glenn", "Debra Hawhee", "John Edmond Marsh", "Stephen Howard Browne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheryl Jean Glenn, Dissertation Advisor", "Cheryl Jean Glenn, Committee Chair", "Debra Hawhee, Committee Member", "John Edmond Marsh, Committee Member", "Stephen Howard Browne, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rhetoric", "Poetry", "Early Twentieth-Century America", "Political Left", "Judicial Rhetoric"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Exploration into the relationship between work and play for employed adults", "id": "27159", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12003", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study focuses on the relationship between work engagement and play for employed adults.

Instead, intrinsic motivation, positive affect, and need-supply fit were the strongest predictors of work engagement. Post hoc analyses found tentative support for a relationship between playfulness and work engagement for certain subgroups (e.g. sample gathered from Facebook and participants who worked in management and administration positions). The analysis also found that, contrary to theory, playfulness was only correlated to one of the two intrinsic motivation subscales.

Retention of the quaternary ammonium salt bretylium showed minimal influence of ion-exchange mechanisms on the C18 phase, however a significant influence of ion-exchange mechanisms was observed for both PFPP and bare silica.  These findings suggest ion-exchange mechanisms dominate retention of basic analytes in the high acetonitrile realm on PFPP.  The PFPP stationary phase exhibits a substantial increase in effects of ionized surface silanol groups compared to the alkyl phase despite similar surface coverage.  Retention of some basic analytes on a PFPP phase was enhanced relative to retention on silica alone, and implicates other dispersive interactions that might be exploited for selectivity different from either alkyl phases or silica alone.\nNMR spectroscopy is a rapid and useful technique for the determining pKa values of solutes in HPLC mobile phases.  The variation of chemical shift data for protons in the vicinity of a basic nitrogen atom as a function of the medium pH can be related through the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to estimate analyte pKa values.  The present study demonstrates that one can not assume that bases are protonated in high acetonitrile content even if the aqueous pH is adjusted to less than two pKa units from the literature pKa value. The pKa values for the basic analytes were shown to decrease by approximately one pKa unit in approximately 90 v/v% acetonitrile from their aqueous value.  Improved prediction and manipulation of HPLC selectivity results from more accurate knowledge of the analyte degree of dissociation values.

It takes the example of the Spanish introduction of gristmill technology and related wheat/bread production and water management practices to Lima, Peru during the early colonial period (1535-1700). Mills are analyzed in a historical political ecological and landscape perspective; they are conceptualized not as isolated mechanical devices, but rather as components of extensive water management systems, far-reaching grain markets and economies, and broad social networks of resource access. They were physical sites of intersection between flows of water, grain, and people. One remarkable archival collection was the main source used to trace these flows. The Libros de Cabildos de Lima (LCL) contain the records of Lima\u2019s city council, the Cabildo, over the course of the entire colonial period. The Cabildo was the branch of colonial government in charge of regulating gristmills, distributing water rights, and provisioning the city with grain. Consequently, the LCL include a nearly unbroken record of the Cabildo\u2019s governance strategies for mills, water, and grain across the entire period of interest. Cabildo data was compiled, analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively, and mapped. This dissertation is divided into three major case studies on mills, water, and wheat, each one exploring a different aspect of Technology-Flows-Governance relationships. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that technology, the creation and growth of urban spaces (and their related environmental and resource flows), and the governance practices associated with these technologies and flows contributed significantly to the socio-ecological and landscape changes of the Columbian Exchange period. It argues that these features, and their change over time, are vital to fresh understandings of colonialism and environment, while the general approach can be applied in diverse geographic and historical contexts.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8838], "author_name_tesi": "Bell, Martha Gwenn", "last_name_ssi": "Bell", "middle_name_ssi": "Gwenn", "first_name_ssi": "Martha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Stephen Zimmerer", "Karl Stephen Zimmerer", "Deryck William Holdsworth", "Brian Hastings King", "James P Mc Carthy", "David Lee Webster", "Brenton Yarnal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Stephen Zimmerer, Dissertation Advisor", "Karl Stephen Zimmerer, Committee Chair", "Deryck William Holdsworth, Committee Member", "Brian Hastings King, Committee Member", "James P Mc Carthy, Committee Member", "David Lee Webster, Committee Member", "Brenton Yarnal, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["environmental governance", "historical political ecology", "environmental flows", "food technology", "gristmills", "Colonial Peru"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Wetting of Two-Dimensional Physically Patterned Surfaces", "id": "13061msb5390", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13061", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An understanding of wetting phenomena is important, in part, due to the many practical applications of controlled wetting. Some of the most exciting applications involve superhydrophobic surfaces, on which water droplets exhibit contact angles larger than 150 degrees and contact angle hysteresis less than 10 degrees. These surfaces are notable for their low-drag, antifouling, and self-cleaning properties, among others. Wetting is known to be affected by both the chemistry and the physical patterning of a surface, with the chemistry affecting what is called the intrinsic contact angle, which is the contact angle displayed by a droplet on a smooth flat surface made of the given material. To date, the largest intrinsic contact angle observed for any material is only about 120 degrees, which does not confer superhydrophobicity. Thus, physical patterning is a crucial component of any superhydrophobic surface. Interestingly, many natural examples of superhydrophobic surfaces exist, with one of the most notable being the lotus leaf. In designing such surfaces, scientists have turned to the natural examples for inspiration, and have found that most natural examples have multiple (usually two) scales of roughness, commonly referred to as hierarchical roughness. Though hierarchical roughness is ubiquitous in the superhydrophobic surfaces of the natural world, its precise role in conferring superhydrophobicity has so far remained elusive.\n\nIn this work, we develop a thermodynamic model to study the wetting of two-dimensional physically patterned surfaces. Past models that have been developed for this purpose often make several assumptions: the drop must be much larger than the surface features while simultaneously being small enough that the effects of gravity are negligible. Many of these models ultimately rely on the older Cassie and Wenzel models, which themselves make assumptions about the drop size relative to the surface features---namely that the drop is again much larger than the surface features. In this work, we relax these assumptions. We begin by investigating the role of hierarchical roughness (specifically dual-scale roughness) in affecting static contact angles by making no assumptions other than that the effect of gravity is negligible, though the surface features are allowed to be similar in size to the droplet. By investigating phase diagrams of contact angles as a function of surface feature parameters, we find that the nanoscale roughness in hierarchical roughness serves mainly to amplify the intrinsic contact angle of the macroscale roughness, thereby allowing for large contact angles on relatively low aspect ratio macroscale structures. Next, we lift the assumption of the negligible effect of gravity, and consider arbitrarily-sized droplets relative to the surface features, for which the effect of gravity is non-negligible. From this, we find that the effect of gravity is primarily to shift the boundary between the Cassie and Wenzel modes in the phase diagram. Other effects of gravity on contact angles occur mainly when the drops are similar in size to the surface features. Further, by comparing predictions of a circular cap model with a deformable cap model, we find that the gravitationally-induced deformations mainly affect the contact angle, with the equilibrium wetting configurations predicted by both models being otherwise quite similar.\n\nBoth of these studies reinforce the idea that pinning effects become less important when the surface features become much smaller than the drop size. We next explore this regime, in which the Cassie and Wenzel models become valid, in more detail. Specifically, we use perturbation theory to derive a correction to the Wenzel equation to properly account for the volume of liquid stored in the grooves which was not considered in the original derivation. By considering both the two- and three-dimensional cases, we find an intuitive explanation for the two-dimensional correction which unfortunately breaks down in the three-dimensional case, due to an unexpected factor of two which arises in the first-order correction term. Finally, we investigate the roles of physical patterning on contact angle hysteresis, and we conclude by discussing potential future directions for this research.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12896], "author_name_tesi": "Bell, Michael Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Bell", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kristen Ann Fichthorn", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn", "Ali Borhan", "Milton Walter Cole", "Francesco Costanzo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Dissertation Advisor", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Chair", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Milton Walter Cole, Committee Member", "Francesco Costanzo, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Wetting", "Hierarchical Roughness", "Wenzel", "Cassie", "Contact Angle", "Thermodynamic Model", "Superhydrophobic"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Teaching Social Skills to Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders: Efficacy of a Social Learning Approach\n\n", "id": "12476", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2894", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As the number of children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is rising, there is increasing demand for evidence-based interventions that are efficient and easy to implement in school settings.

More men than women smoke, but women are less likely than men to quit. Sex differences in smoking behavior contribute to sex differences in cessation, with men more likely to use cigarettes for the pharmacological effects of nicotine and women more likely to smoke for the non-pharmacological effects of cigarettes, in response to learned cues. Brain function is one mechanism underlying these behavioral sex differences, as it is altered by the psychoactive effects of nicotine and facilitates cue-learning. Little is known, however, about the influence of resting state brain function, or intrinsic brain activity that occurs in the absence of a goal-directed task and marks neuropsychiatric disease, on sex differences in smoking behavior. The goal of the current study was to delineate sex differences in the resting state connectivity of three brain networks underlying smoking (default mode, attention, reward), and to determine how sex moderates links from network connectivity to smoking behavior (nicotine dependence, quitting self-efficacy). This goal was accomplished by examining the functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral data of 50 regular adult smokers (23 women). Results revealed sex differences favoring women in connectivity within the default mode network and between the default mode and reward networks. Results also suggest that women have difficulty quitting because of a reward network paradox: For women but not for men, increased connectivity within the reward network predicted both increased nicotine dependence and increased quitting self-efficacy, two behaviors that have opposite relations to cessation. Future work should investigate links between connectivity within the reward network and smoking behavior using larger samples that include non-smoking controls and alternative metrics of network connectivity.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9875], "author_name_tesi": "Beltz, Adriene Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Beltz", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Adriene", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sheri A.

The PZT fibers are embedded in an epoxy matrix to give the composite more flexibility and more ruggedness.  AFC utilizes interdigitated electrodes (IDE) along the direction of the fibers resulting in a d33-mode actuation (actuation parallel to the poling direction), which is advantageous since the d33 coefficient is almost twice the value of the d31 coefficient (actuation perpendicular to the poling direction). The development of AFCs offers a great potential for advancing structural health monitoring techniques and active vibration control and suppression thanks to their flexibility and lightweight, however AFCs piezoelectric performance is still not comparable to that of PZT transducers, where their effective actuation coefficient is 120 compared to 400x10-12 m/V for the bulk PZT. In addition, while in use, AFCs could be subjected to simultaneous mechanical loading, extreme environments, and moderate to high electric fields, leading to nonlinear and inelastic behaviors, strong coupling between various physical properties, and complex failure mechanisms. Moreover, AFCs have more than 50% volume content of polymer; the viscoelastic effect of the polymer matrix on the overall response of AFC can be significant especially at elevated temperatures. The effects of time and temperature on the mechanical and electrical characterization of AFCs have not been studied. Modeling these phenomena for the AFCs is an important step in redesigning them and obtaining reliable properties. However, there is not an available model that takes into consideration combined physical phenomena like time-dependence and piezoelectric non-linearity. In addition many models assume uniform electric field or perfect contact between the fibers and the electrodes, which neglects the effects of any IDE geometry parameters and electrical property of the matrix. \nThe overall objective of this proposed dissertation is to use a combination of experimental and numerical approaches to examine the overall behavior of the AFC with the goals of 1) quantifying the impact of the constituent properties (polymer matrix and PZT fiber) on coupled response of AFCs, 2) conducting an exhaustive parametric study focused on design of AFCs, and 3) building a model which takes into consideration non-uniform electric field behavior, non-linear behavior and time-dependent properties. \nMechanical, electrical and electro-mechanical experimental characterization of AFC and its constituents at various temperatures and loading rates were carried out to bring to light the behavior of AFC, including the time and temperature dependence of some of its properties. Numerical parametric study on the design of the composites that takes into effect the IDE geometry and matrix dielectric constant and modulus is conducted. In addition, the experimental work quantified the non-linear and time-dependent responses of the AFCs, which are then included in the developed model. One outcome of this study is to propose a re-design of an improved AFC device with better electro-mechanical coupling response.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10716], "author_name_tesi": "Ben Atitallah, Hassene ", "last_name_ssi": "Ben Atitallah", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hassene", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zoubeida Ounaies", "Zoubeida Ounaies", "Clive A Randall", "Mary I Frecker", "Charles E Bakis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zoubeida Ounaies, Dissertation Advisor", "Zoubeida Ounaies, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Member", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Piezoelectricity", "composites", "Temperature dependence", "AFC", "Viscoelasticity"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Urban Street Signs in the Linguistic Landscape of Tunisia: Tensions in Policy, Representation, and Attitudes\n", "id": "10966", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5515", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This ethnographic study of linguistic landscape (LL) (Landry & Bourhis, 1997), describes the urban multilingual practices of Tunisia as evidenced by its policy statements, street signage, and local perceptions. Data for this investigation were collected primarily from publicly visible signage in both the capital city (Tunis), and in the suburb (La Marsa), but also from Tunisian policy documents and perceptions of language use and meaning from the local Tunisian population. Drawing on the frameworks of indexicality (Scollon & Scollon, 2003), dialogicality (Bakhtin, 1981), and interpellation (Althusser, 1970), this study revealed that Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) was the undisputed official language not only in terms of political status, but also with respect to its visibility on public signs in the linguistic landscape, and in view of people\u2019s attitudes. However, it was also noted that despite its strong status in the city, there were still some inconsistencies observed with respect to the suburban area of La Marsa, where MSA cedes its supremacy to French on private signs. This inconsistency was explained as the result of additional provisions made by the state which permitted the use of foreign languages, and the importance of a large French expatriate population in La Marsa. The status of Tunisian Arabic (TA) was, contrary to MSA, not institutionalized in political legislation, and was shown not to have a high level of representation in the linguistic landscape. Respondents agreed that TA had to remain an oral language in order not to \u2018corrupt\u2019 the quality of the official and more prestigious MSA. Although not officially recognized in Tunisian legislation, French in Tunisia was shown to have a substantial impact on the linguistic landscape, especially on private signs where it was used either as a relic of colonialism, as a language interpellating  (Althusser, 1970)  a particular social group, or as a language of commodification (Heller, 2003). Local informants valued French as the second language of the country, and as a cultural heritage, or rejected it as a language marking a prevailing status-quo of subjugation to French politico-cultural hegemony. English emerges as a language slowly but surely growing in importance in the linguistic landscape of Tunis and La Marsa, and gaining more acceptance in people\u2019s attitudes. While French was perceived by others as a language indexing colonial status-quo and dependency, English was experienced by some as a liberating or \u2018third space\u2019 (Kramsch, 1993) language which countered the hegemony of French because it lacked association with a colonial history. \n\tThis study demonstrates the need to diversify the range and types of data in LL research. In doing so, researchers interested in language policy and planning can develop a much more astute and comprehensive understanding of urban multilingualism. They can also address bottom-up as well as top-down linguistic practices. The linguistic landscape was also theorized as an example of \u2018new literacy\u2019 (Gee, 2007) modality. The type of literacy represented in the linguistic landscape which is multimodal, multilingual, multiscriptal, and hence multiliterate, provides the local population with the potential to develop multicompetence (Cook 1992, 2002) in reading and writing the multilingualism featured in their daily visual ecology. As shown by Cenoz & Gorter (2008), the linguistic landscape can also be a site which fosters the development of second language acquisition, particularly in the form of input to second language learners. In addition to the implications of the linguistic landscape as a site of literacy practices and language development, the linguistic landscape in Tunisia potentially represents a tool for pedagogy (Sayer, 2010) which can serve to sensitize the population about the languages spoken and encountered in the country. It can also raise people\u2019s awareness about their linguistic repertoires, identities, and cultural heritage (Dagenais et al., 2009).\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5506], "author_name_tesi": "Ben Said, Slim ", "last_name_ssi": "Ben Said", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Slim", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Suresh Canagarajah", "Athelstan Canagarajah", "Celeste S Kinginger", "Meredith Christine Doran", "Grace Hampton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Suresh Canagarajah, Dissertation Advisor", "Athelstan Canagarajah, Committee Chair", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Member", "Meredith Christine Doran, Committee Member", "Grace Hampton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Language Policy and Planning", "Multilingualism", "Sociolinguistics", "Linguistic Landscape"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "NONPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION IN MULTIVARIATE FINITE MIXTURE MODELS\n\n\n\n", "id": "9263", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6108", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The main goal of this thesis is to provide a complete methodology to analyze finite multivariate mixture models.

Specifically, this project will investigate representations of maternity and motherhood in both the fictional narratives and non-fiction essays of three Spanish women: Carmen de Burgos (1867-1932), Margarita Nelken (1896-1968), and Federica Montseny (1905-1994). These three individuals were among the increasing number of educated women who began to earn their living by writing about those women\u2019s issues which provoked conversation and debate within the increasingly visible Spanish feminist movement. By transcending genres and publishing their essays, novels, and novelas in popular journals, periodicals, and revistas, Burgos, Nelken, and Montseny are emblematic of the way in which Spanish women began to articulate their unique voices within a variety of public literary domains.\nHistorically, first-wave Spanish feminism has been classified as delayed, too conservative, or even a complete failure by numerous historians and literary scholars. Yet the so-called \u201ctraditional\u201d women-centered experiences of maternity and motherhood in fact played crucial transformative roles within the nascent Spanish feminist discourse. In reality, the prevalence of maternal issues within women\u2019s writing at this time \u2013 especially in the literary production of women exhibiting liberal, feminist inclinations \u2013 necessitates a cautiously critical analysis within the context of a uniquely Spanish cultural milieu. Rather than stifling, or proving detrimental to the women\u2019s movement, I suggest that feminist appropriations of maternal values and motherhood were, on the contrary, the precise points at which we can perceive a radical feminist ideology that threatened the very foundations of Spain\u2019s patriarchal society. During the years prior to the First World War, for example, the first steps were taken toward redefining motherhood as a voluntary role, rather than as an obligatory, and lifelong, female identity. Far from uniformly rejecting maternity, however, many European feminists sought to appropriate motherhood within new, modern definitions of womanhood. The result was what historian Ann Taylor Allen has termed the \u201cmaternal dilemma,\u201d or the conflict over whether it was possible to be both a mother and an autonomous individual. I have found that early twentieth century Spanish women were acutely aware of this new modern \u201cdilemma,\u201d and their literary representations of mothers and motherhood proved to be frequent, and quite different, from those appearing in novels written before the turn of the century.  \nThe novels and essays that Burgos, Nelken, and Montseny published during the 1920s directly challenged the traditional female ideal (the \u201cangel of the home,\u201d or el \u00e1ngel del hogar) which had prescribed marriage and motherhood as Spanish women\u2019s exclusive social responsibilities since the sixteenth century. As such, these women writers labored to mitigate anti-feminist attempts to unilaterally define an idealized model of female identity based on motherhood.  By taking control of the representations and theorizations of the maternal role through literature, Burgos, Nelken, and Montseny challenged, deconstructed, and even expanded upon the homogenous \u00e1ngel del hogar in order to create exceptional, heterogeneous interpretations of motherhood which could accommodate a variety of roles and identities.  In the end, my analyses of the unique maternal experiences depicted in women\u2019s literature will broaden current perspectives concerning the scope of first-wave feminism in the peninsula and bring us a step closer to articulating a distinctly Spanish vision of feminism in the early twentieth century.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8412], "author_name_tesi": "Bender, Rebecca Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Bender", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nicolas L Fernandez Medina", "William Robert Blue", "Guadalupe Marti Pena", "Joan Landes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nicolas L Fernandez Medina, Committee Chair", "William Robert Blue, Committee Member", "Guadalupe Marti Pena, Committee Member", "Joan Landes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spain", "motherhood", "maternity", "feminism", "angel del hogar", "novela", "essay", "literature", "Burgos", "Nelken", "Montseny"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "APPLICATION OF MONTE CARLO MODELING OF COMPTON SUPPRESSION SPECTROSCOPY TO SPENT FUEL MATERIAL ACCOUNTANCY\n", "id": "11733", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5561", "abstract_tesi": "Gamma ray spectroscopy is the quantitative use of photons emitted during the decay of unstable nuclides to identify a sample.  Compton suppression is a technique used to reduce the contribution of scattered gamma ray photons to the detector response allowing small peaks to be better resolved.  Often, Compton suppression is coupled with neutron activation analysis (NAA) for nondestructive trace isotope identification.  In this study, the application of Compton suppression technique is evaluated for deployment in a measurement system used for nuclear safeguards activities at reprocessing facilities.    \nMaterial accountancy and process monitoring in a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility is uniquely challenging due to the complexity of the highly radioactive process stream.  The experiments described here are an investigation of the feasibility of incorporating a Compton suppression system into a novel safeguards detection system called the Multi-Isotope Process (MIP) Monitor.  The objective of the project is to build a system that detects subtle changes in the distribution of elements in a reprocessing stream using measured gamma ray spectra coupled with multivariate analysis techniques autonomously in near-real time.  The high concentration of 137Cs in the aqueous phase process stream makes the concept difficult to implement in this stage of the separation because of the dominant 661keV peak and subsequent Compton scatter.      \nThe Compton suppression technique was developed to reduce the scatter which causes a Compton continuum.  A Compton suppression spectrometer is generally comprised of a primary, high resolution detector and is surrounded by lower resolution, high stopping power guard detectors.  The detectors operate in anticoincidence with one another whereby if a signal is generated in both detectors within a set time window, the pulse will not be added to the spectrum.  The Pennsylvania State University Radiation Science and Engineering Center (RSIC) is equipped with a custom-designed Canberra build Compton suppression system (CSS).  The system is comprised of an HPGe primary detector surrounded by NaI annulus and plug detectors.  The CSS system has a measured Peak-to-Compton ratio of 1000:1 compared to the standalone HPGe Peak-to-Compton ratio of 58:1.   \nMeasurements described here investigate the feasibility of utilizing a Compton suppression system into a novel reprocessing safeguards detection system called the Multi-Isotope Process (MIP) monitor.  The goal of the Multi-Isotope Process (MIP) project is to detect subtle changes in the elements and their distribution in a reprocessing stream using the gamma ray spectra.   This distribution can be correlated to process variables such as burnup, acid concentration, organic ligand concentration, temperature, etc.   The high concentration of 137Cs in the aqueous phase makes the concept difficult to implement in this stage of the separation because the dominant 661keV peak and subsequent Compton scatter.\nThe existing PSU CSS system was utilized to evaluate the efficacy of a Compton suppression spectrometer for applications involving spent nuclear fuel.  Monte Carlo modeling of a Compton suppressed detection system was also performed using the high energy particle physics transport code Geant4.   The PSU CSS system was used to validate the model results so that the same methodology could be applied to other detector geometries.   The CSS was calibrated using NIST Standard sources to determine the energy and FWHM as a function of energy to apply during modeling.     The model was tested with several standard button sources to evaluate summing and Compton reduction algorithms as well as more complex surrogate sources which mimic spent nuclear fuel.  The surrogate sources were designed to simulate detection challenges posed by fuel samples such as high 137Cs activity and weak low energy features.  Source definition inputs characterizing actual spent fuel were produced using the burnup code ORIGEN-ARP.  \nThe Geant-4 model of the Penn State Compton Suppression System is in development with which to verify the ability to model anticoincidence spectral gating.  Due to the high cost and limited availability of spent fuel samples, once validated, the model will be used to predict spectra from a range of spent fuel samples for system testing purposes.

In particular, spent nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities pose one of the most difficult accountancy challenges: continuously monitoring large volumes of highly radioactive, fluid sample streams.  Current accountancy methods for nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities are resource intensive and time-consuming.  The adaptation of passive gamma-ray detection coupled with multivariate analysis techniques could reduce the man-power requirements and processing time of samples.  However, in measured gamma-ray spectra from spent nuclear fuel, the Compton continuum from the dominant 661.7 keV 137Cs fission product gamma-ray photon peak obscures lower energy lines.  The application of Compton suppression to gamma-ray measurements of spent fuel will reduce the high continuum from nuclides like 137Cs and may allow other less intense, lower energy peaks to be detected, potentially improving the accuracy of multivariate analysis algorithms.  \nThere has been previous investigation into the use of room temperature detectors for gamma-ray spectroscopy of spent nuclear fuel.  Interest has also been expressed in the application of Compton suppression to room temperature detectors for similar applications.  Therefore, the focus of this study has been to assess Compton suppressed gamma-ray detection systems for the multivariate analysis of spent nuclear fuel.  This objective has been achieved using direct measurement of samples of irradiated fuel elements in two geometrical configurations with Compton suppression systems.  This allowed for the quantification of the number of additionally resolvable peaks through the application of Compton suppression and enabled the analysis of the effect of Compton suppressed gamma-ray detection in the presence high radiation field.  A novel Compton suppressed detector model for the simulation of spent fuel measurements was developed.\n   In order to address the objective to quantify the number of additionally resolvable photopeaks, direct Compton suppressed spectroscopic measurements of spent nuclear fuel in two configurations were performed: as intact fuel elements and as dissolved feed solutions.  These measurements directly assessed and quantified the differences in measured gamma-ray spectrum from the application of Compton suppression.  Several irradiated fuel elements of varying cooling time from the Penn State Breazeale Reactor spent fuel inventory were measured using three Compton suppression systems that utilized different primary detectors: HPGe, LaBr3, and NaI(Tl).  The application of Compton suppression using a LaBr3 primary detector to the measurement of the current core fuel element, which presented the highest count rate, allowed four additional spectral features to be resolved.  In comparison, the HPGe-CSS was able to resolve eight additional photopeaks as compared to the standalone HPGe measurement.   Measurements with the NaI(Tl) primary detector were unable to resolve any additional peaks, due to its relatively low resolution.  \nSamples of Approved Test Material (ATM) commercial fuel elements were obtained from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.  The samples had been processed using the beginning stages of the PUREX method and represented the unseparated feed solution from a reprocessing facility.  Compton suppressed measurements of the ATM fuel samples were recorded inside the guard detector annulus, to simulate the siphoning of small quantities from the main process stream for long dwell measurement periods.   Photopeak losses were observed in the measurements of the dissolved ATM fuel samples because the spectra was recorded from the source in very close proximity to the detector and surrounded by the guard annulus, so the detection probability is very high.  Though this configuration is optimal for a Compton suppression system for the measurement of low count rate samples, measurement of high count rate samples in the enclosed arrangement leads to sum peaks in both the suppressed and unsuppressed spectra and losses to photopeak counts in the suppressed spectra.  No additional photopeaks were detected using Compton suppression with this geometry.     \n\tA detector model was constructed that can accurately simulate a Compton suppressed spectral measurement of radiation from spent nuclear fuel using HPGe or LaBr3 detectors.  This is the first detector model capable of such an accomplishment.  The model uses the Geant4 toolkit coupled with the RadSrc application and it accepts spent fuel composition data in list form.  The model has been validated using dissolved ATM fuel samples in the standard, enclosed geometry of the PSU HPGe-CSS.  The model showed generally good agreement with both the unsuppressed and suppressed measured fuel sample spectra, however the simulation is more appropriate for the generation of gamma-ray spectra in the beam source configuration.  Photopeak losses due to cascade decay emissions in the Compton suppressed spectra were not appropriately managed by the simulation.   \nCompton suppression would be a beneficial addition to NDA process monitoring systems if oriented such that the gamma-ray photons are collimated to impinge the primary detector face as a beam.  The analysis has shown that peak losses through accidental coincidences are minimal and the reduction in the Compton continuum allows additional peaks to be resolved.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9047], "author_name_tesi": "Bender, Sarah Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Bender", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Igor Jovanovic", "Joshua Alexander Robinson", "Christopher Orton", "Jon Schwantes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu, Dissertation Advisor", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Chair", "Igor Jovanovic, Committee Member", "Joshua Alexander Robinson, Committee Member", "Christopher Orton, Special Member", "Jon Schwantes, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spent fuel", "Compton suppression", "gamma spectroscopy", "lanthanum bromide", "burnup", "Monte Carlo", "Geant4"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Novel Mechanisms of Bordetella Survival in the Mammalian Host and in the Environment", "id": "27088", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11897", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Bordetella are respiratory pathogens that infect a wide variety of hosts, and this dissertation focuses on novel mechanisms employed by these bacteria to survive in the mammalian host and in the environment.  We highlight in chapter one the mechanisms used by Bordetella species for pathogenesis and survival during infection, and review immune responses to bacterial infection.  Chapter two describes a novel role for the Type Six Secretion System during infection.  An analysis of 58 recently sequenced B. bronchiseptica isolates revealed that one-third of recently sequenced Bordetella bronchiseptica strains of the predominantly human-associated Complex IV have lost their T6SS through gene deletion or degradation.  Since the majority of B. bronchiseptica human infections occur in immunocompromised patients, loss of the T6SS may be selectively advantageous for B. bronchiseptica survival in immunocompromised hosts.  Infection of immunodeficient mice (Rag1-/-) with a T6SS-deficient mutant of B. bronchiseptica caused hyperlethality as compared to infection with the wild-type strain. Additionally, large numbers of the T6SS-deficient mutant (but not wild-type) bacteria were recovered from systemic organs 21 days post-inoculation.  While the T6SS was shown to decrease pathology and pro-inflammatory cytokine production during infection of Rag1-/- mice, co-infection of the wild-type and T6SS-deficient strains revealed that a heightened inflammatory response associated with infection of the T6SS-mutant is not sufficient to enable B. bronchiseptica translocation to systemic organs.  Rather, the T6SS-deficient B. bronchiseptica strain survives in Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) after phagocytosis and is trafficked to systemic organs inside these cells.  Meanwhile, wild-type B. bronchiseptica kills its eukaryotic cellular host via a T6SS-dependent mechanism and is thus not recovered systemically in immunodeficient mice.  We concluded that the bacterial T6SS and host adaptive immune components both limit B. bronchiseptica survival intracellularly during infection.  Loss of the T6SS in recent B. bronchiseptica isolates, therefore, may enable persistence in an intracellular niche in immunocompromised human patients.\nIn chapter three, amoebae are identified as potential environmental reservoirs for the bordetellae.  We showed that B. bronchiseptica efficiently infects single-celled Dictyostelium discoideum trophozoites and survives and replicates in sori of D. discoideum multi-cellular fruiting bodies.  Additionally, the enigmatic Bvg- phase is identified as important for survival in amoeba sori.  While several other bacterial species have been shown to survive endosymbiotically in amoeba sori, we show that B. bronchiseptica lowers amoeba spore numbers over time while replicating in sori and thus hijacks the amoeba mechanism of dissemination for its own benefit.  By passaging B. bronchiseptica-containing sori onto lawns of Klebsiella aerogenes, (an amoeba food source), we identified a stable relationship between B. bronchiseptica and D. discoideum such that the bacteria can be recovered from the sorus through multiple amoebic lifecycles.  While in amoeba sori, B. bronchiseptica can be geographically disseminated by flies and can efficiently infect mice.  These results suggest that amoebae act as an environmental reservoir, replication medium, and transmission vector for B. bronchiseptica. \nWe continue to examine B. bronchiseptica \u2013 amoebic interactions in chapter four.  While most amoeba resistant bacteria (ARBs) prevent D. discoideum differentiation into fruiting bodies, B. bronchiseptica does not prevent D. discoideum initial plaque and fruiting body formation but rather inhibits plaque expansion.  In contrast, amoeba plaques formed on lawns of K. aerogenes expand efficiently over time. Additionally, we identify the adenylate cyclase toxin as important for B. bronchiseptica inhibition of plaque expansion.  Interestingly, B. bronchiseptica does not inhibit amoeba plaque growth when mixed with even low levels of K. aerogenes, suggesting that amoebae circumvent the B. bronchiseptica mechanism of inhibition when other bacterial species are present.  However, growth of plaques and fruiting bodies on mixed B. bronchiseptica and K. aerogenes lawns are altered, as evidenced by decreased fruiting body production relative to those formed on K. aerogenes alone.  Therefore, in the presence of other bacterial species B. bronchiseptica loses its ability to inhibit plaque expansion but is still harmful to amoebae.  Importantly, B. bronchiseptica is recovered from sori of amoebae grown on mixed B. bronchiseptica and K. aerogenes lawns.  These data suggest that B. bronchiseptica has a selective advantage as compared to bacterial \u201cfood\u201d species in the presence of amoebae due to its evolved ability to survive predation and replicate in amoeba sori.\nThis dissertation highlights novel mechanisms employed by Bordetella for survival in mammalian hosts and in the environment.  It establishes that the T6SS limits intracellular survival and that the loss of the T6SS in B. bronchiseptica strains may be linked to B. bronchiseptica survival in the human population.  Furthermore, it identifies amoeba as a potential environmental niche for the bordetellae and elucidates the role of the B. bronchiseptica Bvg- phase for survival in this niche.  Lastly, this work delves into the complex interactions that enable B. bronchiseptica to avoid predation by and utilize D. discoideum in geographical dissemination and transmission to the next host. Altogether, this dissertation contributes to our understanding of B. bronchiseptica transmission, pathogenicity, and persistence in novel mammalian and environmental niches. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11350], "author_name_tesi": "Bendor, Liron ", "last_name_ssi": "Bendor", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Liron", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill", "Robert Paulson", "Kenneth Charles Keiler", "Mary J Kennett", "Ross Cameron Hardison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Paulson, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Charles Keiler, Committee Member", "Mary J Kennett, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bordetella", "bordetella bronchiseptica", "amoeba", "dictyostelium", "amoeba", "Type Six Secretion System", "intracellular survival"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF ADAPTED INSTRUCTION ON THE\nACQUISITION OF LETTER-SOUND CORRESPONDENCES BY YOUNG CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS AND COMPLEX COMMUNICATION NEEDS\n\n\n", "id": "11286", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1697", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reading is one of the most critical skills taught in schools (Heller, Fredrick, Tumlin, & Brineman, 2002).

Much of what is currently known about the prominence of lexically stressed syllables is derived from formal sentence elicitation tasks produced in the laboratory environment. A corpus study analyzing 142 simple declarative utterances produced by four speakers (2 female; 2 male) of Traditional New Mexican Spanish shows that, in agreement with much of the previous research, longer vowel durations and fundamental frequency movement are often correlated with lexically stressed syllables in Spanish. Tonic vowels show longer average durations than the immediately surrounding unstressed vowels\u2014particularly in the pre-tonic context\u2014in both the presence and absence of fundamental frequency movement. Content words in the sample show a deaccentuation rate of 28% and a 45% early-alignment rate for pre-nuclear \u2018accentable\u2019 syllables. Despite traditional descriptions of pre-nuclear syllables in broad focus declaratives displaying late peak alignment, a comparison of early-alignment rates in this variety with the (semi-)spontaneous speech of other varieties of Spanish shows New Mexican Spanish to fall well within the range of variation. The role of vowel energy in cuing lexical stress and prominence is less consistent in the research and in the present sample proves to be highly speaker-dependent. Pairwise comparison shows a significant drop in vowel clarity in the pre-tonic environment, which coupled with shorter durations, may serve to further highlight the upcoming stressed syllable in continuous speech. A separate pilot experiment examines how native Spanish-speaking listeners perceive prominent syllables, exploring the role of the fundamental frequency peak and other perceptual factors (i.e., duration and intensity) when making prominence judgments. Listeners\u2019 responses to both unfiltered and low pass band filtered items show a bias toward penultimate judgments of prominence in the aggregate. Listener accuracy is increased when the fundamental frequency peak is aligned within the stressed syllable, but when lexical stress and the F0 peak are misaligned some asymmetries emerge. Listeners seem to rely heavily on the F0 peak for antepenultimate-accented items, whereas there is a strong tendency to judge penultimate prominence even when the fundamental frequency curve reaches its peak on the final syllable. The findings in the present dissertation contribute to our understanding of how prominence is marked in natural, conversational discourse and suggest avenues for future research into testing whether prominence perception is reliant on listeners\u2019 experiences with language, actual cues in the acoustic signal, or a combination of both.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15193], "author_name_tesi": "Benevento, Nicole Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Benevento", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John M.

However, such transformations have contributed to increasing racial and economic segregation between jurisdictions.  This dissertation explores how housing and school district policies of two suburban school districts within an affluent northeast county function together to impact the racial and economic demographic shaping and segregation between these school districts.  To better understand the role of policy in the increasing demographic shaping and segregation between northern metropolitan suburban school districts I examined two themes in the literature: the suburban construct as White spaces and the link between political fragmentation in metropolitan areas to education and residential segregation.  This research was conducted as a sequential mixed method multiple embedded case study to answer the following question: How does housing and school policy function together to impact the racial and economic segregation between Lower Merion School District (LMSD) and Cheltenham School District (CSD) within Montgomery County, Pennsylvania?  More specifically, how have school districts and municipalities\u2019 housing and population demographics in Montgomery County changed between 1960-2014?; and What federal, state, and local housing and school district policies and jurisprudence contribute to the demographic segregation between suburban school districts in Montgomery County, and how, respectively, do they do so?  Currently, Lower Merion School District is a predominately White and affluent community, while Cheltenham School District is racially and socioeconomically diverse.  Yet in 1960, both districts\u2019 municipalities had a predominately White population (95-99%) and similar economic demographics.  Examining these two districts provided an insight to how divergent goals, cultural purposes, and implementation of housing and education policies have contributed to the demographic trajectory of each suburban jurisdiction.  Findings suggest that suburban municipalities practiced exclusionary policies to keep out minority and low-income populations from a demographically changing Philadelphia core.  However, the cultural narrative of each municipality imparted different zoning and housing goals and policies that shaped the divergent demographics of each area.  Lower Merion reflected a Main Line narrative, concentrated in the production of wealth and whiteness.  Cheltenham\u2019s narrative focused on creating a diverse community that emerged over time. The findings also suggest that the municipalities shape the geographic and cultural boundaries not the school districts in Pennsylvania.  School districts are often reacting to demographic shifts predicated by municipality zoning choices, but they do mostly reinforce the cultural narrative of the municipality that include or exclude populations.  Furthermore, the continued perception of quality suburbs as White spaces allows segregated schools and communities to persist.
