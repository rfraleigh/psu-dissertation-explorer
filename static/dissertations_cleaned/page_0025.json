The body of the Renaissance sonneteer \nmoved through a web of discourses: Galenic rather than Cartesian notions of the materiality of \nthought and emotion; cosmological understandings of the body as microcosm; and religious and \nphilosophical appreciation of the hand as masterpiece of creation.  Writers also had to make use \nof implements\u2014the quill, penknife, ink, and paper\u2014that were prepared and used much \ndifferently from their present counterparts.  Finally, the strict form of the sonnet, as well as an \nactual physical setting, provided a variety of spaces for writing.  By sculpting these three facets, \nsonneteers resolve a tension between two kinds of composition: the first, driven by the poet\u2019s \nexcessive imagination and passion; the second, guided by the poet\u2019s reason and controlling hand.  \nIn resolving this tension, they discover alternative models of poetic physicality.  One model, \nfound in Sidney\u2019s Astrophil and Stella, emphasizes spontaneous oral composition.  A second \nmodel, present in Daniel\u2019s Delia as well as other sequences, incorporates a variety of physical \nsigns, including sighs and tears, to illustrate the effects of love\u2019s passion.  A third model, \nrepresented in Spenser\u2019s and Chapman\u2019s works, makes the poet\u2019s hand into an icon that links \npoems within a laureate career.  Finally, Shakespeare presents a unique blend of these models; in \nhis Sonnets, the poet\u2019s hand writes sonnets for readers to utter aloud, assuring poetic immortality.  \nCombining critical approaches often kept separate, those addressing the body and the author, this \ndissertation is the first to account for the originality and potency of sonnet sequences by showing \nhow the genre allows poets to anatomize their authorship.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5166], "author_name_tesi": "Croft, Ryan J.", "last_name_ssi": "Croft", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marcy Lynne North", "Marcy Lynne North", "Linda Woodbridge", "Patrick G Cheney", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt", "Norris Joiner Lacy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marcy Lynne North, Dissertation Advisor", "Marcy Lynne North, Committee Chair", "Linda Woodbridge, Committee Member", "Patrick G Cheney, Committee Member", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt, Committee Member", "Norris Joiner Lacy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Renaissance", "Early Modern", "Sonnets", "Sonnet Sequences", "Body", "Writing"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Development of Operational Strategies for an On-Demand Food Delivery System in Health Care", "id": "13761", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7218", "abstract_tesi": "As hospitals strive to improve measures of service for patients under their care, every element of the patient care process is examined for opportunities to improve the quality of care and the presence of a patient-centered approach.  Some hospitals have implemented an \u201con-demand\u201d style food service system in an effort to be more patient-centric.  This system allows patients to order from a menu and have it delivered to their room, much like a hotel room service system.  Geisinger Medical Center, in Danville PA, is among the hospitals looking to improve their inpatient food service to better meet the needs of patients by implementing such an on-demand delivery style system. \nThis research develops operational recommendations for an on-demand food delivery system for the inpatients at Geisinger Medical Center.  The recommendations made will allow the system to achieve service level standards set by Geisinger\u2019s Guest Service management team.  Specifically, several combinations of meal delivery cart capacities and dispatching strategies were analyzed for effectiveness with the use of a discrete event simulation model.  The model captures all material handling and routing throughout the Geisinger Medical Center facility and was used to understand how different delivery strategies affect operational performance and service levels. \nTo reduce the percent of meals delivered late, more resources will be required, however, they will not necessarily be utilized efficiently.  The operational strategy that allowed for the best balance between resource utilization and patient service levels used twelve-tray delivery carts, and a dispatch timer setting of ten minutes, provided the meal preparation required less than fifteen minutes.  This policy suggests that approximately 94.3% of patients will receive their meals within 45 minutes of placing an order.  The results also provide an expectation for the number of carts needed, as well as information to assist planning for host staffing levels depending on the operational policy chosen.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7205], "author_name_tesi": "Cronk, Caitlin Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Cronk", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Caitlin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah Jean Medeiros"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah Jean Medeiros, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["discrete event simulation", "vehicle routing problem", "hospital operations", "meal delivery"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Soil Organic Carbon Protection in the Presence of Iron Oxides", "id": "13523ssc160", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13523", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soil organic carbon in peatlands is an important terrestrial pool. Peatlands are typically considered carbon dioxide sinks because their water-saturated soils maintain anaerobic conditions that impede the microbial mineralization of organic carbon. In the face of a warming climate, environmental changes are predicted to induce more aerobic zones in peatland soils, potentially leading to rapid and large releases of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Recent work has shown that minerals, particularly those part of the colloidal fraction like iron oxides, may slow this process by associating with organic carbon and prevent biodegradation.\nThis work focused on examining the biodegradation of organic carbon in iron-carbon associations in peatlands. I hypothesized that organic carbon coprecipitation with and sorption to ferrihydrite reduces the biodegradation of organic carbon, thereby minimizing carbon dioxide emissions from these environments. To test this, I isolated dissolved organic carbon and a mixed microbial community from a peatland soil to perform incubation experiments. Reactors in incubation experiments were amended with different synthesized iron-organic carbon coprecipitates and adsorption treatments over a 66 day incubation.  The transformation of organic carbon throughout the incubation was tracked in two ways. To detect degradation of the soil dissolved organic carbon, changes in the concentration of the dissolved pool of organic carbon were monitored using total organic carbon analysis. The mineralization of organic carbon into carbon dioxide was tracked by headspace evolution measurements using gas chromatography alongside equilibrium calculations to account for carbon dioxide in solution. To begin understanding the mechanisms behind organic carbon transformations, the soil dissolved organic carbon, iron-carbon mineral associations, and microbial community were characterized at the beginning and end of the incubation period. The overall aromaticity, or chemical complexity, of the initial and final soil dissolved organic carbon stock in incubation treatments were characterized using specific ultraviolet absorbance. Chemical and structural changes of iron-carbon associations were determined using microscopy and 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy.\nOver the course of incubation, organic carbon mineralized to carbon dioxide in all inoculated reactors to different extents. Reactors with coprecipitate treatments evolved far less carbon dioxide than sorption treatments, though both coprecipitation and sorption treatments evolved less carbon dioxide than the positive control of soil dissolved organic carbon stock and soil inoculum. Tranmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS), and 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy indicated structural and chemical changes to three of the four coprecipitate treatments, but no changes in the ferrihydrite sorption treatment. Specific ultraviolet absorbance measurements signaled a general trend towards more aromatic, complex carbon compounds over the course of incubation, particularly in coprecipitation treatments. Results from this work pointed to substantial organic carbon preservation in coprecipitation treatments during aerobic biodegradation. Sorption treatments also hindered biodegradation towards the end of incubation, but initial organic carbon mineralization was on pace with the positive control of the soil dissolved organic carbon stock and soil inoculum. In a peat system where dissolved organic carbon is at risk of rapid mineralization into carbon dioxide, association with the common iron oxide, ferrihydrite, may act to minimize aerobic biodegradation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13447], "author_name_tesi": "Cronk, Stephanie Sarah", "last_name_ssi": "Cronk", "middle_name_ssi": "Sarah", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Aaron Gorski", "William D Burgos", "Nathaniel Richard Warner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Aaron Gorski, Thesis Advisor", "William D Burgos, Committee Member", "Nathaniel Richard Warner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Climate change", "peatlands", "ferrihydrite", "soil dissolved organic carbon", "Mossbauer", "TEM", "STEM-EDS", "coprecipitation", "iron oxides"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Expanding the Functional Proteome of an RNA Virus by Phosphorylation of a Protein Containing an Intrinsically Disordered Domain", "id": "13114tjc5337", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13114", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In order for a virus to establish a chronic infection, it must maintain a dynamic equilibrium to persist against the host\u2019s immune response without causing acute disease. To accomplish this, the virus must participate in a multitude of complex interactions with the host. Among other virus types, many positive strand RNA viruses are known to establish persistent infections in hosts ranging from plants and livestock to humans. Compared to their eukaryotic hosts, RNA viruses have a very limited genomic capacity. With this restricted coding capacity, how an RNA virus acquires the vast functional capabilities needed for chronic infection becomes an intriguing question.\nUsing the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model, we have proposed one route an RNA virus could expand its functional capacity by using a protein containing an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). The structural flexibility of a disordered region allows a protein to establish multiple interactions within the same region. This structural flexibility must be regulated though to provide specificity of function. We, and others, propose phosphorylation can regulate the conformation of an IDR. We hypothesize a \u2018phosphorylation code\u2019 exists for the HCV intrinsically disordered protein, NS5A, that regulates its myriad interactions with both host and viral proteins, allowing this protein to serve an essential role in the virus\u2019 ability to dynamically interact with the host and establish a chronic infection.\nIn the following studies, we have established the ability to purify the intrinsically disordered domain (IDD) of the HCV protein NS5A to a concentration and purity suitable for biophysical characterization. We have determined that the NS5A IDD has a propensity for a-helical formation. Using phosphorylation by PKA as a model, we have determined that a single phosphorylation event alters the global conformation of the NS5A IDD. This conformational change is likely inducing a more stable structure with increased a-helical content.\nTo determine the impact of phosphorylation-induced conformational changes on the function of the NS5A protein, we have explored NS5A IDD binding to SH3 domains from several different proteins. While SH3 domains are structurally similar, we found that not only does the NS5A IDD binding to different SH3 domains differ, but PKA phosphorylation impacts the interaction of each of the SH3 domains uniquely. This study provides insight into a fundamental way binding of SH3 domains to polyproline motifs could be regulated.\nThis exploration of the effects of PKA phosphorylation on the conformation and function of the NS5A IDD has contributed to the overall understanding of the role and regulation of intrinsically disordered proteins and provides an example of how an RNA virus with limited genetic capacity could expand its functional proteome.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13621], "author_name_tesi": "Croom-Perez, Tayler Jo", "last_name_ssi": "Croom-Perez", "middle_name_ssi": "Jo", "first_name_ssi": "Tayler", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Eugene Cameron", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "Richard John Frisque", "B Tracy Nixon", "Mary Poss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig Eugene Cameron, Dissertation Advisor", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Committee Chair", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Mary Poss, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hepatitis C virus", "intrinsically disordered protein", "RNA virus", "Phosphorylation", "NMR"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Do Chief Executive Officers Matter More in Some Countries than Others?

To address this issue, I build on the construct of managerial discretion, or latitude of action.  Most research in this domain has focused on the firm-level and industry-level factors that constrain or enable discretion.  I extend managerial discretion research by adopting for the first time a broader interpretation of the firm\u2019s environment \u2013 the national level \u2013 in terms of its constraints on discretion.  My dissertation consists of two major sections.  First, I present a theoretical analysis discussing how cross-national differences in a number of informal institutions (e.g. social norms) and formal institutions (e.g. legal tradition) will differentially affect CEO discretion across countries.  I also discuss the importance of institutional enforcement mechanisms and explore the inter-relationships among informal and formal institutions.  Second, I present a theoretical and empirical analysis of some of the major consequences of cross-national differences in managerial discretion, including CEO effects, CEO characteristics, and the firm performance-CEO departure relationship.  I find evidence that, compared to CEOs in low-discretion environments (e.g. Japan, South Korea), CEOs in high-discretion environments (e.g. U.K., U.S.) tend to be associated with larger CEO effects, earlier CEO entry, more heterogeneous CEO entry and exit, and a greater likelihood of departure following poor performance.  I also examine whether the impact of national-level discretion is moderated by firm-level internationalization.  Finally, I investigate whether these phenomena have changed significantly over time.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1111], "author_name_tesi": "Crossland, Craig ", "last_name_ssi": "Crossland", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Craig", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald C Hambrick", "Timothy Grant Pollock", "James B Stewart", "Wenpin Tsai"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald C Hambrick, Committee Chair", "Timothy Grant Pollock, Committee Member", "James B Stewart, Committee Member", "Wenpin Tsai, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CEOs", "national institutions", "managerial discretion", "upper echelons"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "STORED CHEMICAL ENERGY PROPULSION SYSTEM (SCEPS) REACTOR INJECTOR PERFORMANCE PREDICTION MODELING WITH EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION", "id": "14333mec5485", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14333", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A quasi one-dimensional compressible-flow model has been developed to characterize the thermodynamic state of gas injectors within stored chemical energy propulsion systems (SCEPS).

The test results validated the model\u2019s static pressure prediction for each nozzle case by producing the same distribution of pressures on the same order of magnitude.  The order of temperature values was also validated, although greater divergence from the model predictions occurred toward the latter half of each nozzle.

Long-term culture of SSCs in conditions supporting self-renewal and subsequent transplantation into testes of recipient males for reestablishment of spermatogenesis provides a means to preserve and expand male germlines.  Moreover, these capabilities provide a platform for direct genetic modification of the male germline to produce transgenic animals.  For cattle, these capabilities could provide a novel avenue for enhancing production efficiency and generation of genetically modified food animals.  Studies with rodents revealed that culture of undifferentiated spermatogonia in serum-free media conditions promotes formation of germ cell clumps that contain SSCs.  In addition, supplementation with the growth factor glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is essential for long-term expansion of germ cell clumps including self-renewal of SSCs, and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) enhanced theses effects.  To date, conditions supporting formation and expansion of bovine undifferentiated spermatogonial clumps that are similar in morphology to those in rodent cultures have not been reported.  In this study, we examined several conditions that support rodent undifferentiated spermatogonia in vitro and identified conditions which supported formation of undifferentiated spermatogonial clumps from pre-pubertal bull testes that are identical in morphology to those in rodent cultures.  These conditions included mitotically inactivated bovine embryonic fibroblast (BEF) feeder cells in DMEM/F12 medium containing StemPro supplement and addition of recombinant human forms of GDNF and FGF2. We determined these cells express the transcription factor Plzf, confirming an undifferentiated spermatogonial phenotype. Upon long-term culture we found that the number of clumps declines in these conditions beginning with the first week and the cells could not be maintained for greater than 3 weeks indicating lack of key factors that promote their survival and proliferation. Thus, we conducted microarray analyses of isolated bovine undifferentiated spermatogonia to identify enriched expression of growth factor receptors whose corresponding ligands may enhance their maintenance in vitro. From these analyses we determined that expression of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (Csf-1r) and chemokine (c-x-c motif) receptor 4 (Cxcr4) are highly enriched in the bovine undifferentiated spermatogonial fraction. Addition of recombinant human CSF-1, along with GDNF and FGF2, significantly enhanced the maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia during the first week of culture by greater than 2-fold compared to cultures receiving GDNF and FGF2 only. Supplementation of recombinant human SDF-1 in addition to the GDNF, FGF2, and CSF-1 increased the number of undifferentiated spermatogonia that were maintained by 1.75-fold compared with CSF-1, GDNF, and FGF2 alone. These results implicate CSF-1 and SDF-1 as additional extrinsic factors that promote survival and proliferation of bovine undifferentiated spermatogonia. Furthermore, a Sertoli-enriched feeder cell monolayer was tested and found to improve support of undifferentiated spermatogonia significantly when compared to the BEF feeders. Collectively, these studies have identified conditions that enhance the short-term maintenance of bovine undifferentiated spermatogonia in vitro and serve as an important step towards discovering conditions which promote long-term expansion of the cells including self-renewal of SSCs.

One particular area that ISEs need support in is how to engage preschool-age audiences in science practices. This study is part of a NSF-funded project, My Sky Tonight (MST), which looked at how to support ISEs in facilitating astronomy-themed activities with preschool-age audiences. This dissertation focuses on the influence of a six-week, online professional development workshop designed for ISEs working with preschool-age audiences. I used three primary sources of data: pre/post interviews and a video analysis task from data of 16 participants, as well as observations of implementation from a subset of seven participants who agreed to participate further. I developed and used the Phenomena-driven Practices of Science (PEPS) Framework as an analysis tool for identifying engagement in science practices. Findings from this study show that ISEs identified affective goals and rarely goals that reflect science practice engagement for their preschool-age audiences. They maintained these initial goals after the professional development workshop. ISEs describe the ways in which they engage children in science using primarily science practice-related words, but these descriptions did not show full use of science practices according to the PEPS framework. When observed implementing science activities with their preschool audiences, the ISEs demonstrated a variety of forms of science engagement, but only a few used science practices in ways consistent with the PEPS framework. Engagement in the professional development workshop did not result in a transition in the ways ISEs talk about and implement science with young children. While the write-ups for MST activities were not written in a way that supported engagement in science practices, a subset of MST activities were designed with it in mind. The professional development workshop included little time focusing on how ISEs could engage children in science practices, specific to each activity. These two factors may have played a major role in why participants showed limited improvement in their use of science practices in their goals and implementation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11640], "author_name_tesi": "Crowl, Michele Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Crowl", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Michele", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Julia Diane Plummer", "Carla Zembal Saul", "Heather A Zimmerman", "Christopher Palma"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Julia Diane Plummer, Dissertation Advisor", "Carla Zembal Saul, Committee Chair", "Heather A Zimmerman, Committee Member", "Christopher Palma, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["informal science educators", "professional development", "preschool-age audiences"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ISSUES IN COST ANALYSES OF PREVENTION SYSTEMS: CONSIDERING RESOURCE CONSUMPTION OF A DISSEMINATION MODEL FOR PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n", "id": "11228", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1483", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It is increasingly clear that in order to achieve a public health impact from evidence-based substance abuse prevention programs, researchers must better understand how to cultivate sustainable delivery efforts (Glasgow, Kleges, Dzewaltowski, Bull & Estabrooks, 2004; Spoth & Greenberg, 2005). Consequently, many projects seek to foster sustainability by integrating programs into existing delivery systems (e.g., Hawkins, et al., 2009, Spoth, Greenberg, Bierman & Redmond, 2004). This integration may result in reallocation of resources and funding streams (Green et al., 2008; Romani, et al., 2007). Despite these efforts becoming more common, little research has formally examined this process or described how resource flow changes across time (i.e., resource infrastructures). Economic evaluation includes multiple analytic tools that may be used to analyze resource use and efficiency, which prevention researchers have recently begun to explore (e.g., O\u2019Connell, Boat, & Warner, 2009). \nThis work will describe the resource consumption of a dissemination model known as the PROSPER project. PROSPER attempts to cultivate sustainable partnerships between communities and universities to promote implementation of evidence-based interventions (Spoth, Greenberg, Bierman & Redmond, 2004). PROSPER\u2019s focus on sustainability, and careful prospective resource tracking, makes this model ideal for evaluating the impact of formal dissemination efforts on resource infrastructures. An examination of the fiscal and economic costs, from PROSPER\u2019s implementation, on community, cooperative extension, and university resource infrastructures will be presented. \nResults illustrate the diverse array of costs required for successful coordination of program dissemination and sustainability. It is clear that, from early on in the project, each system bears different proportions and types of costs. Across time, the resource infrastructures of community, cooperative extension and university partners become increasingly integrated as systemic efficiencies grow. \nThis work highlights the need to study program resource networks across time and broaden definitions of what is essential for successful implementation. In particular, application of economic evaluation offers an innovative methodology for analyzing the efficiency of prevention systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1468], "author_name_tesi": "Crowley, Daniel Max ", "last_name_ssi": "Crowley", "middle_name_ssi": "Max ", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark T Greenberg", "Mark T Greenberg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark T Greenberg, Thesis Advisor", "Mark T Greenberg, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["program dissemination", "cost analysis", "prevention systems"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Evaluating The Cost-effectivness Of Real-world Prevention: Approaches For Estimating The Efficieny Of Evidence-based Programming", "id": "15529", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7919", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Successful demonstrations of evidence-based preventative interventions (EBPIs) have led to a growing interest in prevention\u2019s capacity to reduce major public health problems with greater efficiency. In response\u2014just as prevention scientists once distinguished between the efficacy and effectiveness of prevention programs\u2014now researchers are considering the distinction between program effectiveness and efficiency (i.e., contextualizing impact in terms of cost). This inquiry into the benefits and costs of EBPIs presents an opportunity to demonstrate prevention\u2019s impact as well as its greater value to society. To accurately evaluate the efficiency of prevention efforts, program cost-effectiveness must be gauged in real-world contexts. In turn, new methodological approaches are needed to account for potential confounders that may reduce researcher\u2019s ability to draw causal inferences about program impact. For instance, selection bias is introduced when local communities adopt one program over another and when the decision to enroll in multiple programs is left up to participants.  \nThis work demonstrates an innovative approach for assessing the efficiency of evidence-based preventive interventions delivered in everyday settings. Using data from the PROSPER dissemination trial (over 12,000 youth; 28 Communities), this project applies propensity and marginal structural models to strengthen causal inference within cost-effectiveness analyses of community prevention efforts. Using these analytic techniques, I evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three school programs (Life Skills Training, All Stars and Project Alert) and a family program (SFP 10-14) to reduce prescription opioid misuse (e.g., Vicodin, OxyContin). Findings indicated that universal school-based EBPIs can on their own reduce prescription opioid misuse in a cost-effective manner and that the efficiency of a prevention effort employing such school programs can be enhanced by deploying an additional family-based program.\nThis methodological approach provides an opportunity to increase the relevance of prevention impact analyses by allowing researchers to better contextualize program effectiveness in terms of program costs. Specifically, this method provides a more refined approach for understanding the impact of combining interventions and may expedite the development of more efficient prevention efforts. Further, analyses such as these can provide important information to not only researchers, but to multiple stakeholders who seek to translate prevention science into practice.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7840], "author_name_tesi": "Crowley, Daniel Max ", "last_name_ssi": "Crowley", "middle_name_ssi": "Max ", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark T Greenberg", "Mark T Greenberg", "Damon Evan Jones", "Linda Marie Collins", "Edward A Smith", "Donna Coffman", "Daniel Francis Perkins", "Steven Howard Zarit"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark T Greenberg, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark T Greenberg, Committee Chair", "Damon Evan Jones, Committee Chair", "Linda Marie Collins, Committee Member", "Edward A Smith, Committee Member", "Donna Coffman, Committee Member", "Daniel Francis Perkins, Special Member", "Steven Howard Zarit, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Prevention Science", "Cost-Effectiveness", "Prescription Drug Misuse", "Efficiency Analyses"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "IDENTIFYING REDOX PARTNERS AND A ROLE IN OXIDATIVE STRESS FOR IRON-SULFUR FLAVOPROTEIN (ISF) FROM METHANOSARCINA THERMOPHILA", "id": "6568", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1988", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\tIron-sulfur flavoprotein from Methanosarcina thermophila is the prototype for a widely-distributed family of proteins existing amongst distantly-related, strict anaerobes. This family traverses all three domains of life and members containing an Isf homolog usually contain multiple copies. Isf homologs contain one FMN cofactor and one 4Fe-4S cluster per monomer. Also, the 4Fe-4S cluster is ligated by a unusually compact cysteine motif. Previous works have suggested that Isf participates as an electron mediator in the fermentation of acetate to methane. Indeed, Isf is capable of reducing membrane fractions isolated from acetate-grown M. thermophila. The absolute function of Isf, however, remains enigmatic. A recent crystal structure of Isf reveals the protein to exist as a homodimeric tetramer. Isf also bears strong structural homology with the flavodoxin domain of Rubredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase (ROO) from Desulfovibrio gigas. ROO is an oxidative-stress protein which detoxifies O2 to water. In addition to this observation, isf homologs were found in operons containing annotated oxidative stress genes. Since the function and electron acceptor(s) for Isf are unknown, various electron acceptors were tested including: O2, H2O2, O2-, cytochrome c, benzoquinone, ferricyanide, and dihydroquinone. In these studies, the ability of Isf to reduce O2, H2O2, and O2- to water was revealed. In addition, the oxidative half-reaction kinetic parameters of Isf with these compounds was determined. During these studies, new redox properties are revealed suggesting the 4Fe-4S cluster is the site of Isf reduction and the FMN is the site of Isf oxidation. The kinetic parameters obtained by the reduction of Cytochrome c and O2 were catalytically efficient enough to merit physiological consideration. A role for Isf in oxidative stress is considered as well as a role in electron-transfer mediation.   \t\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1971], "author_name_tesi": "Cruz, Francisco ", "last_name_ssi": "Cruz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Francisco", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Gregory Ferry", "J Martin Bollinger Jr", "Jean Elnora Brenchley", "Squire J Booker", "Christopher Falzone"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Gregory Ferry, Committee Chair", "J Martin Bollinger Jr, Committee Member", "Jean Elnora Brenchley, Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Christopher Falzone, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Iron-sulfur flavoprotein", "oxidative stress", "methanosarcina thermophila"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Countertransference in Termination: Therapist Loss Resolution and Fear of Intimacy\n\n", "id": "7902", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2844", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examined therapist loss resolution and fear of intimacy as origins of countertransference reactions involving therapists\u2019 affective and behavioral responses to termination, potentially affecting therapeutic outcome.

HPVs are uniquely associated with and dependent on host epithelial stratification and differentiation for completion of the viral life cycle. As with other non-enveloped viruses, HPVs are taken up by the cell through endocytosis following primary attachment to the host cell. Through studies using recombinant pseudovirus particles (PsV) many host cellular proteins have been implicated in the process. Data reported in literature suggest there are structural and functional differences between recombinant and tissue-derived HPV particles. PsV particles are produced by over-expression of the viral capsid proteins in monolayer cells and thus bypass the need for stratified and differentiated epithelial tissue. Knowledge of attachment and entry by tissue-derived HPV particles is lacking due to the more efficient production and ease of use of PsV particles. \nThe objective of this thesis was to investigate some of the cell surface interactions reported to play a role in attachment and entry, using tissue-derived HPV particles. Further, we wanted to explore whether some of the most common cancer-causing HPV types shared the same requirements. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), especially heparan sulfate (HS), are the primary attachment receptor mediating infection by HPV PsV. Here we show that native HPV particles produced in a differentiated epithelium have developed different strategies to infect the host. In biochemical inhibition assays using purified GAG polysaccharides and GAG-negative cell, the four most common cancer-causing HPV types, HPV18, HPV31, and HPV45 were largely dependent on GAGs to initiate infection. However, their specificities varied. In contrast, HPV16 could bind and enter through a GAG-independent mechanism. Infections of primary human keratinocytes, natural host cells for HPV infections, supported our conclusions. \nThe proprotein convertase furin cleaves the N-terminus of the minor capsid protein L2 post-attachment to host cells and is required for infectious entry by HPV PsV. In contrast, using biochemical inhibition by a furin inhibitor and furin-negative cells, we show that infecting with tissue-derived HPV16 native virus (NV) was independent of cellular furin. We show that HPV16 L2 may be cleaved during virion morphogenesis in differentiated tissue. In addition, HPV45 was also not dependent on cellular furin for infection, but infecting with two other alpha papillomaviruses, HPV18 and HPV31, were dependent on the activity of cellular furin.\nWe extended our analysis of GAG- and furin-dependence to HPV16 molecular variants. HPV16 variants of non-European origin are associated with an increased risk for the development of cervical cancer. Our data suggests that HPV16 variants, similarly to different HPV types, have different specificities for interactions with cellular molecules for infection of the host. \nImportantly, current HPV vaccines target the major capsid protein L1 of HPV16 and HPV18, which together account for 70% of cervical cancer cases, protecting against virus infection and development of neoplasias.  However, since current vaccines are type-specific, they do not offer protection against all cancer-causing HPV types. In addition, they are cost-prohibitive to most women around the world. Thus, there is a need for the development of less expensive alternatives, such as universal microbicides in addition to the current vaccines. We tested carrageenan, a polysaccharide that has microbicidal activities against HPV PsV particles by competing with virus-GAG interactions. Similarly to the different GAG-specificities of the various tissue-derived HPV types, they displayed differential susceptibilities to carrageenan. \nOur data demonstrate that ordered maturation of papillomavirus particles in a differentiating epithelium may alter the virus entry mechanism. This study should facilitate a better understanding of the attachment of and infection by the main oncogenic HPV types. Further, our work sets a framework f0or future research on attachment and entry by tissue-derived particles and for the development of inhibitors of HPV infection.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9387], "author_name_tesi": "Cruz, Linda Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Cruz", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Linda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Matthew Meyers", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "Neil David Christensen", "David Joseph Spector", "Clare E Sample", "Janette Marie Mcallister"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig Matthew Meyers, Dissertation Advisor", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Chair", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Clare E Sample, Committee Member", "Janette Marie Mcallister, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Human papillomavirus", "HPV", "Viral Entry", "Virus Attachment", "Cell Binding", "Glycosaminoglycans", "Furin"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Helicity amplitudes on the light-front", "id": "26491", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11507", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Significant progress has been made recently in the field of helicity amplitudes. Currently there are on-shell recursion relations with shifted complex momenta, geometric interpretations of amplitudes and gauge invariant off-shell amplitudes. All this points to helicity amplitudes being a rich field with much more to say. In this work we take initial steps in understanding amplitudes through the light-front formalism for the first time.\nWe begin by looking at crossing symmetry. In the light-front it is not obvious that crossing symmetry should be present as there are non-local energy denominators that mix energies of different states. Nevertheless, we develop a systematic approach to relate, for example, 1 \u2192 N gluon processes to 2 \u2192 N \u2212 1 processes. Using this method, we give a perturbative proof of crossing symmetry on the light-front. One important caveat is that the proof requires the amplitudes to be on-shell. We also saw that the analytic continuation from outgoing to incoming particle produces a phase that\u2019s dependent on the choice of polarizations.\nNext, we reproduce the Parke-Taylor amplitudes. For this purpose we found a recursion relation for an off-shell object called the fragmentation function. This recursion relies on the factorization property of the fragmentation functions, and it becomes apparent that this recursion is the light-front analog of the Berends-Giele recursion relation. We also found this object\u2019s connection to off-shell and on-shell amplitudes. The solution for the off-shell amplitude, which does reproduce the Parke-Taylor amplitudes in the on-shell limit, turns out to be very interesting. It can be written as a linear sum of off-shell objects with the same structure as MHV amplitudes.\nFinally, we look at the Wilson line approach to generate gauge invariant off-shell amplitudes. It turns out that the exact same recursion relation appears on both frameworks, thereby providing the interpretation that our recursion relation has it\u2019s origins in gauge invariance. This also proved that the interesting, off-shell, MHV-like object that appeared algebraically in our solution is gauge invariant. We also show that for a Ward identity calculation the light-front rules must be modified.

Here I investigate the kinetics of rutile replacement by titanite during amphibolite-facies overprinting of eclogite, garnet amphibolite and anorthosite from Catalina Island, CA, the Troms\u00f8 Nappe, Norway, the North Qaidam terrane, China, and the Guichicovi Complex, Mexico.  Trace element concentration profiles across rutile rimmed by titanite, as determined by laser ablation (LA) ICP-MS, reveal Nb zoning in rutile that are interpreted to be the result of Nb back-diffusion from the rutile-titanite boundary. I present new field-based reaction rates calculated from grain boundary velocities, which in turn were calculated using a 1-D diffusion model for Nb back-diffusion into rutile during titanite replacement over the temperature range 670\u2013770 \u00b0C. These data are consistent with or slightly faster than previous estimates of regional metamorphic reaction rates, and extend the temperature and composition range over which regional metamorphic reaction rates are known.  \nFurther investigation of the kinetics of all metamorphic reactions reveals a strong correlation between heating rate (dT/dt) and net reaction rate for regional, contact, and subduction zone metamorphic settings.  This relationship is used to formulate a new expression relating net reaction rate (Rnet) temperature (T) and heating rate (dT/dt):\nRnet=(4.24*10^-11)*((dT/dt)^1.25)*exp(0.00668T)\nThis expression provides a universal prediction of metamorphic reaction kinetics at the tectonic scale and accounts for the 4-7 orders of magnitude range in metamorphic reaction rates observed in natural systems. Based on this analysis, the dynamic nature of subduction zones (high dT/dt) may result in conditions that are far from equilibrium (large \u0394Grxn), which drives faster reaction rates in these systems. \n\tExamination of the relative abundances of trace elements in rutile and titanite reveal striking differences between high temperature (amphibolite-facies) and low temperature (blueschist-facies) overprinting. I find that trace element distributions approach equilibrium partition coefficients in rocks from amphibolite-facies overprinted terranes, whereas trace element distributions did not approach equilibrium in rocks that experienced blueschist-facies overprinting. Calculated Zr-in-titanite temperatures for amphibolite-facies overprinted rocks are consistent with those reported in the literature, while Zr-in-titanite temperatures for blueschist-facies overprinting consistently overestimate temperature by 50-250 \u00b0C, suggesting that Zr does not approach equilibrium distributions during blueschist-facies overprinting. I conclude that single phase thermometers that rely upon slow-diffusing high field strength elements should not be applied to rocks equilibrated at \u2264550 \u00b0C unless attainment of trace element equilibrium can be demonstrated. \n\tIn situations where trace element equilibrium has been attained, the use of single element thermometers can be quite useful. Here I present a new method for determining 48Ti concentrations in quartz by LA-ICP-MS at the 1 ppm level, relevant to quartz in HP-LT terranes. Titanium contents in low-CL rims in the Bishop Tuff quartz grains were determined to be homogenous by EPMA (41 \u00b1 3 ppm Ti, 2\u03c3), and are a potential natural reference material. I suggest that natural quartz such as the homogeneous low-CL rims of the Bishop Tuff quartz are more suitable than NIST reference glasses as an in-house reference material for low Ti concentrations because matrix effects are limited and Ca isobaric interferences are avoided, thus allowing for the use of 48Ti as a normalizing mass. Titanium concentration from 33 analyses of low-temperature quartz from the Czech Erzgebirge is 0.9 \u00b1 0.2 ppm (2\u03c3) using 48Ti as a normalizing mass and the Bishop Tuff quartz rims as a reference material. The 2\u03c3 average analytical error for analyses of 48Ti is 8% for 50 \u00b5m spots and 7% for 100 \u00b5m spots, which offers much greater accuracy than the 35% error (2\u03c3) incurred from using 49Ti as a normalizing mass.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10152], "author_name_tesi": "Cruz-uribe, Alicia Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Cruz-uribe", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Alicia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maureen Feineman", "James David Kubicki", "David H Eggler", "John Richard Hellmann Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maureen Feineman, Dissertation Advisor", "James David Kubicki, Committee Member", "David H Eggler, Committee Member", "John Richard Hellmann Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metamorphism", "kinetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Almost Nonparametric and Nonparametric Estimation in Mixture Models\n\n\n", "id": "5855", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2446", "defended_at_dtsi": "2000-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An almost nonparametric approach for the estimation of the mixing proportion in a mixture of two distributions, when we have a vector of observations on each subject, is to define a mixture of binomials. A mixture of binomials can be obtained if the vector of observations is mapped into a vector of zeroes and ones by selecting a cut point c. In this dissertation it is shown that the estimation of the cut point c, which minimizes the variance of the estimator of the mixing parameter, does not need to be very precise for some common distributions when the means of these distributions are more than two standard deviations apart.\n\nIf more cut points are introduced a multinomial distribution is obtained and it is shown that the trinomial distribution is preferable to the binomial and the tetranomial is preferable to the trinomial distribution.

Nevertheless, it seems that if we introduce more than two cut points (a multinomial distribution with more than three regions) the gain in efficiency is not significant.\n\nNonparametric approaches are proposed for the estimation of the mixing parameter in a mixture of two continuous distributions with equal shapes and unimodal symmetric densities. In these approaches some cut points ci are introduced in order to define a multinomial distribution, three cut points for a tetranomial distribution and five cut points for a sextinomial distribution. The assumed symmetry of the component distributions is exploited in order to obtain the probabilities for each class of the multinomial approach and five methods of estimation of the parameters of the multinomial mixture are studied. These methods basically measure the concordance among the observed frequencies and the expected frequencies. We present Mathematica and S-plus program codes in order to obtain the estimates of the parameters in the multinomial mixture. A Monte Carlo study shows that for normal components, the estimators of the mixing proportion in the sextinomial approaches are comparable with the EM algorithm estimator if the means are 1.75 standard deviations apart, but the estimators of the sextinomial approaches have an efficiency of 50% with respect to the EM estimator when the distance between the means is 2.32 standard deviations.

In many instances, two-lane rural highways that pass through undeveloped areas provide high levels of mobility that are accompanied by posted speed limits that exceed 45 mph.  However, it is common for two-lane rural highways in Pennsylvania to pass through low-speed, developed areas (i.e., rural villages) with posted speed limits that are 35 mph or less.  The roadway section between the high- and low-speed environments is referred to as a transition zone.  In some cases, transition zone design may be accompanied by changes in roadway geometric features; however, it is hypothesized that drivers fail to adjust their speeds to comply with the change in the regulatory speed at the low-speed end of the transition zone.  In other instances, drivers are only informed of the posted speed limit changes by regulatory signs with no corresponding changes in the roadway geometry. \t\n\tSpeed data were collected at 20 two-lane rural highway transition zones in central Pennsylvania.  At each study site, speed data were collected at four locations: 500 feet before the transition zone, at the beginning of the transition zone, at the end of the transition zone, and 500 feet after the transition zone.  The location of the sensors permitted vehicles to be \u201ctracked,\u201d thus the final analysis database included four speed observations collected from 2,859 individual drivers for a total of 11,436 speed observations.  Highway characteristic data were also collected at each location, including geometric design features, roadside elements, and access density, among others.  The primary objective of this research was to develop speed prediction models to explain the relationship between the roadway features present along a two-lane rural highway transition zone and driver operating speeds.  Two general model specifications were considered based on the available speed data.  These included point speeds based on the \u201ctracked\u201d vehicles, and speed differentials between successive data collection points in a transition zone.   \n\tIn the point speed analysis, four repeated speed measurements were collected on each of the 2,859 drivers across 20 different sites.  Longitudinal models were used to model these data and compared to the more traditional operating speed modeling approach, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.  Use of OLS regression violates the assumption of independent observations.  The longitudinal models considered in this research were panel data models using both the fixed and random effects estimator, multilevel models, and generalized estimating equations (GEE).  From the results of the analyses it was concluded that a three-level model in which speed observations were nested in drivers and drivers were nested in sites is more appropriate in explaining the influence of highway characteristics on driver speeds along two-lane rural highway transition zones.  Key relationships between highway features and mean operating speeds in transition zones are as follows:\n-\tWhen compared to a posted speed limit of 55 mph, a speed limit of 45 mph is associated with a mean operating speed reduction of approximately 3.5 mph.  A speed limit of 25 mph is associated with a mean operating speed that is approximately 10.5 mph lower than the baseline of 55 mph.  Similarly, a posted speed limit of 35 or 40 mph is associated with a mean operating speed that is approximately 2.4 mph lower than the baseline of 55 mph. \n-\tWider travel lanes and lateral clearance distances are associated with higher operating speeds along two-lane rural highway transition zones; a mean operating speed increase of 2.4 mph is expected per one-foot of lane width increase while a one-foot increase in lateral clearance is associated with a mean operating speed increase of 0.15 mph.\n-\tThe presence of curb is associated with a mean speed reduction of approximately 4 mph while the analysis indicated that a mean speed reduction of 1 mph is associated with a one-unit increase in driveway density. \n-\tThe presence of Intersection Ahead and School/Children warning signs were associated with 2 and 1 mph mean speed reductions, respectively, while the presence of a Curve Ahead warning sign was associated with a mean speed increase of almost 1 mph, when compared to the baseline of other warning sign types.\n-\tFinally, the presence of a horizontal curve was associated with a mean speed reduction of 1.5 mph; if the horizontal curve is combined with a warning sign, a mean speed reduction of almost 3 mph is expected when compared to the baseline of a tangent roadway section. \n\tThe results from the three-level model also provided the standard deviation associated with each level of the model hierarchy.  The standard deviations of the random components from the model developed were: 3.1 mph for highest level (site cluster), 2.1 mph at the second level (driver cluster), and 6.5 mph at the lowest level (speeds).  \n\tA second data set was created in which the response variable was change in speed along the transition zone.  By considering speed change as the response variable, only one data point per vehicle (driver) was available; however, a site cluster could still be considered in the model specification.  Use of the speed differential as the dependent variable in a statistical model eliminated part of the repeated observation issue present in the point speed analysis.  As such, two general modeling methods were considered.  These included OLS regression and multilevel models in which speeds were nested in sites.  The variables that were consistently associated with speed reductions across all models were changes in the posted speed limit, reduction in paved shoulder width (1 mph reduction per one-foot reduction in paved shoulder width), number of driveways (0.36 mph reduction per one-unit increase in driveway density), school/children related warning signs (8 mph mean speed reduction), length of transition zone (0.8 mph average speed reduction per 100 foot increase in transition zone length), and presence of horizontal curve that warrants a warning sign (3.2 mph mean speed reduction is expected with this type of horizontal curve).  The presence of a Curve Ahead warning sign and tangent sections were consistently associated with a speed increase along transition zones across all models (3.2 mph average and 2 mph average, respectively).   \n\tSeveral independent variables were not statistically significant in the multilevel speed differential model when compared to the OLS regression model.  These included the change in lane width and in lateral clearance, presence of a curb, and Intersection Ahead warning sign.  Although the standard errors of the parameter estimates obtained using OLS regression were smaller than those obtained using the multilevel models, the multilevel model is a better representation of the nesting structure of driver speed differential nested within data collection sites. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2434], "author_name_tesi": "Cruzado, Ivette ", "last_name_ssi": "Cruzado", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ivette", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Todd Donnell", "Eric Todd Donnell", "Paul Peter Jovanis", "Venkataraman Shankar", "Rana Arnold", "William D Burgos"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Todd Donnell, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Todd Donnell, Committee Chair", "Paul Peter Jovanis, Committee Member", "Venkataraman Shankar, Committee Member", "Rana Arnold, Committee Member", "William D Burgos, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transition zones", "speed prediction models", "multilevel models"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows as probes of their host galaxies and the Cosmos", "id": "10911", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "405", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) represent the sole class of catastrophic phenomena seen over almost the entire history of the Universe.

Furthermore, comparing its performance to other CO2 sorbent systems is necessary to determine the feasibility of pHSA implementation.

Arrest and suspension increase the likelihood of students to miss school, homework assignments, and exams, making it difficult to earn passing grades. Previous studies have focused on the relationship between school suspension and arrest on long-term educational attainment (Kirk & Sampson, 2013). This study contributes to the literature by examining whether the frequency of arrests and school suspensions (i.e. number of days suspended or times arrested) influences the likelihood of completing high school, and whether this relationship varies by race and ethnicity. Data from the 1997 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) is used to compare the educational achievement of African American, White, and Latino youth who were arrested or suspended. The NLSY 97 follows the employment and school experiences of 12-17 year old male and female respondents over their life course. \n        The results suggest that arrest and suspension decrease the likelihood of high school completion after controlling for behavior, educational achievement, and socio-economic background. Furthermore, each additional arrest and each additional day suspended lower the odds of completing high school. Misbehavior and poor academic performance lower the odds of high school graduation.  In addition, the outcomes suggest that the effects of suspension and arrest on high school graduation do not vary by race/ethnicity. Overall, the results suggest that school punishment and involvement with criminal justice system are negatively associated with high school completion.

Since the privatization of British Telecom and the divesture of AT&T until the late 1990s, the focus had been on the impact of telecommunications reforms, i.e., privatization, introduction of competition, liberalization and establishment of independent regulatory agencies, on the industry\u2019s performance in terms of network coverage, affordability and accessibility of primarily voice-based telecommunications services, and the efficiency of networks. However, since the mid-1990s, the attention has been gradually but steadily drawn elsewhere. In the wake of the recognition of the digital divide and the revival of the concept of the Information Society, more efforts have been put into research on the newly emerging \u201cinformation industry\u201d, which combines the traditional telecommunications industry and various new information services. Research on measuring the Information Society has advanced slowly, on account of the insufficient amount of available data. Nonetheless, time has remedied this. In the past decade, a huge amount of data have been collected, and in order to exploit this data, index systems which are aimed to measure the Information Society have been devised by many national and international institutions, most of whose headquarters are based in Europe. These indices, to some extent, have taken advantage of the data, and have been able to produce preliminary results that countries can use to locate their relative standing in the world. However, they are hardly useful or helpful in setting measurable and reachable targets and pointing out a clear direction which future development of the industry should follow. A close examination of the current indices further reveals that leaving what is to be measured undefined and lacking a theoretical foundation and methodological rigidness has undermined the capability and value of these indices.\nThis thesis proposes a solution to these problems. First, it evaluates the existing indices that measure the Information Society, their underlying theories and methods, and identifies their strengths and weaknesses. The thesis further compares performance measures across the network industries that share similarities with the information industry, such as the electricity and utilities industries and the public transportation industry, in the hope that these comparisons may shed light on measurement of the Information Society. Second, it proposes a concept of information well-being, elaborates on its theoretical foundation, operationalizes the concept and derives an operational framework to translate the concept into a numeric form. In this process, the thesis addresses the following shortcomings of the existing indices: a) The concept is theoretically grounded; b) it has a clear definition as to what it is to measure, its scope and applicability; c) it has a rigid methodological framework and guidelines; and d) it defines a goal towards which the development of the Information Society should be driven, and provides tools to measure the progress towards the goal. In the end, a recommendation is put forward to policy-makers, on how to use this thesis as an example of fact-based, data-driven policy-making for the future.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9973], "author_name_tesi": "Cui, Jian ", "last_name_ssi": "Cui", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Denny Taylor", "Richard Denny Taylor", "Krishna Prasad Jayakar", "Anne M Hoag", "Eileen M Trauth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Denny Taylor, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Denny Taylor, Committee Chair", "Krishna Prasad Jayakar, Committee Member", "Anne M Hoag, Committee Member", "Eileen M Trauth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Telecommunications industry", "well-being", "measurement", "composite index"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Methodology for design, calibration, system identification and operation of an experimental Hvac system", "id": "17461", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8176", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It is well known that building control systems rarely function as designed, contributing to excessive energy use and poor environmental control performance.

Mutuality/Duality theory of service space and concept space is established. \nThe Concept Service (CS) network matrix is developed to study the network structure of service composition. The potential of CS network provides insights to identify important services and concepts. This information is used to connect the initial query with sub-components in CS network, thus reducing the computational time for the planning algorithms.  A set of heuristic service composition algorithms is developed based on CS network matrix. \nBased on the mathematical theory established, three types of multi-criteria programming models are designed to find optimal service composition solutions for the offline-planning problem. The three types of mathematical programming models are: Multi Criteria Programming(MCP), Multi Criteria Goal Programming for Optimal composition(MCGPO) and Multi Criteria Goal Programming for Non-optimal composition(MCGPN). MCP model can generate an optimal solution if solutions satisfying all the customer\u2019s functional and nonfunctional requirements exist. In addition, the MCGPO model allows to automatically select a trade-off among the objectives according to the customers\u2019 preferences. MCGPN model is fast for generating satisficing solutions.\nStochastic models are developed to compose service queries under uncertainty. In these models, nested compound work flow and service workload are considered. The algorithms directly utilize prior information of the potential of Concept Service (CS) network matrix to generate a transition matrix.

MgB2 has two conduction bands: a two-dimensional \u00a6\u00d2 band and a three-dimensional \u00a6\u00d0 band with weak interband scattering. The two gap superconductivity in MgB2 gives rise to many interesting physical properties not possible in other superconductors. The relatively high Tc combined with phonon mediated superconductivity and relatively long coherence length makes MgB2 promising for electronics applications like rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) logics and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID). The high current density and record-high upper critical field in pure or alloyed MgB2 are also attractive to a variety of high field applications including cryogen-free Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems. MgB2 may also be used in RF cavity coatings due to its low surface resistance and in photo detection due to its fast photoresponse coupled with relatively high Tc.\nHigh quality epitaxial thin films are produced by the hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD) technique. The HPCVD MgB2 thin films have the highest Tc and lowest resistivity with sharp transition of all MgB2 materials reported. The HPCVD MgB2 material is free of dendritic flux jumps due to its low resistivity. The root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of HPCVD MgB2 films can be ~1 nm when ~1% of nitrogen is added to the hydrogen carrier gas during the growth. The stability of MgB2 films in water is studied; it is found that degradation can be prevented by a thin (10 nm) MgO layer deposited on the film surface. The Tc is enhanced by tensile strain due to the Volmer-Weber growth mode and the mismatches between MgB2 and the substrate in the lattice constants and the coefficients of thermal expansion.\nHigh quality superconductor-insulator-superconductor Josephson tunnel junctions were made with various barrier formation techniques. The junction critical current densities and IcRn products are high with clear gap characteristics and low subgap currents. The Fraunhofer-pattern of Josephson supercurrent modulation in magnetic fields demonstrates excellent junction uniformity. The barrier thickness and height were estimated, and the barrier composition was studied by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Josephson tunnel junctions with non-c-axis-oriented MgB2 were made which clearly exhibit tunneling spectra from both MgB2 superconducting gaps.

Carbon isotopic analysis of the bulk organic matter extracted from core BH9-05 details the onset of the negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) of approximately 4.2\u2030 over 19,000 years (8 m of section, sampled every 30 cm) and its recovery over 50 m of section, representing 150,000 years. The CIE of terrestrial higher plant n-alkanes (~6\u2030) is larger than that of the bulk organic carbon (4.2\u2030), suggesting the CIE of the atmospheric CO2 is in the range of 4.2 to 6\u2030. We use a novel approach to modeling the excursion, forcing an Earth system model of intermediate complexity to conform to the total organic carbon isotope record, yielding rates of carbon release at the PETM for a specified isotopic composition representing end-member potential sources (methane or fossil organic matter).  We find that the peak rate of carbon addition is only a small fraction of the current rate of fossil fuel burning (9 Pg C/yr) whether the source is methane (0.3 Pg C/yr; \u00e413C = -60\u2030) or organic matter (1.7 Pg C/yr; \u00e413C = -22\u2030). Model/data comparison, especially the observed and modeled seafloor carbonate dissolution record, favors the higher peak rate and larger (~13,000 Pg C) cumulative addition associated with an organic-matter source, such as rapid oxidation of peat/coal/marine organic matter, thermal alteration of marine organic matter during emplacement of the N. Atlantic Volcanic Province, or a mix of relatively 13C enriched (volcanic) and relatively 13C depleted (methane) sources. However, model sensitivity analysis shows that while the rate and amount of carbon added (for a specified source type) is relatively insensitive to key model uncertainties, the predicted seafloor carbonate dissolution response is quite sensitive to the presumed initial ocean alkalinity and seafloor carbonate distribution (i.e., the ocean\u2019s buffer capacity against CO2 addition). Given the limited coverage of the existing deep-sea record, we cannot definitively rule out the alternative scenario involving a smaller cumulative addition (~2500 Pg C) from an isotopically lighter source (methane).\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6907], "author_name_tesi": "Cui, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Cui", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lee Kump", "Lee Kump"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lee Kump, Thesis Advisor", "Lee Kump, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["earth system model", "Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum", "\u00e413Corg", "carbonate dissolution"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "ASSESSMENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE\nPERTURBATION DURING THE END-PERMIAN MASS EXTINCTION", "id": "23553", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10647", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the link between mass extinction and extreme global warming is critical to the projections of the consequences of future climate change. The end-Permian mass extinction is the greatest biodiversity loss in the history of animal life, and occurred about 252 million years ago. This event is coeval within error with the eruption of the Siberian Traps, one of the largest continental flood basalt provinces on Earth. Sill intrusion into organic-rich sediments and contact metamorphism in the Tunguska Basin could have released >100,000 Gt CO2, driving carbon cycle perturbation and hence global warming. Many carbon isotopic measurements from\nnumerous locations, both in carbonate and organic matter, suggest there is a ~ -3 to -5\u2030 global carbon isotope excursion during the end-Permian extinction event. In this dissertation, I used multi-disciplinary approaches to explore the overarching factors that contribute to the carbon isotope excursions and their sedimentary signature. \n\nWe evaluated proxy climate data and the existing paleoclimate simulations to assess our current understanding of the link between mass extinction and climate change. Proxies indicate that prior to the end-Permian extinction, tropical sea surface temperatures ranged from ~22 to 25 oC, and possible atmospheric pCO2 values ranged from ~500 to ~4000 ppm. During the peak extinction, tropical temperatures rose up to ~30 oC while pCO2 perhaps increased up to ~8,000 ppm. We found climate models that use different pre-event pCO2 values show similar amount of CO2 doubling to replicate the observed carbon isotope excursion. \n\nWe note that the expressions of temperature change and carbon isotope excursion during the extinction event show strong heterogeneity globally, thus a spatially resolved model that considers the long-term carbon cycle has advantages over simple box models. An Earth system model of intermediate complexity, cGENIE, was used to extract the pattern of CO2 release needed to replicate the observed carbon isotope excursion across the Permian-Triassic boundary. This isotopic inversion approach is novel in geochemical modeling studies and is a more precise way to match geological records. This analysis leads us to suggest that the source of CO2 must have been significantly 13C-enriched than typical biogenic or thermogenic methane to explain the significant warming that occurred during and after the extinction event. \n\nWe then further tested the ocean acidification scenario, another consequence of CO2 emission besides global warming during the end-Permian extinction. Sensitivity analyses were carried out with a range of reasonable estimates of the initial ocean saturation state. We find it most likely that the Siberian Traps volcanism released CO2 in two major multimillennial pulses. The modeled rates of C release are dependent on the \u03b413C of the source and the initial saturation state of the ocean. We find that the initial buffering capacity of the ocean was quickly overwhelmed for many of the plausible scenarios for C release. We suggest that global warming and ocean acidification due to the Siberian Traps volcanism might have pitched the end-Permian Earth system over a critical threshold and caused the mass extinction and subsequent long recovery. \n\nIf the observed global carbon isotope excursion truly is a reflection of the global carbon cycle perturbation, we should see similar features on land. We tested this idea by evaluating organic carbon isotope stratigraphy in terrestrial Permian-Triassic boundary sections in South China. We found that atmospheric \u03b413C signals can dominate other sources of variability, and thus terrestrial \u03b413Corg is a potentially reliable tool for correlation and environmental determination during the end-Permian event. Because there are other sources of variation, however, stratigraphic correlations between marine and terrestrial sequences should only be based on carbon isotope excursions when other independent evidence of the event is available.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10281], "author_name_tesi": "Cui, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Cui", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lee Kump", "Katherine Haines Freeman", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lee Kump, Dissertation Advisor", "Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Member", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["end-Permian mass extinction", "climate change", "global warming", "earth system model", "carbon isotopes."]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "ELECTRICAL DETECTION OF BIO-MOLECULAR INTERACTIONS USING NANOMETER-SCALE GAP ELECTRODE STRUCTURES", "id": "6262", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2609", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-01-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Detecting biological molecules faster and with greater sensitivity has immediate impact on medicine and healthcare.  Disease identification and drug development rely on the ability to detect and identify biological chemicals and their interactions.  Currently, most detection techniques rely on optical methods such as a color change to determine the presence of a biological compound.  The ability to perform these tests electrically has the potential for faster and more sensitive results and the ability to couple easily with computer analysis.\nA unique sensor device and technique for detecting biological molecules has been developed.  Here, an electrical sensor with nanometer-scale dimensions is made using standard processes and equipment found in the semiconductor industry.  This sensor has the ability to be chemically modified to detect specific biological compounds.  This is the first time a device combining these properties effectively for commercial use has been presented.  Processes used in the fabrication of the device are shown to be critical in preserving the ability for chemical modification as a sensor. \nA unique chemical linking method has also been developed which allows effective biological modification of the device.  This modification of the device allows for specific biological molecules to interact with surfaces of the device.  The modification can be used to tailor the device to interact with a range of biological molecules including DNA, proteins and other small bio-molecules.  The ability of the chemistry to interact with a variety of different species is important for commercialization, because a versatile platform is more economically viable to develop.\nUsing an example system, this device electrically detected the interaction of two biological molecules.  The detection scheme makes the use of biologically modified gold nano-particles, which change the electrical characteristics of the device.  The sensitivity of the device is among the highest reported for electrical techniques, and the technique itself appears robust enough for commercial development.  \nOverall, this unique and cost-effective sensor offers sensitive detection of biological molecules.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2602], "author_name_tesi": "Cuiffi, Joseph Dennis", "last_name_ssi": "Cuiffi", "middle_name_ssi": "Dennis", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash", "Osama O Awadelkarim", "Ayusman Sen", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald", "Judith Todd Copley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash, Committee Chair", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Committee Member", "Judith Todd Copley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["BIO-MEMS", "NEMS", "MICRO-TAS", "BIO SENSOR"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Shape Grammar Composition and Salient Feature Identification for a Product Family", "id": "15216", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7589", "abstract_tesi": "In modern product design, product form and aesthetics play a major role in consumer preference and product differentiation.  Because product form design traditionally requires designers with a level of aesthetic skill and intuition, common practice is to entrust product form considerations to industrial design personnel.  The industrial design process, however, is highly subjective and does not translate well across mechanical design disciplines nor is it necessarily consistent across industrial designers.  In addition, due to economic considerations, companies are increasingly delegating industrial design activities to engineers with little formal industrial design training.  An automated or semi-automated approach for producing new designs with a consistent style would be desirable to address these issues and reduce a design\u2019s sensitivity to the background of the designer.\n\nThis thesis presents the development of such an approach.  Shape grammars have recently arisen as methods for producing designs with a coherent style with the ability to control the variation of the output shapes.  A shape grammar for a family of medical ultrasound transducers is first developed, producing a family of shapes with a common architecture in a commercial CAD package and applied to freeform surfaces without maximal line representation.\n\nThe question of shape parameter impact on product style is also examined, specifically for cases where the number of design artifacts on which to base a style is few and no formally-trained industrial design personnel are available.  A survey-based approach is proposed wherein the impact of a shape parameter on product style is evaluated by comparing design variants to a baseline design and having respondents rate the style similarities on a Likert-like scale.  Candidate parameters are screened for aesthetic significance using fractional experiment designs, identifying four significant variables.  This screening is validated using a full factorial experiment with ultrasound transducer designers and engineers.\n\nThe relative weights of the four variables are evaluated in a series of factorial experiments.  Consistent main effect and interaction effects are observed within product classes; comparisons across product class showed no statistically significant common factors.  Respondent demographics were also investigated.  Minor correlation improvements were found among some demographics such as subjects with artistic backgrounds, but survey sub-populations were not large enough in size to warrant statistically-backed conclusions.  Subject familiarity with the product line was found to significantly improve response consistency.  Follow-on experiments validated the relative weights of the four variables investigated; one variable is found to dominate style.  A second follow-on validation experiment confirms observations that non-linearity within the resulting model is significant and that model application is only valid within the variable ranges studied.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7524], "author_name_tesi": "Culbertson, Timothy David", "last_name_ssi": "Culbertson", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["product family", "style", "similarity", "shape", "aesthetics", "feature identification", "freeform surface", "engineering design", "industrial design", "design automation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF PRACTICING PASSAGE RETELL TO A FLUENCY CRITERION TO INCREASE SUMMARIZATION\n", "id": "11365", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1735", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite increased focus on reading comprehension, the literature is limited in regards to comprehension strategies that can be effectively taught, and subsequently practiced to a fluency aim.

Hydraulic fracturing uses a water based mix of chemicals and proppants to create and prop open fractures within a shale matrix. This matrix of propped fractures provides a pathway for hydrocarbon recovery. The greater the fracture complexity, the greater amount of reservoir being accessed.  Understanding the most efficient and effective way of exploiting these resources, early in play development, is essential.  This research has explored the impact of different fracture fluids on fracture complexity within Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and Pennsylvania Bluestone (Sandstone).  Water (H2O), Nitrogen (N2), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Super Critical Carbon Dioxide (SC CO2), and Breathable Air (~20% 02) were the fluids tested. Experiments were done in an unconfined setting where fluid temperature, sample temperature, and fluid flow rates were controlled and measured. This research confirms that fracture (or breakdown) pressure is a function of the fracture fluid type and its state (Alpern, 2013).  It was determined that the Standard Sample Design (blind borehole) fractures as if it was a Plugged Through Borehole PMMA Design; further, installing a plug can seed a fracture initiation point.  The location of this fracture initiation point controls the fracture geometry and complexity in this sample size.  A dual fitting Through Borehole PMMA Block Design removes the borehole termination initiation point and minimizes the membrane effect, which reduces the number of CO2 failure pressures that approach the tensile strength of the PMMA Block.  Bluestone experiments show that there is a similar relationship between average CO2 failure pressures and other Super Critical failure pressures. Although the difference between Saturated and Unsaturated experiments showed an overall slight drop in failure pressure, the range of failure pressures is not significant enough to declare there is an impact.  Post failure examination of Bluestone indicates that the pore water may be pushed out of the immediate pore space surrounding the borehole during the experiment; further, the permeability of the Bluestone may be too high to test if the pore water will control the fracture pressures.

However, research focusing on youth work shows substantial variability in the quality of these early work experiences, such as rate of pay, length of employment, job satisfaction, supervisor age, and learning opportunities. Yet much of the research on youth employment typically uses hours worked as the main predictive variable, finding that youth who work moderate hours (i.e., average 20 or less hours per week) are less likely to be delinquent than those who work intensive hours (i.e., average more than 20 hours a week) or who do not work at all. Little research has examined how the quality of youth employment influences delinquency, and scholars have not yet modeled these relationships using analyses of within-person change to more fully address issues of spuriousness and selection.\nThe purpose of this study is to extend research on youth employment by examining the effects of the quality of work on juvenile delinquency. I extend prior research in four ways: First, using longitudinal data from the 1997 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), I estimate both random and fixed effects models to assess whether changes in employment status and work intensity impact changes in delinquency during adolescence. Secondly, borrowing from criminological theory and past research, I assess whether changes in job duration, supervisor age, job satisfaction and rate of pay predict changes in delinquency among those youth who are employed. Little research has examined the quality of youth work and that which does exist has not utilized random and fixed effects modeling to test work quality effects. Further, many of these studies of quality are based on small or non-representative samples whereas the NLSY97 is large and nationally representative, allowing for testing of subgroup differences. Third, building on prior research, I consider whether the effect of work quality on delinquency is moderated by family socioeconomic background. In particular, I estimate the relationship between work experience measures and delinquency in separate models for low parental education youth and high parental education youth, and then compare the equality of these estimates. Finally, again building upon prior research, I consider whether school performance mediates the effect of work quality on delinquency.\nResults show that higher hourly pay, higher job satisfaction and older supervisors significantly reduce levels of delinquency. However, once controls for unobserved time-stable characteristics are controlled for in the fixed effects models, these relationships largely disappear, with supervisor age retaining marginal significance. The effect of supervisor age is partially moderated by parental education level, indicating that youth with parents with low levels of education are less delinquent when working for older supervisors. GPA was not found to mediate the relationships between the work experience measures and delinquency. Overall, the results suggest that work is unlikely to act as a turning point for most youth already engaged in delinquency. However, for disadvantaged youth, working in jobs with older supervisors may provide additional informal social control which works to reduce levels of delinquency. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12058], "author_name_tesi": "Cundiff, Kelsey Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Cundiff", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Kelsey", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Criminology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeremy Staff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeremy Staff, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Youth employment", "Delinquency"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Ordered Delinquency: The Effects of Birth Order on Delinquency\n", "id": "10661", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4945", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Juvenile delinquency has long been associated with birth order (i.e., the ordinal position in the birth sequence of a given family) in popular culture, though little research has attempted to explain why.

I use data on approximately 16,500 adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).

Using four waves of longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), I examine specifically the impact of these aspirations and expectations during the transition to adulthood.  The dissertation is organized into three parts.  The first part focuses on the short-term relationship between the disjunction between educational aspirations and expectations, as well as future orientation, and deviant behavior while still in high school (1 year after the initial survey).  This part of the dissertation examines the short-term effects of adolescent educational aspirations and expectations, while considering the possibility of differential effects in relation to differences in socioeconomic status and adolescent cohort.  \n\tPart two focuses on the longer-term relationship between the disjunction between expectations and actual outcomes and deviance; namely, the disjunction between the expectation of college attendance and actual college attendance, and the disjunction between the expectation of college graduation and actual college graduation.  As with the analyses in the first part of the dissertation, these analyses will also consider the possibility of differential effects by socioeconomic status and adolescent cohort.  Finally, the third part of the dissertation explores the potentially mediating role of negative affect and actual educational attainment.  This line of research examines whether higher educational expectations have any negative effects on individuals given that we have increasingly seen adolescents view college as the next step after high school regardless of whether or not they have demonstrated the skills necessary to succeed in higher education.  \n\tI find that the relationship between adolescent expectations and deviance becomes more complex as individuals move from adolescence to adulthood.  During adolescence, holding high expectations of college education serves as a protective factor.  Individuals with higher future orientations are significantly less likely to jeopardize their futures by engaging in deviant behavior.  Conversely, failing to realize realistically high expectations of college education during the transition to adulthood dramatically increases an individual\u2019s likelihood of deviance.  Overall, positive expectations of the future, regardless of how unrealistic they may be, tend to have little to no negative effects; yet, for those individuals whose realistic high expectations go unmet there is a significant negative effect that goes beyond the effects of attainment (or lack thereof) alone.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8696], "author_name_tesi": "Cundiff, Patrick  Ryan", "last_name_ssi": "Cundiff", "middle_name_ssi": "Ryan", "first_name_ssi": "Patrick ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeremy Staff", "Jeremy Staff", "Duane Francis Alwin", "Eric Silver", "Jennifer Lianne Maggs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeremy Staff, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeremy Staff, Committee Chair", "Duane Francis Alwin, Committee Member", "Eric Silver, Committee Member", "Jennifer Lianne Maggs, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adolescent Expectations", "Education", "Deviance", "Strain"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Optimization of High Speed Wire Drawing Using Finite Element Analysis\n\n", "id": "9164", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1413", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The process of pulling a wire through a series of conical shaped dies which incrementally reduces its cross sectional area is known as wire drawing.

These models show that during the drawing process the wire at the exit of the die can reach local stresses of roughly 150% of its yield strength. The required drawing force and die stress are monitored at many different drawing conditions. As the drawing speed of the wire is increased there must also be an increase in die approach angle in order to maintain a minimal stress state. The bearing length and reduction ratio of the die must be optimized for different hardening exponents. Brittle materials with low hardening exponents contain strain gradients throughout the thickness of the wire which results in tensile stresses in the outer edges of the wire and compressive stresses near the center. Materials with higher hardening exponents contain less significant strain gradients but exhibit more elastic rebounding after drawing. Optimized die geometries are specific to a desired application and understanding the relationship between the die geometry and the resultant stress states allows improvements on existing drawing techniques as well as the possibility for drawing new materials.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1402], "author_name_tesi": "Cunningham, Daniel J", "last_name_ssi": "Cunningham", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ivica Smid", "Ivica Smid"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ivica Smid, Thesis Advisor", "Ivica Smid, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Wire Drawing", "Finite Element Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Institutionally Designated Safe Spaces: Understanding How Black Students Utilize and Experience These Spaces to Develop a Sense of Belonging", "id": "24849", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11059", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This paper explores the lived experiences of twelve self-identified Black students at Middle State University (Middle State), a predominantly White institution (PWI).

However, the molecular mechanisms that link hormone signals from the cell membrane to the nuclear processes that govern DNA replication and cell division have remained mysterious.  During follicular development, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) are believed to act both independently and in coordination with one another to promote granulosa cell replication and differentiation.  Recent studies have indicated that the pathways mediating the individual, classic effects of these hormones may participate in \u201ccross-talk\u201d events, which could result in synergism or coordinated timing of events.  The goal of these studies was to investigate the ability of FSH to stimulate the PI3K/Akt pathway, an established IGF-I-activated pathway, and to impact on the transcription factor FoxO1a, which is involved in promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in multiple cell systems.  We hypothesized that FSH and IGF-I stimulation of granulosa cells results in the inactivation of this transcription factor, resulting in increased proliferation.  Experiments utilizing granulosa cell cultures demonstrated that FoxO1a is expressed and hormonally regulated in granulosa cells.  FSH and IGF-I cause phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of FoxO1a in a PI3K-dependent manner.  Additionally, we find that overexpressing wild-type (WT)-FoxO1a in granulosa cells results in increased p27kip protein, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor involved in cell cycle regulation.  In contrast, overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) truncation mutant of Foxo1a results in decreased levels of p27kip protein.  Cell cycle analysis of these DN-Foxo1a-expressing cells indicated an 8-10-fold increase in the % S-phase cells vs. null-infected cells, suggesting that inhibition of endogenous FoxO1a function removes a level of control at the G1/S transition.   Co-expression of WT-p27kip reduced the effect of the DN-Foxo1 by 50% (4-fold increase in % S-phase), suggesting that p27kip indeed plays a role in the observed FoxO1a effects.  Perhaps most interestingly, co-expression of WT-p27kip with the DN-Foxo1a also altered the subcellular localization of p27kip, causing it to be localized to the cytosol (where it cannot act to inhibit cyclinE/cdk2).  Thus, FoxO1a modulates both p27kip abundance and activity to restrict the cell cycle.  Together, these data suggest that the nuclear exclusion and inactivation of FoxO1a by FSH and IGF-I may result in the initiation or support of proliferation, in part, through regulation of p27kip.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4445], "author_name_tesi": "Cunningham, Melissa Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Cunningham", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James M Hammond", "Charles H Lang", "Richard Scott Legro", "Shao Cong Sun", "Teresa L Wood, Ph D"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James M Hammond, Committee Chair", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Richard Scott Legro, Committee Member", "Shao Cong Sun, Committee Member", "Teresa L Wood, Ph D, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Foxo1", "FKHR", "granulosa", "ovary", "p27kip", "Akt"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Policing Citizenship: The State Response to Intimate Partner Violence in Centre County, Pennsylvania", "id": "26266", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11435", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "For most of United States history, the state did not intervene in violence perpetrated in the home.

Consequently, women who reach out to the state for help often find themselves re-entrenched in familiar positions of coercive control. To address this challenge, I engage with three principal concepts from critical geography; public and private, citizenship and neoliberalism. By analyzing the state response to intimate partner violence through the intersection of these three concepts, I examine intimate partner violence as more than a violent act that happens at the scale of the home and body.

Understanding what contributes to and what detracts from job satisfaction in the work environment will help to guide the stakeholders involved in these changes. Keeping nurse practitioners, who are uniquely posited to assist in this transition satisfied, will be integral to keeping them in the workforce.\nA descriptive correlational design was used to explore the relationship between job satisfaction and interdisciplinary practice in nurse practitioners in Pennsylvania. The Misener Nurse Practitioner Job Satisfaction Scale and the Bronstein Index of Interdisciplinary Collaboration were the survey tools to measure the major study variables. The conceptual model that guided the study was developed by Koelble who modified Herzberg\u2019s Dual-Factor Theory of Job Satisfaction. The survey was administered over the Internet and potential respondents were recruited by mailed postcard, which went to every sixth nurse practitioner on a mailing list purchased from the state board and through the listserv maintained by the Pennsylvania Coalition of Nurse Practitioners. \nThere were 244 nurse practitioners who logged on to participate however; the inclusion criteria limited the sample to 190. Most were female, the majority had master\u2019s degrees, and 16% had 20 or more years of experience as a nurse practitioner. \nThe key findings of the study were that there is a strong positive relationship between nurse practitioners\u2019 job satisfaction and the degree of interdisciplinary practice they reported. Overall, nurse practitioners in Pennsylvania were minimally dissatisfied to minimally satisfied with their positions. The areas of dissatisfaction have remained consistent over the last decade.\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3481], "author_name_tesi": "Curci, Katherine M", "last_name_ssi": "Curci", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Jayne Loeb", "Susan Jayne Loeb", "Paula F Milone Nuzzo", "Kim Kopenhaver Doheny", "Kristen H Kjerulff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Jayne Loeb, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Jayne Loeb, Committee Chair", "Paula F Milone Nuzzo, Committee Member", "Kim Kopenhaver Doheny, Committee Member", "Kristen H Kjerulff, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nurse practitioners", "interdisciplinary"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "MANDATORY 10-K AMENDMENTS AND STRATEGIC DISCLOSURE: AN EXAMINATION OF FIRMS UNDER REVIEW BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION", "id": "7129", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4237", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the form of disclosure provided in mandatory 10-K amendments filed in response to review by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

However, the effects of these changes on interactions among organisms have been little studied. Here, I compile a detailed record of insect herbivory on angiosperm leaves for the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming and investigate the causes of variation in insect herbivory. I test whether the changes in temperature, atmospheric carbon dioxide, and floral diversity observed across the Paleocene-Eocene boundary correlate with changes in insect damage frequency, diversity, and composition. Because these correlations cannot be recognized without regional, high-resolution studies, this thesis makes a major contribution to the ecological understanding of disturbance and biotic response.\t\n\nInsect damage censuses were conducted at nine stratigraphic levels ranging in age from 59 to 52.5 Ma. A total of 9071 fossil angiosperm leaves belonging to 107 species were examined for the presence or absence of 71 DTs. Damage frequency, diversity, and composition were analyzed on the bulk floras and individual host species. Chapter 1 focuses on insect herbivory during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The abrupt global warming and increase in atmospheric CO2 during the PETM make it the best geologic analog for modern anthropogenic warming. Chapter 2 examines small-scale spatial variability in insect damage along two early Eocene carbonaceous shale beds. I test whether spatial variability within a bed exceeds differences between beds. Chapter 3 extends the study interval through the early Eocene Cool Period and into the Eocene Thermal Maximum, when temperatures cool and then warm to a sustained Cenozoic maximum. \n\nTemporal trends in insect damage are generally greater than intra-bed variation, which is primarily due to differing floral composition. The Bighorn Basin dataset shows a very strong positive correlation between damage diversity and temperature. Damage diversity increases as temperature increases through the late Paleocene, peaks in the PETM, decreases during the early Eocene cooling, and then increases again during the warming to the sustained Eocene Thermal Maximum. Temperature probably affects insect herbivory by allowing diverse insect populations from lower latitudes to migrate northwards and by influencing insect metabolism and population density.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1720], "author_name_tesi": "Currano, Ellen Diane", "last_name_ssi": "Currano", "middle_name_ssi": "Diane", "first_name_ssi": "Ellen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Daniel Wilf", "Mark E Patzkowsky", "Scott W Wing", "Conrad C Labandeira", "Russell W Graham", "Lee Ann Newsom"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Daniel Wilf, Committee Chair", "Mark E Patzkowsky, Committee Member", "Scott W Wing, Committee Member", "Conrad C Labandeira, Committee Member", "Russell W Graham, Committee Member", "Lee Ann Newsom, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum", "insect herbivory", "plant-insect interactions", "Bighorn Basin", "global warming"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Out-Group Marriages and Cohabitations: A Logistic Regression Approach to Studying Black, White, and Hispanic Unions\n", "id": "8410", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "152", "abstract_tesi": "The study of interracial and interethnic unions has a long and extensive history in the United States.

Fraser fir (Abies fraseri) is one of the most popular tree species, due to\nits superior postharvest characteristics and overall general appearance. Unfortunately, it is highly \nsusceptible to Phytophthora root rot and has a mortality rate considered too high for many \nChristmas tree growers. Likewise, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is in production regularly, \nbut is prone to Rhabdocline Needlecast (Rhabdocline pseudotsugae). Several control management \nstrategies exist. However, overall species care and general decline in popularity is making \nmaintenance expensive. Growers are interested in introducing exotic Mediterranean firs, \nparticularly Nordmann (Abies nordmanniana) and Turkish (Abies bornmuelleriana), due to their \nresistance to Phytophthora root rot and marketable Christmas tree characteristics. However, many \nproblems occur with storage practices, as seed viability only lasts two years at most. The goal of \nthis research project was to examine possible reasons for decline of seed viability, and to identify \npotential solutions for improving germination in individual seedlots. Standard germination tests \nwere performed on seed of Nordmann fir from seedlots collected in 2011, 2013 and 2015. \nGermination test results suggest that Nordmann fir seed quickly lose viability using conventional \nAbies storage methods. Seed moisture content in Turkish fir seed collected in 2015 was altered \nprior to stratification to determine if the moisture content percentage influenced seed germination. \nResults indicated that a change in seed moisture was not significant in germination rate. However, \nseed moisture fluctuated during prechilling. Thus, by determining a solution to stabilize seed \nmoisture during the stratification protocol, experiment results may differ. Furthermore, changes in \nseed moisture content were monitored after a 12-week period to determine adequate methods for \nseed storage. Seed was stored in three types of media; a refrigerator, freezer, and an airtight \ncontainer containing zeolite beads. Results indicated that seed in the refrigerator had absorbed the \niv \n \n \nmost moisture, while the seed stored in the freezer and zeolite drying beads had insignificant \nchanges in moisture content. Seed stratification method in Nordmann, Turkish and Fraser fir was \nalso tested to determine any differences in seed germination. While seed that underwent the \nstratification-redry method had slightly higher total germination by the end of the experiment, they \nwere not statistically significant. Nevertheless, seed moisture content changed during the \nstratification period. Finally, wasp larvae from the genus Megastigmus is making importing \nNordmann and Turkish firs seed a challenge for industry leaders. An incubation treatment exists \nfor Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) that successfully kills the insects inside seed while not \naffecting germination. The objective was to determine if the same treatment had influence on \noverall seed germination for Nordmann and Turkish fir. Results concluded that seed was \nsignificantly affected by the incubation, meaning that seed that underwent the prolonged heat \ntreatment had a lower germination rate compared to that of the control. These results suggest that \nNordmann and Turkish fir seed have higher sensitivities to traditional storage and germination \nmethods compared to other true fir species.

Little did he know that he had stumbled upon the oldest nearby star cluster. This Ph.D. dissertation establishes that cluster, now known as Ruprecht 147, as an important new benchmark for astrophysics. This involved acquiring radial velocities over an eight-year period to identify members and binaries. We performed a thorough characterization of R147 by spectroscopically measuring the metallicity and by fitting isochrones to photometry. In all, we identified ~460 candidates, measured RVs for 205 stars, and confirmed membership for 154 of these. Half of these members are binaries, which is on par with the binary fraction in the solar neighborhood. We found six blue stragglers, ten white dwarfs on the cluster cooling sequence, nine eclipsing binaries, a brown dwarf transiting a solar analog, and dwarfs with masses reaching 20% of the Sun.\n\nAges of stars are difficult to infer because stars change very little during the majority of their lifetimes. They spin down over time due to magnetic braking, which underlies the age-dating method called gyrochronology. However, this empirical relation is undetermined at sub-solar masses and ages older than 2.5 Gyr. Similarly, the related decay of chromospheric activity has been formulated into an age-dating tool, but is essentially an interpolation between young clusters and the Sun. This is troubling, given that the evolution of complex life occurred on Earth only within the last few Gyr. \n \nTo remedy this, I initiated the K2 Survey of Ruprecht 147, which produced high-precision lightcurves that are yielding rotation periods of Sun-like and low-mass stars. I also initiated a survey of chromospheric activity in old clusters. As part of this survey, I re-analyzed data for the solar-age M67 and determined that those measurements were negatively biased by interstellar gas absorption. The age-dating effort would benefit from the identification of other old, nearby clusters. We investigated the putative cluster Lod\u00e9n 1, but determined that it was not a real association. The impending release of ultra-high-precision parallaxes from ESA Gaia will enable a thorough search of the nearby Galaxy for old clusters.

The reader will find the step by step process to designing the resonant structure as well as a MATLAB script that will graphically display the effect changing various parameters may have on resonator size to assist in the design analysis.

Although the single-chamber continuous-flow design of the MEC reactor led to methanogenesis within the reactor, the energy of the gas produced by the reactor was much greater than that required to operate the MEC electrodes. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5120], "author_name_tesi": "Cusick, Roland D", "last_name_ssi": "Cusick", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Roland", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pilot Scale", "Domestic Wastewater", "Winery Wastwater", "Microbial Electrolysis Cell", "Microbial Fuel Cell", "Hydrogen", "Methane"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Nutrient and heat recovery from waste streams using microbial electrochemical technologies", "id": "19248", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9258", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microbial Electrochemical Technologies (METs) are an emerging design platform capable of converting organic matter directly into electrical energy. Two new METs were developed to enhance the sustainability of wastewater treatment. The first set of systems utilizes electrical and ionic currents to couple bio-electricity generation from wastewater organics with the recovery of wastewater nutrients via salt crystallization. The second set of METs was designed to enable the recovery of waste heat using engineered salinity gradients.\nThe first system was an energy efficient method of recovering both energy and nutrients from wastewater in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) by producing hydrogen to increase solution pH and precipitate struvite (MgNH4PO4\u22196H2O). The concept was first proven in a single-chamber MEC in which hydrogen evolution cathodes were either stainless steel 304 mesh or flat plates. The cathodes accumulated a layer of crystals, which were verified as struvite using a scanning electron microscope capable of energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Phosphate removals were low (20 \u2013 38%) because the pH increase was localized to the cathode surface. Energy produced as hydrogen was higher than the energy invested to drive hydrogen evolution, implying that MECs may be useful both as a method for hydrogen gas production and struvite production.\nIn order to increase phosphate removal and prevent cathode scale accumulation, a two-chamber MEC was designed where the cathode operated as a fluidized bed crystallization reactor. Within the cathode, hydrogen production continuously raised cathode solution pH, and a fluidized bed of seed particles provided surface area for struvite crystal growth while scoring the cathode surface. When MEC electrodes generated current, the cathode solution pH was maintained between 8.3 \u2013 8.8 under continuous flow conditions, and soluble phosphorus removal ranged from 70 \u2013 85%, as compared to 10 \u2013 20% when the fluidized bed was operated under open circuit conditions. At low current densities (\u2264 2 mA/m2), scouring by fluidized particles prevented cathodic scale formation for the duration of continuous flow experiments. At an applied voltage of 1.0 V, energy consumption from the power supply and pumping was 0.2 Wh/L (7.5 Wh/g-P). This energy requirement could be fully offset if future hydrogen recoveries could exceed 80%. These results indicate that a fluidized bed cathode MEC is a promising method of sustainable electrochemical nutrient recovery.\nThe second type of MET was developed for converting waste heat and wastewater organics into electricity using ammonium bicarbonate (AmB) salt solutions in a microbial reverse electrodialysis cell (MRC). A MRC couples microbial fuel cell (MFC) electrodes with a reverse electrodialysis (RED) membrane stack, a technology capable of recovering energy released when salt and fresh water mix. By feeding the RED stack salt solutions composed of AmB, which decomposes to ammonia and carbon dioxide gas at low temperatures (40 \u2013 60\u00b0C), MRCs can create electricity from abundant sources of low-grade thermal energy such as waste heat. The maximum power density using acetate reached 5.6 \u00b1 0.04 W/m2-cathode surface area, which was five times that produced without the dialysis stack, and 3.0 \u00b1 0.05 W/m2 with domestic wastewater. The greatest contribution to MRC power came from enhanced MFC electrode performance, which increased by more than 300% with acetate and over 700% with domestic wastewater.\nMFC electrode power production was further investigated in MRCs having a minimal number of membranes. It was observed that using only a single RED cell pair (CP), created by operating the cathode in concentrated AmB, dramatically increased power production normalized to cathode area from both acetate and wastewater. Galvanostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that power increases in the 1-CP MRC were caused by reductions in solution and kinetic resistances at the cathode. The addition of a second RED cell pair further increased power production and anode biofilm activity. Power densities achieved here were close to those previously achieved using 11 membranes, indicating near optimal electrode performance with only one or two cell pairs. When normalized to total membrane area, the minimal cell pair MRC power densities was 4 \u2013 10 times higher than previous MRCs. The rate of wastewater COD removal, normalized to reactor volume, was 30 \u2013 50 times higher in 1-CP and 2-CP MRCs than that in a single-chamber MFC. These findings showed that even a single cell pair AmB RED stack could significantly enhance electrical power production and wastewater treatment rates. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9066], "author_name_tesi": "Cusick, Roland D", "last_name_ssi": "Cusick", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Roland", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "Brian Dempsey", "John Michael Regan", "Peggy Ann Johnson", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Dissertation Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Chair", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microbial fuel cells", "microbial electrolysis cells", "struvite", "reverse electrodialysis", "ammonium bicarbonate", "wastewater"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Reading A Migrant Nation:the Aesthetics Of Internal Migration In 20th And 21st-century Peruvian Narratives", "id": "19244", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "8925", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation studies an aesthetic of spatial fractures\u2014of connections and disconnections\u2014that defines contemporary Peruvian narratives of internal migration.

By focusing on movements rather than on spaces, this aesthetic leaves behind previous fixed geographies of the city or the countryside, characteristics of urban and indigenista narratives respectively. \nWhile other traditional writings on geographic mobility emphasize the discovery, formation, and/or development of new communities/spaces, Peruvian narratives of internal migration show their fractures. These narratives unfold alternative spaces that make the survival of migrant characters possible; these characters learn to live in the fractures and to contest their oppressive reality. Such an aesthetic of connections and of disconnections portrays asymmetrical conditions and differentiating practices that make it difficult for migrants to be seen as equals to non-migrants. Hence, this aesthetic does not avoid the representation of binary relationships that stigmatized the migrant as the Other; it rather spatializes binary oppositions to recreate extant social fractures. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8766], "author_name_tesi": "Cuya Gavilano, Lorena ", "last_name_ssi": "Cuya Gavilano", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lorena", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Julia Cuervo Hewitt", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt", "John Andres Ochoa", "Nicolas L Fernandez Medina", "Sophia A Mcclennen", "Melissa Wright", "Amara Leah Solari"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Julia Cuervo Hewitt, Dissertation Advisor", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt, Committee Chair", "John Andres Ochoa, Committee Member", "Nicolas L Fernandez Medina, Committee Member", "Sophia A Mcclennen, Special Member", "Melissa Wright, Special Member", "Amara Leah Solari, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Migration", "Peru", "aesthetics", "race", "narrative", "film", "20th-21st century"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Research on Low Frequency Composite Transducers Fabricated Using a Sol-gel Spray-on Method", "id": "16223", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8204", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation is currently used in countless applications to maintain a system\u2019s operational integrity.

This procedure produces thin film transducers, which adhere directly to a substrate making it favorable in use with irregular surface geometries.

Delamination of the piezoelectric elements was determined to be caused by a large mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients. Adaptations were made to the stainless steel substrates being used in order to overcome this problem. Additionally, invar substrates were used to greatly decrease the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients between the substrate and ceramic composite.\nFabricated samples were found to operate efficiently as longitudinal transducers at frequen- cies well into the low kilohertz range.

Golf course superintendents rely heavily on chemical controls, particularly on high-valued turf areas such as fairways, tees, greens, and their immediate surrounds (collars).  These areas, particularly putting greens, are of the highest value to the course and the game of golf.  Therefore, multiple insecticide applications, targeting both adults and larvae, are made throughout the year, often using the same insecticide classes.  The overuse of insecticides, particularly the pyrethroids, has resulted in an increase in insecticide-resistant populations, and a dire need to develop alternative control strategies.  I investigated the effect that cultural practices have on L. maculicollis survival, behavior, and development in golf course putting greens to determine if populations may be reduced in these areas without synthetic insecticides and to develop Best Management Practices (BMPs) for putting greens. \nWe know very little about the effects that turfgrass cultural practices (e.g. mowing, fertilization, irrigation) have on L. maculicollis population development and damage expression, particularly in golf course putting greens.  Larval feeding damage is rarely reported in these areas, but is commonly observed on the adjacent short-mown turf (e.g. collars, fairways).  Putting greens receive the highest input of insecticides and the most frequent and intense cultural inputs.  Damage is frequently observed on collars, which receive all the same insecticide applications and cultural practices as the putting surface, with the exception of mowing height.  This may suggest that adult survival and/or larval development is affected by mowing height.  I found that mowing height had a significant effect on adult survival and behavior.  Increasing numbers of adults were removed with decreasing mowing heights.  Surprisingly, most adults were removed alive, suggesting there is a potential for moving weevils around the golf course and creating new infestations in close proximity to where clippings are disposed.  Additionally, adults deviated from their normal oviposition behavior in green\u2019s height turf, choosing to oviposit outside of the turfgrass plant rather than within the stem of the plant.  Neither larval abundance nor fitness was affected by mowing height-of-cut treatment.\nI examined the effect that time-of-day (TOD) and temperature had on adult canopy activity to determine when L. maculicollis are most susceptible to removal by mowing.  TOD had no influence on L. maculicollis adult activity in controlled lab experiments when temperature was held constant.  However, temperature appeared to influence vertical movement within the canopy.  Canopy activity was significantly reduced as temperatures decreased below 10\u00b0C.  Temperature influenced canopy activity in field observations more than TOD.   However, adults were most active during daylight hours, with very little activity at night.  Adult activity peaked when day time temperatures were between 14 and 18\u00b0C, with reduced activity on either side of this range.\n\tThe findings of this thesis suggest that L. maculicollis has the potential to develop to damaging stages in turf maintained at putting green heights throughout the region.   However, the act of mowing, especially at very low heights may affect population development and thus reduce the frequency of insecticide applications.  The fate of loose eggs remains unknown, but the vulnerability of loose eggs may be a contributing factor to the lack of damage observed in putting greens.   Finally, superintendents must be aware of how clippings are disposed of since most adults survived the act of mowing and may potentially re-infest turf neighboring disposal areas.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13671], "author_name_tesi": "Czyzewski, Benjamin D", "last_name_ssi": "Czyzewski", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Benjamin A.

It is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in working-age Americans and affects 4.2 million people with diabetes aged 40 years or older. Clinically, DR is diagnosed by identifying abnormalities in retinal vasculature. DR also has a neuronal component that can go undetected during a clinical examination due to the transparency of neural tissue in the retina. \n\nThe neurodegenerative process in DR includes structural and functional changes in retinal neurons that lead to symptoms such as delayed dark adaptation and deficits in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Changes in the composition of synapses can be important factors in compromised retinal function. Previous studies have shown that synaptophysin, a presynaptic protein, is reduced in retinas of experimentally diabetic rats. This protein is found exclusively in both plexiform layers and may be particularly important for retinal function given its role in synaptic vesicle fusion and recycling. The aim of this research was to test the hypothesis that diabetes alters specific mechanisms that regulate synaptophysin content in the rat retina. \n\nThe mRNA translation, N-glycosylation, and degradation of synaptophysin were identified as potential mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, made diabetic by a single intraperitoneal STZ injection, were used for this research. mRNA translation was measured using a 35S-methionine labeling assay followed by synaptophysin immunoprecipitation and autoradiography. A pulse-chase study was used to determine the depletion of newly-synthesized synaptophysin. Depletion of total synaptophysin was determined after treatment with cycloheximide. N-glycosylation was studied by quantifying mannose-rich (immature) synaptophysin and measuring the activity of \u03b1-mannosidases responsible for de-mannosylating the protein. \n\nThe 35S-methionine labeling assay showed that mRNA translation of retinal synaptophysin was significantly increased by diabetes. In the pulse-chase study, diabetes significantly accelerated the degradation of newly-synthesized synaptophysin in the rat retina. Total synaptophysin degradation also sped up compared to control, but only after 2 months of STZ-diabetes. The results from the glycosylation studies indicated that newly glycosylated mannose-rich synaptophysin accumulates in retinas of diabetic rats due to reduced activity of \u03b1-mannosidases responsible for de-mannosylation. Inhibition of \u03b1-mannosidases in healthy retinas specifically accelerated depletion of mannose-rich synaptophysin, mirroring the effect of diabetes on the newly-synthesized protein. Collectively, these findings suggest that diabetes disrupts N-glycosylation of synaptophysin to trigger an early degradation of its immature form and cause a reduction in synaptophysin protein content.\n\nThis study specifically characterizes diabetes-induced irregularities in retinal synaptophysin metabolism, and further suggests an abnormality in post-translational glycosylation that could affect other N-glycosylated proteins. In doing so, this work provides new knowledge on the molecular deficits that may contribute to retinal dysfunction during diabetes. Thus, the findings reported here are important contributions to the larger goal of rescuing functional changes in the retina, and ultimately preserving vision during the early stages of DR. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8323], "author_name_tesi": "D'cruz, Travis Savio", "last_name_ssi": "D'cruz", "middle_name_ssi": "Savio", "first_name_ssi": "Travis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alistair J Barber", "Scot R Kimball", "Ralph Lauren Keil", "Kirsteen Nairn Browning"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alistair J Barber, Dissertation Advisor", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member", "Kirsteen Nairn Browning, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Diabetic Retinopathy", "N-glycosylation", "Synaptophysin", "Mannosylation", "Alpha-Mannosidase"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Measuring The efficiency Of clicker training for service dogs", "id": "27508", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12150", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Clicker training, a young method of positive reinforcement training, involves an acoustical cue for clear communication to mark the exact moment a correct behavior is performed in addition to a motivating reward.

This dissertation is an attempt to lay the foundation for measuring military cooperation and understanding the forces brought forth through its expansion.  The central notion is that the set of policies related to military cooperation should be studied as a coherent whole.  The network map of military cooperation is drawn to include the various cooperative behaviors and institutions that comprise the concept, and military cooperation is estimated as a latent dyadic trait.  Data on one behavior---joint military exercises---is systematically collected and presented for the first time.  Other indicators are gathered from existing sources, and all are combined to estimate military cooperation using methods from item response theory.  Measuring international military cooperation as a latent trait provides insight into many critical research questions because these relations, as a whole, influence and structure state behavior.  The causal mechanism associated with such influence is related to the role of the military, and in particular its autonomy and the linking of security provision among states.  Two examples where such cooperation influences state behavior are with respect to the state's ability to intervene abroad and, in the event of social unrest, the state's decision to use lethal repression domestically.  The multi-policy approach is used to derive a new measure of foreign policy similarity, which is compared to previous measures and is shown to be more intuitive and empirically different.  At the system level, as states integrate their security structures, they form communities of military cooperation.  These communities, too, affect state behavior along various dimensions.  One example is through foreign policy transmission, the process by which a state transmits its preferred policy to other, more capable or willing members of their community.  Provided the integration is deep enough, communities act as single entities with behaviors unto themselves.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9226], "author_name_tesi": "D'orazio, Vito James", "last_name_ssi": "D'orazio", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Vito", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Glenn Hunter Palmer", "Philip A Schrodt", "Joseph Wright", "Diane Helen Felmlee", "James Honaker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Glenn Hunter Palmer, Dissertation Advisor", "Philip A Schrodt, Committee Member", "Joseph Wright, Committee Member", "Diane Helen Felmlee, Committee Member", "James Honaker, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["international relations", "measurement", "military cooperation", "foreign policy", "alliances", "feature selection"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "SCREENING AND DESIGN CRITERIA FOR DIFFERENT SLANTED WELLS", "id": "13008dul188", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13008", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since the development of the oil industry, engineers have been working to improve the production of wells.

This expert system requires a large amount of random sampling data to obtain numerical results. Accordingly, hundreds of different reservoir models were randomly built with their parameters changed in certain ranges. \nIn the end, three kinds of ANN expert systems were shown to be able to predict different expected values. The forward ANN model was found to predict oil, gas, and water production data. The first inverse ANN model was shown to predict reservoir thickness, permeability, porosity, area, and bottomhole pressure.

However, several obstacles prevent SMEs from expanding their activities since the lack of adequate access to capital hinders SMEs from being competitive. A possible reason for this limited access to capital may be the presence of information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders. To offset the information asymmetry between financial institutions and SMEs, the availability of lending technologies such as personal collateral, fixed-asset business lending and financial statement lending, may signal banks the availability of higher-quality projects, helping reveal risk profile of SMEs in order minimize default in loan contracts and reduce information asymmetry between SMEs and banking institutions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of lending technologies on: 1) access to capital and 2) the size of loan contracts in the Brazilian credit market, broadly focusing on SMEs in the service sector, and more specifically, on the hospitality industry. More specifically, it aimed to investigate the impact of lending technologies, such as pledging personal and business fixed assets as collateral and financial statement lending on both the likelihood of obtaining bank loans and the size of loan contracts. Using data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, this study conducted logit and ordinary least squares (OLS) analyses to investigate the proposed research aims.  The results of this study suggested that both fixed asset lending, such as business and personal collateral, and financial statement lending are important components for service and hotel SMEs to the increase of both the likelihood of access to capital and the size of loan contracts. Hotel SMEs are also more likely to obtain access to capital than other SMEs in the service sector. In addition, this study found significant evidence suggesting that larger and older SMEs are not only more likely to have access to capital, but these businesses also obtain greater loan values.

We introduce two new numerical models of the leader process that capture its onset and propagation, as briefly described below.\n\nThe first theoretical model simulates air heating and streamer-to-leader transition in gas discharges. The model accounts for all physical processes known to play a role in the conversion of a streamer corona to a leader channel. Detailed discussion on the role of electron detachment in the development of the thermal-ionizational instability that triggers the spark development in short air gaps is presented. The dynamics of fast heating by quenching of excited electronic states is discussed and the scaling of its main channels with ambient air density is quantified. The developed model is employed to study the streamer-to-leader transition process and to obtain its scaling with ambient air density. The introduced methodology for estimation of leader speeds is based on the assumption that the propagation of a leader is limited by the air heating of every newly-formed leader section. It is demonstrated that the streamer-to-leader transition time has an inverse-squared dependence on the ambient air density at near-ground pressures, in agreement with similarity laws for Joule heating in a streamer channel. Model results indicate that a deviation from this similarity scaling occurs at very-low air densities, where the rate of electronic power deposition is balanced by the channel expansion, and air heating from quenching of excited electronic states is very inefficient. These findings place a limit on the maximum altitude at which a hot and highly-conducting lightning leader channel can be formed in the Earth's atmosphere. This result is important for understating of the gigantic jet discharges between thundercloud tops and the lower ionosphere. Our simulations of leader propagation at stratospheric altitudes demonstrate that initial speeds of gigantic jets are consistent with the leader propagation mechanism, and that the observed acceleration in gigantic jets can be attributed to the expansion of its streamer zone in a medium of exponentially-decreasing air density. This process defines the existence of an altitude at which the streamer zone becomes so long that it dynamically extends all the way to the ionosphere. We extend the air heating model to simulate the effects of strong currents flowing in sprites in the mesosphere. We show that fast air heating (due to quenching of excited electronic states) in sprite cores can produce >0.01 Pa pressure perturbations on the ground, observed in association with sprites.\n \nThe second theoretical model simulates the electromagnetic radiation generated during the initial breakdown stage of lightning discharges. We use this model to describe in detail how the leader discharge dynamics generates the so-called initial breakdown pulses (IBPs) and narrow bipolar events (NBEs) observed with multi-station electric field change sensors on the ground. IBPs have been correlated with individual bursts of light that appear to be illuminations of a lightning leader channel;  as a flash evolves the location of IBP sources inside the cloud coincides with the position of negative leaders as determined by a VHF lightning mapping system. NBEs are electric field signatures with broadband waveforms resembling classic IBPs in both amplitude and duration. Nonetheless, NBEs are quite peculiar in the sense that very infrequently they are followed by conventional lightning processes. Only a small fraction of positive-polarity NBEs happen as the first event in an otherwise regular intracloud lightning discharge. Typically, the initiator-type of NBEs has no difference with other NBEs that did not start lightning, except for the fact that they occur deeper inside the thunderstorm (i.e., at lower altitudes). In this dissertation we propose that IBPs and NBEs are the electromagnetic transients associated with the sudden (i.e., stepwise) elongation of the initial negative leader extremity in the thunderstorm electric field. To demonstrate our hypothesis we use a novel model of the leader electrodynamics. It consists of a generalization of electrostatic and transmission-line approximations existing in the refereed literature. We demonstrate how the IBP and NBE waveform characteristics directly reflect the properties of the bidirectional lightning leader (such as step length, for example) and amplitude of the thunderstorm electric field.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10622], "author_name_tesi": "Da Silva, Caitano Luiz", "last_name_ssi": "Da Silva", "middle_name_ssi": "Luiz", "first_name_ssi": "Caitano", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko", "Julio Urbina", "Iam Choon Khoo", "Deborah A Levin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko, Dissertation Advisor", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member", "Iam Choon Khoo, Committee Member", "Deborah A Levin, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lightning", "Gigantic Jets", "Blue Jets", "Streamers", "Leaders", "Initial Breakdown Pulses", "Narrow Bipolar Events"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Colored Avocado Seed Extract With Antioxidant,            Anti-carcinogenic And Anti-inflammatory Effects", "id": "12666", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1593", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is an increasing consumer demand for and scientific interest in new functional food ingredients. Avocado is a commercially important crop and studies have shown that the pulp may have benefits to cardiovascular health, dermatological health and possibly anti-cancer activity. Despite being important historically, the avocado seed is considered a waste product and does not find uses currently. New research is beginning to show its potentially useful functional properties. We report here that avocado (Persea americana) seed when crushed with water develops an orange color in a time-dependent manner. Heat treatment of the seed prevented color development, whereas addition of exogenous polyphenol oxidase (PPO) restored color development. The orange color intensified as the pH was adjusted from 2.0 to 11.0 in solution, and these changes were only partially reversible in the presence of oxygen but completely reversible when the pH was adjusted and readjusted in the absence of oxygen. The color was found to be stable in solution form at -18 oC for two months at pH 7.5.\nThe colored avocado seed extract (CASE) was found to have radical scavenging activity, by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EC50 = 42.1 \uf06dg/mL) and antioxidant activity in oil-in-water emulsions. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) value of CASE was 2012.1 \u00b1 300 TE/mg.\nCASE inhibited the growth of human cancer cell lines (lung, colon, breast, and prostate) (IC50= 19.1-132.2 \u03bcg/mL) in vitro. LNCaP prostate cancer cells were the most sensitive to the effects and further studies showed that CASE inhibited cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase by decreasing expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E2. Further it induced apoptosis as indicated by cleavage of caspase 3, cleavage of poly (ADP \u2013ribose) polymerase (PARP) and externalization of phosphatidylserine. It also reduced the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB, a transcription factor which promotes cell survival and replication. \nIn lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages, CASE reduced the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1), and NO, a potent inflammatory mediator. Reduced NO production correlated with reduced iNOS expression. CASE reduced the formation of Prostaglandin E2, a pro-inflammatory mediator and inhibited Phospholipase A2 (IC50 = 36 \u00b5g/mL) by a non-competitive mechanism. CASE reduced LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB, transcription factor with pro-inflammatory actions.\nOverall, these results suggest that the avocado seed may be a potential source of natural colorant which could impart additional functions including radical scavenging, cancer preventive activity and anti-inflammatory activities.

In Study 1, we experimentally manipulated leader gender and controlled for leader behavior\u2014including the leader\u2019s demonstration of power over low power people. We also measured low power men\u2019s and women\u2019s perceptions that the leader was worthy of power and engagement in various forms of undermining behavior (e.g., disagreement with leader\u2019s decisions, ignoring the leader\u2019s input).  We expected low power men to be more likely to undermine female leaders than male leaders. However, we found the converse: Low power women were less likely undermine male leaders than female leaders, whereas low power men were equally likely to undermine female and male leaders. Study 2 was the same as Study 1, but, to test possible indirect effects of leader and/or participant gender on undermining behaviors, we additionally measured: participants\u2019 feelings of discomfort when thinking about their performance being seen by others, anger, expectancy violations at the leaders\u2019 demonstration of power, and fear of punishment from the leader for undermining. Consistent with the mechanisms expected to produce gender differences in undermining behavior, female leaders were seen as less worthy of their power and were less respected than were male leaders; perceived power worthiness and respect, in turn, predicted greater undermining behavior.

First, male leaders were feared less than female leaders and lack of fear, in turn, predicted the greater undermining of male leaders than female leaders (via ignoring the input of male leaders more than female leaders). Second, low power women felt more discomfort at the thought of others seeing their performance than did low power men, and that discomfort, in turn predicted perceptions that leaders were less power worthy and, subsequently women\u2019s greater undermining of leaders (via more disagreement with leaders decisions). Third, low power women experienced more expectancy violation at a female leader\u2019s demonstration of power compared with a male leader\u2019s demonstration of power. Fourth, low power men were more likely than low power women to undermine leaders (via ignoring the leader\u2019s input).

To achieve increased efficiencies and improved environments, project teams seek to optimize building systems through the iterative process of integrated design. These sustainable delivery methods are maturing, and there is a growing population of sustainable buildings in operation. Thus, a fundamental question arises \u2013 are sustainable buildings performing as expected? And, how can building performance be comprehensively measured?\n\nThis research investigates sustainable building performance and demonstrates a new methodology for evaluating buildings using the House of Quality matrix to structure the data. The matrix synthesizes data from building operations (including occupant satisfaction, operator satisfaction and actual building performance) to evaluate with respect to the original design intent. Two recent projects provide empirical data collected through an embedded research program.\n\nRigorous data collection procedures were developed to provide information describing building performance. Occupant data was collected using a survey instrument and sampling techniques based on social science research methods. Data collection from building operators was based on triangulation, collecting data through interviews of different operator groups and through the environmental management and control system of each building. Project data was collected through field and embedded research programs and was based primarily on project documents and focused interviews of project team members.\n\nUpon completion of the three point evaluation, building performance is described on many levels using the House of Quality to structure the data. Performance metrics, based on the original design intent of the building, are rated by the user groups to enable cross comparison. The House of Quality speeds the process of analyzing the performance data to identify the crucial performance aspects for all stakeholder groups. This is a significant advance from existing research and evaluation practices. By quickly identifying critical building areas, resources are leveraged to investigate building systems of highest importance.\n\nThe results of this research demonstrate the importance of the project team\u2019s focus on the customer during project delivery \u2013 the owner organization, as well as significant end-user groups. In each of the two applications of the methodology, the research highlights the tensions that exist between the end-users and the project managers in organizations. The two applications of the building evaluation methodology also show that sustainable buildings do not necessarily perform better than their non-sustainable counterparts.\n\nThis methodology provides feedback that is crucial to building owners and project teams as sustainable design and construction strategies continue to penetrate the construction industry. The results also indicate that project teams must continue to adapt project controls to establish owner values early in the project and focus design solutions towards these values. For their part, building owners must coordinate user groups to define their multi-layered definition of value and supply timely information to the project team for effective decision making in design.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4887], "author_name_tesi": "Dahl, Peter Keith", "last_name_ssi": "Dahl", "middle_name_ssi": "Keith", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael J Horman", "David R Riley Ii", "John Messner", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael J Horman, Committee Chair", "David R Riley Ii, Committee Member", "John Messner, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Stuckeman Family Building", "sustainable design", "post-occupancy evaluation", "POE", "building evaluation", "occupant survey", "Pentagon Renovation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Staging Building Energy Retrofits", "id": "20347", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9646", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A significant portion of energy consumption use globally is from providing energy services in buildings. Retrofitting commercial buildings to use significantly less energy is an essential strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve energy supplies.\nThe building energy efficiency market has significantly expanded in recent years and many facility managers and building owners are installing energy efficiency measures to reduce energy use in their buildings. This is primarily driven by a desire to save on energy costs, and energy efficiency measures are subject to a short investment payback period of 3-5 years. As a result, priority is given to the easiest, most reliable, and highest payback measures - lighting, building controls, and HVAC system replacements.\nAs energy conservation goals become more stringent and easy measures are exhausted, professional experience is brought in, usually in the form of an energy audit, to determine further measures. A new set of benchmarking tools and building energy simulation tools have been developed to fill the need for measure identification, especially for smaller commercial buildings that cannot afford the full expense of a professional energy audit.\nEnergy benchmarking and audit tools recommend measures for a building from a statistical comparison of end-use energy consumption to the energy use of a set of similar buildings, recommending measures with the best payback. While this approach allows for rigorous comparison and ranking in relation to the current building stock, it does not consider the technically achievable potential of a building that may be important in the long term given significant societal efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and conserve energy resources for higher-value use by future generations.\nThis work quantifies the impact of alternately ordering energy efficiency measures on total energy cost, consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. This is done by comparing a decision strategy for energy retrofits where best-payback options are installed first to a decision strategy that sets a clear future target for energy savings and back-casts to determine which measures to take. The nature of decision-making for long term energy efficiency is complex, as technological, policy, and energy futures are highly uncertain and interdependent.

Model-based approaches better distinguish between infants whose looking time responses exhibit systematic decreases over trials and infants who do not.  Use of model-based measures provide increased sensitivity for the detection of post-habituation recovery responses to novel stimuli, even when conventional methods based upon the 50%DC fail.  Finally, model-based measures can be implemented using fixed numbers of habituation trials (as few as seven), eliminating the need for online computation of habituation criteria between trials.\n\tThe current study used a conventional infant control habituation paradigm with 55 infants (aged 4-6 months) to observe pre- and post-habituation responses to one of three pairs of visual stimuli.  Infants were repeatedly presented with one stimulus from the pair for up to a maximum of 15 trials, or until they achieved the 50%DC.

Roughly one week later, infants were tested a second time using the same stimulus pair, but reversing their roles such that the habituating stimulus from the first visit became the novel stimulus on the second visit.  Looking time responses for each infant visit were classified under one of four habituation models using BIC (Ramsey & Schafer, 1997, p. 343-345), and the magnitudes of post-habituation recovery were examined using both conventional and model-based measures.

With unique combination of properties such as low density, high strength, thermal stability and corrosion resistance, ceramics are essential for aerospace and other engineering applications involving extreme environments, including gas turbines, thermal protection tiles and heat exchangers for corrosive agents. However, current application of ceramics is limited due to their low fracture toughness. In recent studies, nanoporous ceramics demonstrated unusual deformation mechanisms such as shear banding, pore collapse, and pore compression. While these behaviors introduced by nanoporosity can possibly enhance macro-scale toughness of ceramics, implementation of such mechanisms in macro-scale still requires more thorough multi-scale understanding of the mechanisms' drivers and limitations. In this study, the effects of nanoporosity on mechanical properties and deformation behaviors, particularly pseudo-plasticity, of ceramics were studied by conducting nanoindentation tests on anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes. More specifically, key deformation mechanisms of nanoporous ceramics and their transition, along with the correlation between the above mechanical deformation mechanisms with measured micro-scale mechanical properties such as elastic modulus and hardness were studied. The AAO samples with porosity ranging from ~10-30%, pore size from ~38-210 nm and different material phases (amorphous and polycrystalline) were tested using Berkovich and cube-corner tips with indentation depth up to 2 \u03bcm and 4 \u03bcm and resulting indentation load up to ~400 mN. Mechanical properties including elastic modulus and hardness were measured. Deformation behaviors were observed by post-indentation scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) inspections and were correlated with the mechanical properties. Inspection of the indented AAO sample surface revealed the existence and trends of multiple deformation mechanisms including radial/subsurface fracture, nanocracks, shear banding in the form of arrays of collapsed nanopores and localized pore compression for AAO samples with varying pore size, porosity and material phase. For example, shear banding and localized pore collapse, compression behaviors are more easily triggered at medium to high porosity (~20-30 %) and small inter-pore distance (~107 nm). For AAO samples with large inter-pore distance and low porosity, only nanocracks or radial/subsurface fracture can be observed. Among these deformation mechanisms, shear banding forming around indentation impression created by cube-corner tip are of the most interest, as they can potentially result in quasi-ductility with limited compromise of materials mechanical properties. In future, these studies can be extended to correlating nano-pore deformation with macro-scale fracture toughness, potentially leading to development of toughened ceramics without weakening.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14397], "author_name_tesi": "Dai, Jingyao ", "last_name_ssi": "Dai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jingyao", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Namiko Yamamoto", "Jogender Singh", "Philip John Morris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Namiko Yamamoto, Thesis Advisor", "Jogender Singh, Committee Member", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ceramics", "Fracture", "Nanoporous", "Anodic Aluminum Oxide", "Nanoindentation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Gaining Big Picture Awareness in Enterprise Cyber Security Defense", "id": "22382", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10176", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cyber security is nowadays facing \u201ca sea of sensed data\u201d, especially in the enterprise environment.

Detecting and preventing intrusions in cyber space is like \u201ccatching big fishes in the sea\u201d. Like fishermen, we need a well-knit \u201cfishing net\u201d to capture cyber attacks. As researchers, we first propose an interconnected enterprise-level and multiple-layer model called SKRM (Situation Knowledge Reference Model).

Three such problems are identified: the zero-day attack path problem, the network service dependency discovery problem and the challenges to traditional cyber security diagnosis. This paper then presents solutions to them as three systems. The first system is named Patrol to correctly and efficiently identify zero-day attack paths. The second system is called Snake to accurately and quickly discover the network service dependencies. The third system is named X-ray to raise alerts in a profile by taking X-ray pictures for cyber-attacks in a fine-grained and cross-machine way.\n\nAll the three systems\u2019 design benefits from the cross-layer paradigm of SKRM. With their soul rooted in SKRM, the idea and design evolve from system to system. At the same time, all systems contribute to the whole construction of SKRM-enabled big picture situation awareness. Specifically, Patrol constructs the network-wide system object dependency graph as the OS Layer graph, Snake further generates the network service dependency graph as the App/Service Layer graph, and X-ray further correlates alerts with the system object dependency graph (OS Layer) at the points of policy violations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9864], "author_name_tesi": "Dai, Jun ", "last_name_ssi": "Dai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peng Liu", "Peng Liu", "John Yen", "Heng Xu", "Wang Chien Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peng Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Peng Liu, Committee Chair", "John Yen, Committee Member", "Heng Xu, Committee Member", "Wang Chien Lee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cyber security defense", "enterprise network diagnosis", "situation awareness", "big picture", "zero-day attack path", "service dependency"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "NEW PHOSPHORUS LIGANDS: DEVELOPMENT AND\nAPPLICATIONS IN TRANSITION METAL CATALYSIS\n", "id": "7506", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5056", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Transition metal catalyzed reactions are among the most powerful and direct approaches for the synthesis of organic molecules.  During the past several decades, phosphorous-containing ligands have been extensively used in transition metal catalyzed C-C and C-H bond forming reactions.  Development of new phosphine ligands for palladium catalyzed coupling reactions and rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenations are the focus of this dissertation.  A variety of triazole-containing monophosphine ligands have been prepared via efficient 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of readily available azides and acetylenes.  Their palladium complexes have been investigated in amination reactions (up to 98% yield) and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions (up to 99% yield) of electronically unactivated aryl chlorides.  A CAChe model for one of the Pd-complexes shows that a Pd-arene interaction might be a rationale for its high catalytic reactivity.  A new class of C1-symmetric bisphosphine ligands with three hindered quadrant motif has been obtained through facile synthesis from chiral binol derivatives.  Their rhodium complexes have exhibited high enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee) in the asymmetric hydrogenation of various unsaturated prochiral olefins, providing an efficient catalytic system for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral amino acids and amines.  Utilizing a rhodium complex of an electron-donating bisphosphine ligand (TangPhos), a highly efficient method for the enantioselective synthesis of a new class of N-aryl substituted \u0192\u00d2\u0192{amino acid derivatives has been developed with high conversions and enantioselectivities (up to 96.3% ee).

Cocoa shells, generally considered a by-product of cocoa processing, have low economic value. Previous research has focused on the polyphenols that can be extracted directly from nibs with aqueous-organic solvents, the so-called \u201cfree\u201d forms. In grains, fruits, coffee beans, and nuts, many phenolic compounds exist in significant amounts bound to plant fibers through ester and ether bonds. Since cocoa fiber has been shown to have antioxidant capacity, and cocoa shell is a rich source of dietary fiber, it was hypothesized that both cocoa nib and shell contain bound phenolics.\n\nThis study aimed to identify and quantify the bound phenolic compounds in both cocoa nib and shell. In addition, the effects of the industrial cocoa processing operations, alkalization and roasting, on the phenolic content in cocoa beans were investigated. \n\nRaw Trinitario cocoa beans were alkalized for 0, 60, or 120 minutes. They were then dried and roasted for 30 minutes at 110, 130, or 150 \u00b0C. This 3 x 3 experimental design allowed analyses of both main factor and interaction effects. The nib and shell were then separated, each component was ground, and the pH and color measured. The shell and nib powders were defatted, and the free phenolics were extracted. Bound phenolics were liberated by alkaline hydrolysis with NaOH and extracted in a manner analogous to the free phenolics. Analyses by HPLC coupled with UV and electrochemical (ECD), and UPLC coupled with mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detections were conducted to identify and quantify the major phenolic compounds in each fraction. Principal component analysis (PCA), multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), analysis of variance (ANOVA), and quadratic regression were used to analyze the phenolic profile.\n\nThree flavonoids, (-)-epicatechin, (+)-catechin, and quercetin, and five phenolic acids, 4-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids, were identified and quantified in free and bound forms. For non-alkalized cocoa roasted at 110\u00b0C, the total phenolic content (TPC) of the free fractions (70.9 mg gallic acid equivalents [GAE]/g defatted nib and 18.85 mg GAE/g defatted shell) was close to literature values, and the shell contained higher bound TPC (61.34 mg GAE/g) than the nib (47.75 mg GAE/g). These non-alkalized cocoa beans roasted at 110\u00b0C contained 116.31 \u03bcg/g and 164.08 \u03bcg/g of bound (-)-epicatechin, and 125.72 \u03bcg/g and 115.28 \u03bcg/g of bound (+)-catechin in nib and shell, respectively. The majority of phenolic acids were in bound forms in both cocoa nib and shell, and, the most abundant bound phenolic acids in nib was 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (397.11 \u03bcg/g), whereas in the shell, it was protocatechuic acid (363.03 \u03bcg/g). There were significant differences in phenolic contents between free and bound fractions, nib and shell fractions, and water soluble and water insoluble fractions. Alkalization and roasting had significant effects on TPC, (-)-epicatechin, and (+)-catechin contents in nib in free fractions, but not in their bound fractions suggesting that these bound phenolics were likely less vulnerable during alkalization and roasting.

It is also the first well established two-band superconductor. The two different superconducting gaps are caused by the electron-phonon interactions in two weakly interacting bands. Previous research in the group has established a method to fabricate high quality MgB2/native oxide/superconductor planar tunnel junctions and revealed a distribution of gap values in MgB2 from the quasiparticle tunneling spectra. Those results confirmed the importance of the anisotropic electron-phonon interaction. In this thesis, the effect of electron scattering in the tunnel junctions, either from the MgB2 film or the junction interface or barrier, are studied. The scattering was shown to smear out the gap distribution structures in the tunneling spectra. Deterioration of the MgB2 film surface was also found to cause an increase in the \u03c0 gap value, likely due to an enhancement of interband scattering.

Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) measurements first demonstrated an induced superconducting energy gap in topological insulator Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 in the NbSe2/Bi2Se3 and NbSe2/Bi2Te3 heterostructures. In this thesis, PCAR spectra revealed an induced energy gap in the bulk of Bi2Se3 due to the superconducting proximity effect from NbSe2. The gap values were consistent with the bulk superconducting gap observed by the ARPES and STS measurements. The gap was ~0.16 meV at low temperature in a NbSe2/16QL Bi2Se3 heterostructure. In addition, below 0.45 K, a plausible second energy gap ~0.12 meV appeared in the NbSe2/16QL Bi2Se3 PCAR spectra which could indicate a superconducting gap in the topological surface state.\n\nBesides spectroscopic measurements on superconducting energy gap features, a study of high-field properties of carbon-doped MgB2 superconducting thin films prepared by hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD) using the trimethylboron (TMB) precursor source is included in Chapter 5. MgB2 holds great potentials for high magnetic field applications due to its high Tc. Previous research in the group on carbon-doped MgB2 thin films by HPCVD using a metal-organic source (MeCp)2Mg showed significantly enhanced upper critical field Hc2 above 70 T. In this work, another precursor source TMB, was used as the carbon source. The heavily C alloyed films using TMB source show better high parallel Hc2 than the films using (MeCp)2Mg source (  slope as high as ~ 8.3 T/K near Tc). The behavior is found to depend on the unique microstructure of the films, which consists of few-nanometers thick MgB2 layers separated by non-superconducting MgB2C2 layers. It leads to an increase in the parallel Hc2 by the geometrical effect, which is in addition to the significant enhancement of Hc2 due to changes of the scattering rates within and between the two bands. For the applications of MgB2 in high magnetic fields, the high Hc2 values observed are very promising.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9397], "author_name_tesi": "Dai, Wenqing ", "last_name_ssi": "Dai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenqing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qi Li", "Qi Li", "Moses Hung Wai Chan", "Renee Denise Diehl", "Nitin Samarth", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qi Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Qi Li, Committee Chair", "Moses Hung Wai Chan, Committee Member", "Renee Denise Diehl, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Superconductor", "Tunneling", "Point contact", "Topological superconductor", "multiband superconductor", "proximity effect"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "An X-Ray Study of Gravitational Lenses", "id": "6391", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6665", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Gravitational lensing of distant quasars by intervening\ngalaxies, where multiple images are formed, is a spectacular phenomenon in the universe.\nWith the advent of Chandra, it is\npossible to resolve for the first time in the X-ray band lensed quasar images with separations\ngreater than about 0.3 arcsec.

Geographers use categories to conceptualize, interpret and communicate phenomena, such as land cover, urbanization, regions of economic growth, etc.  Inductive machine-learning enabled by computers has proved to be a powerful tool for categorization in increasingly complex geographical datasets.  Machine-learning tools are able to locate clusters of patterns or partitions in the space constructed from variables, which, however, are often hard for humans to understand and interpret. Furthermore, the data-driven clusters or patterns provided as results are not guaranteed to be appropriate in terms of \u00a1\u00b0information classes\u00a1\u00b1 which are meaningful and important to users. This research provides a two-part solution to this problem.\nIn the first part, a cognitive model of category development is synthesized to emphasize the integration of data-driven and theory/knowledge-based categories. Inductive learning from data examples provides data-driven classes or clusters. Human knowledge is employed in supervised category development, and develops generalized category models for GIS communities. The construction of categories is a problem of the integration between \u00a1\u00b0information classes\u00a1\u00b1 (categories) and data-driven classes provided by machine learning. This model provides an integrated approach combining machine learning and human expert knowledge, and then improves communication, representation and sharing of categories during their development.\nIn the second part, the integrated category development model is structured and optimized by combining visualization techniques and exploratory statistics with machine-learning tools. The visualization interface enables preprocessing of examples, facilitates an examination of the uncertainty in category design, and allows users to visually explore feature space. The combination of visualization and machine-learning supports the construction of categories, including the exploration for appropriate methods in category development, e.g. choosing between different types of classifiers, selection of appropriate training examples, rejection of outliers. This combined method of category development incorporates human expertise into the data-driven machine-learning by the visual interface, which allows controls on machine-learning tools and coordination among tools. The communications between the examples, description, categories and human expertise are, thus, enhanced and an integrated category development system is achieved. The integrated category development model is implemented as a series of visual and computation components and connected into a workflow design using GeoVISTA Studio.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6638], "author_name_tesi": "Dai, Xiping ", "last_name_ssi": "Dai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiping", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Gahegan", "Alan Maceachren", "Brenton Yarnal", "Frederico T Fonseca"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Gahegan, Committee Chair", "Alan Maceachren, Committee Member", "Brenton Yarnal, Committee Member", "Frederico T Fonseca, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Concept", "Visualization", "GIS", "Category", "Machine-learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "INTEGRATION OF IRON AND TRINEXAPAC-ETHYL INTO NITROGEN FERTILIZATION REGIMENTS FOR MANAGING FERTILIZER AND WATER REQUIREMENTS OF PENN A-SERIES CREEPING BENTGRASS (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i> L.)

Nitrogen fertilizers, especially those applied to porous sand-based putting green root zones; pose a threat to groundwater quality due to leachate NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pollution. Meanwhile, liberally applied N is associated with excessive clipping production, reduced putting green speed, decline in root growth, and exacerbated summer stresses. Research indicated that some N requirements can be substituted by iron (Fe) fertilization with equivalent visual quality and that lower N inputs are directly associated with lower evapotranspiration and consequently less water requirements. Trinexapac-ethyl (TE), a gibberellic acid inhibitor, is known to reduce clipping yield and promote turfgrass tolerance to environmental stresses. We thus hypothesize that N and water fertilizer requirements of creeping bentgrass putting greens can be reduced by TE and Fe treatments and that better rooting, fewer clippings, faster putting green speed, and more drought resistance may also be obtained with reduced N fertilization and concurrently applied Fe and TE. \nField experiments in 2007 and 2008 were conducted simultaneously on Penn A-series creeping bentgrass putting greens based on United States Golf Association (USGA) specified sand and on a Hagerstown silt loam. Field experiments conducted in 2007 investigated the partial substitution of N by Fe in the fertility programs of \u2018Penn A-4\u2019 creeping bentgrass putting greens. Both sand- and soil-based putting greens were treated with combinations of Fe rates ranging from 0 to 4.9 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> mo<sup>-1</sup> (as FeSO<sub>4</sub>&#8729;7H<sub>2</sub>O) and N from 15.5 to 43.1 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> mo<sup>-1</sup> (as NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>), every 6 or 12 d, from May to October. Fertilizer rate combinations were arranged in a response surface design while application frequencies in a strip design, with a total of 144 experimental plots. Turfgrass color, canopy density, clipping yield, tissue nutrients/carbohydrates, and rooting parameters were measured to evaluate growth and visual quality. Field experiments conducted in 2008 investigated the effects of combined N, Fe and TE treatments on turfgrass quality and N requirements of \u2018Penn A-1/A-4\u2019 creeping bentgrass putting greens. Both sand- and soil-based putting greens were treated with factorial combinations of three NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> rates (15, 30, or 45 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> mo<sup>-1</sup>), three FeSO<sub>4</sub>&#8729;7H<sub>2</sub>O rates (2.5, 5, or 7.5 kg Fe ha<sup>-1</sup> mo<sup>-1</sup>), and three TE application frequencies (every 5, 10, or 15 d, at the rate of 0.102 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> mo<sup>-1</sup>), from May to October. Fertilizer treatments were applied every 10 d. These experiments were arranged in an incomplete block design with a total of 120 experimental plots. Irrigation was largely suspended in two extended periods and practiced only to prevent severe dehydration. Turfgrass color, canopy density, clipping yield, leaf water content, ball roll distance, rooting parameters, tissue nutrients, and carbohydrates were measured to evaluate growth, visual quality, and stress tolerance. \nNitrogen was the major driver for shoot growth and leaf carbohydrate accumulation in both years but significantly inhibited root growth at higher rates in 2007. Greener turfgrass color was observed at the combination of high Fe and N rates. Iron rates higher than 2.5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> mo<sup>-1</sup> are more likely to produce synergistic effects on turfgrass color with N applications. Iron had generally limited effects on clipping yield but appeared to reduce shoot growth at higher N rates. Iron reduced canopy density regardless of N rate in both years. The root growth inhibition observed at higher N rates appeared to be relieved with Fe fertilization in 2007, which was probably related to the shoot growth regulation effects of Fe. Nitrogen and Fe fertilizers applied every 6 d produced more stable responses in turfgrass color and canopy density than when applied every 12 d in 2007. The three TE application frequencies did not affect most of turfgrass growth and quality parameters in 2008. The difference among the closely spaced TE reapplication intervals may have been too subtle to detect under field conditions. \nAccording to our field studies in 2007 and 2008, we recommend to substitute part of the N requirements of Penn A-series creeping bentgrass putting greens with 4 to 6 kg Fe ha<sup>-1</sup> mo<sup>-1</sup> to manage N inputs around 25 to 35 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> mo<sup>-1</sup> for less shoot growth, greener turfgrass color, better rooting, and less water requirements. Reduced canopy density may occur with reduced rates of N and more input of Fe but canopy density should stay in the acceptable range with moderate N inputs, as observed in our field studies. Our research suggests that the partial substitution of N with Fe minimizes the negative impact associated with intensive N fertilization while maintaining optimum turf quality. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3252], "author_name_tesi": "Dai , Jing ", "last_name_ssi": "Dai ", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alfred J Turgeon", "Alfred J Turgeon", "James Landis Rosenberger", "Maxim J Schlossberg", "David Robert Huff", "John Matthew Schmidt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alfred J Turgeon, Dissertation Advisor", "Alfred J Turgeon, Committee Chair", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member", "Maxim J Schlossberg, Committee Member", "David Robert Huff, Committee Member", "John Matthew Schmidt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["trinexapac-ethyl", "nitrogen", "iron", "creeping bentgrass"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Design and Analysis of a Magnetic Levitation System for Control Systems Courses\n", "id": "11237", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2962", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this thesis is to develop a low-cost electromagnetic levitation test bed that can be used to demonstrate concepts of feedback control systems as applied to linearized models of non-linear systems. This test bed is particularly interesting because it can be used to demonstrate both repulsive and attractive levitation. From a control standpoint, these correspond to stable and unstable equilibrium points of a non-linear system. An inexpensive commercial system, using attractive levitation, is analyzed and later compared to the developed test bed as an educational tool. Parametric modeling and system identification techniques are used to determine the linearized models of both systems around an operating point. These models are used in the design of feedback controllers, which are implemented and verified experimentally. Experimental results suggest that heating due to power dissipation in the electromagnet varies the system model over time, resulting in degradation of the transient response characteristics. Overall, the developed electromagnetic levitation test bed proves to be a cost-effective educational tool for both undergraduate and graduate level studies of control systems topics.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2955], "author_name_tesi": "Dalenberg, Jason ", "last_name_ssi": "Dalenberg", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Louis Schiano", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano", "Ji Woong Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Louis Schiano, Thesis Advisor", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano, Thesis Advisor", "Ji Woong Lee, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["compensator design", "system identification", "design and analysis", "magnetic levitation"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Les Ondes d\u00e9cha\u00een\u00e9es: Analyse culturelle des radios libres fran\u00e7aises, 1977-1981\n\n[Unchained Airwaves: A Cultural Analysis of Free Radio in France, 1977-1981]", "id": "6022", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4349", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-09-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Apparues au printemps 1977 et rest\u00e9es ill\u00e9gales jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lection de Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidence de la R\u00e9publique en 1981, les radios libres ont boulevers\u00e9 le paysage radiophonique fran\u00e7ais.

Local and specialized (mostly political, musical, and community-based), free radio stations were started by small teams and operated with modest technological means. They offered a true alternative to existing national stations. To the uniformity, rigidity, and solemnity that were the trademark of France Inter, RMC, RTL, and Europe 1, they responded with diversity, originality, and spontaneity.\n\n\n[This dissertation proposes a cultural analysis of free radio between 1977 and 1981, with the aims of elucidating an ill-defined media and social phenomenon and using this phenomenon as a prism through which to better understand contemporary France. Cultural analysis is defined as the careful examination, the deciphering, and the interpretation of cultural phenomena and the relationships they entertain with the context (political, social, economic, etc.) which both forms them and is influenced by them over time.\n\n\nThe overarching perspective for this study is interdisciplinary, using theoretical and methodological borrowings from cultural studies in general and French culture studies in particular; political science; and history: political history, social history, history of the media, cultural history, and what has come to be known as the history of the present. As such, this study is ultimately conceived as a contribution to the cultural history of present day France through the object \u2018radio\u2019.\n\n\nThe study shows how, in the field of media, free radio stations acquired legitimacy through the enormous amount of press coverage devoted to them between 1977 and 1981\u2014a legitimacy which this coverage in turn illustrates. Moreover, the study demonstrates the considerable impact these stations eventually had on the composition, the actors, and the production of the entire field of radio, relatively impervious to change until then.\n\n\nIn the political sphere, on one level, free radio was used as a communication tool by leaders and militants of various parties across the political spectrum, looking for exposure on the airwaves. On another level, it was a major topic of debate in the political arena, creating divisions within both the left and the right, and ultimately revealing the fragmentation of the French political landscape.\n\n\nFinally, from a social and cultural standpoint, by favoring local, non-hierarchical mediated communication, free radio tried, without always succeeding, to be part of an effort to redefine the interpersonal relations that constitute the foundation of society\u2014that is to expand the public sphere and revitalize the very notion of community.]\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4321], "author_name_tesi": "Dalle, Matthieu ", "last_name_ssi": "Dalle", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Matthieu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vera Mark", "Frank R Baumgartner", "Allan Inlow Stoekl", "Catherine Bertho Lavenir", "Willa Zahava Silverman", "Monique Yvonne Yaari", "Jean Claude Vuillemin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vera Mark, Committee Member", "Frank R Baumgartner, Committee Member", "Allan Inlow Stoekl, Committee Member", "Catherine Bertho Lavenir, Committee Member", "Willa Zahava Silverman, Committee Member", "Monique Yvonne Yaari, Committee Chair", "Jean Claude Vuillemin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["underground radio", "pirate radio", "France - contemporary history", "France - radio", "France - cultural studies", "France - media"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Life and Death of an American Archetype: The Shopping Mall and the Suburbs", "id": "24976", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11180", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The original intent of the shopping mall was to organize American suburban development.

When considered, these corridors are typically conceptualized and represented as monofunctional lines that connect nodes. To question this concept of infrastructure corridors and to study the landscapes of these corridors, a method using satellite photos, GIS software, and ground surveys is proposed. The method is then tested on three case studies within Pennsylvania: Interstate 80, the Norfolk Southern Railway, and the Susquehanna-Roseland electric transmission line. With each case, after observing each corridor remotely and on the ground, a catalog of landscape sites along the corridor is developed. Further, sites adjacent to the corridors that have the potential to be leveraged into any proposed landscape intervention are also cataloged. Each catalog is then refined to a typology of sites. From this information, the specifics of each corridor are analyzed, leading to an exposition of the sites that exist within the landscape of infrastructure corridors. Factors such as connections to the surrounding landscape and the importance of movement along the corridor are also considered. Within the larger question of how existing infrastructure corridors can improve the culture, economy, and ecology of adjacent communities, this thesis proposes a refined concept of the landscapes of infrastructure corridors to improve the potential of landscapes architects to successfully intervene within existing corridors.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10654], "author_name_tesi": "Dallos, Matthew Ryan", "last_name_ssi": "Dallos", "middle_name_ssi": "Ryan", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Landscape Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil Philip Korostoff", "Charles Andrew Cole", "Ronald Eric Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Neil Philip Korostoff, Thesis Advisor", "Charles Andrew Cole, Thesis Advisor", "Ronald Eric Henderson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["infrastructure", "infrastructure corridors", "corridors", "landscape", "landscape architecture"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Analogue Trauma Exposure and Emotional Memory Intrusions: The Role Of Ovarian Hormones", "id": "v118rd525", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13128", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The gender difference in the development of reexperiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be partly explained by the influence of gonadal hormones on memory consolidation for stressful events. Circulating levels of ovarian hormones may influence the encoding of stressful memories, via their modulation of stress-response systems. This study augments existing research asserting that absolute levels of circulating ovarian hormones determine risk for the development of memory intrusions by also considering the prospect that cyclical fluctuations in estradiol and progesterone may facilitate re-experiencing. The low hormone early follicular (EF) phase of the menstrual cycle and hormonal contraceptive (HC) use, which eliminates cyclical fluctuations in endogenous estradiol and progesterone, may serve to diminish the risk naturally cycling women face for severe stress responding and the subsequent development of intrusive memories. To replicate existing research and contextualize potential protective effects, the development of memory intrusions following trauma film stressor exposure was assessed and compared among men (n = 27), HC users (n = 41), naturally cycling (NC) women in the EF (n = 24), late follicular (n = 20), ovulatory window (n = 14), and luteal phases (n = 21) for a 5-day period to determine whether low ovarian hormone levels confer a protective effect among women. Contrary to hypotheses, this study found no support for this prospect; rather, stressor exposure during the window around ovulation increased risk for the occurrence more frequent intrusive memories. Enhanced stress responsivity may have particular utility around ovulation as a means to promote evolutionary fitness.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12520], "author_name_tesi": "Daly, Kelly A", "last_name_ssi": "Daly", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Kelly", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Amy Dyanna Marshall", "Peter Andrew Arnett", "Sheri A.

In the former case, we used two structurally similar molecules that differ in the degrees of freedom afforded to each. We found that this influenced the degree of order and conductance of self-assembled monolayers of each molecule, but had little influence of conductance switching of individual molecules inserted in alkanethiolate self-assembled monolayers.\nWe further demonstrated how molecular structure influences phase separation, displaceability,\nand molecular mobility of self-assembled monolayers by assembling 1-adamantanethiol on\nAu{111}. Molecular-resolution imaging of the self-assembled monolayers with the scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy confirmed a highly ordered hexagonally close-packed molecular lattice. We found\nthat the 1-adamantanethiolate self-assembled monolayers were susceptible to replacement by the\npresence of another thiolated species, both from solution and vapor phases. Additionally, we determined that the displacement process is a nucleation and growth mechanism and the structure of the resulting self-assembled monolayers is dependent on the strength of the intermolecular interactions of the displacing molecules\nIt was hypothesized that 1-adamantanethiolate displacement was driven by a combination\nof energies gained from the exchange of one self-assembled monolayer for a denser self-assembled\nmonolayer and from the increased stability due to intermolecular interaction forces.\nExploiting the susceptibility of the 1-adamantanethiolate self-assembled monolayers to displacement, we have designed a novel patterning strategy, termed \u2018microdisplacement printing\u2019, by\ncombining these sacrificial self-assembled monolayers with microcontact printing. During microdisplacement printing, a molecular ink is patterned by contact with a patterned stamp directly atop an existing adamantanethiolate self-assembled monolayer, displacing the self-assembled monolayer everywhere the self-assembled monolayer is contacted. In this way, artificial diffusion barriers are created that block lateral mobility of the stamped molecules during patterning, allowing the patterning of molecules that are otherwise not patternable by conventional techniques.\nWe also studied the influence of deposition time and the substrate species presence on\nmolecular transport during dip-pen nanolithography. The transport rate was dependent on the size of the patterned features, and slowed down as a function of total deposition time. Additionally, the transported molecules interacted with preexisiting substrate molecules, and the transport rate was influenced by the functionality of substrate species.\nThese studies demonstrate how complex assembles can be controlled by manipulating the properties of the individual components of the molecular device.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4], "author_name_tesi": "Dameron, Arrelaine Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Dameron", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Arrelaine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss, Committee Chair", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["self-assembled monolayers", "molecular patterning", "microdisplacement printing", "microcontact printing", "dip-pen nanolithography", "scanning tunneling microscopy", "atomic force microscopy", "molecular electronics", "adamantanethiol"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Buying Local: The Cognitive Effects of Environmental Messaging\n", "id": "11834", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6399", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is currently a lot of environmental messaging being presented through advertisements and public service announcements, but there is no clear indication about what type of message is the most effective.
