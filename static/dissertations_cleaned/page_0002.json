While graphene is an excellent conductor and a semimetal, fully fluorinated graphene is an insulating wide bandgap semiconductor. The electronic properties of graphene can be modified by controlling the adsorbate concentration to produce conducting, semiconducting or insulating components for nanoscale electronic devices.\n\nThe high electronegativity of fluorine makes it very reactive to the graphene\nsheet resulting in structures that are stable under ambient conditions. Moreover,recent reports of spin 1/2 paramagnetism in graphene has invigorated research efforts in this field due the possibility of spin transport devices.\n\nWhile there is a lot of speculation about the origin of the spin, no clear theoretical explanation exists in the literature. Semi local DFT functionals predict that the fluorine adatom is non-magnetic, whereas calculations with hybrid functionals indicate a local moment of 1\u03bcB. However, neither approaches can explain the trends in the experimentally observed spin concentration as a function of fluorination percentage.\n\nAfter an introduction in Chapter 1 and an overview of our methods in Chapter2, in Chapter 3, using density functional theory (DFT) we show that in highly fluorinated graphene, small regions of unfluorinated carbon atoms produce localized magnetic states at the fermi-level. We study the shape and size dependence of these regions on the net spin and find that most odd clusters have a net spin of 1/2 while most even clusters have zero spin. We construct a minimal tight binding model that captures the low energy response of DFT and describes the localized magnetic states produced by the unfluorinated carbon atoms. This model is then solved exactly to include the e!ect of excited states in the magnetic response and go beyond the mean field predictions of DFT.\n\nThe model for magnetic carbon regions, when combined with large scale molecular dynamics methods that simulate the surface configurations formed upon fluorination, can provide a theoretical description of the magnetic response of partially fluorinated samples. However, commonly used semilocal functionals do not provide a physically correct description of the interaction of dilute fluorine adsorption on graphene. These functionals predict a fractional charge on fluorine at a distance of 10\u00c5 from the surface (delocalization error), however at such large distances the fluorine atom should interact with the graphene sheet through weak Van Der Waals forces. Classical potentials that are fit to the incorrect behavior of DFT inherit these errors and produce inaccurate fluorine interactions in dynamical processes. We describe the limitations of these functionals in chapter 4 and provide a physical model that predicts a physically reasonable fluorine interaction behavior as a function of distance from the surface.\n\nIn chapter 5, we turn towards a reactive force field method, ReaxFF to simulate the fluorination of graphene. The screening e!ect of fluorine atoms already adsorbed on the surface causes the charge transfer to fluorine atom to be negligible beyond 5\u00c5 from the surface. This is important because the fluorine atoms will not be accelerated over large distances towards the surface. We study the adsorption process and surface configurations formed upon fluorination and find that though initially the attachment starts in a correlated fashion, we do not see the formation of large fluorographene (CF) like domains. The fluorine atoms adsorb at multiple sites over the lattice, with not enough time to diffuse and form domains. This creates several small unfluorinated carbon regions and applying the model developed in Chapter 3 overestimates the magnetic response.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnetic model developed in Chapter 3 is suitable for describing the magnetic response in highly fluorinated graphene with well defined domains of CF like regions as described in Appendix A. For dynamical simulations that produce non-equilibrated configurations, the unfluorinated carbon atoms are not well localized and their interactions are likely to produce a different spin response. This being said, the classical potentials used to simulate the atomic configuration upon fluorination are dependent on DFT calculations of physical parameters like binding energy, charge, bond lengths, etc. Thus, a self interaction error free exchange correlation functional would provide an updated description of the dynamics and interaction on surfaces.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11639], "author_name_tesi": "Aditya, Piali Mitil", "last_name_ssi": "Aditya", "middle_name_ssi": "Mitil", "first_name_ssi": "Piali", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn", "Renee Denise Diehl", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Dissertation Advisor", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Chair", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Member", "Renee Denise Diehl, Committee Member", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["graphene", "fluorine", "DFT", "spin", "magnetic moment", "adatom", "adsorption"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Exploring the Personal Narratives of Mothers of Former Preterm Infants Now at Preschool Age", "id": "10492", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1136", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Having a preterm-born child is often fraught with ongoing challenges for the child\u2019s mother.

We have developed growth and synthesis routes to produce Ge and Si nanowires of diameters ranging from 3nm to 10nm that exhibit quantum confinement effects. The asymmetric Raman lineshape predicted for scattering from confined optical phonon by Richter, and the Fano interference lineshape in n-type Si and Ge are found to be similar. However, the physics of either phenomenon is distinctively different. We performed a series of Raman scattering experiments on Si and Ge nanowires to determine the true origin of the asymmetry. The experiments were conducted under two conditions: high wire density and low wire density, corresponding to poor thermal anchorage and good thermal anchorage on substrate.  We identified three physical phenomena that contribute to the lineshape: Phonon confinement, photo-stimulated and thermally induced Fano scattering. We can distinguish each of these processes based on the diameter of the wire and the laser flux dependence of the scattering and the evolution of the lineshape at low laser power with nanowire diameter. \n\tWhich effect dominates depends on the contact of the Raman sample to the substrate, the substrate thermal properties, and the diameter of the nanowires. We have proposed a coupled phenomenological model which takes the phonon confinement and Fano processes into account that best describe the observed asymmetry in the phonon lineshapes. We are the first to report true phonon confinement in Si and Ge nanowires that shows the evolution of the lineshape asymmetry with diameter (3 nm to 30 nm) first predicted by Richter. We have also investigated the effect of oxide layer, and strain induced by the oxide layer on the first order Raman scattering from Si nanowires. Our data reveal that: a) one can either introduce strain or suppress strain depending on the dry oxidation route; in situ suppresses strain where as ex situ induces strain and b) the asymmetric lineshape in the phonon mode is affected by the strain and the thickness of the oxide layer. \n\tFinally, we have used photoluminescence to demonstrate that twinning superlattice of GaAs nanowires of classical size d \u00b3 30nm can exhibit quantum confinement effects e.g., a red shift in the band gap (as predicted by theoretical investigations). In addition, Raman scattering spectrum from the GaAs twinning superlattice reveals a new strongly enhanced peak at 515 cm-1 that is not observed in the bulk.

The current version of the MET was based on an existing lower power (< 20 watts) version with various modifications. Studies were performed in the areas of antenna design, RF inputs, and dielectric shape. In order to assure high coupling efficiency, the cavity was attached to a network analyzer to measure the absorbed power at various antenna lengths.

Second, in order to accommodate the requirement for higher power, the antenna\u2019s coaxial RF connector was changed from an SMA to an N-type connector. The N-type connector raised the maximum forward power to 100 W. Finally, due to the high temperatures that would be present at the tip of antenna, the insulating Teflon material surrounding the conductor was removed and replaced with boron nitride.\nHot fire testing using helium as propellant resulted in coupling efficiencies as high as 96%.

We, as humans, use years of evolution and a tightly integrated top-down and bottom-up visual system to be able to recognize a large set of objects with a very high degree of precision. When poor lighting, occlusion and varying pose create confusion or when new unidentifiable objects come into the picture, we use context to make an educated guess. For example, consider a foreign tourist looking for a restaurant in a busy city. Even though the tourist may not be able to understand the language of that place, by recognizing known objects such as 'plate', 'cup', 'chair', 'bread', he or she can come to a very quick conclusion about it being a restaurant.\n\nAs machines have evolved in their learning capabilities, technology has brought them closer to us allowing finer levels of interactions; initially from being hand-operated to then being hand-held and now being worn. However, current systems being deployed for vision-specific tasks are still either too power-hungry, require huge storage space or computationally take too long for them to be useful for any real-world scenario. Thus, as computing takes a new leap into this exciting world of 'Wearables', the need for smart cameras capable of supporting, engaging and enhancing human capabilities has never been felt more acutely.\n\nThis thesis tackles one of the critical tasks of large-scale visual object recognition for embedded wearable platforms. A scalable architecture for visual object detection that is fast, accurate, light-weight and\npower efficient is first proposed. A Context-Aware Scalable Pipeline for Efficient Recognition - CASPER - which uses context in conjunction with a hierarchical visual recognition pipeline targeted for retail is then discussed. We are able to achieve high recognition rates across 62 object classes that are diverse in shape, size and color. The utility of using context in this visual pipeline is showcased and computing effort is reduced significantly without impacting accuracy at all.

LT and CAP were measured by a developed leaf sensor. In the first experiment, the relationship between leaf relative water content (RWC) and relative LT (RLT) was determined on cut leaves of four crops in a lab condition. Linear piecewise modeling explained 86-97% of the variations, but the estimated parameters varied by species. The second experiment was conducted on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) in a growth chamber at a constant temperature and on/off photoperiod. The plant was irrigated to the saturation level and allowed to dehydrate thereafter. The daily LT variations were minor for \u03b8 above the wilting point, but more noticeable below it. CAP was at a minimum value during the dark periods and rapidly increased by illumination, implying that CAP was a reflection of photosynthesis. The extent of daily CAP variations decreased when \u03b8 was below the wilting point, suggesting that the effect of water stress on CAP would be through its negative impact on photosynthesis. In the last experiment, eight tomato plants were grown in a controlled greenhouse. One leaf sensor was clipped on a leaf of each plant. The irrigation regime was designed based on observed visual wilting stages such that water stress level was increased over time. Daily LT variations increased by water stress. CAP was at a minimum value during the nights and rapidly increased by light, but the extent of daily variations decreased by water stress. The relative values of daily night- and noon-time LT and noon-time CAP had strong piecewise linear relationships with \u03b8. Overall, \u03b8 and soil matric potential could not identify the water stress levels, while a transition from a stress level to the next level could be identified by at least one of the relative values of LT or CAP.

The acoustic spectrum of the noise radiated from slats exhibits two distinct features. There is a high-frequency tonal noise component, and a high-energy broadband component ranging from low to mid-frequencies. The objective of this thesis is to predict both the tonal and the broadband slat noise. An aeroacoustic whistling mechanism is proposed to predict the tonal noise generation. When the vortex shedding frequency at the blunt trailing edge of the slat comes close to one of the normal modes of the gap between the slat and the main element, an intense tonal noise is produced.  The normal modes are calculated based on the geometry of the wing. The vortex shedding frequency is predicted based on a linear stability analysis of the slat's wake region. An efficient and robust scheme is developed by which the stability calculation can be performed by a modular algorithm in a relatively quick time.  The broadband noise is predicted using a two-step process. First the noise sources are modeled based on the local turbulence information. Then, the sound from these sources is propagated by assuming that the flow past the wing is uniform. A Boundary Element Method is developed to find the Green's function for wave propagation in a moving medium in the presence of the wing.  The noise in the far field is then predicted by forming a convolution of the Green's function with the modeled sources. Finally, a technique is presented to account for nonuniform flow around the wing. This requires a solution of the linearized Euler Equations. However, these equations support acoustic as well as instability waves. The instability waves can completely overwhelm the acoustic-wave solution. Thus it is imperative for an accurate noise-prediction scheme to suppress the unwanted instability waves.  A detailed mathematical analysis is presented that demonstrates that the instability wave solution is suppressed if the governing equations are solved in the frequency domain. The main focus of this thesis is in the development of numerical schemes and models, and then their use to explore the physics of noise generation, and the prediction of noise radiation, from slats.

The research explores Jua Kali youths with informal skills accessing employment opportunities in the informal economic sector. In the conceptual framework, youths exit school early before acquiring skills, and consequently become involved in informal work or in activities that are not official or regulated by government. While engaging in these activities, youth attain life skills. The adopted thematic analysis serves as the analytic and interpretive lens for informants\u2019 experiences and for focusing on events influencing the search for work, the impact of negotiating work in Jua Kali, and youths\u2019 attitudes toward second-chance education.  \nThe study notes: First, results produced are closely similar for the context countries (e.g., informants responses reveal existing disenchantment in formal educational practices as cause for a lack of skills for those exiting school early. Second, fundamental factors, organizational intricacies in Jua Kali, lack of guiding rules, inadequate experience prior to employment, roles of social networks, formal educational attainments; and personal qualities influence access to employment by youths. Third, accessing employment in Jua Kali by the youthful population reveals desired impact on their wellbeing: Youths feel fulfilled, happy and economically empowered. Contrarily, undesirable economic consequences persist; disillusionment due to income instability, and displacement from work or aggravated poverty, rendering youths vulnerable to socio-economic hardships. In response to the challenges of Jua Kali youths, time is propitious for second-chance education that is; workplace, and occupational based toward improvement of current youths\u2019 skills. Finally, this study contributes to the ongoing research in adult education, particularly in the nuanced concept of second-chance education as a compensatory educational strategy for those who do not complete the formal educational cycle. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9719], "author_name_tesi": "Agelu, Jerome ", "last_name_ssi": "Agelu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jerome", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ladislaus M Semali", "Ladislaus M Semali", "Davin Jules Carr Chellman", "Jamie Myers", "Kidane Mengisteab"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ladislaus M Semali, Dissertation Advisor", "Ladislaus M Semali, Committee Chair", "Davin Jules Carr Chellman, Committee Member", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member", "Kidane Mengisteab, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Youths", "Jua Kali", "Informal learning", "Negotiating work", "Informal economic sector"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Development of Self-Lubricating Coatings via Cold Spray Process: Feedstock Formulation and Deformation Modeling", "id": "7826", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2151", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Because of their low density, high specific strength and high stiffness, titanium alloys are one of the prime candidates for structural application often requiring specific tribological properties. However, their relatively high friction coefficients and low wear resistance are limiting their application over a wider temperature range. Various coatings deposited with technologies like- high velocity oxy flame (HVOF), detonation gun (D-Gun), electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD), etc., can improve wear performance and decrease corrosion damage. These technologies require high processing temperatures precluding the integration of thermally vulnerable lubricants.\nThis research looks at a relatively new coating process called Cold Spray for self-lubricating coatings on Ti-6Al-4V alloys. Cold Spray can produce coatings without significant heating of the sprayed powder or substrate. The particles are in solid state as they hit the substrate, and the formation of coatings occurs mainly due to the kinetic energy of the particles. Therefore, the impact velocity plays an important role. Below a critical value, the particles can cause densification and abrasion of the substrate. The focus of this study is to design composite coatings for the cold spray process and determination of the critical velocity through finite element modeling. \nDifferent powders and feedstock formulation techniques are discussed in order to find an optimum formulation for self-lubricating coatings. A composite powder (Ni coated hBN) was found to be the best candidate for the feedstock. The deformation of composite particles upon impact on the substrate was modeled and compared to the experiments. A number of approaches involving different modeling platforms, particle-substrate geometries, and material models have been tried. This work presents the results of ANSYS (version 10.0) analysis using an axisymmetric model of the particle impact. Stress and strain distributions in the particle-substrate interface have been observed for a wide range of impact velocities (200 to 1000 m/s). The results are evaluated to predict particle size, lubricant content, and finally the critical velocities for composite particles during the cold spray process.\nFor the first time, the cold spray process is used to deposit Ni-MoS2 and Ni-hBN self-lubricating coatings. The modeling results are matched with the experimental results to provide guidelines for composite coatings via cold spray processing.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2131], "author_name_tesi": "Aggarwal, Gaurav ", "last_name_ssi": "Aggarwal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gaurav", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ivica Smid", "Albert Eliot Segall", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Robert Carl Voigt", "Timothy John Eden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ivica Smid, Committee Chair", "Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Robert Carl Voigt, Committee Member", "Timothy John Eden, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cold Spray", "Coatings", "Modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Studies Directed Towards Total Synthesis of Securine A and Securamine A\n", "id": "8095", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4989", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aim of this research project was to synthesize securamine A (6) and to make use of the facile equilibrium between securamine A (6) and securine A (13) in the strategic design.

More specifically, I examine how risk reduction strategies distribute a \u201cspecial\u201d pre-situational vulnerability to feminine bodies and a sense of gendered responsibility for prevention. To clarify the theoretical limitations and ethical hazards of this distribution, I critically apply concepts from Maurice Merleau-Ponty\u2019s phenomenology of embodiment and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s ethics of ambiguity. In the first chapter, I develop Merleau-Ponty\u2019s thesis of the primacy of perception, his account of embodiment, and his ontology of the flesh in order to reveal the ontological error that risk reduction strategies perpetuate. In the second chapter, I develop key facets of Beauvoir\u2019s methodology and existential ethics, including ambiguity, the fluid parameters of the human situation, and the intersubjective dimensions of situated freedom, in order to clarify the ethical error of these strategies. In the third chapter, I carry these methodologies forward in an examination of women\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d vulnerability to sexual violence. I critique the phallocentric logic of vulnerability that undergirds the application of a neo-liberal conception of risk management to sexual violence. I examine the corresponding risk reduction strategies that are imposed on the feminine body and provide a phenomenological description of how they situate feminine bodies within a space of risk. This enables me to articulate how the theoretical limitations of the narrow focus on women\u2019s vulnerability translate into ethical harms that impact both women and society at large. The conclusion provides a preliminary framework for liberating vulnerability from risk reduction. More specifically, I suggest an understanding of mutual vulnerability that affirms an existential understanding of risk and recalibrates the reciprocity of the erotic encounter. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15210], "author_name_tesi": "Aggleton, Sabrina Irene", "last_name_ssi": "Aggleton", "middle_name_ssi": "Irene", "first_name_ssi": "Sabrina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonard Richard Lawlor", "Leonard Lawlor", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi", "Sarah Clark Miller", "Claire Mary Colebrook"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonard Richard Lawlor, Dissertation Advisor", "Leonard Lawlor, Committee Chair", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi, Committee Member", "Sarah Clark Miller, Committee Member", "Claire Mary Colebrook, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rape", "ethics", "embodiment", "phenomenology", "Maurice Merleau-Ponty", "Simone de Beauvoir", "gender", "vulnerability"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "CROSS-NATIONAL COMPARISONS OF FEMALE CRIME AND THE GENDER GAP", "id": "6715", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5555", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "National development is an important and complex process with significant consequences for many aspects of social life.  There is contention surrounding the differential affects of development on men and women.  Furthermore, it has been suggested that development can impact a country\u2019s level of criminal offending.  This dissertation brings together these themes by investigating the relationship between development and the gender gap in offending.  \nPrevious investigations of this relationship are limited and they have somewhat mixed results.  This project is both a replication and extension of an article by Steffensmeier et. al. (1989) investigating several alternative explanations for the relationship between development and the female share of offending.  A major theme in the literature on female crime has focused on the connection between female status and female crime.  The liberation hypothesis suggests that development leads to greater equality between men and women, and that these changes in gender equality lead to a greater female share of offending.  Alternatively, it has been argued that development marginalizes females relative to males, also leading to an increase in the female share of offending.  Other research has suggested different ways in which development may impact the female share of offending.  Development may lead to changes in the formalization of the mechanisms of social control, which can differentially impact male and female arrest rates.  Additionally, the growth in opportunities for consumer crime that is associated with development may differentially impact male and female offending rates and the proportion of arrests accounted for by females.\nThis research asks the following questions 1) What are the effects of development on female crime and the gender gap?  2) To what extent are the effects of development on the female share of offending explained by changes in the relative status of women, opportunity for consumer crime, and formalization of the mechanisms of social control?  \nThese questions are assessed using international sex-specific arrest data from the Interpol (International Criminal Police Organization) and population figures from the U.S. Census International Database.  Five offense categories are included: total crime, homicide, robbery, theft, and fraud.  The primary dependent variable is the female percentage of arrests, a measure of the proportion of all arrests that are of females, controlling for the sex distribution in the population.  Data for predictor variables comes from the World Bank, United Nations, and the International Labor Office.  Ordinary Least Squares regression techniques are used to assess the relationship between predictor variables and the female percentage of arrests.  The mediation effects of formalization, opportunity, and relative female status are assessed using the Clogg Test for mediation. \n\tOverall, the results demonstrate that more highly developed countries have a higher female percentage of arrests, although there is little variation cross-nationally in the female share of arrests for robbery and homicide.  More formalized criminal justice systems are associated with a higher female share of total crime and robbery offending.  The effect of opportunity for consumer crime was difficult to discern given its correlation with development, but increased opportunity is related to a higher female share of theft offending.  Assessment of relative female status demonstrated that it was predictive of the FPA for fraud, but that it had very weak effects on the female share of arrests for total crime, homicide, robbery, and theft. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5546], "author_name_tesi": "Agha, Suzanne Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Agha", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Suzanne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier", "Leif Jensen", "John Kramer", "Eric Silver", "Marylee Carmel Taylor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier, Committee Chair", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "John Kramer, Committee Member", "Eric Silver, Committee Member", "Marylee Carmel Taylor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["crime", "female crime", "gender gap", "cross-national", "development", "female status"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Pragmatic Minimalism: A Defense of Formal Approaches to Semantics", "id": "13153", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7049", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Context plays a fundamental role in interpreting language. It aids in determining what was said, what was meant, and how we choose to respond. Knowing what a particular utterance means is thus not simply a matter of knowing what the words in the sentence mean along with a grammar. Knowing a language also requires the non-linguistic (pragmatic) capacity to know how context influences the interpretation of sentences. \n\nMinimalism is the theory that the role context plays in determining the literal meaning of an utterance is guided entirely by the syntactic and lexical features in the sentence. That is, if the meaning of a sentence depends upon the context in which the sentence is used, then there will be some feature in the sentence itself that conventionally directs the language user to the context. In short, language drives a turn to context. Contextualism, by contrast, is the theory that the interpretation of utterances involves a process of free enrichment, i.e. conversational or pragmatic rules will draw upon features from context to shape the content in certain ways.\nMy argument for minimalism occurs in two parts. First, I articulate and respond to two major objections to minimalism. Incompleteness objections state that the minimalist theory does not deliver propositional content and so falls short as a semantic theory. The inappropriateness objections state that the minimalist theory may deliver propositional content but this content plays no functional role in a larger story involving human communication and cognition. I argue that by appealing to a more expansive notion of language (involving its syntactic and semiotic underpinnings) both of these objections are unwarranted. Second, I offer a number of reasons for choosing minimalism over contextualism. I argue that minimalism offers a psychologically realistic (modular) picture of how we process language, that it provides the best explanation for the existence of cross-contextual communication, and that it best explains the distinction between what we are committed to in virtue of the words we use and what we are committed to in virtue of conversational principles governing communication. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7042], "author_name_tesi": "Agler, David Wells", "last_name_ssi": "Agler", "middle_name_ssi": "Wells", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent M Colapietro", "Emily Rolfe Grosholz", "Christopher P Long", "Linda Furgerson Selzer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Chair", "Emily Rolfe Grosholz, Committee Chair", "Christopher P Long, Committee Member", "Linda Furgerson Selzer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["semantics", "pragmatics", "contextualism", "minimalism", "Peirce", "formal semantics", "Williams Syndrome", "philosophy of language"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Design, Modeling, and Simulation of Battery Pack Suspensions for Off-road Electric Vehicles", "id": "21205", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9886", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Battery packs on commercial off-road battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are exposed to harsh environments with vibration and shock loading that can lead to battery damage and premature failure.

Ensuring long life of the expensive pack often requires a suspension system to isolate damaging resonant frequencies and attenuate transient shock accelerations.\nIn this thesis, suspensions comprising wire rope isolators and silicone safety bump stops are designed, modeled, and simulated for an example underground mining vehicle.

To this end, in this in vitro study, the interactions of purified blood components with model biomaterials have been studied with an objective of establishing relationships between the surface properties and the biological response.  The principal technique that was used in this study is atomic force microscopy (AFM), which allows both visualization of biomolecules in physiologically relevant environments and the measurement of interaction forces from the microN to pN range.  \nTapping mode atomic force microscopy was used to study the time-dependent changes in the structure of fibrinogen under aqueous conditions following adsorption on two model surfaces: hydrophobic graphite and hydrophilic mica.  Fibrinogen is a key plasma protein involved in initiation of thrombosis on synthetic surfaces, and its adsorption to the biomaterial surface and subsequent interactions with the blood platelets are of fundamental interest.  Fibrinogen was observed in the characteristic trinodular form.  Based on the differences in the relative heights of the D and the E domains, four initial orientation states were observed for fibrinogen adsorbed on both surfaces.  On graphite, the initial asymmetric orientation states disappeared with spreading over time.  Spreading kinetics of fibrinogen on the two surfaces was determined by measuring the heights of the D and E domains over a time-period of ~2 hours.  The spreading of the D and E domains on graphite was analyzed using an \u2018exponential-decay-of-height\u2019 model and a two-step spreading model is proposed.\nWith the objective of relating the observed post-adsorption structural changes in fibrinogen to the surface availability of active epitopes and extending AFM imaging studies to complex multicomponent protein films, the adhesion mapping mode of AFM was developed for biologically sensitive imaging.  AFM probes were functionalized by covalently linking polyclonal antibodies against fibrinogen.  Adhesion mapping mode of AFM was used to generate both topographic images and adhesion images.  The efficacy of the functionalized probes was first established by performing adhesion mapping on patterned dual-component protein films formed by microcontact printing bovine serum albumin (BSA) on a mica surface and then backfilling with fibrinogen.  Next, adhesion mapping was done on randomly distributed two-component protein monolayers generated by sequential adsorption of submonolayer amounts of fibrinogen followed by backfilling with bovine serum albumin.\nThe interactions of platelet membrane integrin GPIIbIIIa in purified form as well as in intact unfixed platelets against fibrinogen adsorbed to model hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces were characterized by using the force mode of AFM.  Force curves obtained with probes functionalized with integrins on adsorbed fibrinogen showed multiple rupture events over a large range of distance on both surfaces.  On the hydrophobic surface, the rupture length range was 20-200 nm, whereas on the hydrophilic surface, the rupture length range was 20-400 nm.  Rupture events in the force curves had contributions from non-specific protein-protein interactions, mechanical denaturation of fibrinogen domains, and specific ligand-receptor interactions of integrin and adsorbed fibrinogen.  Periodicities in the debonding force distributions were used to estimate the debonding strength of a single integrin-fibrinogen pair at different loading rates.  For loading rates of 10-60 nN/s, the debonding strength of a single integrin-fibrinogen pair was in the range of 50-80 pN on both surfaces.  This result suggests that once the active epitope is exposed on a surface, binding of the platelet membrane integrin receptor follows the same kinetics, regardless of the surface properties. \nPolyurethane biomaterials are among the most blood-compatible materials available for biomedical devices.  It has been suggested that the good blood compatibility of polyurethanes arises from nanoscale chemical heterogeneities at the surface as a consequence of the microphase-separated morphology.  Tapping mode atomic force microscopy with phase imaging under aqueous conditions was used to characterize the interfacial properties of a series of poly(urethane urea) block copolymers with varying hard segment content.  Topographic images showed the formation of nanometer-sized raised features on the surface, having lateral dimensions of 50-70 nm and heights of 10-15 nm.  Phase images, reflecting the local distribution of the mechanical properties under aqueous conditions, were quite different from those obtained in ambient conditions, consistent with water-induced structural reorientation.  Images under aqueous conditions suggest that there is little soft phase material at the polymer surface in the presence of water, while images acquired after dehydration of the samples show that the surface layer remains rich in hard domains, indicating that the films do not return to their original states over the time period studied.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [469], "author_name_tesi": "Agnihotri, Aashiish ", "last_name_ssi": "Agnihotri", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aashiish", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Alan Siedlecki", "Cheng Dong", "Erwin A Vogler", "William O Hancock", "Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Alan Siedlecki, Committee Chair", "Cheng Dong, Committee Member", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Biomaterials", "Fibrinogen", "Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)", "Blood Material Interactions", "Integrins"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "PARTICIPATION IN CAPACITY-BUILDING PROGRAMS AND THE  IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WELLBEING OF YOUNG FARMERS WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES IN UGANDA", "id": "15300dja5368", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15300", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThis research study comparatively examined participation in capacity-building programs and the implications for the well-being of young farmers with and without disabilities in Northern and Eastern Uganda. The study employed a comparative, mixed methodology, cross-sectional research design involving 774 young farmers composed of 388 with disabilities and 386 who had no disabilities. The sample selection strategies involved the use of a stratified, random and criterion purposive sampling techniques. This research utilized an interviewer-administered paper survey, focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews in collecting data. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were used in analysing quantitative data. Qualitative data helped to validate quantitative findings using Seldana\u2019s framework for coding and analysis.\nThe findings indicated that many young farmers with disabilities are male (65.5%), 20 to 29 years old, married (55.4%), and attained a primary school education (59.8%). Most households had at least one person with a disability (71.1%). Many young farmers have an innate disability (69.6%), and most experienced moderate (52.1%) to severe (34.2%) limitations to participation in daily life activities. A majority of the young farmers have a disability caused by accidents (48.7%), disease (18.5), and gunshots/landmines/civil wars (17.6%). Many young farmers with limb disabilities were innate (25.8%) and acquired (19.1%). Most disabilities were linked with loss of limbs (20.1%), or from burns (9.3%), loss of hearing (5.7%), and loss of vision (4.4%) among those aged 20 to 29 years. However, there were no statistically significant associations between the causes of disability among young farmers across the various age categories. There were statistically significant associations (Cramer\u2019s V = .148; p = .043) between the types of disabilities among young farmers across the various age categories; however, no association existed between region and type of disability. There were no statistically significant associations between causes of disability among young farmers and age of acquisition of disability in Uganda \nMany young farmers with disabilities (48.7%) and without disabilities (43.9%) were self-employed (55.6%) in subsistence agriculture. However, people with disabilities were less engaged in vocational trades due to a lack of skills and competencies. There was no statistically significant differences in employment sectors for young farmers with and without disabilities. Most young farmers with disabilities (52.3%) earned income comparable to that earned by young farmers without disabilities (47.7%), with a greater proportion of young farmers with disabilities in Northern Uganda (35.7%) earning incomes comparable to those with disabilities in Eastern Uganda (16.4%). In contrast, a slightly greater proportion of young farmers without disabilities (26.3%) in Eastern Uganda earned income compared to their counterparts in Northern Uganda (25.2%). There was a statistically significant association in the regularity of income earned by young farmers with and without disabilities in Eastern Uganda as well as in Northern Uganda.\nFurther, for agricultural production needs, disability, value addition, and market demonstrated evidence of a statistically significant negative impact on food security. However, there was a statistically significant positive association between being from Northern Uganda, money, improved animals, agricultural information and food security. Furthermore, for social capital; disability demonstrated a statistically significant negative relationship with food security. However, in Northern Uganda, talking to people outside the family, traveling to places outside the community of residence had a statistically significant positive influence on food security. In terms of poverty trap, disability has a statistically significant negative relationship with food security. While adequacy of food eaten in a meal, level of satisfaction with food eaten in a meal, and level of food availability in a household have a statistically significant positive relationship with food security. In addition, for social exclusion; disability and group membership have a statistically significant negative relationship with food security whereas Northern Uganda has a statistically significant positive relationship with food insecurity. \nIn addition, young farmers with a disability and being contacted face-to-face were less likely to participate in community capacity-building programs. In contrast, for farmers in Northern Uganda, those contacted in a group setting, application of sign language interpretation, being female, and having supportive training staff increased the chances of their participation in community capacity-building programs. Moreover, having a disability, satisfaction with the amount of food eaten in a meal, interaction with people outside the family, feeling of belonging, and highest level of education have a statistically significant positive relationship with well-being of young farmers. In contrast, active participation in training and being female had a statistically significant negative association with well-being of young farmers. In order to navigate difficult social-cultural terrain to function fully in their communities, young farmers with disabilities employ self-disability awareness, self-created positive self-image, building social network beyond disability-related, competitive behaviors, and forming disability-groups. \nTherefore, the researcher recommends disability-inclusive programming and the use of evidence-based  disability-inclusive programming as a criterion for funding capacity-building programs, enforcement of disability policies, retooling extension and community educators, and integrating disability in training curricular for extension and community educators.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16705], "author_name_tesi": "Agole, David ", "last_name_ssi": "Agole", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Connie D.

This along with the availability of increasing amount\nof healthcare data has created a renewed interest in researchers to develop efficient and\npractical healthcare decision support systems. To that end, in this dissertation we study\nthree important, related, and yet independent, healthcare research problems are studied\nwith two viewpoints data analytics based and operations research (OR) based techniques\nin healthcare. In this research, our objective is to develop, validate and integrate the\ndata-driven predictive models into the hospital workflow and provide decision making\nsupport for medical professionals. It is our hope this research can help generate solutions\nto these problems, improving the efficiency of hospital operations, patient outcomes, and\npatient and staff satisfaction.\nThe three issues addressed in this dissertation are: (1) patients\u2019 return to hospital\nwithin 72 hours after discharge from being an inpatient (e.g., surgical) due to adverse\nevents, (2) developing a provider scheduling system for outpatient clinic at a multi-clinic\nfacility, and (3) developing a preference based scheduling model for a healthcare provider\nnetwork (HPN).\nIn the first problem we develop a stacked classification model to predict short-term\nand long-term readmission, emergency department revisits and deaths (REDD) along\nwith identifying the important factors contributing to adverse events. We proposed\na stacked classification model with level one training models using logistic regression,\nrandom forest and gradient boosting method. The second level learning model was a\nnon-negative least square method. The final outcome is a linear combination of the\npredictions from the three learning models. The short-term (3-day) model had a fair\nc-statistic of 0.671 and 0.664 for the derivation and validation cohort, respectively. The\nc-statistic of long-term (30-day) REDD model was 0.713 and 0.711 for the derivation\nand validation cohort, respectively. These models were implemented at Geisinger Health\nSystem and are under pilot study. In the second problem, we propose a multi-objective provider scheduling model\nunder demand and capacity uncertainty and patient no-shows. Though the problem is\nformulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP), the network structure of the problem\nsimplifies the computational complexity of the problem.\nResource flexibility is an important criterion for any scheduling model to be practical.\nIn the final research problem, the appointment scheduling with multiple clinic locations,\nmultiple physicians is proposed as a network model, which gives it the necessary flexibility\nto dynamically assign providers to patients in real time but also to be rigid enough so that\nit can be implemented months in advance. In addition to that, we consider multi-priority\npatients with heterogeneous preference in our model. We develop theoretical bounds\nfor the best achievable policy as well propose a heuristic approach to solve the dynamic\nproblem. Using extensive numerical experiments we show the proposed scheduling policies\ncan outperform the current scheduling practices. Finally, to make the model closer to\nreality we propose two extensions to the model. In the first extension, the demand follows\ndoubly stochastic Poisson process. We also show that the proposed dynamic policy is\nrobust under the assumption of a doubly stochastic assumption. In the second extension,\nwe propose joint capacity planning and appointment scheduling problem, which can be\nformulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP).\niv", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15390], "author_name_tesi": "Agrawal, Deepak ", "last_name_ssi": "Agrawal", "first_name_ssi": "Deepak", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Kumara", "Soundar Kumara", "Vinayak V Shanbhag", "Guodong Pang", "Mort D Webster", "Guodong Pang", "Guodong Pang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Kumara, Dissertation Advisor", "Soundar Kumara, Committee Chair", "Vinayak V Shanbhag, Committee Member", "Guodong Pang, Committee Member", "Mort D Webster, Outside Member", "Guodong Pang, Committee Chair", "Guodong Pang, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["appointment scheduling", "healthcare analytics", "preference based scheduling", "markov decision process", "no-show", "multi-priority", "network model", "risk prediction", "physician scheduling"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Variation Study on Advanced Cmos Systems for Low Voltage Applications", "id": "26674", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11793", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the key challenges in scaling beyond 10nm technology node is device-to-device variation.

Factors affecting the selection of proppants are closure stress of reservoir, required conductivity, and permeability of the deposit.

The purpose of this research is to explore the effect of spatial correlation in models of road crash frequency at the segment level. Different segment neighboring structures are tested to establish the most promising one in the context of modeling crash frequency in road networks.  \nA Full Bayes hierarchical approach is used with conditional autoregressive effects for the spatial correlation terms. Analysis of crash, traffic and roadway inventory data from rural engineering districts in Pennsylvania and Washington indicate the importance of including spatial correlation in road crash models. Six different road classes were analyzed in a single network model to facilitate the inclusion of the spatial correlation structures in the whole state-maintained network simultaneously rather than in separate models by road type. \nThe inclusion of spatial correlation has an important impact on the estimation of crash frequency models by explaining additional extra-Poisson variability present in the data ; hence, producing better fitting models and improving the precision of the crash frequency and excess crash frequency estimates compared with models with heterogeneity-only random effects. \nPure distance-based neighboring models (i.e. exponential decay) performed poorly in comparison to adjacency-based or distance-order models. The results also suggest that spatial correlation is more important in distances of one mile or less. The inclusion of spatially correlated random effects significantly improves the precision of the estimates of the expected crash frequency for each segment by \u2018pooling\u2019 strength from their neighbors; thus, reducing their standard deviation.

The doll has become a great part of children\u2019s lives either through her presence or her absence in their play experiences.  Moreover, the feelings and memories she evokes can provide insights to girls\u2019 lived experiences in relation to a number of topics. As a result, Barbie becomes an important artifact of girlhood and an excellent site of interrogation about girlhood. While a large amount of research has examined Barbie\u2019s role in girls\u2019 lives, the scholarship has not included the experiences of Puerto Rican girls.\n \nThis study examines the experiences of a group of multigenerational Puerto Rican women and girls who interacted with Barbie dolls during their childhood and the social and cultural implications these experiences may have on their lives in the present. Through qualitative research approaches that included individual and group interviews, as well as artifactual data, this study depicts the narratives of twenty-one participants who recounted stories of how Barbie became part of their childhoods and the meanings the doll held in their lives, showing how different those experiences can be for girls according to their contexts. Based on the these stories, this research raised questions about Barbie as a marker of class, accessibility to the doll and her accessories, representations of female body and image, race, and gender. \n\nThe findings of this research demonstrate the important role Barbie played in the formative years of many Puerto Rican girls. Participants perceived interactions with the doll, however different, and whether entirely positive or not, as an important part of their girlhoods and in some cases even their adult lives. They also describe the often-complicated relationship girls and women have with the doll. More importantly, the study highlights how women and girls constructed their own identities in relation to femininity, body image, race, and nationalism through Barbie play. \n\t\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12156], "author_name_tesi": "Aguilo-Perez, Emily R", "last_name_ssi": "Aguilo-Perez", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jacqueline J A Reid-Walsh", "Jacqueline J A Reid-Walsh", "Daniel Dean Hade", "Courtney Desiree Morris", "Christine M Thompson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jacqueline J A Reid-Walsh, Dissertation Advisor", "Jacqueline J A Reid-Walsh, Committee Chair", "Daniel Dean Hade, Committee Member", "Courtney Desiree Morris, Committee Member", "Christine M Thompson, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["girlhood studies", "play practices", "identity", "Puerto Rico", "Barbie", "race class and gender"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Design and Optimization of Narrow-Gauged Contact-Aided Compliant Mechanisms for Advanced Minimally Invasive Surgery\n", "id": "11772", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4075", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this research is to develop design and optimization methods for contact-aided compliant mechanisms intended for Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES). The design methods are used to develop prototypes for the purpose of evaluating tool performance in benchtop and end-user testing procedures. The work described in this dissertation is part of a collaborative effort between mechanical design engineers and material scientists. Recent advancements in materials sciences and a need for mesoscale surgical instruments to advance NOTES, drive the development of a novel design and manufacturing method. NOTES has been referred to as the \u2018coming revolution of surgery\u2019 and motivates development of new design and manufacturing methods. New instruments must be smaller in diameter to minimize the size of incisions coupled with the flexibility to approach the surgical site through the body\u2019s natural orifices. Once access to the surgical site is attained, the instruments must be capable of precise and effective manipulation to complete complex procedures. \n\nCollaborating with clinicians at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center, a surgical forceps is selected for design, taking into account constraints imposed by manufacturing processes. A significant challenge is designing a surgically useful device under the severe geometric constraints of narrow-gauge instruments. The goal is to design a forceps that can open large enough and provide sufficient grasping force to effectively execute complex surgical maneuvers. This research seeks to attain this goal through compliant mechanism design. \n\nThe device is a monolithic contact-aided compliant mechanism, which relies on contact stress-relief to obtain large elastic tip deflections for effective grasping. Because of the proposed instrument scale and required feature sizes, Penn State\u2019s lost mold rapid infiltration forming process is selected for part fabrication. Since quantitative surgical instrument requirements are not well defined in the literature, they are established within this dissertation. Design constraints are defined in terms of the current limitations imposed by the manufacturing process. \n\nComputational methods are developed to simulate and predict tool performance using nonlinear finite element analysis. Size and shape optimization methods are used to determine optimal tool dimensions for ceramic and metallic parts. Once parts are fabricated they are characterized and tested to compare experimental and theoretical tool performance. Good agreement between experimental and theoretical tests verified that the prototypes merit assessment in end-user surgical simulators.\n\nCollaborators at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center volunteered to execute a set of standardized tasks to compare the prototype\u2019s performance side-by-side with a standard commercially available endoscopic forceps. The prototype was rated superior at fine grasping and its ability to control intermediate positions between the open and closed positions of the jaws. The standard instrument had a slightly higher average measured pull-off force; however, the maximum pull-off force recorded for both instruments was identical at 1.46 N. The prototype was also identified as being not suitable for biopsies, which can be accredited to the prototype\u2019s square cross-sectional arms. \n\nAlthough various design modifications were suggested to improve prototype performance, the most common critique was that the jaw opening of the device should be increased. Since the prototype\u2019s grasping force was rated satisfactory, alternative design methods focus on increasing the total jaw opening while preserving the current grasping capabilities. These design methods, which adhere to the current two-dimensional manufacturing constraint, include a hybrid, two material forceps design and a multiple contact-aided compliant mechanism design. For both alternative design concepts intermediate solutions are provided for the consideration of future work.\n\nThe hybrid design method was developed to investigate the performance benefits of two-material contact-aided compliant mechanisms. A hybrid approach could eliminate the tradeoff between flexibility and stiffness by isolating the two desired properties. Results show that larger jaw openings and blocked forces can be achieved, compared to a homogeneous design. \n\nAdditionally, a design method was developed to examine whether multiple contact-aided compliant mechanisms can further exploit the benefits of contact stress-relief. Theoretically, designs with additional contact elements result in more stress-relief to maximize the re-distribution of stresses and achieve larger elastic tip deflections. Results prove that the device generates larger elastic tip deflections with each additional contact element. When comparing the performance of a multi-contact forceps to the existing prototypes, the predicted jaw opening improved by a factor of three; however, to obtain comparable grasping forces three-dimensional or hybrid manufacturing capabilities are required. \n\nThe design and optimization techniques developed in this dissertation were demonstrated through the design of a narrow-gauge forceps for NOTES. End-user tests identified design modifications for the next generation of prototypes. Future work to improve the tool performance should focus on incorporating flexible materials and/or 3D manufacturing into the design and fabrication process.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4050], "author_name_tesi": "Aguirre, Milton ", "last_name_ssi": "Aguirre", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Milton", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker", "Mary I Frecker", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Matthew B Parkinson", "Christopher Muhlstein", "Harriet Black Nembhard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Chair", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member", "Matthew B Parkinson, Committee Member", "Christopher Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Design", "Contact-Aided", "Compliant Mechanism", "Advanced MIS", "NOTES", "Optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Hard Sensor Processing for Data Fusion", "id": "11868", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5337", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is a vast amount of information available these days that can be used in the right direction\nto prevent several extreme/disastrous events.

This study seeks to examine the roles of these two message factors\u2014distance and efficacy\u2014in psychological responses to environmental communications. Environmental values have been theoretically linked to environmental behaviors, and empirical research has largely supported a causal model of environmental decision-making that starts with values.

This study seeks to introduce construal level, specifically idealistic values versus pragmatic concerns, as a possible mechanism whereby environmental values manifest themselves in environmental attitudes and behavioral intentions. Idealistic construals are found to significantly mediate the values-attitude and values-intentions relationships, and distance and efficacy message factors are found to interact with values in determining idealistic construal. The mediating role of perceived efficacy, which has been established in prior research, is also measured and included in an overall model of environmental message effects.

Of these, the first two problems are closely related and focus on solving optimization problems in which the problem parameters are misspecified but can be estimated through a parallel learning problem. The last problem focuses on the development of a distributed algorithm for the direct current formulation of the optimal power flow problem arising in power systems operation. Next, we provide a short description of each part of this dissertation.\n\nThe first part of this work considers a misspecified optimization problem that requires minimizing a function f(x;q*\u0012) over a closed and convex set X where q* is an unknown vector of parameters that may be learnt by a parallel learning process. In this context, we examine the development of coupled schemes that generate iterates (x_k,q_k) as k goes to infinity, then x_k converges to x*, a minimizer of f(x;q*\u0012) over X and q_k  converges to q*\u0012. In the first part of the work, we consider the solution of problems where f is either smooth or nonsmooth. In smooth strongly convex regimes, we demonstrate that such schemes still display a linear rate of convergence, albeit with inferior constants. When strong convexity assumptions are weakened, it can be shown that the convergence in function values sees a modification in the convergence rate of O(1/K) by an additive factor ||q_0 \u2212 \u0012q*||O(q_g^k + 1/K) where ||q_0 \u2212 \u0012q*|| represents the initial misspecification in q*\u0012, q_g denotes the contractive factor associated  with the learning process and K denotes the number of projection steps. In both convex and strongly convex regimes, diminishing steplength schemes are also provided and are less reliant on the knowledge of problem parameters. Finally, we present an averaging-based subgradient scheme and show that the optimal constant steplength leads to a modification in the rate by ||q_0 \u2212 \u0012q*||O(q_g^k + 1/K), implying no effect on the standard rate of O(1/sqrt(K)). In the second part of the chapter, we consider the solution of misspecified monotone variational inequality problems, motivated by the need to contend with more general equilibrium problems as well as the possibility of misspecification in the constraints. In this context, we first present a constant steplength misspecified extra-gradient scheme and prove its asymptotic convergence. This scheme is reliant on problem parameters (such as Lipschitz constants) and leads us to present a misspecified variant of iterative Tikhonov regularization. Preliminary numerics support the asymptotic and rate statements.\n\nIn the second portion of our work, we generalize the setting introduced in the first part and consider a misspecified optimization problem that requires minimizing of a convex function f(x;q*\u0012) in x over a misspecified constraint set represented by h(x;q*\u0012)<=0, where \u0012\u0003 is an unknown (or misspecified) vector of parameters. We develop a joint first-order inexact augmented Lagrangian scheme for computing x* while simultaneously learning q*. The term \u201cinexact\u201d refers to the property of the scheme that ensures that the Lagrangian subproblem is solved inexactly. In the first part of this chapter, we derive a non asymptotic convergence rate for primal suboptimality, dual suboptimality and primal infeasibilty when a constant penalty parameter is employed. Given a required \u000fe-accuracy in function value and when q* \u0012 is known, we prove that the iteration complexity of inexact augmented Lagrangian scheme is O(1/e\u000f). However, when q* is misspecified and learning is introduced to the problem, the iteration complexity of the joint scheme degenerates to O(1/e^4). Unfortunately, constant penalty Lagrangian schemes require tuning the penalty parameter, motivating the development of an increasing penalty parameter scheme. Specifically, in the second part of this chapter, we investigate the convergence rate of the joint scheme when an increasing sequence of penalty parameters is considered. In this setting, we show that if q* is known, the overall iteration complexity of inexact augmented Lagrangian scheme is O(\u000f1/e log(1/e)). As opposed to the case with constant penalty parameter, when learning is introduced to the problem, the order of iteration complexity of joint scheme remains unchanged. Finally, the empirical behavior of both schemes is studied on a portfolio optimization problem with a misspecified covariance matrix and preliminary numerical results support these findings.\n\nThe third part of this dissertation focuses on developing a distributed algorithm for the direct current optimal power flow problem (DCOPF) in power systems operation. Distributed optimization techniques have gained popularity in such settings as they provide a scalable avenue for resolving a broad class of such problems while respecting privacy concerns. One such a problem of interest is the DCOPF problem which seeks to minimize the cost of generation subject to flow limits, capacity constraints, and voltage bounds. In this chapter, we consider the application of an alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) scheme on the dual formulation of DCOPF. By leveraging problem structure, we proceed to show that the updates can be reduced to a fully distributed scheme that relies on solving optimization problems at the nodal (or bus) level. We prove the convergence of the developed scheme and utilize known results to claim that the scheme admits a non-asymptotic rate of O(1/k). Furthermore, we show that the constant in the rate can be minimized by appropriately choosing the penalty parameter. Finally, the developed algorithm is tested on IEEE 24 bus system and preliminary results suggest promise.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11866], "author_name_tesi": "Ahmadi, Hesamoddin ", "last_name_ssi": "Ahmadi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hesamoddin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vinayak V Shanbhag", "Necdet S Aybat", "Guodong Pang", "Minghui Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vinayak V Shanbhag, Dissertation Advisor", "Necdet S Aybat, Committee Member", "Guodong Pang, Committee Member", "Minghui Zhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Optimization and learning", "distributed optimization in power system", "convex optimization", "augmented Lagrangian"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Fast microfluidic mixers based on acoustically drivem microbubbles\n\n", "id": "9140", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1587", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Due to the low Reynolds number associated with microscale fluid flow, it is difficult to rapidly and homogenously mix two fluids.

Devices capable of finely controlled swimming at the microscale could enable bold ideas such as targeted drug delivery, non-invasive microsurgery, and precise materials assembly. Progress has already been made towards such artificial microswimmers using several means of actuation: chemical reactions and applied magnetic, electric or acoustic fields. However, the prevailing goal of selective actuation of a single microswimmer from within a group, the first step towards collaborative, guided action by a group of swimmers, has so far not been achieved. Here I present a new class of microswimmer that accomplishes for the first time selective actuation (Chapter 1). The swimmer design eschews the commonly-held design paradigm that microswimmers must use non-reciprocal motion to achieve propulsion; instead, the swimmer is propelled by oscillatory motion of an air bubble trapped within the swimmer\u2019s polymer body. This oscillatory motion is driven by a low-power biocompatible acoustic field to the ambient liquid, with meaningful swimmer propulsion occurring only at resonance frequencies of the bubble. This acoustically-powered microswimmer performs controllable rapid translational and rotational motion even in highly viscous liquid. By using a group of swimmers each with a different bubble size (and thus different resonance frequencies) selective actuation of a single swimmer from among the group can be readily achieved.\n\nCellular response to chemical microenvironments depends on the spatiotemporal characteristics of the stimulus, which is central to many biological processes including gene expression, cell migration, differentiation, apoptosis, and intercellular signaling. To date, studies have been limited to digital (or step) chemical stimulation with little control over the temporal counterparts. Microfluidic approaches have offered a higher level of sophistication in terms of liquid manipulation, however, due to low Reynolds number associated with these methods, precise temporal manipulation has remained a challenge. Furthermore, varying the sample concentration rapidly and controllably, an important task for a plethora of chemical and biological studies, has proven to be extremely difficult. Here I demonstrate (Chapter 3) a novel approach for generating chemical waveforms that permits continuous modulation of the signal characteristics including the shape, frequency, amplitude (sample concentration), and duty cycle, with frequencies reaching up to 30 Hz. Furthermore, using multiple bubbles of different sizes in a single microchannel, we show fast switching between multiple distinct stimuli, wherein the waveform of each stimulus is independently controlled. Using our device, we characterized the frequency-dependent activation and internalization of the \u03b2_2-adrenergic receptor (\uf0622-AR), a prototypic G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to epinephrine. We determined that \uf0622-AR internalization due to epinephrine occurs on timescales between 100 ms and 5sec. The chemical waveform generation and switching method presented herein is expected to be useful for understanding the dynamics of fast biomolecular processes. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9156], "author_name_tesi": "Ahmed, Daniel  ", "last_name_ssi": "Ahmed", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Huang", "Jun Huang", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Corina Stefania Drapaca", "Peter J Butler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Jun Huang, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Corina Stefania Drapaca, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Micropropulsion", "Acoustics", "bubble", "Microfluidics", "Chemical waveform", "Tunable chemical gradient"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO CAREER ADVANCEMENT BY TOP-LEVEL, ENTRY- LEVEL AND NON\u2013 ADMINISTRATIVE WOMEN IN PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS: A MIXED METHODS STUDY\n", "id": "12456", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1776", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the barriers and facilitators to career advancement among women administrators occupying top-level positions, those occupying entry-level positions and those in non-administrative positions in both rural and urban public school districts in central Pennsylvania.

As a result, increasing interests are focused on technologies with benefits such as reduced space requirements, reduced material consumption, and improved energy efficiency.  Origami-inspired engineering has gained much attention among scientists, engineers and mathematicians as an emerging form of technology with potential advantages such as relatively simple assembly process, realization of a large number of structures/shapes from a single sheet and finally, capability of folding into a compact shape and then unfolding (deploy or launch) into a larger-complex shape. Self-folding mechanism coupled with origami-inspired engineering is of particular interest where the structure has the ability to fold and unfold in response to an external stimulus without manual assistance. Researchers have investigated several self-folding mechanisms to realize origami-inspired engineering. In this work, an electroactive polymer (EAP), more specifically poly (vinylidende fluoride-trifluoroehtylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene) P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE), is studied and implemented to achieve origami-inspired self-folding structures.\nP(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) is used to realize electric field driven origami-inspired smart structures because of high room temperature dielectric constant (~50), fast response and reversible actuation mechanism. Processing condition of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) is studied based on the microstructure and electromechanical properties. Then a detail electrical, electromechanical, analytical, thermal, mechanical characterization on P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) is performed and presented. Through dielectric spectroscopy it is observed that the Curie transition of terpolymer shows a broad peak unlike normal ferroelectric polymer. Polarization study reveals very slim (less lossy) hysteresis loop. The current understanding of the origin of electrostrictive strain is attributed to phase transition from paraelectric to ferroelectric phases. In this work, electric field in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and sum frequency generation (SFG) study are conducted to investigate and confirm the switching of \u03b1 and \u03b3 phases to polar \uf062-phase. \nTo enable electric field-driven on-demand bending and folding of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE), various approaches are undertaken. First, electric field-driven large bending is achieved using a one layered unimorph actuator. Two approaches are pursued to convert the bending actuation into folding: notches and stiffener. While stiffener approach was not very successful, the notch approach showed more pronounced folding actuation. However, EAP actuators also possess drawbacks that impede their implementation in applications, namely they induce relatively low force and require high actuation voltages. To address these issues, a multilayered unimorph concept is proposed. Due to the complex fabrication process of multilayered unimorph actuator and the large number of experimental parameters, a universal analytical model is developed in this work to guide the experimental design and fabrication of these actuators. The model is based on a set of non-dimensional equations for electric field-induced curvature, tip displacement and blocked force, taking into account the wide range of design parameters (such as thickness, modulus, number of layers, electric field magnitude, etc.). First, analytical results are validated with experimental studies, then the model is used to predict the displacement, curvature, blocked force and maximum work output of multilayered unimorph actuators for various input parameters such as thickness, modulus, number of layers, electric field and stiffness contrast. An advantage of this combined modeling and experimental approach is the ability to maximize the performance of the designed actuator for the particular application of interest; for example, whether displacement or force is the goal would determine the number of layers and type of substrate used. Finally, origami-inspired smart structures are actuated using the insights from the developed electromechanical model. \nAlthough the multilayered actuator concept improves the electromechanical performance of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) actuator, with the increase of number of polymer layers the possibility of defect driven premature electrical breakdown also increases due to the requirement of high driving voltage. Polymer-based capacitors have the ability to clear defects with partial electrical breakdown and subsequent removal of a localized electrode section near the defect, which is known as self-clearing. A methodical approach to self-clear P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) terpolymer to delay premature defect-driven electrical breakdown of the terpolymer actuators at high operating electric fields is proposed in this study.  Breakdown results show that electrical breakdown strength is improved up to 18% in comparison to a control sample after self-clearing. Furthermore, the electromechanical performance in terms of blocked force and free displacement of terpolymer-based benders are examined after self-clearing and precleared samples show improved blocked force, free displacement and maximum sustainable electric field compared to control samples. The study demonstrates that controlled self-clearing of EAPs improves the breakdown limit and reliability of the EAP actuators for practical applications without impeding their electromechanical performance.  \nIn this study, the limitations of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) terpolymer are addressed and studied to achieve origami-inspired self-folding structures. First, processing conditions of terpolymer is studied and 9 hours annealing condition is selected based on the improved electromechanical performance. Electric field driven in-situ XRD and SFG is implemented which gives direct experimental evidence of the electric field induced reversible transition of \uf061 and \uf067 phases to \uf062 phase. The feasibility of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) to achieve electric field driven on-demand bending and folding is experimentally demonstrated using various geometric approaches. Then, a universal analytical model for an EAP based on beam bending theorem is developed which can also be implemented to design multilayered actuators driven by other physical fields such as magnetic or thermal. The concept to couple active multilayered actuators with inactive origami-inspired structures is introduced and successfully actuated. Finally, a systematic method is introduced to induce controlled self-clearing of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE), which improves electric field sustaining capability and reliably of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) devices.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15525], "author_name_tesi": "Ahmed, Saad ", "last_name_ssi": "Ahmed", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Saad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zoubeida Ounaies", "Zoubeida Ounaies", "Mary I Frecker", "Paris R Vonlockette", "Michael T Lanagan", "Timothy William Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zoubeida Ounaies, Dissertation Advisor", "Zoubeida Ounaies, Committee Chair", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Member", "Paris R Vonlockette, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Outside Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Electroactive polymer", "Origami-inspired engineering", "Self-clearing", "Electrode", "Dielectric breakdown", "Actuators", "P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Control, Assembly, Shape-dependent and Material-dependent Studies of Ultrasonically Propelled Nano- and Micromotors", "id": "26282", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11535", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fuel free, low power, ultrasonic propulsion of nano- and microscale motors is currently among the leading candidates for use for biomedical applications such as drug delivery and holds potential for use in a variety of other applications. It does not rely on a finite supply of fuel, provides autonomous motion and promises to be biocompatible. In order to realize its potential for use in biological systems as well as other applications it must be, its biocompatibility demonstrated,  the assembly behaviors of the propelled nanomotors explored, and the factors affecting motion interrogated. This document aims to shed light on these various aspects of ultrasonic motor propulsion.\n An overview of the field of nanomotors, including different propulsion mechanisms, types of motion and the challenges of propulsion at a low Reynolds number are provided in Chapter 1. \nIn Chapter 2, the steering of nanorod motors in biocompatible media towards living cells was demonstrated.  By incorporating a magnetic nickel segment (40\u00b15nm) within a gold-ruthenium rod that is 300 \u00b1 30nm in diameter and 4.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m long, it is possible to use a small external magnetic field to define the motor path. It is possible to suppress random motion, as quantified by the decrease in the mean displacement angle and rotation diffusion coefficient of the rods, and exert relatively fine control over the steering of acoustically propelled nanomotors using a 40milliTesla external magnetic field. Rods maintain autonomy and can be selectively guided toward single cells with micron level precision.  The effect of the exposure to ultrasonic power within the acoustic chamber on living cells in the presence of metallic nanorods was evaluated, and for durations as long as 20 minutes biological cells remain alive. \nIn Chapter 3, the assembly behavior of magnetic, steerable nanorods is explored. It was found  that segmented gold-ruthenium nanorods (300 \u00b1 30 nm in diameter and 2.0\u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m in length) with thin Ni segments at one end assemble into few particle, geometrically regular dimers, trimers and higher multimers while levitated in water by ~4 MHz ultrasound at the midpoint of a cylindrical acoustic cell. The assembly of the nanorods into multimers is controlled by interactions between the ferromagnetic Ni segments.  These assemblies are propelled autonomously in fluids by excitation with ultrasound and exhibit several distinct modes of motion. Multimer assembly and disassembly are dynamic in the ultrasonic field. The relative numbers of monomers, dimers, trimers, and higher multimers are dependent upon the number density of particles in the fluid and their speed, which is in turn determined by the ultrasonic power applied. The magnetic binding energy of the multimers estimated from their speed-dependent equilibria is in agreement with the calculated strength of the magnetic dipole interactions.  These autonomously propelled multimers can also be steered with an external magnetic field and remain intact after removal from the acoustic chamber for SEM imaging.\nIn Chapter 4, the shape dependent motion of micromotors in the acoustic chamber is explored. Micromotor structures are designed to interrogate the effect of various levels of shape asymmetry, aspect ratio and rotational asymmetry. Structures of precise shapes and dimensions are fabricated using a combined photolithography and electrodeposition or evaporation approach  that allows for the post synthesis release of structures from the substrate for testing within the acoustic chamber. Structures with dimensions larger than 20\u00b5m were shown to not undergo random autonomous motion while structures with dimensions smaller than 10\u00b5m undergo rotational random autonomous motion. These structures show a consistent polarity of motion indicating that the shape asymmetry of the structure indeed has an effect on its motion. This is in support of the existing consensus that propulsion can be attributed to motor shape asymmetry. \nIn Chapter 5, various factors that affect nanorod ultrasonic propulsion are explored. The effect of a bimetallic nanorod composition, nanorod size and the location of various acoustic behaviors and their response to changes in the electronic signal are studied. These observations also provide insight into the mechanism of ultrasonic propulsion. Bimetallic nanorod motors, exhibit similar behaviors as their monometallic counter parts including random autonomous motion and nodal patterns. Interestingly, bimetallic rods exhibit a consistent polarity of motion with one metal end leading axial propulsion. While propulsion has been attributed to shape asymmetry, in the presence of material asymmetry, the polarity of motion is determined by material asymmetry in cases where there is a difference in density between the two metal segments. In these cases the material segment with a lower density leads motion. Speed comparisons between rods of different densities have shown that lower density rods travel faster than higher density rods explaining the reason why the lower density segment within a bimetallic rod leads. Where only a small density difference exists between the metal segments in a bimetallic rod, the shape asymmetry at the ends of the rod determines the polarity of motion. Insight into the primary force propelling motors was gained by interrogating the length dependent speeds of rods by varying their lengths. As the rods got longer, their speed was reduced which is in support of a streaming induced drag force dominated motion. This was further supported by the correlation between the sharp reduction of acoustic streaming, as indicated by the disappearance of spinning chains, and the sharp reduction in axial propulsion speed of random autonomous motors within the levitation plane. The locations of the various nanorod behaviors within the acoustic chamber were noted.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11043], "author_name_tesi": "Ahmed, Suzanne ", "last_name_ssi": "Ahmed", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suzanne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk", "Ayusman Sen", "Benjamin James Lear", "Jun Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk, Dissertation Advisor", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "Jun Huang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanorod", "Nanomotor", "Ultrasonically Propelled Nanomotor", "Acoustic Nanomotor"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Modeling Of Hydraulic Fracture Network Propagation In Shale Gas Reservoirs", "id": "16369", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8066", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The most effective method for stimulating shale gas reservoirs is massive hydraulic fracture treatments.

However, compared to other human-computer interaction technologies such as speech recognition, gesture recognition has not been actively applied to personal devices such as mobile phones or laptops due to the spatial requirements when performing gestures as well as sensitivity to background noise. My research first devises a problem of recognizing speed sensitive finger gestures using a novel camera called Dynamic Vision Sensor camera, which detects the temporal luminance difference for each pixel at microsecond-level granularity and outputs a stream of on-events (brighter) and off-events (darker) to the hardware. As with other machine learning problems, the performance of a gesture classification task depends on how well the representative features are extracted. Thus the feature extraction process must consider device-specific data properties to maximize the feature recognition abilities while minimizing computational cost. My research studies two feature extraction methods, namely local and global feature extractions, which are designed to maximize the performance of the DVS camera-based gesture recognition system.\n First, the local feature extraction method aims to extract a smaller number of representative features from a long sequence of the raw gesture events detected by the DVS camera using segmentation. This approach is called the local feature extraction, since the features are extracted by considering neighboring events only. Specifically, I propose bottom-up segmentation methods, where the sequence of events are first divided into segments having the same time interval, called the time-based, or the same number of events, called the event-based, and the segments are repeatedly augmented based on the event distributions of the neighboring segments. The experimental results show that the event-based initial segmentation outperforms the time-based across different classifiers, and is more robust to noise. I also found that Bayesian network classifier is more accurate than hidden Markov model when features are well extracted using the event-based segmentation.\n Second, the global feature extraction method aims to construct higher level compound features by transforming the locally extracted features. Specifically, an evolutionary algorithm is employed to find a good set of simple and compound features. This is a challenging task due to the large search space and the risks of overfitting. I define problem-specific representation, genetic operators, and evaluation methods, and analyze how the specified mutation and crossover operator controls the individual\u2019s search space. The experimental results show that the proposed EA can extract a good set of compound features that can enhance the performance accuracy with a smaller number of features. Finally, I show how my evolutionary-based feature extraction approach can serve as a knowledge discovery process in the context of gesture recognition.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7422], "author_name_tesi": "Ahn, Eun Yeong Yeong", "last_name_ssi": "Ahn", "middle_name_ssi": "Yeong", "first_name_ssi": "Eun Yeong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Yen", "John Yen", "Dinghao Wu", "Dongwon Lee", "Patrick M Reed", "Tracy Mullen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Yen, Dissertation Advisor", "John Yen, Committee Chair", "Dinghao Wu, Committee Member", "Dongwon Lee, Committee Member", "Patrick M Reed, Committee Member", "Tracy Mullen, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Global Feature Extraction", "Local Feature Extraction", "DVS camera", "Evolutionary Algorithm", "Segmentation"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Learning to Teach within the Curricular Reform Context: A Sociocultural Perspective on English Student Teachers' Practicum Experience in South Korea", "id": "9351", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3570", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigates the extent to which the communicative language teaching (CLT)-oriented English language curricular reforms mandated by the Ministry of Education are instantiated in pre-service teacher education in South Korea. Specifically, it focuses on the extent to which a cohort of four pre-service teachers is able to internalize the concepts embedded in these curricular reforms and enact those concepts in their instructional practices during the practicum experience. Sociocultural theory (Lantolf & Thorne, 2006; Vygotsky 1978, 1986) and activity theory (Engestr\u00f6m, 1987, 1993, 1999a; Leontiev, 1978, 1981) were adopted as the theoretical framework through which teacher learning was examined. In particular, sociocultural theory allows us to understand and trace these student teachers' concept development. Activity theory, specifically, the activity system model (Engestr\u00f6m, 1987, 1993, 1999a) was applied to the data in order to identify if and where contradictions emerged that altered the nature of the activity system itself or maintained the status quo. Moreover, this model identified several dimensions of the activity system that appeared to influence their development and finally where and what needs to be changed within this activity system if the outcome of student teachers' learning is to be the ability to teach in line with the mandated curricular reforms. Two teams, consisting of a mentor teacher and two student teachers, were shadowed during a four-week practicum at a Korean laboratory middle school. The data consisted of interviews, classroom observations, team conferences, student teachers' journals, lesson plans, and curricular reform documents. The data were analyzed inductively through a grounded content analysis (Bogdan & Biklin, 1998; Glaser & Strauss, 1967) within the traditions of ethnographic qualitative research (Hammersley & Atkinson, 1995; Hymes, 1964; Watson-Gegeo, 1988; Wilcox, 1982).\nThe analyses revealed that each student teacher experienced different degrees of internalization depending on a range of individual, social, and institutional factors. The student teachers' apprenticeship of observation (Lortie, 2002) grounded in their previous schooling experiences and the everyday concepts with which they entered the teacher education program had a powerful influence how they perceived and enacted the curricular reform concepts during the practicum experience. In addition, the mediational means provided by the mentor teacher and instantiated in the practicum activities worked to socialize these student teachers into the normative ways of teaching English in this institutional context. Moreover, institutional constraints including pupils' lack of classroom participation and limited L2 abilities, the high-stakes nature of school-based exams, and pressure to complete the immediate practicum teaching requirements were found to constrain these student teachers' attempts to enact the CLT-oriented curriculum. Overall, the findings of this study indicate that conceptual, mentoring, and institutional support is critical for pre-service teacher concept development within the context of curricular reform efforts. In particular, the results indicate that broader macro-structures embedded within the activity systems in which these pre-service teachers were learning to teach must change in order for new teachers to fully overcome the contradictions they face in their initial classroom teaching experiences if language teacher education programs are to reorient their teaching conceptions and practices toward the CLT-based curricular reforms.

The dynamics and the attitude control of a spacecraft with a shifting mass distribution within the system are examined. The behavior and use of conventional attitude control actuators are widely developed and performing at the present time. However, the advantage of a shifting mass distribution concept can complement spacecraft attitude control, save mass, and extend a satellite\u2019s life. This can be adopted in practice by moving mass from one tank to another, similar to what an airplane does to balance weight. Using this shifting mass distribution concept, in conjunction with other attitude control devices, can augment the three-axis attitude control process. Shifting mass involves changing the center-of-mass of the system, and/or changing the moments of inertia of the system, which then ultimately can change the attitude behavior of the system.\nThis dissertation consists of two parts. First, the equations of motion for the shifting mass concept (also known as morphing) are developed. They are tested for their effects on attitude control by showing how shifting the mass changes the spacecraft\u2019s attitude behavior. Second, a method for optimal mass redistribution is shown using a combinatorial optimization theory under constraints. It closes with a simple example demonstrating an optimal reconfiguration.\nThe procedure of optimal reconfiguration from one mass distribution to another to accomplish attitude control has been demonstrated for several simple examples. Mass shifting could work as an attitude controller for fine-tuning attitude behavior in small satellites. Various constraints can be applied for different situations, such as no mass shift between two tanks connected by a failed pipe or total amount of shifted mass per pipe being set for the time optimum solution. Euler angle changes influenced by the mass reconfiguration are accomplished while stability conditions are satisfied. In order to increase the accuracy, generally, more than two control systems are installed in a satellite. Combination with another actuator will be examined to fulfill the full attitude control maneuver. Future work can also include more realistic spacecraft design and operational considerations on the behavior of this type of control system.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7211], "author_name_tesi": "Ahn, Young Tae ", "last_name_ssi": "Ahn", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Young Tae", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Bradley Spencer", "Robert Graham Melton", "Sven G Bilen", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Bradley Spencer, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Graham Melton, Committee Member", "Sven G Bilen, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["spacecraft attitude dynamics", "attitude control", "combinatorial optimization theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "MOLECULAR AND GENETIC STUDIES OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR AP-2\nIN DROSOPHILA APPENDAGE DEVELOPMENT\n", "id": "6397", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4897", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Transcription factor AP-2 has essential roles in nervous system, oro-facial and limb development based on studies of Drosophila and vertebrate model organisms. Previous studies have shown that dAP-2, the sole AP-2 family gene in Drosophila, is expressed in leg, antennal, and labial imaginal discs (anlaga of adult legs, antennae and proboscis, respectively) in multiple domains along the proximal-distal (PD) axis of the growing appendage. In leg imaginal discs of late larvae and early pupae, dAP-2 is expressed in nine domains of epithelial cells that presage boundaries (joints) between the ten segments comprising the adult leg. Genetic analysis has established that dAP-2 is required cell-autonomously for leg joint development and non-autonomously for outgrowth of leg segments. This thesis presents contributions I have made to broaden our understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating expression of dAP-2 in developing legs and antennae. I report the identification of multiple cis-regulatory elements each responsible for activation of particular domains of dAP-2 expression along the PD-axis of the leg and antenna. Molecular, genetic and biochemical analyses of one of these enhancers, PrF, which activates expression at the proximal end of the presumptive femur, reveals that it is directly regulated by Hox transcription factors and their homeodomain cofactor Extradenticle (Exd). Hox proteins, Exd, and Homothorax (Hth, a homeodomain protein required for nuclear localization of Exd) and their vertebrate orthologs have ancient roles in development of proximal regions of limbs. However, until this thesis, direct target genes for Hox and Exd proteins in leg development were unknown. Our analysis of dAP-2 transcriptional enhancers reveals that the seemingly simple repetitive pattern of dAP-2 expression in developing limbs is mediated by multiple separable enhancers each responsible for activation of a particular portion of the dAP-2 expression pattern and responding to region- and appendage-specific regulatory factors. Also described in the thesis are experiments using tissue-specific RNA interference (RNAi) to induce spatiotemporally restricted loss of dAP-2 and two other proteins, Nubbin, a POU-domain transcription factor implicated in limb development, and CG10440, a BTB/POZ protein reported to be a protein:protein interaction partner for dAP-2.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4874], "author_name_tesi": "Ahn, Younwook ", "last_name_ssi": "Ahn", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Younwook", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard W Ordway", "Robert Paulson", "Pamela J Mitchell", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Graham Hugh Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Pamela J Mitchell, Committee Chair", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hox proteins", "transcriptional regulation", "enhancers", "gene expression", "limb development"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Design of Large Field-of-View High-Resolution Miniaturized Imaging System", "id": "8109", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4605", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, there has been an interest in the design of computational imaging systems to meet specific imaging goals. Such systems comprise of an optical component as well a digital processing component that acts on the output of the optical component to give a high quality output. Computational imaging systems have been used successfully, for example, to achieve enhanced depth-of-field. The design of a computational imaging system to achieve a large field-of-view (FOV) is still an open problem.\n\nLarge FOV imaging systems find application in several areas such as surveillance, threat-detection and medical imaging. When designing imaging systems for such applications, there is generally a desire for high spatial resolution in addition to a large FOV. This entails the use of low $f$-number optics, which, in turn, results an image with very high spatial-frequency components at the focal plane. To avoid aliasing of the high-frequency content, the photoreceptor array must be sufficiently dense. Not only does this increase the cost and fabrication complexities, but the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the captured image degrades with a decrease in pixel size.\n\nTo circumvent this problem, the design of an imaging system based on the compound-eye of insects is proposed in this research. Instead of using a single lens to capture a large FOV, an array of smaller lenslets, each capturing a small FOV are arranged on a suitable curved surface. Moreover, in order to improve the SNR of the captured images, the pixel pitch in the focal-plane array (FPA) is deliberately kept large. To counter the resultant aliasing caused by this, superresolution techniques are used to combine the intensity values captured in neighboring LR frames to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image.\n\nThe goal of image sequence superresolution is to obtain a single HR image from multiple LR images of a given scene. In order to achieve this, it is essential that all the LR images capture different information about the scene. The Papoulis-Brown generalized sampling theorem (GST) states conditions under which a one-dimensional bandlimited signal can be reconstructed from a set of its filtered and undersampled versions. An extension of the Papoulis-Brown GST, to encompass multidimensional as well as non-bandlimited signals, is proved as part of this research. This provides the theoretical basis for image sequence superresolution.\n\nThe superresolution technique proposed in this research is based on the Moving Least Squares (MLS) method of approximation. The conventional MLS method involves estimating the intensity values at HR points by fitting a polynomial of a fixed order to a fixed neighborhood of LR points around the desired HR point. The amount of blur introduced by this process and the amount of noise-filtering that occurs depends on the order of the polynomial approximant and the size of the neighborhood. It is shown in this research that by varying these parameters adaptively for each HR grid-point, the resultant HR image produces images of superior visual quality by achieving the optimal trade-off between blur introduced and noise-filtering.\n\nFinally, the performance of the proposed large FOV imaging system with superresolution is tested by creating a virtual environment and capturing LR frames with a virtual camera whose parameters match the designed system.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4572], "author_name_tesi": "Ahuja, Nilesh A", "last_name_ssi": "Ahuja", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Nilesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nirmal K Bose", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "William Evan Higgins", "Jesse Louis Barlow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nirmal K Bose, Committee Chair", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member", "William Evan Higgins, Committee Member", "Jesse Louis Barlow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wavelets", "imaging system", "large field of view", "superresolution"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Promoting second language development with concept-based language instruction and intelligent computer-assisted language learning", "id": "26320", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "11356", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation reports on a study that aimed to support intermediate\u2013level American university students of Chinese (N=6) in developing conceptual knowledge in the functional purpose of the Chinese ba-construction and its differences from the canonical SVO and the topicalization OSV word orders through concept-based language instruction and intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL).

To better deploy daylighting, IES LM-83-12 proposed two metrics: Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA300/50%) and Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE1000, 250h) to evaluate the daylight conditions in a space. sDA300/50% indicates the sufficiency of daylight inside a room and the ASE1000, 250h shows the potential risks of visual discomfort. The LEED V4 criteria introduced the application of spatial daylight autonomy and annual sunlight exposure for the evaluation of daylight credits. \nIn order to have a better perspective on sDA and ASE, conventional metrics such as Daylight Factor (DF), Daylight Autonomy (DA), Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) and continuous Daylight Autonomy (cDA) were reviewed and compared with the two new metrics. This research was designed to investigate the sDA300/50% and the ASE1000, 250h of a classroom with dimensions of 33 feet \u00d7 30 feet \u00d7 10 feet excluding furniture and partitions. 6 selected cities were grouped by 3 latitudes. 8 fa\u00e7ade orientations were applied in 45\u00b0 steps. Overhang lengths ranging from 0 feet (non-overhang) to 4 feet (with a 5 feet overhang added to the ASE1000, 250h simulations), shading devices like roller shades and blinds, and climate (indicated by the sunshine hours) were included in this research as variables. The non-GUI advanced version of DAYSIMps and other program scripts were implemented in the simulations. ASE1000, 250h does not account for shading devices so there is no difference between roller shades and blind conditions for this metric.  sDA300/50% was studied for the roller shades with 5% VLT and horizontal blinds were modeled in two different approaches (a translucent material with 20% VLT distribution and  real geometry with 80% reflectance) per IES LM-83. \nThe simulation results of ASE1000, 250h, are dependent on the solar angles determined by the latitudes, window orientations, and the overhang length. The climate also affects the ASE results because of the sunshine hours throughout a year. The sDA denotes mainly the diffuse light penetration inside a space. The sDA300/50% results are impacted by the shading on/off hours and the climate. The shading devices were lowered if the direct sunlight covered more than 2% of the work plane area. The shading options are impacted by the window orientations, overhang lengths, and climate. \nRecommendations were provided to help designers improve the daylight performance inside the classroom. The directions of north, northeast, and northwest are the preferred orientations for achieving low ASE values. The longer overhang helps to increase the sDA in south, southwest, southeast, west and east facing and lowers the ASE only slightly on these orientations, but it still high. Adjustments to the overhang or aperture sizes can be made according to the climate to achieve better daylight performance and budget savings. As expected, the blinds have better sDA300/50% than the 5% VLT roller shades due to their higher transmittance.\nFurther studies to comprehensively evaluate daylight conditions and energy savings in total building energy are encouraged.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12468], "author_name_tesi": "Ai, Qi ", "last_name_ssi": "Ai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard George Mistrick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard George Mistrick, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Daylighting", "Annual Sunlight Exposure", "Spatial Daylight Autonomy", "overhang", "Window orientation", "climate"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "fast copper-catalyzed aryl c(sp2)-h amination with n-(2-pyridyl)sulfonyl directing group at ambient temperature", "id": "21536", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9926", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ubiquity of aryl amines makes them a crucial part in various organic syntheses.

Tides cause  periodic changes in sea and ground levels, they affect the length of day, and even volcanic activity. Tides cause effects on the scale larger than that of an individual body, affecting entire  orbits of planets and moons. \n\nIn this thesis we focus on the effect of tides on the dynamics of orbits, leaving aside internal effects of tides on planets. This thesis addresses a gap in the literature. On the one hand, the mathematical theory of celestial mechanics is a classical subject going back to Newton, and it reached a high level of development by people like Legendre, Lagrange, Laplace, Jacobi, Poincare, Moser, Arnold and others. Without exception (to our knowledge) this theory treats planets as point masses subject to Newtonian gravitational attraction, and without account for tidal effects. On the other hand, astronomers take more realistic models of the planets, but get few if any rigorous results.  In this thesis we study problems which fall in the gap between these two approaches: they do include tidal dissipation on the one hand, making them more realistic than the classical system which completely ignores them, but we make this dissipation simple enough to be tractable mathematically. \n\nTo build dissipation into the equations of motion,  we use the Routh method of introducing dissipation into Lagrangian equations of motion. According to this method, to write the equations of motion one only needs, in addition to the Lagrangian of the system, also the so--called Routh dissipation function: the power dissipated  as a function of generalized coordinates and generalized velocities of the system. We choose a simple class of dissipation functions, leaving more general questions for future work. \n\nIn this thesis we study tidal dissipation in two problems: the Kepler problem, and the restricted three--body problem, and ask the question of the long--term behavior of these problems with dissipation. There are two main results. First, we show that all the negative energy solutions of Kepler's problem approach circular motion, and do so with an additional interesting feature. \n\nThe second main result of this thesis deals with the restricted three body problem with dissipation. We show that the Lagrangian equilateral configurations become unstable due to tidal dissipation. This is a rather surprising result of dissipation causing instability. In addition, we show that almost all (in the Lebesgue sense) motions end either in a collision or an escape to infinity. \n\nThe restricted three body problem, which is infinitely delicate in the classical conservative case,  thus admits an essentially complete analysis if one introduces an arbitrarily small dissipation.

Attempts to mitigate the damage caused by human activity, such as wildlife translocations, may also be viewed as a type of disturbance despite the intended positive goals of many animal relocations. My research examines the risks wildlife translocations present relative to introduced or endemic infectious diseases and is driven by this over-arching question: what is the impact of augmenting populations with new hosts relative to the outbreak potential of pathogenic infections? For directly transmitted diseases, pathogens rely on host interaction and infectiousness to spread. Therefore, to truly assess the impact translocation events may have on local disease dynamics, we need to examine processes occurring across the landscape as well as between hosts and within hosts. \n\nMy research focuses on the intersection between animal management, behavior, and epidemiology using the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) as a case study. I first approach the translocation question at the population level (Chapter 1) and use tortoise movement data from a controlled, replicated translocation study to estimate changes in population connectivity using proximity networks. This study shows that translocation creates many new opportunities for contact and transmission that could result in higher prevalence of local pathogens. I next examine how pathogen characteristics like transmission efficiency per contact might affect these conclusions. In Chapter 2, I focus on between-host transmission of the pathogen Mycoplasma agassizii - the most significant pathogen identified in tortoise populations. By initiating controlled contact events between infected and uninfected tortoises, I was able to estimate how much interaction would be necessary between hosts to establish infection, relative to the infectiousness of the transmitting host. By comparing these transmission estimates to contact data collected from wild tortoises, Chapter 2 shows that transmission-efficient contact events will likely be distributed in a highly skewed fashion compared to the assumptions made in Chapter 1. In Chapter 3, I then explore what underlying factors may drive heterogeneity in tortoise contacts and thus aid in identifying circumstances that facilitate M. agassizii transmission events. Considering tortoise behavioral and spatial ecology, I identified metrics that improve prediction of contacts between tortoises and show that mating behavior largely underlies skewed contact rates. Finally, in Chapter 4, I return to tortoises infected with M. agassizii during the Chapter 2 study to determine how host response to infection and patterns of disease progression might affect host infectiousness and the length of the infectious period. I found varying levels of pathogen resistance and tolerance among infected hosts, which had a large impact on the quantity of pathogen shed and the duration of shedding. Collectively, these studies lay the groundwork for more comprehensive studies of M. agassizii epidemiology in both disturbed and undisturbed populations. I conclude with a discussion of future work incorporating these data into experimental translocations conducted as part of a larger project.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16412], "author_name_tesi": "Aiello, Christina Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Aiello", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Christina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter John Hudson", "Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Peter John Hudson", "David Andrew Miller", "Ephraim Mont Hanks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter John Hudson, Dissertation Advisor", "Tracy Lee Langkilde, Committee Chair", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Member", "David Andrew Miller, Committee Member", "Ephraim Mont Hanks, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wildlife epidemiology", "wildlife translocation", "behavioral ecology", "contact networks", "applied ecology", "wildlife management"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF IN VIVO PERISTALTIC AND SEGMENTAL MOTION IN THE RAT SMALL INTESTINE USING DYNAMIC MRI\n", "id": "10225", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "38", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conventional methods of quantifying segmental and peristaltic motion in animal models are highly invasive; involving, for example, the external isolation of segments of the gastrointestinal(GI) tract either from dead or anesthetized animals.

This study investigated the timing and spatial dynamics of chaparral and tree establishment in six chaparral stands in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California. Findings include that the oldest chaparral established after a fire event and were older than most trees in the stand.  The chaparral were multi-aged, indicating continued resprouting in the absence of fire. Tree density (trees hectare-1) was higher closer to the forest edge than further into the chaparral, suggesting gradual tree invasion from the forest.

Virtual models offer huge potential in construction projects as a mean of collaboration, integration and communication. Virtual models also offer huge benefit in enabling documentation of as-built information.  Despite the benefits of virtual models, their use is often limited to the design and tendering/bidding stage. Much more benefit can be derived from these models by extending their use to the construction and operations and maintenance phases of a facility\u2019s lifecycle. A good way of achieving this involves real-time bi-directional coordination between virtual models and the physical construction. To maintain bi-directional coordination, computational resources are required to tightly integrate the virtual models and the physical construction such that changes in one environment are automatically reflected in the other. This is termed a cyber-physical systems approach.\nThis research was concerned with investigating the applicability of a cyber-physical systems approach in the construction industry for real-time consistency checking between virtual models and the physical construction.  A variety of research methods was adopted in the conduct of the research. A literature review was undertaken on cyber-physical systems, related integration efforts and enabling technologies in the construction industry and other industry sectors. This review enabled the identification of suitable technologies and opportunities for improvements to existing approaches. To illustrate the applicability of cyber-physical systems in realistic construction situations, four use case scenarios were developed and analyzed with industry experts. The scenarios illustrate how cyber-physical systems approach can be used to enhance the steel erection process, notify door placement changes on a retrofit project, track changes to engineered components, and track and control bulk components during a facility lifecycle. Two prototype systems were developed, one of which was evaluated with a group of industry practitioners. \nThe developed systems illustrate how current construction practices can be enhanced and also shows the wider benefits of the proposed approach for the construction industry. These benefits include access to real-time progress information which will aid the construction project team in quick decision making and the potential for enhancing real-time communication and collaboration between the personnel on the job site and the office. Another benefit is that the proposed approach can facilitate improvements in facility management practices by enhancing the current process of as-built documentation, which will aid performance monitoring and control of the constructed facility. By demonstrating the potential of the cyber-physical systems integration approach, this research has opened the door to new CPS applications in the construction industry. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7051], "author_name_tesi": "Akanmu, Abiola Abosede", "last_name_ssi": "Akanmu", "middle_name_ssi": "Abosede", "first_name_ssi": "Abiola", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba", "John Messner", "Stephen James Treado", "John Yen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba, Dissertation Advisor", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba, Committee Chair", "John Messner, Committee Member", "Stephen James Treado, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Virtual Models", "Physical Construction", "Cyber-Physical Systems", "Bi-directional Coordination"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "EXTERNALLY IMPOSED THERMO-ELASTIC STRESS-STATES TO CONTROL OR DELAY FRACTURE DURING UNSUPPORTED CUTTING OF ALUMINA\n\n", "id": "7383", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5382", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nCeramics are extremely hard materials with high melting points. Their extreme hardness and brittle nature makes it almost impossible to use traditional mechanical methods to machine them. Laser cutting, being a thermal technique with zero contact force involved, is efficient in cutting ceramics into desired shape. However, even the use of lasers does not necessarily preclude damage and fracture, especially for manufacturing situations where the work pieces can only be partially supported during the cutting process. While \u201cnail-bed\u201d supports can readily eliminate this problem, they are not always practical for efficient or high-speed manufacturing of complex shapes. Either delaying or controlling fracture is an economical solution for such situations. In most instances, the resulting stresses are primarily mechanical in nature and arise from the bending and/or twisting moments from the still attached scrap. Even if the scrap weight remains relatively constant (as is usually the case), mixed-mode fracture is all but inevitable since the remaining (supporting) section is continuously diminishing as the cut progresses. Given the predominantly mechanical, and therefore predictable nature of the resulting stresses, it is conceivable that intentionally induced compressive thermo-elastic stresses due to an off-focused laser might be used to control (or at least, delay) such fractures. As such this research investigated the possibility of reducing the probability of premature fracture from bending and twisting stresses, by using a tailored laser surface heating scenario around a progressing cut to \u201cactively\u201d induce compressive thermal-stresses. A defocused laser was used in addition to the cutting laser for actively superimposing compressive thermal stresses. Numerical models capable of simulating unsupported laser cutting were developed and used to predict parameters (power, spot size, and location relative to the cutting laser) for the additional defocused laser. Numerical models computed temperatures, thermo-mechanical stresses and failure probabilities during unsupported cutting. These models were run for different sets of parameters for the defocused laser and those which resulted in a decrease in the failure probability were considered favorable set of parameters which could potentially delay premature fractures. Finally experiments were conducted using favorable parameters for the defocused laser to test the viability of the concept of \u201cactive stressing\u201d. Experiments indeed confirmed the possibility of delaying failure by using an additional defocused laser.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5375], "author_name_tesi": "Akarapu, Ravindra ", "last_name_ssi": "Akarapu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ravindra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert Eliot Segall", "John Richard Hellmann Jr.", "Barbara Shaw", "David John Green"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Chair", "John Richard Hellmann Jr., Committee Member", "Barbara Shaw, Committee Member", "David John Green, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Modeling of laser cutting", "Laser Cutting of ceramics", "Active Stressing", "Unsupported Cutting", "Mitigate Damage"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "link age: a factor in link prediction in a social network", "id": "25789", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11235", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work extends a previous one that investigated link age and its effect on network evolu- tion. Whether aging adversely influences prediction power of links in network evolution is the fundamental question partially answered in the previous work.

One of our hypotheses is that aging of a link is a crucial factor in link prediction. The other one is that prediction power of a link usually lessens over time. Using logistic regression and mixture extension, younger links are observed to dominate the link prediction process in most cases. However, this is not always the case. We cannot ignore the links that are old but still powerful. In addition to prediction power of the links, using a mixture model improves the overall link prediction accuracy.

The first essay considers a multi-component, multi-product (ATO) system that uses an independent base-stock policy for inventory replenishment. We formulate a two-stage stochastic integer program with recourse to determine the optimal base-stock policy and the optimal component allocation policy for the system. We show that the component allocation problem is a general multidimensional knapsack problem (MDKP) and is NP-hard. Therefore we propose a simple, order-based component allocation rule. Intensive testing indicates that our rule is robust, effective, and that it significantly outperforms existing methods. We use the sample average approximation method to determine the optimal base-stock levels. In the second essay, we exclusively concentrate on the component allocation rule proposed for the ATO system, and study its analytical properties and computational effectiveness. Although our heuristic is primarily intended for the general MDKP, it is remarkably effective also for the 0-1 MDKP. The heuristic uses the effective capacity, defined as the maximum number of copies of an item that can be accepted if the entire knapsack were to be used for that item alone, as the criteria to make item selection decisions. Instead of incrementing or decrementing the value of each decision variable by one unit in each iteration, as other heuristics do, our heuristic adds decision variables to the solution in batches. This unique feature of the new heuristic overcomes the inherent computational inefficiency of other general MDKP heuristics for large-scale problems. Finally, in the third essay of the dissertation, we study a dynamic resource allocation problem, set up in a revenue management context. An important feature of our model is that the resources are flexible. Each customer order can potentially be satisfied using any one of the capable resources, and the resources differ in their level of flexibility to process different demand types. We focus on the acceptance decisions of customer demands, and the assignment decisions of resources to accepted demands. We model the revenue maximization problem as a stochastic dynamic program, which is computationally challenging to solve. Based on our insights gained from the analysis of special cases of the problem, we propose several approximate solutions; rollout, threshold, newsboy and dynamic randomization heuristics. Through an extensive simulation study, we verify that these heuristics are indeed effective in solving the problem, and are near-optimal for many problem\ninstances. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6813], "author_name_tesi": "Akcay, Yalcin ", "last_name_ssi": "Akcay", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yalcin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anant Balakrishnan", "Susan H Xu", "Jack C Hayya", "Gautam Natarajan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anant Balakrishnan, Committee Member", "Susan H Xu, Committee Chair", "Jack C Hayya, Committee Member", "Gautam Natarajan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multidimensional Knapsack Problem", "Assemble-to-Order Systems", "Flexible Resources", "Revenue Management"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Quantifying Green Construction Safety\nthrough Company Outcomes", "id": "16316", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7939", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Around the world, the construction industry is known for its high rates of injuries and accidents. Having a safer working environment is a priority not only during construction, but also during the early phases of the design. Current literature shows the positive impacts of design integration on both safety performance and green construction. The design for safety process improves safety performance and reduces risks on construction worksites. Similarly, decisions made during the design phase have significant effects on sustainability and end building performance goals. Recent studies have identified the safety risks associated with specific sustainable design attributes and practices. Current literature lacks in identifying the discrepancy between the value of integration for both safety and green building design and construction, and the noted increased safety incidents on green projects.\n\nThe goal of this research is to identify, at a company level, if there is a correlation between quantity of green construction performed and safety performance of green contractors. This research study quantified the impact on safety metrics at a company level for the amount of green construction captured via revenues. With this intention, for the main efforts of this research study quantitative research methods were used, including analysis of covariance by considering year as a categorical variable to examine the relationship between safety and green construction, and continued with qualitative methods, including tracking project data by conducting case studies and conducting interviews with safety experts to support the findings of statistical analysis. \n\nThe results include that higher revenues are suggestive of higher safety incidents. The more green construction revenue, the higher the number of recordable incidents and lost time cases measured. When the amount of design-build work was considered as a percentage of revenue, the impact is significant and negatively correlated to recordable incidents and lost time cases. This suggests that despite a positive correlation with increased green revenue and design-build revenue, the use of integrated delivery, such as design-build, may help mitigate safety impacts. Case study findings suggest that a contractor might have different implementations on project level based on the project requirements even though it is expected to have the same strategies and implementations that come from the company level safety program. Also, they indicate the impact of owner and designer involvements and the effect of owner requirements to achieve better implementation for safety. Interviews add value to this research study by identifying the translation from company strategies to projects for achieving successful safety performance in green building construction.

In traditional reactor core analysis, thermal reactor core calculations are customarily performed with 3-D two-group nodal diffusion methods. Steady-state multi-group transport theory calculations on heterogeneous single assembly domains subject to reflective boundary conditions are normally used to prepare the equivalent two-group spatially homogenized nodal parameters. For steady-state applications, the equivalent nodal parameters are theoretically well-defined; but, for transient applications, the definition of the nodal kinetics parameters, in particular, delayed neutron precursor data is somewhat unclear. The fact that delayed neutrons are emitted at considerably lower energies than prompt neutrons and that this difference cannot be accounted for in a two-group representation is of particular concern. To compensate for this inherent deficiency of the two-group model a correction is applied to the nodal values of the delayed neutron fractions; however, the adequacy of this correction has never been tested thoroughly for Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) applications, especially where the instantaneous thermal-hydraulic conditions play an important role on the core neutron kinetics calculations.

The design of effective catalysts is necessary to increase the rate of the electrocatalytic reactions in order to improve the working efficiency of the electrochemical devices. The reactions occur at the electrode/electrolyte interface, with the reaction rates controlled by complex interactions between the redox species and electrolytic ions on the solvated electrode surface that operates under constant applied potentials. These phenomena are difficult to probe experimentally and computational modeling can provide insight on the impact of the electrode potential and electrolyte distribution on the electrocatalytic processes. This dissertation primarily employs Density Functional Theory (DFT) to investigate the effect of the electrode potential on the thermodynamics and kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions. Modeling the electrolyte distribution is not feasible with computationally intensive DFT calculations and as such, classical reactive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to model the structure and dynamics of the electrolyte at longer length and time scales. \nThe electrochemical reduction of CO2 is given special emphasis although the methods and approaches adopted in this dissertation are generally applicable towards investigating any electrocatalytic reaction of interest. CO2 electroreduction (ER) offers the possibility of generating hydrocarbons from renewable energy sources, however, the process is limited by (i) the use of inefficient electrocatalysts that are not selective and active towards hydrocarbon formation, (ii) a poor understanding of the reaction mechanism and the key rate-limiting and selectivity determining steps and, (iii) limited insight on the influence of the electrolyte composition on the selectivity and production rate of key intermediates. In this dissertation, DFT-based calculations are used to probe the electrode potential-dependent activity, reactivity and selectivity of various transition metal electrocatalysts for CO2 ER. A model to estimate the potential-dependent reaction energies and activation barriers is developed and applied to examine elementary kinetics of C-H, O-H and N-H bond breaking and forming steps. The implications of DFT model choices are explored. To address the limitations in the length and time scales of the DFT models, classical reactive MD simulations using ReaxFF are performed to model the electrochemical interface and examine the interfacial distribution and dynamics of the solvent and electrolytic ions under constant applied electrode potentials. The overall objective of this dissertation is to develop computational modeling tools for electrocatalytic reactions and examine the factors that influence the rational design of electrode materials for key electrocatalytic processes.

While mass transport can occur through concrete\u2019s porous matrix, cracks can significantly accelerate the rate of mass transport and effectively influence the service life of concrete structures. To allow concrete service life prediction models to correctly account for the effect of cracks on concrete durability, mass transport thru cracks must be characterized. In this study, transport properties of cracks are measured to quantify the saturated hydraulic permeability and diffusion coefficient of cracks as a function of crack geometry (i.e.; crack width, crack tortuosity and crack wall roughness). Saturated permeability and diffusion coefficient of cracks are measured by constant head permeability test, electrical migration test, and electrical impedance spectroscopy. Plain and fiber reinforced cement paste and mortar as well as simulated crack samples are tested. The results of permeability test showed that the permeability of a crack is a function of crack width squared and can be predicted using Louis formula when crack tortuosity and surface roughness of the crack walls are accounted for. The results of the migration and impedance tests showed that the diffusion coefficient of the crack is not dependent on the crack width, but is primarily a function of volume fraction of cracks. The only parameter that is changing with the crack width is the crack connectivity.

It seems \ntherefore reasonable to combine diversity schemes \nof different dimensions with one another to \narrive into a practical solution.  This is the \nprimary focus in this thesis.  In addition, to \nfurther increase the capacity, we consider some \npractical rate-adaptive coding (modulation) \nschemes to be used along with the proposed space \nand time diversity schemes.  The first part of \nthis thesis is dedicated to applying the above \nconcepts to some well-known radio channels, \nhaving the goal of providing a guaranteed \nQuality-of-Service (QoS) at all channel \nconditions.  The second part of this work is \ndedicated to indoor wireless infrared channels. \nIn these channels, it is possible to provide \nspace diversity in a manner somewhat different \nfrom the way it is provided in radio systems, \nand for this reason, it is commonly referred to \nas direction (or angle) diversity.  We first \ninvestigate the properties of our proposed \ninfrared channel and look into some of its \ndeterministic as well as statistical \ncharacteristics.  Based on these characteristics \nwe propose efficient modulation, coding and \ncombining schemes to achieve the desired goal of \nQoS provisioning at all possible positions within \nthe coverage area.  Coding in time as well as in \nspace in this case allows for having a low-power \nwireless local-area network that can operate at \nvery high bit rates.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3440], "author_name_tesi": "Akhavan, Koorosh ", "last_name_ssi": "Akhavan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Koorosh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Jenkins", "Rajeev Sharma", "Shizhuo Yin", "Hao Che", "Lynn A Carpenter", "Mohsen Kavehrad"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member", "Rajeev Sharma, Committee Member", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member", "Hao Che, Committee Member", "Lynn A Carpenter, Committee Member", "Mohsen Kavehrad, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["ARQ", "Wireless Infrared", "Code Combining"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Essays on Time-Inconsistency and Bargaining", "id": "7086", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6965", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis consists of three essays focusing on time inconsistency in a game theoretic framework.\n\nThe first essay studies an equilibrium concept for both one and two player extensive form games. The equilibrium concept, by construction, embraces different bounded rationality approaches in one framework. A special case that examines the games played by potentially time inconsistent agents is presented and naive backwards induction solution concept is specified.\n\nThe second essay focuses on an alternating offers bargaining game between possibly time inconsistent players. The time inconsistency\nis modeled by quasi hyperbolic discounting and naive backwards induction solution concept is used in order to obtain the results. Both naive agents who remain naive and those who learn\nabout their own preferences are considered. Offers of the players who are naive are never accepted by any type of player in both no learning and gradual learning cases. The game between a naive player who never learn and a time consistent agent ends in immediate agreement if the time consistent agent is the proposer. A one period delay occurs if time consistent agent is the responder. The more naive the player is, the higher share she gets. In addition, two naive agents who never learn disagree perpetually. When naive agents who are able to learn play against exponential or sophisticated agents, there exists a critical date before which there is no agreement. Therefore, the existence of time inconsistent players who can learn their types as they play the game can be a new explanation\nfor delays in bargaining. The relationship among the degree of naivete, impatience level and bargaining delay is also characterized.\n\nThe third essay examines the role of time inconsistency in intertemporal investment decisions. Quasi hyperbolic discounting framework is incorporated into a game including two stages, namely, self investment game and alternating offers bargaining game. We found that exponential and naive agents finish investment stage without any delay whereas sophisticated agents have a periodical investment schedule. In addition, there exists a threshold level of preference for immediate gratification that makes the sophisticated agent finish investment stage without any delay. When a bonus scheme is added, we showed that the amount of bonus should  increase in order for naive agent to continue to invest and finish the investment stage. Moreover, the agents with higher self control problems should be given higher bonus in order to induce them to complete the same investment project.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6962], "author_name_tesi": "Akin, Zafer ", "last_name_ssi": "Akin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zafer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Susanna Esteban", "Edward James Green", "Abdullah Yavas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Susanna Esteban, Committee Member", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "Abdullah Yavas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Game Theory", "Bargaining", "Hyperbolic Discounting"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Improving The Efficiency of NADPH-dependent Xylitol Production in Engineered Escherichia coli\n\n", "id": "10962", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4840", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The development of cost-effective and sustainable microbial processes for the production of chemicals and high-energy fuels is crucial to reducing current dependence on petroleum. Nature has provided a vast collection of biological systems that can be redesigned to efficiently convert readily available, inexpensive, biomass-derived sugars to these high-value products. In this study we describe various metabolic engineering strategies aimed towards developing the E. coli bacterium as a microbial host for heterologous, nicotinamide cofactor (NADH and NADPH)-dependent transformations. These transformations are of major importance because they are applicable in the synthesis of a variety of important chemicals. NADPH-dependent xylitol production from glucose/xylose mixtures serves as the experimental platform and is used to illustrate the important aspects of this work. The experimental system is designed such that glucose oxidation serves as the source of electrons for xylose reduction to xylitol. Previous assessments of the metabolic behavior of this system under aerobic conditions showed that xylose conversion to xylitol was less than 100% due to production of xylulose as a by-product. It was also shown that cofactors were not efficiently diverted towards xylitol production and this resulted in sub-optimal yields (defined as mol of xylitol produced/ glucose consumed and denoted as YRPG) under these conditions. Therefore in this study genetic modifications and process conditions aimed at improving xylose conversion to xylitol, the efficiency of the biotransformation (defined as experimental YRPG / theoretical YRPG) and the productivity of the engineered system are investigated. We focus on parameters such as competing pathways, transhydrogenase activity and level of aeration, as these are key factors expected to impact cofactor availability for the desired biotransformations. We find that efficiency of the biotransformation is maximal under non-respiratory conditions possibly due to the elimination of respiration as a sink of reduced cofactors.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4817], "author_name_tesi": "Akinterinwa, Olubolaji ", "last_name_ssi": "Akinterinwa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Olubolaji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Michael Cirino", "Patrick C Cirino", "Donald Ashley Bryant", "Costas D Maranas", "Andrew Zydney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Michael Cirino, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick C Cirino, Committee Chair", "Donald Ashley Bryant, Committee Member", "Costas D Maranas, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biocatalysis", "Escherichia coli", "metabolic engineering", "xylitol", "NADPH"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "ADSORPTION Of WATER ON SILICA and SILICATE GLASSES", "id": "29156", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8666", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-01-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aqueous surface chemistry of glasses has a significant effect on material properties, including chemical durability, mechanical strength and electrical conductivity. Thus, a fundamental understanding of water adsorption phenomena on glass surfaces is enormously important. This study examined adsorption phenomena on multicomponent glass surfaces by DRIFTs (Diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) and TG-MS (Thermogravimetric mass spectroscopy). In particular, the effect of non-bridging oxygen and alkali/alkaline earth ions on the variation and concentration of surface adsorption sites, and eventually the degree of hydration, were examined on dry- and wet-ground multicomponent silicate glasses. For this purpose, commercial Ba-silicate, Ba-, Ca-, Mg-boroaluminosilicate, float glass, fused silica and fused quartz glasses have been used. The adsorbed water on the glass surface was distinguished from bulk water, trapped in interstices of silicate network, by D2O exchange experiments. The variation in the glass surface composition as a function of the chemical composition and grinding media (wet or dry) was characterized by XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). The effect of chemical structure on physically adsorbed water and chemisorbed water species on different multicomponent glasses were identified via adsorption/desorption experiments using in-situ DRIFTs. \n\nThe degree of hydration was found to vary depending on the concentration of Si-OH groups which is strongly dependent on the presence of (1) modifier ions or non-bridging oxygen, (2) glass intermediates (Al2O3 or B2O3) and (3) water already trapped in the bulk structure of the glass. For Ba-silicate and float glass with many non-bridging oxygen sites, the number of silanol groups (SiOH) and subsequent hydration rate is higher compared to fused silica and fused quartz. Moreover, BaCO3 formation on the surface of Ba-silicate network also enhanced the degree of hydration. The number of water molecules on/in Ba-silicate glasses was found three times higher than pure silica counterparts. The presence of Al2O3 and B2O3 in modifier-containing silicate glasses decreases the number of NBO\u2019s due to their charge compensation of [AlO4]- and [BO4]-groups in the glass network structure. This limits the hydroxylation and subsequent hydration process. For this reason, the number of water adsorption sites in/on Ba-boraluminosilicate glasses was found considerably smaller than Ba-silicate.  \nBesides the effect of chemical composition, the mechanical milling of glass powders in aqueous environments also promotes the degree of hydration. The effect of milling media is more predominant in Ba-silicate glasses with the high number of non-bridging oxygen. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8543], "author_name_tesi": "Akkopru Akgun, Betul ", "last_name_ssi": "Akkopru Akgun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Betul", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carlo G Pantano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carlo G Pantano, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["water adsorption", "silicate glasses", "physisorption", "chemisorption"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Distribution of La and O Vacancies in Bulk and Surface Models of Ceria", "id": "13658mqa5531", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13658", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dry reforming of methane is a significant alternative energy technology that can valorize two major greenhouse gases, methane and carbon dioxide, by converting them to synthesis gas. One of the major challenges involved in making dry reforming of methane a commercially viable process is to design a catalyst that would have high activity, selectivity, sulfur tolerance, and resistance to coking. Preliminary experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies have shown that transition metal (TM) doped rare earth oxides (REOs) can provide better coking resistance and sulfur tolerance than conventional reforming catalysts by forming oxysulfide surfaces. Further atomistic scale understanding of these catalytic systems for dry reforming of methane calls for a thorough understanding of dopant and doping induced O vacancy distribution in the REO, to develop a reasonable model of the TM-doped REO.\n\tThis thesis utilizes DFT to study the distribution of La and O vacancies in bulk and surface models CeO2.

The presence of clays minerals is often considered as a major cause of formation damage. Thus, clay behavior in porous media needs to be taken into account when evaluating the potential productive capacity of hydrocarbon reservoir sandstones. Since the main mechanisms of permeability reduction, such as fine migration and clay swelling, occur at the pore-scale, in this study we couple permeability experiments with X-ray \u03bc-computed tomography (\u03bc-CT) to visualize and quantify clay behavior in porous media. The selected porous media were packed columns (diameter, d=1.27 cm, average length, L=6.4 cm) of soda lime beads and quartz grains.  Various amounts of swelling (montmorillonite) and non-swelling (kaolinite) clays were added as coatings on beads and quartz. The amount of clay in the samples varied from 1.38 to 5.5wt.% in montmorillonite-coated samples and from 2.0 to 6.84wt.% in kaolinite-coated samples.  Permeability measurements were performed on each sample to investigate the impact of clay content and grain size on permeability reduction as a result of clay swelling. Permeability changes were monitored as a function of time.  Visualization of coated bead and grains columns by \u03bc-CT provided quantitative information on morphological changes of clay grains/coatings among dry and water-saturated samples. All clay-coated samples showed 10-40% decrease in permeability as compared to uncoated samples (K/Ko= 0.6-0.9). In general, the higher the clay content was, the larger permeability reduction was observed. Permeability remained constant within an error after 4 hours of flow experiment in montmorillonite samples.  In contrast, permeability of kaolinite samples oscillated with time, possibly due to fine migration. A 39% volume increase of montmorillonite particles was observed by \u03bc-CT immediately after the sample was saturated with water, i.e. swelling occurred almost instantaneously after water-clay contact. However, no further changes in volume were observed after 4 hours of flow. Kaolinite-coated samples showed a 15% volume increase of clay particles, which was attributed to the hydration of clay pellets by water. The calculated porosity reduction associated with clay swelling ranged from 0.4-1.7% including both montmorillonite- and kaolinite-coated samples. This decrease in porosity was estimated to cause only a 2-5% reduction in permeability, primarily due to the high initial porosity and permeability of the selected samples. This study presents a base line to estimate changes in permeability as a result of clay swelling for variable clay content, grain size, and porosity.

For support vector machine (SVM) classification, a widely used technique is Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). We demonstrate RFE is not consistent with margin maximization, central to the SVM learning approach. We thus propose explicit margin-based feature elimination (MFE) for SVMs and show both improved margin and improved generalization, compared with RFE. Moreover, for the case of a nonlinear kernel, we show RFE assumes the squared weight vector 2-norm is strictly decreasing as features are eliminated. We demonstrate this is not true for the Gaussian kernel and, consequently, RFE may give poor results in this case. We show that MFE for nonlinear kernels gives better margin and generalization. We also present an extension which achieves further margin gains, by optimizing only two degrees of freedom -- the hyperplane's intercept and its squared 2-norm -- with the weight vector orientation fixed. We finally introduce an extension that allows margin slackness. We compare against several alternatives, including RFE and a linear programming method that embeds feature selection within the classifier design. On high-dimensional gene microarray data sets, UC Irvine repository data sets, and Alzheimer's disease brain image data, MFE methods give promising results. We then develop several MFE-based feature elimination methods for the case of more than two classes (the``multiclass' case). We compare against RFE-based multiclass feature elimination and show that our MFE-based methods again consistently achieve better generalization performance. In summary, we identify some difficulties with the well-known RFE method, especially in the kernel case, develop novel, margin-based feature selection methods for linear and kernel-based two-class and multiclass discriminant functions for support vector machines (SVMs) addressing separable and nonseparable contexts, and provide an objective experimental comparison of several feature selection methods, which also evaluates consistency between a classifier's margin and its generalization accuracy.\n\nWe then apply our SVM classification and MFE methods to the challenging problem of predicting the onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), focusing on predicting conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD using only a single, first-visit MRI for the person so as to aim for early diagnosis. In addition, we apply MFE for selecting brain regions as disease ``biomarkers'. For these aims, for the pre-classification image data preparation step, we co-develop an MRI brain image processing pipeline system named STAMPS, as well as develop a related system with additional capabilities named STAMPYS. These systems utilize external standard MRI brain image processing tools and generate output image types particularly suitable for detecting (and encoding) brain atrophy for Alzheimer's disease. We identify and remedy some basic MRI image processing problems caused by some limitations of external tools used in STAMPS -- i.e. we introduce our basic fv (fill ventricle) algorithm for ventricle segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). For prediction of conversion to AD for MCI patients, we demonstrate that our early diagnosis system achieves higher accuracy than similar recently published methods.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6814], "author_name_tesi": "Aksu, Yaman ", "last_name_ssi": "Aksu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yaman", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Profs David J Miller And George Kesidis", "David Jonathan Miller", "George Kesidis", "Qing X Yang", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "James Z Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Profs David J Miller And George Kesidis, Dissertation Advisor", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Chair", "George Kesidis, Committee Member", "Qing X Yang, Committee Chair", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Member", "James Z Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Alzheimer", "Support Vector Machine", "biomedical imaging", "discriminant function", "classification", "machine learning", "MRI", "brain imaging", "gene microarray"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Level Tracking in Thermal-Hydraulic Simulations of Nuclear Reactors\n\n", "id": "6076", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "476", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-02-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The presence of stratified liquid-gas interfaces in vertical flows poses difficulties to most classes of solution methods for two-phase flows of practical interest in the field of reactor safety and thermal-hydraulics. These difficulties can plague the reactor simulations unless handled with proper care. To illustrate these difficulties, the US NRC Consolidated Thermal-hydraulics Code (TRAC-M) was exercised with selected numerical benchmark problems. These numerical benchmarks demonstrate that the use of an average void fraction for computational volumes simulating vertical flows is inadequate when these volumes consist of stratified liquid-gas interfaces. An accurate description of these computational volumes, which are divided into two regions with distinct flow topology, requires that separate void fractions be assigned to each region. This strategy requires that the liquid-gas interfaces be tracked in order to determine their location, the volumes of regions separated by the interface, and the void fractions in these regions.\n\n\nAlthough the idea of tracking stratified liquid-gas interfaces is not new, its applications in the reactor safety codes in the past showed only limited success. Improper modifications to the field equations were mostly responsible for their failures. This thesis proposes a systematic approach to implement a method for tracking interfaces in the one- and three-dimensional field equations of TRAC-M. This approach is applicable to the solution methods of known thermal-hydraulic codes of the same class. The success of this approach was demonstrated by exercising TRAC-M with the same benchmark problems that were previously used to expose the difficulties of handling the liquid-gas interfaces.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [473], "author_name_tesi": "Aktas, Birol ", "last_name_ssi": "Aktas", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Birol", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Harlan Mahaffy", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Gordon Edward Robinson", "Christopher J Duffy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Harlan Mahaffy, Committee Chair", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Gordon Edward Robinson, Committee Member", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["level tracking", "computational fluid mechanics", "two-phase flows", "thermal-hydraulics", "reactor safety"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Workload Mapping Method For Multicore\nsystems Using Cross-run Statistics", "id": "15343", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7819", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multicore architectures have become the design of choice in today\u2019s microprocessor\nmarket.

Ducted fans provide a higher static thrust/power ratio, improved safety and lower noise levels for a given diameter when compared to open rotors. Although ducted fans provide high performance in many \u201cVertical Take-Off and Landing\u201d (VTOL) applications, there are still unresolved problems associated with these unique machines. The main problems are distortion of inlet flow due to forward flight and tip leakage related problems. Distorted inlet flow results in lip separation on the inner side of the lip section severely limiting the lift generation and controllability of vertical lift systems. Inlet flow distortions passing through a typical ducted fan rotor become increasingly detrimental with increasing forward flight velocity. Fan rotor tip leakage flow is another source of aerodynamic loss for ducted fan systems. Tip leakage related problems adversely affect the general performance of VTOL \u201cUninhabited Aerial Vehicles\u201d (UAV) systems.\n\nThe current research utilized experimental and computational techniques in 5\" and 22\" diameter ducted fan test systems that have been custom designed and manufactured.  Qualitative investigation of flow around the ducted fan was also performed using smoke flow visualizations. Quantitative measurements consisted of 2D and 3D velocity measurements using planar and Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV and SPIV), high resolution total pressure measurements using Kiel total pressure probes and real time six-component force and torque measurements. The computational techniques used in this thesis included a recently developed radial equilibrium based rotor model (REBRM) and a three dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) based CFD model. \n\nA radial equilibrium based rotor model (REBRM) developed by the author was effectively integrated into a three-dimensional RANS based computational system. The PIV measurements and computational flow predictions using (REBRM) near the fan inlet plane were in a good agreement at hover and forward flight conditions. The aerodynamic modifications resulting from the fan inlet flow distortions in forward flight regime were clearly captured in 2D PIV results. High resolution total pressure measurements at the downstream of the fan rotor showed that tip leakage, rotor hub separation, and passage flow related total pressure losses were dominant in hover condition. However, the losses were dramatically increased in forward flight because of inlet lip separation and distortion. \n\nA novel ducted fan inlet flow conditioning concept named \u201cDouble Ducted Fan\u201d (DDF) was developed. The (DDF) concept has a potential to significantly improve the performance and controllability of VTOL UAVs and many other ducted fan based vertical lift systems. The new concept that will significantly reduce the inlet lip separation related performance penalties used a secondary stationary duct system to control \u201cinlet lip separation\u201d occurring especially at elevated forward flight velocities. The (DDF) is self-adjusting in a wide forward flight velocity range. DDFs corrective aerodynamic influence becomes more pronounced with increasing flight velocity due to its inherent design properties. \n\nRANS simulations of the flow around rotor blades and duct geometry in the rotating frame of reference provided a comprehensive description of the tip leakage and passage flow in the flow environment of the two ducted fan research facilities developed throughout this thesis. The aerodynamic measurements and results of the RANS simulation showed good agreement especially near the tip region. A number of novel tip treatments based on custom designed pressure side extensions were introduced. Various tip leakage mitigation schemes were introduced by varying the chordwise location and the width of the extension in the circumferential direction. The current study showed that a proper selection of the pressure side bump location and width were the two critical parameters influencing the success of the tip leakage mitigation approach.  Significant gains in axial mean velocity component were observed when a proper pressure side tip extension was used. It is also observed that an effective tip leakage mitigation scheme significantly reduced the tangential velocity component near the tip of the axial fan blade. Reduced tip clearance related flow interactions were essential in improving the energy efficiency and range of ducted fan based vehicle. Full and inclined pressure side tip squealers were designed. Squealer tips were effective in changing the overall trajectory of the tip vortex to a higher path in radial direction. The interaction of rotor blades and tip vortex was effectively reduced and aerodynamic performance of the rotor blades was improved. The overall aerodynamic gain was a measurable reduction in leakage mass flow rate. This leakage reduction increased thrust significantly. Full and inclined pressure side tip squealers increased thrust obtained in hover condition by 9.1 % and 9.6 % respectively. A reduction or elimination of the momentum deficit in tip vortices is essential to reduce the adverse performance effects originating from the unsteady and highly turbulent tip leakage flows rotating against a stationary casing. The novel tip treatments developed throughout this thesis research are highly effective in reducing the adverse performance effects of ducted fan systems developed for VTOL vehicles. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [390], "author_name_tesi": "Akturk, Ali ", "last_name_ssi": "Akturk", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ali", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci", "Cengiz Camci", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin", "Edward C Smith", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Michael H Krane"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci, Dissertation Advisor", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Chair", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Committee Member", "Edward C Smith, Committee Member", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Michael H Krane, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ducted fan", "Inlet flow distortion", "Tip leakage", "Tip leakage mitigation", "Double ducted fan", "Pressure side platform", "Fan rotor tip loss", "Tip treatment"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Essays On Mechanism Design Without Transfers", "id": "22392", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10096", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of three chapters.\n\nIn Chapter 1, we compare two widely used allocation methods for school choice, the Deferred Acceptance (DA) mechanism and the Boston mechanism, in terms of welfare. We consider a symmetric incomplete information setting in which students have independently drawn valuations for schools and all schools have an identical ranking of the students. Our main result is that when each school has one available seat and the number of schools and students is large, every type of every student has a higher interim utility under the Boston mechanism than under the DA mechanism. Although this strong result is not true when the number of schools is small, even in this case, the Boston mechanism is ex-ante welfare superior to DA under weak conditions on the distribution of valuations.\n\nIn Chapter 2, we consider the problem of allocating n\u22652 indivisible distinct objects (possibly with multiple copies of each) to m\u22652 agents without monetary transfers. We assume that agents have private preferences and consider mechanisms that depend only on agents' reported ordinal preferences. Full efficiency cannot be achieved in this environment, and so we look for a welfare maximizing, incentive compatible mechanism. We show that when agents' rankings over objects are independent of other agents' rankings and each possible ranking is equally likely, the so-called Ranking mechanism (first-order) stochastically dominates any other anonymous, neutral and incentive compatible ordinal mechanism. In particular, when agents' preferences over random allocations are responsive, every type of every agent has a higher interim welfare under the Ranking mechanism.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we consider the problem of allocating multiple objects to agents via an auction by using \"points\" as in the \"Course Bidding System\" that is used by several business schools. Each agent has a fixed amount of divisible points which can only be used for bidding and have no monetary value. Agents simultaneously bid for the objects, and each object is given to the agent who bids highest for that object. This game is equivalent to the classical \"Colonel Blotto\" game. We consider this game under incomplete information when agents have private values for the objects. For a class of value distributions, we solve for a Bayes-Nash equilibrium of this game. Furthermore, for all the value distributions for which we can solve for equilibrium in closed form, we show that every type of agent has a higher interim payoff under this allocation method than any other incentive compatible allocation method that depends only on ordinal preferences.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9790], "author_name_tesi": "Akyol, Ethem ", "last_name_ssi": "Akyol", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ethem", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijay Krishna", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Marc Albert Henry", "Aydin Alptekinoglu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijay Krishna, Dissertation Advisor", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Member", "Marc Albert Henry, Committee Member", "Aydin Alptekinoglu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mechanism Design", "School Choice", "Colonel Blotto", "Incomplete Information"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Essays In Applied Microeconomics", "id": "22538", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10169", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "CHAPTER 1 (with Kala Krishna) : Preferences, Selection, and Value Added: A Structural Approach\n\nThis paper investigates two main questions: i) What do applicants take into consideration when choosing a high school? ii) To what extent do schools contribute to their students' academic success? To answer these questions, we model students' preferences and derive demand for each school by taking each student's feasible set of schools into account. We obtain average valuation placed on each school from market clearing conditions. Next, we investigate what drives these valuations by carefully controlling for endogeneity using a set of creative instruments suggested by our model. Finally, controlling for mean reversion bias, we look at each school's value-added.\n\nWe find that students infer the quality of a school from its selectivity and past performance on the university entrance exam. However, the evidence on the value-added by schools shows that highly valued or selective schools do\nnot have high value-added on their students' academic outcomes.\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 (with James Key and Kala Krishna) : Hit or Miss? Test Taking Behavior in Multiple Choice Exams\n\nThis paper models and estimates students' decision to guess/attempt or skip the question in a multiple choice test in order to understand the role that student characteristics play. We do this using data from the Turkish University Entrance Exam, a highly competitive, high stakes exam. In particular, we investigate students' behavior according to their gender, predicted score and experience in the exam. Our results show that students' attitudes towards risk differ according to their gender, predicted score and exam experience: female students behave in a more risk averse manner relative to male students, and high scoring students are more risk averse.\nHowever, our counterfactual analysis suggests that although different testing regimes can lead to different score distributions, the relationships between exam score percentiles and student characteristics are relatively invariant.\n\nCHAPTER 3 (with Kala Krishna and Sergey Lychagin) : Gender Differences in College Major Choice: Evidence from a Centralized System\n\nThis paper investigates factors affecting college major choice decisions of students. In an environment where college admission depends solely on students' college entrance exam score and their preferences, we found that gender difference in exam performance is an important factor, especially performance in math and science fields. Our results suggest that policies that can increase performance of female students to the level of male students can reduce the gender gap in engineering and technical science majors by half.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9858], "author_name_tesi": "Akyol , Saziye Pelin", "last_name_ssi": "Akyol ", "middle_name_ssi": "Pelin", "first_name_ssi": "Saziye", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kala Krishna", "Kala Krishna", "Sung Jae Jun", "Paul L E Grieco", "John Raymond Moran Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kala Krishna, Dissertation Advisor", "Kala Krishna, Committee Chair", "Sung Jae Jun, Committee Member", "Paul L E Grieco, Committee Member", "John Raymond Moran Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["School Choice", "School Value-Added", "Multiple Choice Tests", "Major Choice", "Gender Gap"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Investigating Alternative Sacrificial Channel Materials for Grow-in-place Encapsulated Silicon Nanowires", "id": "16336", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7857", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nanowires have become of great interest for many applications in different fields of science and engineering. They have many interesting properties, such as high surface area to volume ratios and tunable electrical properties.

Nanowire-based logic devices are still in an embryonic stage and more research is needed for the integration of nanowire building blocks into CMOS technology.

This is not limited to the blue light-emitting diode (LED) used for efficient solid-state lighting, but other applications as well, such as solar cells, radar and a variety of high frequency power electronics, which are all prime examples of the technological importance of nitride based wide bandgap semiconductors in our daily lives. The goal of this dissertation work was to explore and establish new growth schemes to improve the structural and optical properties of thick to atomically thin films of group-III nitrides grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on SiC substrates for future novel devices.\nThe first research focus of this dissertation was on the growth of indium gallium nitride (InGaN). This wide bandgap semiconductor has attracted much research attention as an active layer in LEDs and recently as an absorber material for solar cells. InGaN has superior material properties for solar cells due to its wavelength absorption tunability that nearly covers the entire solar spectrum. This can be achieved by controlling the indium content in thick grown material. Thick InGaN films are also of interest as strain reducing based layers for deep-green and red light emitters. The growth of thick films of InGaN is, however, hindered by several combined problems. This includes poor incorporation of indium in alloys, high density of structural and morphological defects, as well as challenges associated with the segregation of indium in thick films. Overcoming some of these material challenges is essential in order integrate thick InGaN films into future optoelectronics. Therefore, this dissertation research investigated the growth mechanism of InGaN layers grown in the N-polar direction by MOCVD as a route to improve the structural and optical properties of thick InGaN films.\nThe growth of N-polar InGaN by MOCVD is challenging. These challenges arise from the lack of available native substrates suitable for N-polar film growth. As a result, InGaN layers are conventionally grown in the III-polar direction (i.e. III-polar InGaN) and typically grow under considerable amounts of stress on III-polar GaN base layers. While the structure-property relations of thin III-polar InGaN layers have been widely studied in quantum well structures, insight into the growth of thick films and N-polar InGaN layers have been limited. Therefore, this dissertation research compared the growth of both thick III-polar and N-polar InGaN films grown on optimized GaN base layers. III-polar InGaN films were rough and exhibited a high density of V-pits, while the growth of thick N-polar InGaN films showed improved structural quality and low surface roughness. The results of this dissertation work thereby provide an alternative route to the fabrication of thick InGaN films for potential use in solar cells as well as strain reducing schemes for deep-green and red light emitters. Moreover, this dissertation investigated stress relaxation in thick N-polar films using in situ reflectivity and curvature measurements. The results showed that stress relaxation in N-polar InGaN significantly differed from III-polar InGaN due to the absence of V-pits and it was hypothesized that plastic relaxation in N-polar InGaN could occur by dislocation glide, which typically is kinetically limited at such low growth temperatures required for InGaN.\nThe second part of this dissertation research work focused on buffer free growth of GaN directly on SiC and on epitaxial graphene produced on SiC for potential vertical devices. The studies presented in this dissertation work on the growth of GaN directly on SiC compared the stress evolution of GaN films grown with and without an AlN buffer layer. Films grown directly on SiC showed reduced threading dislocation densities and improved surface roughness when compared to the growth of GaN on an AlN buffer layer. The dislocations in the GaN films grown directly on SiC were predominantly of mixed-type dislocations. Films also contained basal plane stacking faults and {11-20} prismatic stacking faults as revealed by transmission electron microcopy (TEM) near the GaN/SiC interface. Channeling cracks were also observed in the GaN films when the AlN buffer layer was not utilized. This was attributed to tensile stress induced from the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch, which was corroborated with in situ stress measurements collected during the growth process. The results provided in this dissertation showed the potential of growing GaN films directly on SiC for vertical power devices, where the use of an AlN buffer layer typically obstructs both electrical and thermal vertical transport in such devices.\nAlso in the second part of this dissertation, additional studies were performed to understand the nucleation behavior of GaN and AlN on epitaxial graphene produced directly on SiC. The use of graphene as a template layer for the heteroepitaxy of group-III nitrides has gained interest due to the hexagonal arrangement of the sp2 hybridized carbon atoms being similar to the (0001) c-plane of wurtzite GaN. It was observed that the nucleation of AlN and GaN was preferential along the periodic graphene coated step edges of SiC and at defects sites on the (0001) terraces due to the enhanced chemical reactivity at those regions. The density of nuclei on the (0001) terraces of graphene increased with the unintentional incorporation of nitrogen defects into the graphene lattice via NH3 exposure and intentional introduction of defects using oxygen plasma. Furthermore, Raman spectral mapping showed that GaN selectively nucleates on regions of few-layered graphene as opposed to regions of multi-layered graphene. It was also revealed that though the graphene underlayers were highly defective in the region of GaN nucleation, the GaN nuclei were single crystalline, c-axis oriented and were free of threading dislocations. In contrast, polycrystalline islands of AlN were found to nucleate on graphene, but did not produce disorder to the underlying graphene.\nFurthermore, to implement group-III nitrides in tunnel junctions for ultra-low voltage and steep-switching applications and single photon emitters for quantum communication and computing, extreme confinement of group-III nitrides into 2D layers must be realized. Confinement of this materials system in two-dimensions \u201ci.e. 2D nitrides\u201d leads to massive changes in the electronic properties. This brings to light an entirely new platform to tune the properties of group-III nitrides, such as the bandgap energy, without alloying.\nGraphene has proven to be a remarkable material over the past decade. The third part of this dissertation research work showed that graphene can stabilize \u201c2D\u201d forms of traditionally \u201c3D\u201d binary compounds, launching a new platform to realize many other classes of materials that are not traditionally 2D, specifically on a technologically relevant substrate, like SiC. The growth process of 2D GaN utilized the mechanism of adatom intercalation from the vapor phase in an MOCVD growth environment into the interfacial region of graphene formed on SiC. The synthesis process developed in this dissertation work was termed as \u201cMigration Enhanced Encapsulated Growth\u201d (MEEG). Here the mechanism of 2D nitride formation was elucidated and the role of the interface of epitaxial graphene produced on SiC in providing sufficient stabilization of the direct bandgap 2D buckled structure of GaN was discussed. The atomic structure was directly resolved from the nitrogen and gallium atomic columns using aberration corrected scanning TEM (STEM) in annular bright field (ABF) mode with supported ABF-STEM simulations. Density functional theory calculations predicted a bandgap for 2D GaN in the range of 4.79-4.89 eV which was corroborated with experimental results from UV-visible reflectance, absorption coefficient and low loss electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements. Recognizing the impact of 2D nitrides, it can be expected that the addition of 2D GaN will enable new avenues for scientific exploration and novel optoelectronic device development.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14992], "author_name_tesi": "Al Balushi, Zakaria Yahya", "last_name_ssi": "Al Balushi", "middle_name_ssi": "Yahya", "first_name_ssi": "Zakaria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Joshua Alexander Robinson", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Sukwon Choi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Dissertation Advisor", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Chair", "Joshua Alexander Robinson, Committee Member", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Sukwon Choi, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Group-III Nitrides", "MOCVD", "Thin Films", "Graphene", "2D Materials"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "EFFECS OF CLOSURE STRESS ON FRACTURE MORPHOLOGY AND MULTI-PHASE FLOW IN SHEAR FRACTURED  BEREA SANDSTONE", "id": "9330", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5673", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the mechanical properties of fractures and how fractures affect single and multi-phase flow behavior is very important, not only in petroleum reservoirs but also in many other fields.

Fracture properties such as average aperture and asperity ratio are highly affected by increasing the closure stress.\nTwo multi-phase flow experiments were conducted under two different closure stresses. Full scans were acquired at different saturation conditions at both closure stresses.

Increasing the closure stress has no significant effect on the fluid distributions inside the fracture and on effective permeabilities; the same behavior was observed at both closure stresses.\n Fluid distributions at all saturation conditions and at both closure stresses confirm that oil occupies the large apertures; and cannot be displaced out of the fracture and force the water to flow in the matrix and the small apertures, thus yielding very low water relative permeabilities at Sor.

In such conditions, the productivity experience a reduction in recovery due to the appearance of condensate near the production channels, which in turn reduces the overall flow of hydrocarbons to the surface.  The phase behavior of the fluids in place impacts the production scheme of gas-condensate reservoirs, since the recovery of condensate is highly dependent on the changes in composition.  In this study, the productivity of naturally fractured gas-condensate reservoirs is addressed using a compositional simulation model to examine the effects of capillary pressure and relative permeability on the recovery of gas-condensate fluids.  \n\nCapillary pressure is a function of saturation and it controls the distribution of fluids in the pore spaces of a reservoir.  The role of capillary pressure in the distribution of fluids in the reservoir can become more relevant in naturally fractured reservoirs, where the transport of fluids between the matrix and the fractures depends on the capillary pressure.  In addition, the deliverability of gas-condensate reservoirs in such conditions is controlled by the transport properties, which are the relative permeabilities between the fluids in a pore-scale.  Therefore, this study is devoted to evaluate the growth of condensate coating by examining different compositions (light/heavy) with the activation of the capillary pressure forces, while keeping the depletion rate constant, and deactivating the diffusion effect in the system.  \n\nA compositional simulation model was utilized for the evaluation of the influence of fluid characteristics on the severity of condensate coating while assigning tight matrix permeability of 0.001 md, 1 psi/day for depletion rate, and zero capillary pressures.  The analysis of the condensate coating on the edges of the matrix blocks lead to the conclusion that the saturation pressure point is controlled by the concentration of heavy components.  The sooner the saturation pressure is reached, the sooner condensate appears and hinders the overall recovery of fluids.  Using the same conditions applied to the different composition concentration while activating the capillary pressure effect at different pore size distribution indexes (1.5 to 7); the fluid distribution, movement, and recovery, had a similar behavior indicating that the capillary pressure had insignificant influence on the reservoir fluids behavior.  On the other hand, the effect of relative permeabilities showed dependency on the amount of condensate content in the reservoir.  The more condensation that takes place, the more influence is applied by the relative permeability curves.   The major variable that enhanced the oil-gas relative permeability curve was the fracture parameter (\u00eb) obtained by van Genuchten\u2019s (1980) to calculate the oil and gas relative permeabilities.   Several values were used to address the fracture parameter to influence the position of the oil-gas relative permeability curve.  As a result, it appeared that the influence depends on the amount of condensate content in the reservoir.

The capability of the simulator proved to be successful after simulating a hypothetical case of a 2-D tight liquid-rich gas reservoir using the in-house simulator against commercial software CMG.  The results of both simulators came into agreement with one producer well being put on production at a constrained bottom-hole flowing pressure of 1500 psia.  The validation of the basic framework of the in-house simulator has provided the necessary confidence to extend the development of more complex models. \n\nThe impact of capillary pressure on phase behavior was explored using an in-house generated coupled phase behavior model with a capillary pressure equation.

In the Oman sample, job satisfaction (Beta= .376, P-value= .000) and role ambiguity (Beta= .291, P-value= .000) were statistically significant and attributed to work engagement. In the UAE group, the variables job satisfaction and workload were statistically significant (both at Beta= .311, P-value= .000).\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16426], "author_name_tesi": "Al Khadhuri, Jamal Eid", "last_name_ssi": "Al Khadhuri", "middle_name_ssi": "Eid", "first_name_ssi": "Jamal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith A.

Ranging from digital watches to factory controllers, these systems are dedicated to handle a particular task both efficiently and reliably. The advancements in computer vision and machine learning, in conjunction with the abundance of computational power, made it possible for these systems to perform other tasks such as image processing and video analytics; giving rise to embedded vision systems. \nBeing the heart of embedded vision systems, computer vision is the key technology enabler for image processing and video analytics. However, the computational modalities that are prominent in computer vision algorithms are usually inconsistent with those modalities most exploited in contemporary computer architectures. As a result, execution inefficiencies are observed when algorithms are processed by such architectures. \nFurthermore, recent studies have shown that biologically-inspired (neuromorphic) vision algorithms can be robust alternatives, due to their detection and recognition capabilities. Interestingly, these neuromorphic algorithms experience similar execution inefficiencies when running on general purpose processors.\nOn the other hand, domain-specific computing is believed to be the solution to the challenges presented above. Developing customized hardware accelerators targeting specific workloads, is the key to achieving the desired performance while operating at a lower power budget. However, domain-specific computing may be an unfavorable route to many, due to a whole host of challenges associated with hardware design and implementation.\nThis dissertation addresses the issues presented above by describing a hardware-software framework that offers a flexible, reliable, and high performance accelerator infrastructure. The underlying hardware complexity of the framework is abstracted from the user through a standardized Application Programming Interface, API. Furthermore, the dissertation presents a software automation tool for expediting the process of building embedded vision systems and mapping them to prototyping platforms. \nIn addition, this dissertation discusses the hardware architecture of several vision accelerators, including neuromorphic accelerators, which are mapped to the accelerator framework described above. In particular, this dissertation presents accelerators for a neuromorphic vision algorithm, HMAX. This algorithm can be used as a feature extractor for multiple recognition tasks. Results reveal that the neuromorphic accelerators can deliver as much as 7.6X speedup, and are up to 12.8X more power efficient when compared to contemporary CPU and GPU platforms. Additionally, results indicate that the neuromorphic accelerators can achieve up to 90% classification accuracy on some of the standard datasets. Furthermore, this dissertation discusses the hardware architecture of other non-neuromorphic embedded vision systems, where results show that these accelerators can speed up the execution time of some of the computer vision algorithms by up to 100X when compared to a CPU platform.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7999], "author_name_tesi": "Al Maashri, Ahmed ", "last_name_ssi": "Al Maashri", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ahmed", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Yuan Xie", "Robert Collins", "Richard A Behr"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Dissertation Advisor", "Yuan Xie, Committee Member", "Robert Collins, Committee Member", "Richard A Behr, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Embedded Vision Systems", "Domain-Specific Computing", "Reconfigurable Computing", "Power Efficiency", "Neuromophic Accelerators"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "ACADEMIC SOCIALIZATION: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE EXPERIENCES\n\n OF THE EMIRATI AND SAUDI  STUDENTS AT U.S. UNIVERSITIES\n", "id": "12652", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2048", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study examines academic, cultural, discipline-related challenges Emirati and Saudi students face at U.S. universities and investigates Emirati and Saudi students\u2019 coping strategies to face their challenges.

Also, female Emirati and Saudi students stated that they try to avoid interaction with male students in their classroom interaction. Writing is the most difficult aspect the Emirati and Saudi students\u2019 face, so to overcome this difficulty they go to writing centers, take more writing courses and use dictionaries to improve their writing. Further analysis used in-depth interviews from six participants to expand the analysis of their lived experiences.

Studying educators\u2018 and employers\u2018 perspectives on technical and non-technical skills may result in improving the quality of the graduates to compete on the level of the local as well as the global labor market. According to Gray and Herr (1998), if workforce education is to be effective, work preparation cannot be restrained to technical content alone, but must also equip students with employability skills as well.\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate educators and employers\u2018 perceptions on employability skills of graduates from career and technical education institutions as perceived by both educators and employers. The study also examined if there are any differences in perceptions on employability skills among employers on assigned variables on the one hand, and if there are any differences in perceptions among educators on the same assigned variables on the other hand.\nData for this study were collected via validated and reliability tested questionnaire. The survey included three employability skills domains: fundamental skills, personal management skills, and teamwork skills.

The participants of the study were given a professional development workshop, \u201cFlip Your EFL Classroom,\u201d which introduced student teachers to how they could implement the flipped classroom teaching approach during their teaching in practicum. Rehearsal training sessions as a pedagogy of teaching practice for student teachers were also provided on a weekly basis throughout the period of study. \n\tThe main question of the study was: How do rehearsal sessions impact the Saudi English as a foreign language student teacher\u2019s learning-to-teach journey through the implementation of the Flipped Classroom method? This was accompanied with the sub-questions: To what extent do rehearsal sessions help Saudi English as a foreign language student teachers develop their teaching skills? How does rehearsal-session feedback influence student teachers\u2019 actual teaching in the classroom? How do Saudi English as a foreign language teacher educators utilize rehearsal sessions as a professional development tool? \nThese questions were investigated through observation of both student teachers and teacher educators\u2019 performance and interaction during rehearsal-based training sessions and their actual classroom teaching throughout the course of their practicum experience. At the end of practicum, I conducted interviews with the Saudi English as a foreign language student teachers and their teacher educators to explore their experiences with both the rehearsal pedagogy of practice and the flipped classroom teaching approach, and to what extent these contributed to disruption of their practice.\nThe participants of my study were three groups of Saudi English as a foreign language female student teachers. Each group consisted of four student teachers, assigned to three different schools. In addition, there was a teacher educator for each group, including this researcher in one of the groups. Thus, the total was 12 English as a foreign language student teachers and 3 teacher educators. The practicum took place in three public high schools in the city of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. \nIn this study, I embrace Corbin and Strauss\u2019 (2008) school of grounded theory research methodology and built my analytical process on their concept of \u201canalysis as a process\u201d which consists of five stages: description stage, analysis stage, theoretical sampling stage, integration stage, and theoretical saturation stage. \nData analysis resulted in the development of the core category of the study: learning through practice. The storyline of the study\u2019s findings consists of five phases under each phase number of developed concepts and sub-concepts. The first phase gives a first glance at the field of Saudi student teachers\u2019 learning-to-teach experience during practicum in connection with prior academic preparation in college. The main category raises a call for English as a foreign language preservice teachers\u2019 professional development reform and carries with it the following concepts: the gap between student teachers\u2019 academic preparation and the field, student teacher\u2019s existing self-awareness, student teacher\u2019s self-doubt concerning their own efficacy, and the generally misguided image of teaching. The second phase advances the findings and takes the analysis closer to the field with implementation of the study\u2019s interventions. I call it \u201cIn the middle of wonderland!\u201d and include the following concepts: the distinction between actual teaching and rehearsal, micro-teaching vs. rehearsal, rehearsal as more complex than actual teaching, and, finally, out of the cooperating teacher\u2019s shadow. The third phase explores the issue of practice and enactments and brings with it two concepts\u2014\u201cthe third space\u201d and \u201caha moments.\u201d The fourth phase, \u201cMeet me at the end of the day,\u201d sheds further light on the role of teacher educators while mentoring student teachers. It includes the two concepts of teaching delay and adoptive performance. The last phase addresses the flipped side of flipping, highlighting the impact of the flipped classroom approach on student teachers\u2019 learning to teach through these two concepts: flipping student teachers\u2019 learning-to-teach experience and developing student teachers\u2019 agency, which carry with them the two sub-concepts of student teachers\u2019 decision-making skills and student teachers\u2019 autonomy.\nTo conclude the study, I further expanded my data analysis to draw the developed theoretical framework of the study. I aimed to develop a middle range theory of practice in teacher education that is rooted in Ericsson\u2019s (2002) notion of \u201cdeliberate practice.\u201d I sought for a deeper understanding of practice and a shift to a practice that imparts the essence of learning to teach. I developed a pyramid for practice in learning to teach called \u201cthe degrees of practice pyramid.\u201d It consists of three levels for practice from the bottom up: blind practice, approximations of practice, and deliberate practice. On this pyramid, higher levels of practice indicate greater levels of practice complexity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15660], "author_name_tesi": "Al-Fahid, Mai Fahid", "last_name_ssi": "Al-Fahid", "middle_name_ssi": "Fahid", "first_name_ssi": "Mai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anne Angiline Whitney", "Anne Angiline Whitney", "Jacqueline Reid-Walsh", "Jamie M.

Cultural orientation was measured through variables in relation to time (future time orientation), structure (uncertainty avoidance), authority (power distance), and relation (interdependence). Learner self-regulation was measured through six variables representing metacognitive and motivational aspects of self-regulation. These variables were planning, self-checking, effort, self-efficacy, help-seeking, and time and environment management. The validity of cross-cultural comparisons was established using back-translation and multiple group confirmatory factor analysis. Construct, method and item equivalence were established for all research constructs. \nResults suggest significant differences between Arab and American distance learners in the way they regulate their learning, in their cultural orientation towards time and group interdependence, and in their preferences towards course structure and interaction with instructors. American students scored significantly higher than the Arabs on interdependence and future orientation. They also scored significantly higher than Arab students on planning, monitoring, effort, time and environment management and self-efficacy, while Arab students scored significantly higher than American students on help. Arab students preferred significantly higher structure and more interaction with their instructors than American students. Using structural equation modeling, the relationship between cultural and self-regulation variables was investigated. In the best fitting model, only future orientation explained variances in self-regulation. Help was not found to be measurement invariant across the two groups. American students did not conceptualize help as part of their self-regulation whereas Arab students did. Results were inconclusive when adding variables of course structure and interaction, years and gender to the model. Some fit indices indicated unacceptable fit and some of the components of the model were insignificant.

One of the important topics studied is the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of copper, the main method used for material removal. Several copper CMP observations have gone without adequate explanation despite their importance to the CMP process. This study investigates three of these observations.\n\nThe first observation concerns the discrepancy between the observed polishing rate and the electrochemically determined corrosion rate. In general, the electrochemically determined corrosion rates are found to be much lower than the polishing rate. In this study, copper CMP is studied as a corrosive wear process, where the enhanced dissolution is due to passive film rupture. The most common CMP slurry ingredients were selected: benzotriazole (BTAH) as a corrosion inhibitor and ferric ion and hydrogen peroxide as oxidizers. \n\nThe first step was to study the kinetics of the Cu(I)BTA film growth.  The rate of growth of this film was monitored as a function of potential, BTAH concentration, and pH. The growth of the film followed a 3D growth model, with progressive nucleation at low pH and instantaneous nucleation at higher pH. By modeling the surface coverage of Cu(I)BTA as a function of time, it was shown, for the first time, that if the Cu(I)BTA film is ruptured during a CMP process, there is not enough time for it to grow back. This leaves the copper metal in the bare metal state exposed to the oxidizing slurry. \n\nUsing a continuous scratching setup, the electrochemical behavior of bare copper metal was studied. In the presence of BTAH, scratching away the Cu(I)BTA film increased the corrosion current. The results also indicated that, even in the absence of the Cu(I)BTA passive film, BTAH will still inhibit the corrosion of copper. However, the inhibitive effect was more prominent for the cathodic than the anodic reaction, which classifies BTAH -under these conditions- as a cathodic inhibitor. \n\nThe corrosion current of bare copper metal was determined in ferric ion and in hydrogen peroxide solutions and was found to be close to the CMP rate reported in the literature. This leads to the new conclusion that copper CMP is mainly a corrosive wear process that occurs at the abraded spots on the wafer surface, the high spots. Cu(I)BTA film forms only at the low areas which are not being abraded. This finding calls for the revision of the conventional view that CMP involves a successive sequence of film formation and removal.\n\nThe second topic studied deals with the dissolution of copper in hydrogen peroxide solutions. The literature reports that the polishing rate of copper increase with hydrogen peroxide concentration then drops at higher concentrations. Copper oxide has been detected on the metal surface although the bulk solution pH and metal ion concentration are too low for precipitation to occur. In this study, the near surface pH of copper dissolving in hydrogen peroxide was found to be ~2.3 pH units higher than the bulk value. At high metal dissolution rates, the surface concentration of the metal ions increases rapidly, exceeding the solubility limit and precipitating an oxide. Aqueous stability diagrams confirmed the possibility of oxide formation under the identified surface conditions. The effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration on oxide formation was modeled.\n\nAnother effect of pH was investigated, this time for the dissolution of copper in hydroxylamine solutions; the third topic of this study. The literature shows that the polishing rate of copper in hydroxylamine solutions exhibits a peak at pH ~6. Aqueous stability diagrams and electrochemical measurements showed that the increase in the dissolution rate of copper coincided with the regions of stability of the copper hydroxylamine complexes. The peak observed around pH 6 was explained as a result of two competing processes; one is the increase in the dissolution rate of the metal due to the increase in the concentration of the unprotonated ligand, and the other is the precipitation of the oxide. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [379], "author_name_tesi": "Al-Hinai, Ashraf Talib", "last_name_ssi": "Al-Hinai", "middle_name_ssi": "Talib", "first_name_ssi": "Ashraf", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Shaw", "Howard W Pickering", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare", "Tarasankar Debroy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Shaw, Committee Member", "Howard W Pickering, Committee Member", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Committee Chair", "Tarasankar Debroy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogen peroxide", "bare metal", "hydroxylamine", "chemical mechanical polishing", "cmp", "bta", "benzotriazole", "copper"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Autonomy and Addiction:\nAn Overview of Relevant and Confounding Factors", "id": "10885", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2692", "abstract_tesi": "The accurate assessment of drug addiction is a widely debated issue across academic disciplines and a hotly contentious subject in society at large.  While legal institutions largely recognize addicts as rational, moral agents, an emerging understanding of addictive cravings in the social and neurological sciences seems to challenge this view.  In a complementary manner, medicine has traditionally viewed addiction as a disease, leading some addiction theorists to conceptualize addictive behavior as the product of a symptomatic physiological condition.  Consistency on this issue has become of paramount importance, as disparities between punitive and rehabilitative programs create a confused and deleterious environment for addicts.  It is the purpose of this paper to survey and critique the claims made by different groups about the questionable autonomy of those in a drug-addicted state, and to bring up through critical interpretation a strong base for understanding autonomy in both its particularly relevant and most general character. Through an examination of relevant concepts in mental health, physiology, medicine, sociology, law, and philosophy, tensions between competing explanations of the addictive experience will reveal gaps that demand mediation.  Relating these different insights to a basic and non-normative definition of autonomy will show how explanations that deny or severely challenge the call for responsibility in addiction fail to address the vicissitudes of autonomy in its lived experience. I will argue that the practical, theoretical and therapeutic challenges of denying addicts status as autonomous agents compels us to retain a strong but nuanced notion of accountability in addiction, and structure our social response to chemical addictions around these lines of responsibility.  In particular, I embrace a global and diachronous understanding of autonomy that places accountability on the chemically addicted to confront the challenges of addictive cravings, and plan their lives with insight into the very real compromises such cravings place on the exercise of self-rule.  By debunking the popular and exaggerated representations of addiction, it is my goal to reinstitute addictive processes within the vagaries and allowances of autonomy as it is tenuously achieved by embodied agents.  Situated as such, I argue that addicts be understood as autonomous in this very basic sense that protects their status as moral agents, with the rights, respects, and responsibilities due to such agents.

The engine manufacturers in the United States have implemented the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and diesel particulate filters (DPF) to meet the stringent emissions limits on NOx and PM, respectively.  Although the EGR-DPF system is an effective means to control diesel engine emissions, there are some concerns associated with its implementation.  The chief concern with this system is the DPF regenerability, which depends upon several factors, among which are the physico-chemical properties of the soot.  Despite the plethora of research that has been conducted on DPF regenerability, the impact of EGR on soot reactivity and DPF regenerability is yet to be examined.  This work concerns the impact of EGR on the oxidative reactivity of diesel soot.  It is part of ongoing research to bridge the gap in establishing a relationship between soot formation conditions, properties, and reactivity.\t \nThis work is divided into three phases.  In the first phase, carbon dioxide (CO2) was added to the intake charge of a single cylinder engine via cylinders of compressed CO2.  This approach simulates the cold-particle-free EGR.  The results showed that inclusion of CO2 changes the soot properties and yields synergistic effects on the oxidative reactivity of the resulting soot.\nThe second phase of this research was motivated by the findings from the first phase.  In this phase, post-flame ethylene soot was produced from a laboratory co-flow laminar diffusion flame to better understand the mechanism by which the CO2 affects soot reactivity.  This phase was accomplished by successfully isolating the dilution, thermal, and chemical effects of the CO2.  The results showed that all of these effects account for a measurable increase in soot reactivity.  Nevertheless, the thermal effect was found to be the most important factor governing the soot reactivity.\nIn the third phase of this research, diesel soot was generated under 0 and 20% EGR using a four-cylinder, four-stroke, turbocharged common rail direct injection (DI) DDC diesel engine.  The objective of this work was to examine the relevance of the single cylinder engine and flame studies to practical engine operation.  The key engine parameters such as load, speed, and injection timing were kept constant to isolate the EGR effect on soot properties from any other engine effects. \nThe thermokinetic analyses of the flame soot and engine soot showed a significant increase in soot oxidation rate as a result of the CO2 or EGR inclusion into the combustion process.  The activation energy of soot oxidation was found to be independent of soot origin or formation history.  The increase in soot oxidation rate is attributed solely to the increase in soot active sites, which are presented implicitly in the pre-exponential factor (A) of the oxidation rate equation.  This latter statement was confirmed by measuring the initial active site area (ASAi) of all soot samples considered in this study.  As expected, higher oxidation rates are associated with higher ASAi.  \nThe chemical properties of the soot were investigated to determine their effects upon soot reactivity.  The results showed that the H/C and O/C ratios were not modified by CO2 or EGR addition.  Therefore, these ratios are not reactivity parameters and their effects upon soot reactivity were ruled out.  In distinct contrast, the physical properties of the soot were modified by the addition of CO2 or EGR.  The interlayer spacing (d002) between the aromatic sheets increased, the crystallite width (La) decreased and the crystallite height (Lc) decreased as a consequence of CO2 or EGR addition.  The modified physical properties of the soot are responsible for the increased rate of soot oxidation.\nIn order to examine the soot oxidation behavior in the DPF, the soot samples produced from the DDC engine under 0 and 20% EGR were partially oxidized in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) to specific conversion levels.  Unreacted and partially oxidized soot samples were then subjected to comprehensive characterization.  The Raman spectroscopy showed that the disordered fraction of the soot (ID/IG) decreases with the oxidation progression.  Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) results showed an increase in the (I\u0192\u00e0/ I\u0192\u00e3) for soot generated under 0% EGR but no significant increase in this ratio was observed for the soot generated under 20% EGR.  These results indicate that soot generated without EGR is likely to be more highly ordered in its nanostructure. \nVisual inspection of the unreacted and partially oxidized soot (produced under 0 and 20% EGR) was obtained by the use of high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).  The results suggested that the initial nanostructure of the soot primary particles is the same for soot produced under 0 and 20% EGR.  However, soot produced under 0% EGR condition exhibits strictly external burning (i.e., from the outside in).  On the other hand, soot generated under 20% EGR possesses dual burning modes, that is, slow external burning and fast internal burning.  This internal burning of the 20% EGR soot clarifies the importance of the burning modes upon soot reactivity.  This study confirmed that EGR exerted a strong influence on the diesel soot physical properties.  Consistent with the flame study, a separate engine study confirmed that the most important factors to enhance the soot reactivity are the thermal effect of the EGR followed by the dilution effect.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3513], "author_name_tesi": "Al-Qurashi, Khalid O", "last_name_ssi": "Al-Qurashi", "middle_name_ssi": "O", "first_name_ssi": "Khalid", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Angela Lueking", "Richard A Yetter", "Yaw D Yeboah"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Chair", "Angela Lueking, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Yaw D Yeboah, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Oxidation", "Nanostructure", "EGR", "Diesel", "Soot", "Flame"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Understanding The Effects Of Nano-scale Surface Texture And Environment On Diamond-like Carbon", "id": "18468", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8910", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The effects of nano-scale surface texture and the environment on the tribological and mechanical properties of diamond-like carbon (DLC) are investigated. Nano-textured DLC was produced by coating DLC film on a textured silicon substrate. In this study it was found that the nano-texture has a different lubrication mechanism than micro-scale texture. The nano-confinement-induced solidification of a liquid lubricant plays a critical role in reducing the friction coefficient when the nano-texture deforms under the contact pressure. The lubricant molecules sandwiched between the high points of the textured DLC and the counter-surface show long-range structuring and solidification upon confinement. However, the lubricant molecules entrapped in the depressed regions of the nano-textured DLC would not solidify, which can contribute to the reduction of the interfacial friction. The nano-texture effect is not limited to macro-scale friction tests; it was also observed in nanoindentation measurements where the probe depth is only about 10% of the DLC film thickness. The presence of sub-surface polystyrene spheres seems to change the DLC deformation pattern under pressure which reduces plastic deformation and residual indent size. The contact geometry and the presence of the polystyrene spheres both significantly affect the measured local hardness and elastic modulus of DLC, as well as the residual indents dimensions in single-asperity indentation measurements. The presence of water in the environment also has a profound effect on the friction and wear behavior of DLC. The effects of bulk liquid water were quite different from those of the water layers adsorbed from the vapor phase. Moreover, the structure and the amount of transfer film that forms on the counter surface depends on the amount of adsorbed water vapor present on the DLC surface, which is governed by the relative humidity.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8752], "author_name_tesi": "Al-azizi, Ala' Ahmad", "last_name_ssi": "Al-azizi", "middle_name_ssi": "Ahmad", "first_name_ssi": "Ala'", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seong Han Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seong Han Kim, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["DLC", "surface", "friction", "texture", "water", "nano"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "SURFACE CHEMISTRY AND SUPERLUBRICITY OF DIAMOND-LIKE CARBON", "id": "28736", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12321", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Contrary to the widely accepted idea that diamond-like carbon (DLC) is inert, this thesis provides evidence that DLC readily reacts with its surrounding environments. Reactions occurring at the surface of DLC strongly affect its surface composition and structure, and consequently, its friction and wear behavior. However, experimental results presented in this thesis show that reactivity of DLC is neither limited to, nor exclusively dictated by the surface. The bulk can both influence the reactivity of DLC, and be altered by it.\nThe ultra-low friction behavior of DLC consists of three main components: the run-in behavior, transfer film formation, and the ultra-low steady friction. Our results prove that the cause of the run in behavior in dry environments is the removal of oxide layers of DLC. These oxide layers do not only have higher oxygen content, but are also richer in sp2 graphitic rings compared to the bulk of DLC. This structure reduces the wear resistance of the oxide layers, causing their removal and the high friction at the beginning of sliding in inert environments. In the presence of multi adsorbed water layers that can act as an electrolyte, this sp2 rich oxide protects DLC from wear when slid against more anodic surfaces. Although the oxide layer is just few nanometers thick and more susceptible to wear, they can induce galvanic corrosion on much harder counter surfaces protecting DLC during sliding in high humidity environments.\n Our results also indicate that the transfer film, another component often thought to be critical for the ultra-low friction of DLC, is a byproduct of internal stresses of DLC film, rather than requirement to achieve ultra-low friction. Mitigation of internal stresses of DLC improved its wear resistance and suppressed transfer film formation from DLC to the counter-surface. Our results also suggest that these internal stresses play a critical role in the susceptibility of the bulk to react with vapor molecules. Modifying DLC surface using vapor-phase reactions is often accompanied by reaction of the subsurface layers which negatively impacts the integrity of DLC network and its mechanical properties.  \nOxidation is detrimental to the ultra-low steady state friction, the third component of the friction behavior of DLC in inert environment. A chemical modification method using vapor-phase reaction with silanes to increase the hydrophobicity of DLC is developed and tested. Silane-treated DLC exhibits low friction in humid environments containing up to 30% water partial pressure. However, the silane treatment compromised the bulk properties of DLC reducing its wear resistance at water partial pressures of 40% and higher.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11699], "author_name_tesi": "Al-azizi, Ala' Ahmad", "last_name_ssi": "Al-azizi", "middle_name_ssi": "Ahmad", "first_name_ssi": "Ala'", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seong Han Kim", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr.", "Themis Matsoukas", "Randy Vander Wal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seong Han Kim, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Member", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Randy Vander Wal, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Superlubricity", "Surface chemistry", "tribology", "diamond-like carbon"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "BOARDS\u2019 RESPONSE TO SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 DISSATISFACTION: THE CASE OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 SAY ON PAY IN THE U.
