Because no single effect size metric has garnered absolute support to date, three different effect size metrics were calculated: percentage of non-overlapping data, percent exceeding the median baseline phase, and the standard mean difference. Overall, function-based interventions were associated with significantly larger effects than non-function-based interventions. Interventions based on functional analysis manipulations were also associated with larger effects. Variables such as the intervention agent, the level of intervention restrictiveness, and the purpose of the intervention were also associated with larger treatment effects. Although each effect size metric measured differing aspects of treatment effectiveness, moderate to large correlations were found between metrics.

In South Africa, the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS exacerbates the risks associated with sexual violence (Dorrington et al., 2006). However, little is known about the psychosocial and behavioral characteristics that may increase (risk factors) or decrease (protective factors) youths risk for sexual violence in South Africa. This thesis describes two related studies that (1) examines behaviors, attitudes, and skills (or the lack of skills) that predict forced sex among South African youth; and (2) evaluates HealthWise, a comprehensive substance use and HIV/AIDs prevention program, on the significant predictors of forced sex. \n\nFor study 1, analyses were restricted to youth in the control group who were virgins at wave 1 and sexually active by wave 5, who had reported forced sex between Waves 1 and 4. The final sample consisted of 327 sexually active youth (M age = 15.9), the majority of whom were male (59.9%). Of these youth, 28 reported experiencing forced sex during the past 6 months. Results revealed that greater sexual agency and condom use self-efficacy were protective against experiencing forced sex. Conversely, compared to their sexually active peers, youth who reported forced sex were more likely to believe it is a girl's duty to have sex with an older man and condone the use of substances to obtain sex. Youth who had been forced to have sex were more likely to use alcohol or marijuana at the time of their last sexual encounter. Risk avoidance skills, recent alcohol use, and gender were not significantly different between sexually active youth and those who experienced forced sex. As expected, there was no difference between number of partners, length of sexual history, or relationship to partner, which counters the common colloquial stance that the victim\u2019s promiscuity is to blame for sexual violence. These results suggest that youth who experience sexual violence are not particularly promiscuous. Study 2 consisted of 6,341 students who participated in either the control or treatment conditions of the HealthWise study, which began at the start of student\u2019s grade 8 school year. \n\nResults support that HealthWise students were less likely to drink alcohol at last sex than the control group, as reported at the 6 month follow-up. HealthWise students did not differ significantly from the control group on reports of sexual agency, condom use self-efficacy, substance use with sex norms nor belief that it is a girl\u2019s duty to have sex with an older man. \nResults of the two studies discussed provide further understanding of forced sex in South Africa and identifies areas for future research. Study findings suggest that youth who experience forced sex differ on several, possibly malleable factors. HealthWise reduced youth\u2019s likeliness to use substance at last sex, which is a strong predictor of forced sex. The ultimate goal of interventions is to change behavior; consequently, this finding has important implications for future interventions, despite the lack of treatment effect on attitudinal predictors measured. Overall, findings suggest a need for future research that examines the context of forced sex in South African in order to better inform intervention development. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2482], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Jacqueline Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Jacqueline", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward A Smith", "Edward A Smith", "Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward A Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Edward A Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adolescents", "Intervention", "Sexual Violence", "South Africa", "forced sex"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Context and Consequences of Sexual Coercion towards South African Boys and the Impact of Enhancing the School Environment on School Sexual Climate and Coercion", "id": "26461", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11580", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "National reports from South Africa suggest that nearly half of adolescent boys will experience sexual violence by age 18. However, research on sexual violence has predominantly focused on violence towards girls and women. This dissertation consists of three studies that address existing gaps in the literature and expand our understanding of sexual violence towards South African boys using data from the HealthWise translational research study.\n  \nStudy 1 uses data from 252 South African adolescent boys reporting sexual coercion in grade 8 to examine the context of boys\u2019 most recent experience of sexual coercion. Study 2 uses propensity score modeling and mediation analyses to examine the consequences of sexual coercion on boy\u2019s sexual behaviors, attitudes, and norms among victimized boys and their matched peers (n = 1454). Lastly, study 3 evaluates how school-wide activities, implemented in the 56 participating schools, impact the schools\u2019 sexual climate and overall prevalence of sexual coercion within schools.\n\nEighth grade boys were most likely to report that their perpetrator was a similar-aged female and that perpetrator\u2019s age played a particularly important role in what tactics were used. Adult perpetrators were more likely to use physical force, threatened them, harassed them electronically, and that the perpetrator was drinking or using drugs at the time. Results from study 2 suggest that when boys are balanced on baseline characteristics, the experience of sexual coercion is associated with increases in perceived norms of risky sex and coercive behaviors. The results further support an indirect effect of sexual coercion on sexual risk behavior and perpetrating sexual violence a year later through the effect on perceived sexual norms. \n\nThough results from study 3 did not support an effect of school-wide activities on the school\u2019s overall sexual coercion prevalence, sexual climate and coercion prevalence varies substantially across schools. Schools with more risky and aggressive sexual climates have a higher prevalence of sexual coercion. These findings, along with findings from studies 1 and 2, suggest that schools are an important venue for addressing sexual coercion. Future research should further explore how schools can work to prevent sexual violence amongst students.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11084], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Jacqueline Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Jacqueline", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward A Smith", "Edward A Smith", "Linda L Caldwell", "Donna Coffman", "Rachel Annette Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward A Smith, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward A Smith, Committee Chair", "Linda L Caldwell, Committee Member", "Donna Coffman, Committee Member", "Rachel Annette Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sexual violence", "male victimization", "adolescents", "South Africa"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Detection of mRNA decay machinery association with RNA during unstressed and stressed conditions", "id": "13376jem482", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13376", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In order to characterize how living organisms respond to stress, it is crucial that we understand how gene expression at the RNA level is controlled. RNA abundance is a product of synthesis and decay and both are important for understanding how protein levels are eventually established. Additionally, identifying how proteins regulate these processes is important. Whereas a great deal of effort has been spent on understanding how transcriptional regulation effects RNA abundance, much less is known about how the stability of the RNA transcript contributes to mRNA abundance and more specifically how RNA binding proteins (RBPs) regulate individual transcripts during different environmental and developmental conditions. Having said that, a great deal of information about RNA decay has been gleaned from biochemistry assays on model genes. This has greatly influenced how we understand the paths an mRNA can take when going from being a translated mRNA to one that is being degraded. Additionally, genome-wide studies have used techniques to measure global changes in RNA abundance and decay after deleting or mutating genes that code for mRNA decay factors. Having said that, it remained unclear which RNAs the RBPs were recruited to in order to regulate individual mRNA levels across the transcriptome.\n\nTo address these issues we developed a modified RIP-seq technique. Although previous techniques like CLIP-seq and native RIP-seq have been used to identify RNA-protein interactions on a genome-wide scale, these techniques when adapted to yeast, a model organism, place the cells in conditions that perturb RNA-protein interactions prior to isolation of the RNA. As described in chapter 2 and 3, our RIP-seq method includes the addition of a crosslinker (e.g. formaldehyde) prior to cell collection, which allows for capturing in vivo RNA-protein interactions without the perturbation that native RIP-seq or CLIP-seq studies are prone to. We chose to investigate the RNA-protein interactions of a core subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex,Ccr4, which is also the main cytoplasmic deadenylase in yeast. Additionally, Dhh1 and Puf5, two proteins that associate with the core subunits were also used in the RIP-seq study.\n\nCcr4-Not is a multi-subunit protein complex that has a wide range of functions that regulate mRNA synthesis, post-translational modifications and mRNA decay to name a few. Thus prior attempts to characterize its role in establishing mRNA levels through its ability to associate with mRNA have been hampered by genetic techniques that cannot distinguish between its many functions. By identifying RNAs that the protein of interest is recruited to, we can start to gain mechanistic insight underlying changes in mRNA abundance and decay rates in genomic studies that deleted genes that code for Ccr4-Not subunits. Moreover, the more we learn about synthesis and decay, the more it has become commonly understood that proteins that regulate decay can also regulate synthesis, Ccr4-Not included. Thus, this study will help illustrate that taking multiple -omics approaches will be necessary to understand multifunctional proteins.\n\nChapter 3 shows how RIP was adapted for high-throughput sequencing (RIP-seq). This process involved making sure the sequencing of RIP RNA could be done in a reproducible manner. Furthermore, we developed a workflow to determine the level of enrichment for each RNA Ccr4, Dhh1, and Puf5 were recruited to. Since Puf5 has a motif that it is known to recognize in mRNAs, motif analysis was used to confirm that our RIP-seq method could also identify the motif as a positive control. Moreover, we found that our method was not biased by abundance or length, providing further evidence these proteins were targeting the mRNAs and not associating with them indiscriminately.\nAfter creating a method to detect RNA-protein interactions, chapter 4 was devoted to understanding the biological significance of these interactions while the cells were growing in rich media. Ccr4, Dhh1 and Puf5 shared many of the same targets at their 3\u2019 end, most of which were mRNAs. By comparing the correlations between RIP-seq enrichment, decay and synthesis rates it was concluded that Ccr4 has greater influence over mRNA abundance through decay relative to synthesis. Additionally, there are two deadenylase complexes (e.g. Ccr4-Not and Pan2/3) in yeast however little was known about which mRNAs they regulated. The RIP-seq results suggest there is division of labor between Ccr4 and Pan2/3. Interestingly, the decay machinery was also recruited to genes that fluctuate during the yeast metabolic cycle, suggesting these decay factors are important for sensing changes the metabolic state of the cell.\n\nIn order to test if Ccr4-Not RNA-protein interactions were affected by the oxidative state of the cell, RIP-seq was performed with samples that had been treated with hydrogen peroxide. Chapter 5 describes how stress causes Ccr4 to have a unique response to oxidative stress, in the sense that it loses most of its targets. Most importantly, there is a significant redistribution of the mRNA decay machinery to upregulated mRNAs upon oxidative stress. Furthermore, these are genes that are important for the cell to counter the harmful affects of oxidative stress. Since Ccr4, Dhh1 and Puf5 were recruited to transcriptionally up-regulated mRNAs it suggests they are important for buffering the response oxidative stress and provides new mechanistic insights into broader gene regulation concepts like gene expression buffering.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13358], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Jason Eli", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Eli", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph C.

During natural leaf senescence SAG transcript levels increase while PAG transcript levels decline.  SAG and PAG expression levels were determined by northern analysis in Arabidopsis ecotype Landsberg erecta plants treated with 0.15 mL L-1 O3 for 6 hours per day for 14 days.  Ozone treatment caused the early expression of BCB, ERD1, SAG13, SAG18, SAG20, SAG21 and CCH and an early decline in rbcS and cab transcript levels.  No induction of the following senescence-related genes was found: SAG12, SAG19, MT1 and Atgsr2.  The spatial distribution of SAG expression in leaves was investigated by treating transgenic plants carrying the SAG13 promoter-GUS construct with O3.  SAG13 promoter-driven GUS activity was located throughout O3-treated leaves.  This expression pattern differed from that found in naturally senescing leaves.  While differences do exist between natural leaf senescence and O3-induced accelerated leaf senescence, the process in O3-treated leaves is highly regulated and involves the expression of many genes associated with natural senescence.\n\n\tProtein levels for two SAGs were investigated during O3 treatment to determine whether the increases in SAG transcript levels were accompanied by corresponding increases in protein levels.  ERD1 and BCB protein levels were determined by western analysis in plants treated with 0.15 mL L-1 O3 for 6 hours per day for 8 and 14 days.  ERD1 transcript levels were strongly induced by O3 treatment, whereas ERD1 protein levels declined with increasing O3 exposure.  BCB transcript levels also increased during O3 treatment, while no BCB protein accumulation was detected during the exposure.  The reason for the disparity between transcript and protein levels is not known, causing the functional significance of O3-induced increases in ERD1 and BCB transcript levels to be questioned.\n\n\tThe plant hormone ethylene modulates the timing of leaf senescence and is produced during exposures to high doses of O3, so the role of ethylene in inducing SAG expression during O3 treatment was studied.  SAG and PAG transcript levels were measured by northern analysis in wild-type Arabidopsis, ecotype Columbia, plants and the ethylene-insensitive mutant, etr1-3.  During exposure to 0.15 mL L-1 O3 for 6 hours per day for 14 days, equivalent changes in SAG and PAG expression levels were found in wild-type and etr1-3 plants.  The increase in SAG transcripts and decline in PAG transcripts occurred without any increase in ethylene production, ACC levels or ACS6 transcript levels.  During exposure to a higher O3 concentration, 0.35 mL L-1 O3 for 6 hours, ethylene production was induced, but once again the level of SAG induction and PAG transcript decline were similar in wild-type plants and etr1-3 mutants.  This work suggested that ethylene perception was not necessary for the induction of SAG transcripts and decline in PAG transcripts during O3 exposure.  The etr1-3 mutant retains some partial sensitivity to ethylene, so the role of ethylene in O3-induced SAG expression was investigated in three additional ethylene-insensitive mutants.\n\n\tWild-type plants and ethylene-insensitive mutants etr1-3, ein2-1, ein3-1 and ein4-1 were treated with 100 mL L-1 ethylene for 6 hours and expression of the ethylene-responsive gene, HEL, was measured by northern analysis to determine the ethylene sensitivity of leaves.  Transcript for HEL was induced in ethylene-treated wild-type plants and some induction was also found in ethylene-insensitive mutants, etr1-3 and ein3-1.  No ethylene induction of HEL was found in ein2-1 or ein4-1 mutants.\n\n\tThe ethylene-insensitive mutants were treated with O3 to see if SAGs could be induced in the absence of ethylene perception, as in ein2-1 and ein4-1 leaves, or under reduced ethylene perception, as in etr1-3 and ein3-1 leaves.  Wild-type plants and etr1-3, ein2-1, ein3-1 and ein4-1 mutants were treated with 0.15 mL L-1 O3 for 3.5 hours and SAG transcript levels were determined.  SAGs were induced in wild-type plants and all ethylene-insensitive mutants at similar levels.  Wild-type plants and mutants were treated with 0.30 mL L-1 O3 for 3.5 hours to determine SAG expression levels when the O3 treatment caused a sharp increase in ethylene production.  In the presence of O3-induced ethylene production, SAGs were once again induced at similar levels in wild-type plants and ethylene-insensitive mutants.  This work demonstrates that ethylene is not the primary signal for SAG expression during O3 treatment.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2623], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Jennifer Dawn", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Dawn", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eva Joy Pell", "Richard N Arteca", "Ramesh Raina", "Allen T Phillips"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eva Joy Pell, Committee Chair", "Richard N Arteca, Committee Member", "Ramesh Raina, Committee Member", "Allen T Phillips, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gene expression", "Arabidopsis thaliana", "ethylene", "ozone", "senescence"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Ribosomal Proteins: Implications in Translation and Apoptosis", "id": "9429", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2793", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mitochondrial ribosomes synthesize thirteen proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, mitochondria also contribute to biochemical processes coordinating apoptosis, mitochondrial diseases, and aging in eukaryotic cells. Due to the overall resemblance between the two systems and the earlier reports of post-translational modifications, we investigated how phosphorylation of ribosomal proteins from bacteria (70S) and mitochondria (55S) regulates translation and other acquired roles.  Identification of twenty-four phosphorylated 70S and 55S ribosomal proteins as well as the potential endogenous kinase was achieved using 2D-gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry.  Specific detection of phosphorylation was fulfilled by [\u00e3-32P] ATP- labeling, ProQ staining, or phospho-specific antibodies.  Many of the phosphorylated proteins are located at the polypeptide exit tunnel, mRNA binding path, and the sarcin-ricin loop of the ribosome, implying the functional role of this post-translational modification in translation.  By IMAC and SCX, enrichment of phosphopeptides resulted in the mapping of evolutionarily conserved phosphorylation sites which correlated to ribosomal function.  Furthermore, we have demonstrated, in the presence of in vitro phosphorylation, the inhibition of protein synthesis by mitochondrial kinases PKA, PKC\u00e4, and Abl Tyr kinase.  From these phosphoproteomic analyses of 70S and 55S ribosomal proteins, a mitochondrial specific protein DAP3 and the conserved L7/L12 were chosen for functional studies.  DAP3 is a GTP-binding apoptotic small subunit protein phosphorylated at several serine and threonine residues, which are dispersed around the GTP-binding motifs, and may alter protein conformation and activity. Site-directed mutagenesis studies on selected phosphorylation sites were conducted to determine the effect of phosphorylation on cell viability and PARP cleavage.  On the other hand, L7/L12, a large subunit protein, stimulates the activity of several GTPases.  Highly conserved serine and threonine phosphorylation sites are strategically located at different functional domains of the protein, inducing conformational changes to the stalk.  Site-directed mutagenesis studies coupled to in vitro translation assays were performed, stimulating or inhibiting protein synthesis due to the charge repulsion of neighboring acidic residues in various arrangements.  Overall, these proteomic studies identified novel phosphorylated targets and emphasize the importance in translation and apoptosis by maintaining the delicate balance between these two opposing processes.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2790], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Jennifer Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Emine Koc", "Ming Tien", "Robert Allen Schlegel", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets", "Emine C Koc"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Emine Koc, Dissertation Advisor", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Robert Allen Schlegel, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets, Committee Member", "Emine C Koc, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["ribosomal proteins", "apoptosis", "phosphorylation", "mitochondria", "proteomics", "translation"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Minimization of Circuitry in Large Format Lithium-ion Battery Management Systems", "id": "16309", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8188", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lithium-ion based batteries are the most energy and power dense rechargeable batteries currently available.

The results of three-dimensional motion analyses are typically displayed on a two-dimensional video screen. While such views may be rotated to give the appearance of a three dimensional motion, viewing a flat screen is inherently different from a truly three-dimensional display. A volumetric display would allow perception of the motion in three true dimensions and multiple observers could simultaneously view the same motion from different angles. Two different approaches to volumetric displays were explored, an LED display and a projected-light string display. The former is controlled by a microcontroller that is programmed to light a 3-D array of LEDs, and the latter involves projection of a two-dimensional image onto an array of vertical strings to create the three-dimensional image. Because it was less expensive to fabricate and easier to interface with the motion capture system, it was decided to move forward with the projected-light string display. Using a six camera Eagle Motion System, the coordinates of markers placed on human body segments were recorded and accessed in MATLAB in real-time. The marker data were used to calculate intersections between the body segments and the strings in the display. These intersections were represented as rectangles in a two-dimensional image projected onto the strings to create the three-dimensional image. Three applications were developed to demonstrate the capabilities of the display: (1) real-time posture assessment and training; (2) feedback of trunk lean angles during walking to lessen loads on painful joints; and (3) feedback of low back loads during a lifting task. Preliminary data collected during tests of these applications suggest that the use of the display conveys benefits to motor learning.

In an attempt to fill the lacuna left by her unfinished work, The Life of the Mind, I argue that Arendt\u2019s appropriation of the Kantian sensus communis entails a theory of ethical and political judgment centered in the community rather than the subject. Taking my cue from her comment that the goal of philosophy is to teach us how to \u201cthink without banisters,\u201d I defend Arendt\u2019s view that the faculty of thinking cannot practically constrain the faculty of willing, and that the categorical imperative is inadequate to challenge of the explosive unforeseeability that Arendt attributes to action. Thus Arendt\u2019s account of judging cannot be equated with reasoning over consequences or intentions. \nBecause Arendt rejects Kant\u2019s attempts to circumscribe action under a moral law and his nascent account of historical progress developed under the rubric of teleological judgment, her account of aesthetic judgments also departs significantly from that of Kant. To spell out this departure, I analyze Arendt's dissertation on Augustine, in which I show that Arendt sought a theory of judging as amor mundi that depends on the phenomenological circumscription of communities of interpretation and response. I expand this account with a reading of Augustine\u2019s struggle to negotiate with the Donatist schismatics, which I use to develop the parallels between Arendt\u2019s account of judgment and contemporary democratic theories of deliberation and public reason", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2513], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Joshua A.", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Philip Christman", "John Philip Christman", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan", "Dennis Schmidt", "Stephen Howard Browne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Philip Christman, Dissertation Advisor", "John Philip Christman, Committee Chair", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Committee Member", "Dennis Schmidt, Committee Member", "Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hannah arendt", "judgment", "life of the mind", "public sphere", "sensus communis", "common sense", "immanuel kant", "kant", "arendt", "augustine", "love and saint augustine"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ADENYLOSUCCINATE SYNTHETASE 1: \nA NOVEL TARGET OF DELETION IN LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR METABOLIC STRESS TOLERANCE\n", "id": "11282", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2593", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tobacco smoke consists of numerous carcinogens whose effect on lung tumor development includes the induction of mutations in key metabolic genes as well as the induction of chromosome instability (CIN). Consequently, carcinogen-induced mouse lung adenocarcinomas (LAC) display many more recurrent site- and chromosome-specific changes in DNA copy number compared with non-induced LAC. Here we identified the Adenylosuccinate synthetase 1 (Adss1) gene located on distal chromosome 12q as a focus of biallelic or homozygous deletion (HD) in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC). HDs of Adss1 were detected at a high rate in both mouse LAC cell lines and primary LAC tumors induced in mice.  Losses of Adss1 not meeting the quantitative threshold of HD were also detected at a high frequency.  Adss1 losses were found to be significantly associated with a more extensive CIN phenotype in the primary mouse tumors indicating that this change may be more relevant to carcinogen induced tumors. \nA similar frequency of ADSS1 deletion was observed in human LAC cell lines, suggesting relevance in human lung cancer. These results suggest ADSS1 inactivation as a novel somatic alteration in lung carcinogenesis, and suggest that its selective deletion in LAC may be triggered by CIN.  In human lung tumors quantitative PCR detected bi-allelic or homozygous deletion of ADSS1 at a high frequency in LAC, however only one Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor exhibited biallelic loss and this was not isolated to ADSS1 specifically. ADSS1 loss not reaching the level of HD was detected at a much higher frequency than HD in both LAC and lung SCC, including the human cell lines. In all cases, for both HD and for deletions not reaching the threshold of HD, ADSS1 loss occurred at a higher frequency than was observed in either flanking gene, Inverted-Feron 2 (INF2) and SIVA1.\nThe ADSS1 isozyme plays a key role in the inter-conversion of inosine 5\u00b4-monophophate (IMP) and adenosine 5\u00b4-monophophate (AMP), which is tightly linked with the production of cellular energy in the form of adenosine 5\u00b4-triphophate (ATP).  Purine salvage pathway disruption is also reported in a number of cancers, primarily by deletion or mutation of the gene 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP).  It was observed here that ADSS1 and MTAP are deleted in a mutually exclusive fashion and HD of one gene was detected in the majority of the cell lines examined.  Knockdown of the remaining pathway in several cell lines resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability.  Due to the potential impact of these pathways on cellular energy levels, analysis of the nucleotide pools was undertaken in stable knockdowns for ADSS1.  HPLC showed an increase in adenylate levels in both cell lines examined as well as to the ratio of ATP to AMP in the H522 LAC cell line.  \nCellular energy status can affect both rates of proliferation and response to metabolic stress.  While no increase was observed in growth rates from this change in cellular energy levels, succinate dehydrogenase activity, an indicator of cellular metabolism, was increased in knockdowns under hypoxia.  Metabolic remodeling is often associated with changes in metabolic stress tolerance and low ADSS1 protein expressing cell lines were shown to be resistant to inhibition of glycolysis.  Inhibition of glycolysis by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in a panel of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines showed that levels of ADSS1 protein expressed relate to sensitivity to metabolic stress.  Restoration of ADSS1 expression to an ADSS1 deficient immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line was shown to sensitize it to both inhibition of glycolysis by 2-DG and to inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation by rotenone which functions by inhibiting electron transport.  This indicates a role in ADSS1 loss for protecting tumor cells during times of metabolic stress.\nResults from these studies demonstrate the frequent inactivation of ADSS1 by deletion in both mouse and human LAC, which suggests that this novel and irreversible change in cellular metabolism is selected in and therefore advantageous for LAC tumorigenesis.  Our results suggest that ADSS1 loss increases AMP availability for energy production and promotes survival under energy stress characteristic of early tumorigenesis.  As the underlying metabolic changes of cancer are better understood, these pathways are becoming increasingly relevant for therapeutic development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2586], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Joshua Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Christopher Herzog", "Chris Herzog", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Jong Kak Yun", "John Peter Richie Jr.", "Melvin Lee Billingsley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Christopher Herzog, Dissertation Advisor", "Chris Herzog, Committee Chair", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member", "John Peter Richie Jr., Committee Member", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lung cancer", "lung adenocarcinoma", "metabolic reprogramming", "adenylosuccinate synthetase", ", novel deletion"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Measuring the efficacy of an energy and environmental awareness campaign to effectively reduce water consumption", "id": "11337", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3776", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Increased energy costs and a move toward environmental stewardship are driving many organizations, including universities, to engage in awareness efforts to reduce both energy consumption and their carbon footprint.

The semiconductor, Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N, provides a material system suitable for a number of applications, provided for by adjustment of the AlN mole fraction.  Thus, there is a need for a universal metallization that can consistently produce low specific contact resistances for a range of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N compositions.  Although conventional ohmic contacts to n-type Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N are based on four-layer Ti-based metallizations, recently our research group has shown that V-based contacts outperform Ti-based contacts as the x in Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N increases.  When the identity of the third layer in a V/Al/X/Au layer structure was studied, where X is a transition metal, the V/Al/V/Au contact on AlN-rich Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N showed promise over the other V-based metallizations by providing low specific contact resistances at annealing temperatures as low as 700\u00b0C.  Up until this work, research based on V-based contacts was limited and further optimization of this metallization was needed.  This thesis is split into three sections based on Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N composition.  The first is on ohmic contacts to n-Al<sub>0.58</sub>Ga<sub>0.42</sub>N for bottom-emitting ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV LEDs).  The V- and Ti-based metallizations are optimized on both as-received and plasma-etched material, and differences between the metallization/semiconductor interactions are explored.  The second section reports on contacts to Al<sub>0.27</sub>Ga<sub>0.73</sub>N/GaN heterostructures for high electron mobility transistors.  The last section details a newly developed V/Al/V/Ag contact to n-GaN and n-Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N, which explores the effect replacing the traditional Au cap with a different metal.  Throughout the thesis, the focus remains on V-based metallizations and their adaptation to different compositions and conditions of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N.\n\tContacts to n-Al<sub>0.58</sub>Ga<sub>0.42</sub>N are the first metallizations to be described in this thesis.  The aluminum nitride-rich Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N is important for bottom-emitting ultraviolet light emitting diodes due to its wide, direct band gap.  As x increases in Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N to facilitate shorter emission wavelengths, it may become more difficult to form low resistance ohmic contacts to the semiconductor.  Since the nitride material often requires a sapphire substrate, both n- and p-type contacts are made to the same side of the LED device and plasma etching is required to expose the buried n-type layer.  A blanket layer of n-Al<sub>0.58</sub>Ga<sub>0.42</sub>N is plasma-etched with a BCl<sub>3</sub>/Cl<sub>2</sub>/Ar etch chemistry to mimic conditions under which bottom-emitting UV LEDs may be processed.  Several V/Al/V/Au and Ti/Al/Ti/Au contacts are tested to the as-received n-Al<sub>0.58</sub>Ga<sub>0.42</sub>N and compared to metallizations contacted to the plasma-etched material.  \n\tWhen compared on the as-received n-Al<sub>0.58</sub>Ga<sub>0.42</sub>N, the V-based contacts provided lower specific contact resistances at lower temperatures than the Ti-based contacts.  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that for the annealed V-based contacts, limited reaction with the Al<sub>0.58</sub>Ga<sub>0.42</sub>N occurs.  With the Ti-based contact, the reaction region is deep, penetrating 50 nm into the semiconductor.  Interestingly, the V-based metallization does not require deep reaction depths in order to provide a low resistance contact.  \n\tOn the plasma-etched n-Al<sub>0.58</sub>Ga<sub>0.42</sub>N, the specific contact resistances of V- and Ti-based contacts were more similar.  Cross-sectional TEM uncovered similarities in reaction depth and phase formation.  Both metallizations exhibited limited reaction depths, unlike Ti-based contacts as-received Al<sub>0.58</sub>Ga<sub>0.42</sub>N.  Both metallizations formed thin layers of aluminum nitride at the interface.  The crystalline aluminum nitride was penetrated by metal channels, which connect the top part of the annealed metallization to the plasma-etched n-Al<sub>0.58</sub>Ga<sub>0.42</sub>N.  The metal channels differ in composition, size and density between the V- and Ti-based contacts.  The metal channels were comprised of only the Al-Au phase for the Ti-based contacts, while they were made of V-Al-Au-N and Al-Au phases for the V-based contacts.  The importance of the aluminum nitride layer is discussed.    \n\tLow resistance ohmic contacts are also important for efficient high electron mobility transistors.  Here, ohmic contacts are also required to exhibit smooth morphology and contact edges.  A V/Al/V/Ag metallization has been developed for ohmic contacts to Al<sub>0.27</sub>Ga<sub>0.73</sub>N/GaN heterostructures with a thin GaN cap.  Through a combinatorial approach to the optimization of metal layer thicknesses, a contact with a low specific contact resistance as well as a smooth morphology was developed.  Some V/Al/V/Au and Ti/Al/Ti/Au contacts were fabricated for comparison; however, neither provided as good properties as those of the V/Al/V/Ag contacts.  \n\tCross-sectional TEM images of the V/Al/V/Ag contact to the Al<sub>0.27</sub>Ga<sub>0.73</sub>N/GaN heterostructure revealed some interesting results.  Large grains of V-Al, Ag and V-Al-Ag are identified in the annealed metallization as well as a composite of several smaller grains of V-Al, Ag, V-Al-Ag, Al-O and Al-Ag.  The composite contacts the Al<sub>0.27</sub>Ga<sub>0.73</sub>N layer.  The majority of the composite is comprised of Ag-bearing phases.  Since Ag has a lower work function than Au, it is likely that the work functions of the metal phases at the interface are lower than phases present in an analogous Au-bearing metallization.  One of the most interesting results of the V/Al/V/Ag contact, however, is that the annealed metallization leaves the Al<sub>0.27</sub>Ga<sub>0.73</sub>N layer intact after annealing.  In contrast, cross-sectional images of both of the optimized Au-bearing metallizations to the heterostructure show penetration of the 2DEG channel.\n  \tFinally, the V/Al/V/Ag metallization is contacted to both n-GaN and n-Al<sub>0.58</sub>Ga<sub>0.42</sub>N, due to the superior properties observed on the Al<sub>0.27</sub>Ga<sub>0.73</sub>N/GaN heterostructures.  Promising results were obtained for both semiconductor compositions.  Cross-sectional TEM imaging of the V/Al/V/Ag metallization showed very similar phase formation, regardless of the composition of the semiconductor.  Also, little change in the smooth morphology of the metallization occurred between V/Al/V/Ag contacts to n-GaN and n-Al<sub>0.58</sub>Ga<sub>0.42</sub>N.\n\tSpecific contact resistance was also studied as a function of temperature.  Curves that modeled thermionic emission, thermionic field emission and field emission dependence were matched against experimental data for all optimized contacts to n-GaN, Al<sub>0.27</sub>Ga<sub>0.73</sub>N/GaN heterostructures, and n-Al<sub>0.58</sub>Ga<sub>0.42</sub>N.  Determination of doping density ranges and Schottky barrier heights is discussed.  Ohmic contacts to n-GaN and n-Al<sub>0.58</sub>Ga<sub>0.42</sub>N were determined to have field emission dependence.  Although experimental data for ohmic contacts to Al<sub>0.27</sub>Ga<sub>0.73</sub>N/GaN heterostructures appear to show thermionic field emission dependence on temperature, the data could not be modeled due to the presence of two barriers to current transport that may exhibit temperature dependence: the metal/semiconductor interface and the Al<sub>0.27</sub>Ga<sub>0.73</sub>N/GaN interface. \t\nThe V/Al/V/Au, Ti/Al/Ti/Au, and V/Al/V/Ag metallizations were tested on three different Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N compositions.  Of the three metallizations, the V/Al/V/Ag metallization shows the most promising properties.  Minimal changes in the metal layer thickness, annealing temperature and time were necessary to optimize the V/Al/V/Ag metallization to a range of compositions of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N.  The V/Al/V/Ag metallization showed less of a dependence of metal layer thickness than the Au-bearing metallizations, and throughout the study, lateral diffusion of the metallization was not observed.  A limited sensitivity to layer thickness makes the V/Al/V/Ag metallization more robust to processing variations.  The V/Al/V/Ag metallization provides a reliable, low contact resistance and smooth morphology metallization for ohmic contacts to n-Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N from x = 0 \u2013 0.58.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3933], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Mary A.", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Mary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Joseph Flemish", "Jian Xu", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Chair", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Joseph Flemish, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ohmic contacts", "Vanadium", "AlGaN", "LEDs", "HEMTs"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Perceptions of District Leaders of Cyber Charter Schools in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania", "id": "13919", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7423", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nGiven the growth of cyber charter schools in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, more research is needed in this new wave of school reform.  In fact, little research currently addresses the perceptions that district leaders have in regard to cyber charter schools and that is what this study proposed to address.  District leaders interviewed included superintendents, curriculum specialists, building principals, and teachers\u2019 union representatives among others.\nThis qualitative study explored the perceptions of district leaders regarding the cyber charter schools through in-depth studies of two districts located in the Intermediate Appalachia Unit 8.  Specifically, the two case studies sought to address each district\u2019s current involvement with cyber charter schools and the perceptions of district leaders to be disposed either favorably or unfavorably toward cyber charter schools.  Finally, the study sought to explore the responses of districts to the cyber charter school challenge.\nData collection occurred over a three month period and included conversational interviews with respondents from both districts as well as analysis of a variety of relevant documents.  The researcher analyzed data through finding common themes among the research responses.  Thus, the research resulted in a thick, rich description of each district in terms of their perceptions of cyber charter schools.\nThree conclusions were drawn from the research.  First, the cyber revolution has brought significant challenges and lasting changes to traditional conceptions of schooling.  Second, public schools appear to be generally ill-prepared to meet these new cyber charter challenges, relying on more reactive, imitative responses rather than proactive, innovative initiatives.  Third, school leaders, on the whole, do not appear to perceive the cyber challenge as a major threat and are preoccupied with other issues.   Finally, there were a number of recommendations for practice and for further research.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7371], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Norman Jacob", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Jacob", "first_name_ssi": "Norman", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nona Ann Prestine", "William Hartman", "Dr Susan Faircloth", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Dr Preston Green"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nona Ann Prestine, Dissertation Advisor", "William Hartman, Committee Member", "Dr Susan Faircloth, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Dr Preston Green, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["cyber school", "virtual learning", "charter school", "21st century learning", "technology in the classrom", "cyber charter school", "school district leaders' perceptions on cyber charters", "cyber charter case study", "cyber charter challenge"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DIETARY PATTERNS, RED AND PROCESSED MEAT-DERIVED MUTAGEN EXPOSURE, AND COLORECTAL CANCER RISK\n\n\n", "id": "10872", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4881", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Colorectal cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed malignancy in developed countries and the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. A recent consensus report issued by the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research concluded that the evidence to support a positive association between greater intakes of red and processed meat and colorectal cancer risk was convincing, although the specific components within meat driving these associations remained unclear. The report also stated that there was insufficient evidence to render judgment regarding dietary patterns and colorectal cancer risk. To address these identified gaps in knowledge, we explored associations between both dietary patterns and specific meat components and colorectal cancer risk in a large multi-site population-based case-control study in a high-risk adult population in northeast and central Pennsylvania. Participants completed a 137-item food frequency questionnaire that included a detailed cooked and processed meat module, which allowed for the use of databases of heterocyclic amines (HCAs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrites, and nitrates.\nIn the first study, our objective was to examine colorectal cancer risk associated with dietary patterns among 431 incident cases (225 men, 206 women) and 726 healthy controls (330 men, 396 women). The majority of previous studies have derived patterns either by measuring compliance with pre-established dietary guidance or by empirical methods such as principal components analysis (PCA). We explored whether dietary patterns identified by both methods were associated with colorectal cancer risk. Three dietary patterns among men (fruits and vegetables, meat and potatoes, alcohol and sweetened beverages) and two among women (fruits and vegetables, meat and potatoes) were identified by PCA. Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-05) scores were generated to assess the degree of adherence to recommendations found in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. After adjusting for potential confounders, the PCA-derived fruits and vegetables pattern was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk among both men (odds ratio (OR) = 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.21-0.69 for the highest compared to the lowest quartile; P for trend = 0.006) and women (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.19-0.65; P for trend = 0.031). In contrast, the meat and potatoes pattern was positively associated with risk in women (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.08-4.50; P for trend = 0.070) and there was a suggestion of a positive association among men (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 0.84-2.90; P for trend = 0.070). Men and women with greater HEI-05 scores had a significant reduction in risk (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.31-0.99; P for trend = 0.004; OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.24-0.77; P for trend <0.001, respectively). In summary, findings from the first study indicate that both the hypothesis-oriented diet index-based approach and the empirically-driven PCA approach are of value in the study of diet and colorectal cancer associations and that following the Dietary Guidelines or a primarily plant-based dietary pattern that includes low-fat dairy and fish may be protective.\nIn the second study, our objective was to explore potential underlying mechanisms for previously observed associations between red and processed meat and colorectal cancer risk. We examined whether increased levels of exposure to mutagens generated through meat cooking and meat processing methods were risk factors for colon and rectal cancer among 726 healthy controls, 287 colon cancer cases, and 128 rectal cancer cases. Associations between meat exposures and colorectal cancer stratified by sub-site of the large intestine were estimated from unconditional logistic regression models. After multivariate adjustment, positive associations with HCAs and PAHs, as measured by total mutagenic activity, were stronger for rectal cancer (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.00, 3.08; P for trend = 0.031) than colon cancer, whereas suggestive positive associations with nitrites plus nitrates were stronger for colon cancer (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 0.82-2.00; P for trend = 0.084). These findings support the hypothesis that greater exposure to HCAs, PAHs, nitrites, and nitrates is a plausible mechanism by which red and processed meat may increase colorectal cancer risk. Our sub-site analyses indicate that associations between meat-derived exposures and colon and rectal cancer may differ, which underscores the need for additional studies that examine dietary risk factors for colon and rectal cancer as separate endpoints.\nIn conclusion, our research supports the complementary study of both dietary patterns and individual dietary components as cancer risk factors as each can serve a unique purpose in identifying areas to target for colorectal cancer prevention strategies as well as future research studies. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4858], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Paige Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Paige", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Leann L Birch", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "David Theodore Mauger", "Philip Lazarus"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Terryl Johnson Hartman, Dissertation Advisor", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Chair", "Leann L Birch, Committee Member", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "David Theodore Mauger, Committee Member", "Philip Lazarus, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["heterocyclic amines", "meat", "nutrition", "diet", "rectal cancer", "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons", "colon cancer", "nitrosamines"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Experimental investigation of permeability and mechanical evolution of cataclastic deformation bands ", "id": "26595", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11231", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cataclastic shear bands in unconsolidated sands are typically stronger and exhibit lower permeability than the surrounding matrix, and therefore act as barriers to fluid flow in aquifers and reservoirs.

The first is a poorly cemented marine terrace sand from the footwall of the McKinleyville thrust fault in Humboldt County, California, and the second is well-cemented sandstone from the hanging wall of the Moab Fault in Moab, Utah. I report on a suite of laboratory experiments that included measurement of permeability, porosity, and acoustic wave velocity over a range of effective stresses from 1-65MPa. \n\nThe permeability-porosity trends are similar for all samples, with permeability decreasing systematically with increasing effective stress and decreasing porosity. The permeability of the host material is consistently >1 order of magnitude greater than the host material for samples from both localities over the tested stress range. The permeabilities of host and shear band material from McKinleyville at peak stress range from 3.1\u00d710-17 m2 to 3.0\u00d710-18m2 respectively while the permeabilities of host and shear band material from Moab range from 3\u00d710-15m2 to 1\u00d710-16m2 respectively at peak stress. P- wave speeds are observed to increase systematically with increasing mean effective stress and decreasing porosity for all samples. Distinct differences between the petrophysical properties of the host material and shear bands observed in the two sample sets implies that the presence of cementation and the initial porosity dictate the evolution of transport and elastic properties within and in proximity to the shear band core. Regardless of formation properties, catalcastic shear bands will act as barriers to fluid flow and will compartmentalize reservoirs or aquifers depending on their orientation relative to flow.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10774], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Peter Kent", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Kent", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Demian Saffer", "Chris J Marone"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Demian Saffer, Thesis Advisor", "Chris J Marone, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rock mechanics", "deformation bands", "sandstone", "permeability", "reservoir mechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "GEOMORPHOLOGY OF LATERALLY ADVECTED FAULT BLOCKS IN CONVERGENT OROGENS", "id": "7152", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5766", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although the kinematics of bedrock in tectonically active mountain ranges commonly includes large horizontal components, few studies have addressed what the effect of this motion might be on geomorphology. Using a 2-D landscape evolution model, I investigate the role of lateral bedrock motion in steady-state topography developed on fault-bend folds and on extruding plateau margins. The first study, of fault-bend fold topography, examines the role that lateral bedrock motion has on the longitudinal profile shapes of detachment-limited streams. The primary effect is that streams on the fold that flow in the direction of lateral advection have greater steepness and concavity indices than streams that flow the opposite direction. This results from the fact that steady-state erosion rate is a function of bedrock velocity as well as topographic slope and aspect. Erosion rates are greater on a given surface sloping in the direction of advection than on a similar surface facing the opposite direction. Similarly, steeper slopes facing in the direction of advection must erode at faster rates than gentler slopes. This effect is enhanced at faster bedrock velocities, at intermediate fault dips, for thinner hanging walls, and for lower erosion coefficients. Because stream profiles set the relief structure of most mountain ranges, the cross-sectional asymmetry of their range-scale topography results from this mechanism.  Hillslope diffusion does not strongly influence this asymmetry at the common length-scales of mountain range half-widths and for reasonable diffusivities. Model results compare favorably to active fault-bend fold topography in the Siwalik Hills, Nepal. The second study shows how topography, such as transversely oriented valleys and ridges, can be advected across the crest of a fault-bend fold. This advection results in a cross-correlation between elevations on the two sides of the mountain range, promoted by the same conditions listed above. The third study demonstrates how lateral advection of an extruding plateau margin, where bedrock motion is limited to a block bounded by an upper normal fault and a lower thrust fault, creates convexo-concave detachment-limited stream longitudinal profiles that are shown to be consistent with observations of trans-Himalayan streams as they cross the Higher Himalaya.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5762], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Scott Ruthardt", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Ruthardt", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rudy L Slingerland", "Donald Myron Fisher", "Mark N Gahegan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rudy L Slingerland, Committee Chair", "Donald Myron Fisher, Committee Member", "Mark N Gahegan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tectonic geomorphology", "fault-bend fold", "lateral advection", "fluvial", "hillslope", "South Tibetan fault system", "Main Frontal thrust", "Siwalik Hills", "landscape evolution model", "asymmetry"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Design as a Sequential Decision Process: A Method for Reducing Set Space Using Models to Bound Objectives", "id": "13724swm154", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13724", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Complex engineered systems rely heavily on simulation models for design. Designing such systems typically involves a sequential decision process that increases the modeling and engineering analysis detail while simultaneously decreasing the space of alternatives considered. This space of alternatives is called the tradespace, and in a decision theoretic framework, low-fidelity models help decision-makers identify regions of interest in the tradespace and cull others prior to constructing more computationally-expensive higher fidelity models to further discriminate alternatives in support of a model-based systems engineering process.\n\nPrevious work has shown that multi-fidelity modeling can aid in rapid optimization of the design space when higher fidelity models \\emph{are coupled with} lower fidelity models, i.e., it is assumed that both models are available, and the two are used as a computational ``trick'' to speedup optimization routines. This dissertation introduces and motivates the sequential process of design through a formal model. The formal model seeks to answer (1) what structure models of varying fidelities should have relative to one another, (2) a linkage between decisions made from each modeling effort, and (3) a method for selecting a sequence of computational models and analyses when considering design as a \\emph{sequential decision process}. The method presented herein demonstrates design as a sequence of finite decision epochs through a tradespace defined by the extent of the set of designs under consideration, modeling characteristics, and the level of analytic fidelity subjected to each design. This work introduces a method for constructing cost-optimal sequences of models of increasing fidelity by reducing the design set size under the guarantee that the optimal solution remains in the consideration set at each epoch. \n\nA summary of relevant literature in design sciences, social sciences, and engineering optimization communities is given to scope the research. The formal model is presented with its assumptions, definitions, and applications as well as a method for applying the model to an engineering system. The method is applied to several examples including 1D and 2D finite element analysis and a bi-level optimization problem with a combinatorial kernel based on a 2D bin packing problem.

The energy absorbers tested are textile based devices that use sacrificial elements to dissipate the kinetic energy of a moving object. The two types of devices characterized are nylon stitch-ripping devices and polyester tear webbing. A series of environmental conditioning protocols were imposed onto the textile load limiters to determine their fitness-for-purpose. The test specimens were exposed to laboratory ambient, salt-fog spray, isopropyl alcohol, hydraulic fluid, hot-water immersion, kerosene, and high and low temperatures at quasi-static rates. The devices were also tested dynamically over a range of speeds between 0 and 15 m/sec at ambient conditions. Devices were quantified using performance metrics of specific energy absorption, volumetric energy absorption, linear energy absorption, and coefficient of variation of force.\n\nThe energy absorbers load profiles and energy absorbing capabilities were found to be mostly invariant to the selected conditions for quasi-static testing. However, exposure of the devices to extreme temperatures did result in the most variance in energy absorbing metrics as compared to ambient conditions. Two unique failures occurred in tear webbings that were exposed to hydraulic fluid or kerosene, one failure in each condition; the devices experienced warp fiber breakage prematurely.\n\nThe energy dissipation performance metrics were found to be invariant to rate effects across tested speeds. Stitch-ripping devices showed a slight increase in force variations with rate whereas tear webbings demonstrated a significant decrease. At these high rates, it is hypothesized that the tear webbing's sacrificial elements break at the interface between the webbings instead of slipping and pulling through the webbings.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5900], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Simon W", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Simon", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn", "Michael Andrew Yukish", "Christopher Rahn", "Charles E Bakis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Andrew Yukish, Thesis Advisor", "Christopher Rahn, Thesis Advisor", "Charles E Bakis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["textile", "energy absorber", "load limiter", "tear webbing", "stitch ripping device", "environmental conditioning", "quasi static", "high rate", "crashworthy", "restraint"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Toward the Greening of Nuclear Energy: A Content Analysis of Nuclear Energy Frames from 1991-2008\n", "id": "10868", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5769", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Framing theory has emerged as one of the predominant theories employed in mass communications research in the 21st century.

It is characterized by multiple broadband peaks and dominates the total noise at large angles to the jet downstream axis. A new model is introduced for the prediction of broadband shock-associated noise that uses the solution of the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The noise model is an acoustic analogy based on the linearized Euler equations. The equivalent source terms depend on the product of the fluctuations associated with the shock cell structure and the turbulent velocity fluctuations in the jet shear layer. The former are deterministic and are obtained from the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes solution. A statistical model is introduced to describe the properties of the turbulence. Only the geometry and operating conditions of the nozzle need to be known to make noise predictions. Unlike other models, the developed broadband shock-associated noise model is a true prediction scheme and not calibrated for a finite range of operating conditions. The broadband shock-associated noise model developed represents the only prediction method in existence that has no restrictions on nozzle geometry or jet operating conditions. This overcomes the limitations and empiricism present in previous broadband shock-associated noise models. Extensive validation of the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes solution is performed using experimental data.

These validations show both the strengths and deficiencies for modeling strategies of supersonic jets operating off-design using Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations and associated turbulence closure schemes.

Additionally, golden eagles are at high risk for negative interactions with wind power development in other parts of their range. Because this population is thought to be small, <2000 individuals, and because the majority of the population is thought to concentrate twice annually during migration in central PA where significant wind power development is occurring, there is a very high potential for conflict. Until I undertook this work, knowledge of the spatial ecology and movements of this population was based on bird band recoveries and four birds tagged with ARGOS satellite telemetry devices. My purpose in conducting this research was to improve the ecological knowledge about the movements and space use of this population and to map risk from a known threat, industrial wind power development. To address these issues and others, 42 golden eagles were trapped and fitted with telemetry devices between 2006-2012. I examined inter- and intra-seasonal variation in movement during summer and winter by calculating home range size (a proxy for amount of movement) using adaptive local convex hulls (aLoCoH) and by developing a new movement index, the central place foraging index (CPFI), which is the ratio of the aLoCoH to the minimum convex polygon. For each season, I examined the influence of age class, latitude, and habitat type on space use and movement. I found that during summer, space use depended upon eagle age and that winter space use was negatively correlated to forest coverage. Mean summer range size was 812.7 \u00b1 344.7 km2 (\u00b1SE, n = 10) for adults, 3,684.9 \u00b1 2,397.9 km2 (n = 3) for sub-adults, and 2,917.3 \u00b1 1,833.9 km2 (n = 4) for juveniles. Time of year also influenced movements. During winter, range size was smaller and much less variable than during summer (p = 0.018). Mean winter range sizes were 164.2 \u00b1 132.2 km2 (n = 10) for adults (A), 695.8 \u00b1 4,577.7 km2  (n = 9) for sub-adults (SA), and 372.3 \u00b1 199.4 km2 (n = 10) for juveniles (J). Finally, during summer, adult movements were more centralized, presumably around a nest site, than those of sub-adults or juveniles (CPFI = 0.28 \u00b1 0.03 (A) vs. 0.21 \u00b1 0.03 (SA) vs. 0.05 \u00b1 0.15 (J); p = 0.011), which is consistent with the expected breeding behavior of adults. However, during winter, CFPI was similar for all age classes (p > 0.05). The complex interactions between season and age I documented show the importance of considering such parameters in evaluating movement ecology. Mechanisms controlling migratory flight behavior also have direct consequences for fitness. I explored the influence of several biotic (flight speed, individual age and sex) and abiotic (weather, day of year, topography) factors on directness of migratory flight, measured by the straightness index, at multiple spatial scales. At a daily scale, spring flight paths were controlled by weather and topography. Conditions better for thermal development - increases in solar radiation and tailwinds - resulted in straighter flight paths because drift in thermals occurred parallel to the axis of migration. Conversely, increasing speed of headwinds resulted in more sinuous, less direct paths as birds drifted opposing the primary axis of migration. Long-linear ridges of the Ridge and Valley Province in central Pennsylvania provide leading lines where near straight-line orographic lift is available. When conditions for thermal development were poor, flight within this region was straighter than flight paths outside of the region because flight is constrained by the topography. At broader scales, regional and complete migratory paths, biotic factors were the drivers of flight path directness. At the regional scale, the interaction between age and sex was an important determinant of directness of flight; non-adult females flew the least directly and non-adult males flew the most directly. These differences may be a result of variation in physiology, development, or possibly anatomy.  At the full migratory scale, distance, age, and speed were important determinants of directness of flight. Wind drift and age-related differences in the learned ability to compensate for drift, as well as exploration by non-breeders, and aggressive territorial defense by breeding birds are likely mechanisms that push non-breeding birds off course. To assess risk during migration from industrial wind power developments, I modeled resource selection of low flying eagles and of wind turbines in three regions, the Allegheny Mountains/Plateau (AM) of west central PA, Plateau Provinces (PL) of northern PA and the Ridge and Valley (RV) region of central PA. I combined these models to create regional spatially explicit risk models. I found that risk varied regionally. Areas that are suitable for wind development that do not overlap with eagle habitat are: 14% in AM, 9% in PL, and 2% in RV. Of the total area suitable for development in AM, PL and RV, 22%, 16%, and 80%, respectively, fell in the high-highest risk categories. In addition to determining regional levels of risk, these models can be used to make site-level recommendations to wind developers regarding turbine placement that have the potential to reduce risk to low flying eagles and allow for wind energy generation.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7654], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Tricia Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Tricia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Brooks", "Robert Brooks", "Margaret Brittingham Brant", "Michael R Gannon", "George Young", "Todd Katzner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Brooks, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Brooks, Committee Chair", "Margaret Brittingham Brant, Committee Member", "Michael R Gannon, Committee Member", "George Young, Committee Member", "Todd Katzner, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["golden eagle", "movement", "ecology", "resource selection", "home range", "seasonal", "migration", "modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Crustal Response to Changes in the Magmatic System at the Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano, Montserrat\n", "id": "12480", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6410", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation addresses the crustal response to the magmatic system beneath the Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano (SHV), Montserrat, using various seismic techniques. To facilitate a more robust interpretation of these results and other studies at similar crustal environments, we have also analyzed the seismic techniques typically utilized in such settings. \n\nIn the first article of this dissertation I explored volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquake activity recorded during the onset of volcanic activity, from July 1995 to October 1996, at SHV. I have determined earthquake locations for 6605 events and focal mechanism solutions for select events to reveal the stress axes. I identified several zones of temporally-confined seismic activity that comprise assemblages of small scale structural elements, >2-4 km distant from SHV, at depths 2-4 km b.s.l. I suggest that the clustered seismicity and relatively aseismic zones reflect a broad weakened tectonic zone of ESE trend that crosses Montserrat, which is overprinted by the ascent of a magmatic dike of NNE trend. This event, which altered the stress distribution, promoted localized fault movements and dilatation, with resultant changes in pore-fluid pressures. Ultimately, depending on the local polarity of strain these events may have weakened or strengthened the rock mass. \n\nIn the second article I have explored the limitations of focal mechanism solutions and identified methods to fortify their robustness by using three subsets of focal mechanisms with the best-quality determinations. One subset contains only the largest magnitude events. Two additional subsets, which were chosen for their tight temporal and spatial occurrence are part of the distal earthquake swarms located NE of the summit (NE) and at St. Georges Hill (SGH). I assume these two subsets were generated under consistent stress conditions. I propose that inconsistencies in the determined mechanisms for each subset may be due to uncertainties in the depth estimates, or real differences in stress due to crustal variations. I have used two approaches to determine the compression (P), intermediate (B), and tension (T) stress axes for the solutions at a range of hypocentral depths. These methods are successful in amplifying the signals of the dominating stress axis orientations. The dominating stress in the two focused clusters is that of extension; the NE subset has a T-axis orientated NW-SE, whereas the SGH subset has a T-axis oriented NE-SW. The P- and B- axes for both subsets are more variable. On the basis of these results we suggest that a local stress regime (generated by magmatic pressurization) is overprinting the regional stress regime.\n\nFinally, I examine the significance of a seismic pattern recently identified on Montserrat (termed VT-strings). I compare VT-string earthquake characteristics to other VT events to derive how they relate to the evolution of the volcanic system. In late 2007, the first observation of a VT-string sequence was made (7 November) consisting of a short-lived intense swarm of VT events. Since this initial sequence, several other similar swarms have been identified and have been correlated to the onset of eruptive activity. To determine how these unusual VT earthquakes relate to magmatic processes at SHV, I have examined the 7 November swarm for collective properties and distinguishing characteristics, when compared to other VT earthquakes recorded during this time period. I have calculated earthquake locations and focal mechanisms, and have explored the event waveforms for their spectral characteristics and similarity among events. The 7 November swarm events were closely related in time (all within a 1 hour period) and space (~2 km b.s.l.); but lack a distinct pattern in waveform characteristics. Conversely, other earthquakes (mostly occurring on 16 December 2007), are also closely related in space (~3 km b.s.l.), but correlate highly with events that occurred one or two days later. The VT-string sequence earthquake mechanisms exhibit no dominant orientation of maximum stress, whereas the later clusters highlight a vertical T-axis and a NW-SE trending P-axis. The repeating earthquakes are interpreted as occurring on pre-existing fractures at the top of the well-established conduit from depth, whereas the 7 November (not-correlating) events represent new fractures produced by the upward migration of magma into previously unstressed host rock or fatigue fracturing from repeated periods of pressurization. \n\nTogether, the articles in this dissertation increase our understanding of the crustal-magmatic system interactions at SHV. Exploring the processes at the onset of activity and later in the eruption, once the system has evolved.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6409, 6410, 6411], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Victoria Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Victoria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barry Voight", "Barry Voight", "Charles James Ammon", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barry Voight, Dissertation Advisor", "Barry Voight, Committee Chair", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Chair", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["locations", "earthquake", "volcano-tectonic", "Montserrat", "volcano", "Soufri\u00e8re Hills", "focal mechanism", "stress", "VT-string"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "THE INTERACTION OF INFLAMMATION AND GENDER/SEX IN BIPOLAR DISORDERS", "id": "15232cxm816", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15232", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent decades, inflammatory/immune activation has emerged as an important factor in the onset and progression of mood disorders.

There is evidence for a causal relationship between peripheral concentrations of the cytokine IL-6 in childhood, which can predict the onset of depressive symptoms in adulthood. \n\tHere we have proposed that gender and/or sex moderates the relationship between inflammation and mood in BD. Women and men are known to have different symptomatology and comorbidities associated with a diagnosis of BD; women have higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and eating disorders, whereas men have higher rates of alcohol and cannabis abuse and conduct disorder. Further, women with BD are known to experience depressive symptoms at the onset of the illness, whereas men are more likely to experience mania at onset. Moreover, there are known sex-based differences in inflammatory/immune activation. In general, females have more robust cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to antigenic challenges compared with males. Women had higher self-reported feelings of depression and social isolation after endotoxin injection compared to men in a recent report. In contrast, it is known that the female sex hormone 17-\u03b2 estradiol (E2) is broadly anti-inflammatory and confers protection against sepsis - a life-threatening complication of infection. \n\tOur research aims to address gaps in knowledge related to inflammation and gender/sex in BD. In our first study (Chapter 2) we examined peripheral biomarkers from human participants with symptomatic BD. The biomarkers of interest were (1) neopterin - a marker of the acute phase immune response that is released from activated macrophages, and (2) zinc - an essential biometal and antioxidant in the human body. We postulated that neopterin would be increased in symptomatic BD and zinc would be decreased. Further, we hypothesized that gender/sex would moderate the relationship between biomarker concentration and mania and depression severity. Our results indicated that peripheral zinc concentrations were in fact reduced in symptomatic BD compared to a healthy control population. Further, we found that zinc concentrations were associated with severity of depressive symptoms in women with BD. In contrast, neopterin concentrations were associated with mania severity in men with BD. In this way, our findings underscore the importance of analyzing gender differences in biomarker studies. This research will help to advance the field of personalized medicine for BD.\n\tIn our second study (Chapter 3), we postulated that male and female mice would respond differently to an injection of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - a component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. Further, we expected that there would be a sex-based dichotomy regarding the levels of oxidative stress and apoptosis in the brain after LPS injection. We found that males had higher levels of depressive-like behavior after LPS, compared to saline-treated males. Further, we found increased protein levels of superoxide dismutase in the male hippocampus. 28 days after the LPS injection, males showed signs of increased apoptosis in the hippocampus - higher cleaved caspase-3 protein levels and increased TUNEL staining. Females overall appeared more resilient against LPS administration - they did not show signs of apoptosis or oxidative stress in the hippocampus and did not increase depressive-like behavior. However, females appeared more 'sick' than males, indicated by decreased mobility in the open field test. Overall our study indicated that (1) inflammation might underlie hippocampal atrophy in some cases in males, (2) females appear to have a different behavioral response to inflammation compared to males, (3) females are more resilient against deleterious effects on LPS on the hippocampus compared to males. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16522], "author_name_tesi": "Millett, Caitlin Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Millett", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Caitlin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Erika F H Saunders", "Erika F H Saunders", "Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy", "James Robert Connor", "Julio Fernandez-Mendoza"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Erika F H Saunders, Dissertation Advisor", "Erika F H Saunders, Committee Chair", "Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy, Committee Member", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "Julio Fernandez-Mendoza, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mood Disorder", "Depression", "Inflammation", "Biomarker", "Psychiatry", "Female", "Women"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Kallah's Choice: Hair Covering Practices of Orthodox Women in an American Small Town", "id": "13167", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "192", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-01-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hair covering serves as a siman nisuin (sign of marriage) for many Orthodox Jewish women.

On these farms as well as others in the Northeast, manure storage capabilities are limited, requiring farmers to empty storage multiple times throughout the year.  Although manure is a valuable source of nutrients, it can lead to water quality impairment. Applying manure in the fall is inherently more risky due to a lack of vegetative growth and a long time delay before primary crop uptake. This thesis research focused on different management strategies that would protect water quality and conserve nitrogen for crop use when manure is applied in the fall. In a two-year field study conducted at the Russell E. Larson Agricultural Research Farm, winter rye (Secale cereal L.) was planted before corn (Zea mays L.) in fields managed as a no-till system.  Three different management strategies were evaluated: i) winter rye management (rye grown as a cover crop or harvested as silage); ii) method of manure application (broadcasted or injected); and iii) timing of manure application (applied early or late in the fall, in September or November respectively. \nIn the first half of the study, effects of manure application strategies on nitrogen conservation for winter rye were evaluated by measuring ammonia volatilization, rye biomass, nitrogen content in aboveground rye, and soil-N to a depth of 90cm. Consistently in both years, ammonia volatilization was lower after early-injected manure than early-broadcasted. More nitrogen was conserved in the soil, and ryelage biomass was 48 and 38% higher after early-injected manure than after early-broadcasted manure in 2014 and 2015, respectively.  After late-broadcasted and late-injected manure, there were no differences in ryelage biomass. However, late-injected manure resulted in 3.8 and 10.6% rye damage in 2014 and 2015, respectively. There were no differences in rye cover crop biomass due the method or time of manure application. Following rye, soil NO3-N tended to be higher after each of the following management practices: i) a rye cover crop compared to ryelage; ii) injected manure compared to broadcast manure; iii) a late manure application compared to early application; but differences were not always significant. \nIn the second half of the study, previous management of manure and rye effects on manure-N availability from fall-applied manure for corn were assessed by: i) measuring pre-sidedress soil nitrate, corn yields, and total harvested corn and rye forage; ii) estimating adjusted N-recommendations and cost; and iii. calculating manure-N equivalency. In 2014 and 2015, pre-sidedress soil nitrate test (PSNT) results were below 25mg kg-1 for all treatments, and N-recommendations tended to be lower after each of the following: i) a cover crop compared to ryelage, ii) injected manure compared to broadcast manure and iii) late applied manure compared to early applied manure. Manure N-equivalencies were highest after a rye cover crop with late-injected manure (57.4%) and lowest after ryelage with early-broadcasted manure (4.3%). Averaged over the two years, total harvested forage, (either corn silage only after a cover crop, or ryelage and corn silage dry matter), was 19% higher after ryelage than after a rye cover crop and 22% higher after injected manure than after broadcasted manure. Winter rye coupled with nitrogen conserving manure application strategies can provide Northeast dairy producers flexible field management strategies that can increase fall manure-N utilization for crop production, and reduce nitrogen loss to the environment.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12254], "author_name_tesi": "Milliron, Rachel Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Milliron", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Heather D Karsten"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Heather D Karsten, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fall manure applications", "Winter rye", "Cover crop", "Ryelage", "Injected manure", "Late-fall manure application timing", "Nutrient pollution", "Nitrogen conservation", "Manure-N equivalencies"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A New UHF High Dynamic Range Receiver for the Arecibo Observatory", "id": "17655", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8464", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Arecibo Observatory\u2019s radio telescope studies the upper regions of the atmosphere using its 430 MHz receiver system.

The environment is a random-matching model of money where some people \nhave publicly-observed histories and so can be monitored, while others have private histories and cannot be monitored. Those who are monitored issue inside money. The issuers of inside money can only be monitored imperfectly, however, because histories are observed only after a lag. I show via a mechanism design approach that for some parameters, there exist allocations that are achievable only when both outside and inside money are used.   \n\nTHE SIZE OF MEETINGS AND THE ROLE OF MONEY\n\nDouble-coincidence problems are necessary for money to be essential. I amend a random-matching model with no commitment and no publicly-\nobservable histories by making the number of people in a random meeting a parameter, denoted N. This is one way to parameterize the extent of the double-coincidence problem. I prove that as N approaches infinity, the beneficial role of money disappears.\n\nMECHANISM DESIGN IN FREEMAN'S MODEL OF PAYMENTS\n\nFreeman (1996a) claims to have an environment in which outside money is essential to repay debt.

At the present time, most superconducting nanostructures are fabricated from deposited films of metals, which are often polycrystalline or amorphous. The realization of a single-crystal nanostructure would provide the opportunity to explore the effects of the electronic band structure. Consider crystalline superconducting nanostructures of NbSe2. Questions such as the how the charge density wave order influences vortex pinning and the logarithmic vortex-vortex interaction, as well as how the crystal thickness dependence of the electronic band structure affects intrinsic vortex properties motivated our efforts to develop techniques to fabricate and measure superconducting nanostructures of 2D crystal NbSe2. Additionally, nanoscale transport devices are relevant to potential future superconducting electronics.\n\nIn this dissertation, we begin by presenting a novel technique for the preparation of single-crystal nanostructures prepared from mechanically exfoliated few-layer crystals of NbSe2 using a process combining electron beam lithography and reactive plasma etching. Our technique allows for the preparation of ultra-thin, single-crystal superconducting nanostructures with a desired geometry for the study of vortex dynamics in extremely confined systems. A primary advantage of transport devices is the ability to directly manipulate individual vortices through the use of an applied current and other parameters.\n\nWe first present magnetoresistance measurements on NbSe2 nanowires and show features related to vortex crossing, trapping, and pinning. The vortex crossing rate is found to vary non-monotonically with the applied field, which results in non-monotonic magnetoresistance variations in agreement with theoretical calculations in the London approximation. Above the lower critical field, Hc1, the crossing rate is also influenced by vortices trapped by sample boundaries or pinning centers, leading to sample-specific magnetoresistance patterns. We show that the local pinning potential can be modified by intentionally introducing surface adsorbates, making the magnetoresistance pattern a \"magneto fingerprint\" of the sample-specific configuration of vortex pinning centers in a superconducting nanowire.\n\nBuilding upon our work on NbSe2 nanowires, we next focus on NbSe2 nanoloops. The doubly-connected topology of nanoloops presents a unique opportunity for the manipulation of Abrikosov vortices; numerical calculations in the London limit suggest that an Abrikosov vortex can be trapped in a nanoloop above a critical magnetic field and generate a phase shift in the magnetoresistance oscillations. We measure magnetoresistance oscillations resulting from vortex crossing events in NbSe2 nanoloops and demonstrate experimentally that the crossing of vortices can be directed at a pair of constrictions in the loop, leading to more pronounced magnetoresistance oscillations than those in a uniform loop. We also observe for the first time a phase shift in the magnetoresistance oscillations resulting from vortex trapping in the nanoloop, and we manipulate the trapped vortex with an applied transport current. \n\nResults obtained in our NbSe2 devices provide a starting point for the manipulation of individual Abrikosov vortices, allowing further exploration of the fundamental properties of this topological object that will lead to a deeper understanding of the motion, including the quantum motion, of vortices.

The bioreactors were constructed and operated side-by-side at the Texas Street Well Facility in Redlands, Californian. Each reactor was packed with either sand or plastic media. A perchlorate-reducing bacterium, Dechlorosoma sp. KJ, was used to inoculate the bioreactors. Perchlorate was successfully removed down to a non-detectable level (< 4&micro;g/L) in both bioreactors with acetate as a carbon source and nutrients at loading rates less than 0.063 L/s (1 gpm; 0.34 L/m2s). The sand medium bioreactor could achieve complete-perchlorate removal up to flow rate of 0.126 L/s. A regular backwashing cycle (once a week) was an important factor for completely removing perchlorate in groundwater.\nPower generation directly from pure or mixed organic matter was examined using microbial fuel cells (MFCs), which were run either in batch or continuous mode. In batch experiments, both a pure culture (Geobactor metallireducens) and a mixed culture (wastewater inoculum) were used as the biocatalyst, and acetate was added as substrate in the anode chamber of the MFC. Power output in a membrane MFC with either inoculum was essentially the same, with 40 \u00a1\u00be 1 mW/m2 for G. metallireducens and 38 \u00a1\u00be 1 mW/m2 for mixed culture. A different type of the MFC containing a salt bridge instead of a membrane system was examined to generate power using the same substrate and pure culture as used in the membrane MFC. Power output in the salt bridge MFC was 2.2 mW/m2. It was found that the lower power output  was directly attributed to the higher internal resistance of the salt bridge system (19920 \u00a1\u00be 50 \u00a7\u00d9) in comparison with that of the membrane system (1286 \u00a1\u00be 1 \u00a7\u00d9). \nContinuous electricity generation was examined in a flat plate microbial fuel cell (FPMFC) using domestic wastewater and specific organic substrates. The FPMFC, containing a combined electrode/proton exchange membrane (PEM), was initially acclimated for one month to domestic wastewater, and then was operated as a plug flow reactor system. Power density using domestic wastewater as a substrate was 72 \u00a1\u00be 1 mW/m2 at a liquid flow rate of 0.39 mL/min (1.1 hr hydraulic retention time, HRT), and COD removal was 42 %. At a longer HRT of 4.0 hr, the COD removal increased to 79%, and power density was 43 mW/m2. Several organic compounds (about 1000 mg-COD/L) also generated high power densities including: glucose (212 \u00a1\u00be 2 mW/m2), acetate (286 \u00a1\u00be 3 mW/m2), butyrate (220 \u00a1\u00be 1 mW/m2), dextran (150 \u00a1\u00be 1mW/m2), and starch (242 \u00a1\u00be 3mW/m2). Therefore, it was shown that power could be successfully generated in a continuous-mode MFC with a variety of organic substrates. \nAnimal wastewater was also tested as substrate to generate power in an air-cathode single chamber MFC operated in batch mode. This preliminary experiment demonstrated that power generation could be sustained with animal wastewater and that wastewater strength and odors were substantially reduced in the reactor after only one day of operation.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [858], "author_name_tesi": "Min, Booki ", "last_name_ssi": "Min", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Booki", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "John Michael Regan", "William D Burgos", "Thomas E Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Chair", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "William D Burgos, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microbial fuel cell", "Bioreactors", "Remediation", "Perchlorate", "Electricity generation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Temperature Dependence of Dielectric Breakdown in Polymers\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "8567", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1260", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Capacitors possess high-power densities and have the ability to deliver energy with short discharge times, which are in the micro-second to nano-second range.

To realize a versatile (bio)chemical sensing system for the fundamental study as well as their practical applications, the following three distinct components were studied and developed: i) detection platforms with high sensitivity, ii) novel innovative sensing materials with high selectivity, iii) analytical model for data interpretation. 8-pixel micromachined quartz crystal resonator (microQCR) arrays with a fundamental resonance frequency of 60 \u2013 90 MHz have been used to provide a reliable detection platform with high sensitivity. Room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) has been explored and integrated into the sensing system as a smart chemical sensing material. The use of nanoporous gold (np-Au) enables the combination of the resonator and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for both quantitative and qualitative measurement. A statistical model for the characterization of resonator behavior to study the protein adsorption kinetics is developed by random sequential adsorption (RSA) approach with the integration of an effective surface depletion theory. \nThe investigation of the adsorption kinetics of blood proteins is reported as the fundamental study of biological phenomena using the proposed sensing system. The aim of this work is to study different aspects of protein adsorption and kinetics of adsorption process with blood proteins on different surfaces. We specifically focus on surface depletion effect in conjunction with the RSA model to explain the observed adsorption isotherm characteristics. A number of case studies on protein adsorption conducted using the proposed sensing system has been discussed. Effort is specifically made to understand adsorption kinetics, and the effect of surface on the adsorption process as well as the properties of the adsorbed protein layer.\nThe second half of the dissertation focuses on chemical sensing and biosensing applications. For chemical sensing, we describe the characteristics of room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) as a chemical recognition material and integrate it into the quartz crystal resonator arrays to realize chemically selective microsensor arrays. The quartz crystal resonator array integrated with RTIL doped ionomer is then used to detect the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and to qualitatively and quantitatively discriminate the composition of VOC mixtures. For multianalyte discrimination, we explored the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) technique.\nFor biosensing application, nanoporous gold (np-Au) fabricated by selectively dealloying Ag/Au alloy, is integrated onto the sensor array as an active Raman substrate to provide a special structure for enhancement of Raman signal. Using thiol based biomolecular functionalization in combination with the quartz crystal resonator array based gravimetric sensing and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based molecular identification, both quantitative and qualitative (dual-mode) sensing has been achieved. The use of nanoporous gold electrode enables label-free biomolecular fingerprinting via SERS. 24-mer oligonucleotide binding reaction was investigated to prove the usefulness of np-Au for a possible dual mode sensing application using the proposed sensing system and SERS.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9414], "author_name_tesi": "Min, Hwall ", "last_name_ssi": "Min", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hwall", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "David Lawrence Allara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Dissertation Advisor", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Chair", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Member", "David Lawrence Allara, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["quartz", "resonator", "quartz crystal microbalance", "biosensor", "chemical sensor", "protein adsorption", "RSA", "ionic liquid", "pattern recognition"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION USING MOTION TRAJECTORIES", "id": "6617", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3202", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new method for extraction and temporal segmentation of multiple\nmotion trajectories in human motion is presented.

First, I build a conceptual framework that describes differences in team members\u2019 perceptions about their relative status in dyadic relationships. Specifically, I address three different motivational theories under the approach-avoidance framework: regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997), goal orientation theory (Dweck & Legett, 1988), and self-verification theory (Swann, 1983). These theories are applied to distinguish situations in which members perceive their higher status as an opportunity or threat and their lower status as an opportunity or threat. I also propose possible behavioral and team outcomes that follow members\u2019 perceptions about their dyadic status. Then, I conduct an empirical study to test a part of my conceptual framework. As expected, low self-esteem, higher status members demonstrate fewer helping behaviors and lower quality relationships with their dyadic partners than high self-esteem, higher status members. Furthermore, learning goal orientation amplifies the negative influence of higher status in dyads: Members showed the lowest levels of helping and information-sharing behaviors when they were higher status, low on self-esteem, and high on learning goal orientation. These findings support the new approach that this dissertation takes to status suggesting that not all people desire higher status.

Many ECs are known to be endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and they include natural estrogens and synthetic estrogens, which have been detected in surface waters worldwide.  Effluent discharged to downstream water bodies from wastewater treatment plants, and surface runoff from manure-amended fields, are two important pathways of estrogens into the environment.  In order to manage these wastes in a sustainable manner, more research is needed to understand the impacts of land application activities on water quality and contaminant fate and transport.\nWhile the land application of animal manure provides many benefits, concerns exist regarding the subsequent transport of estrogens and the potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems.  The effects of two methods of dairy manure application, surface broadcast and shallow disk injection, on the fate and transport of natural estrogens in surface runoff were examined.  Ten natural surface runoff events were sampled over a 9-mo. period following fall manure application, in October of 2014, to 12 large field plots in Central Pennsylvania, USA.  Study results show that the range of estrogen concentrations observed in surface runoff from the broadcast plots was several orders of magnitude higher ( > 5000 ng L-1) than the concentrations in runoff from the shallow disk injection plots ( < 10 ng L-1).  Additionally, the transport dynamics differed, with the majority of the estrogen loads from the surface broadcast plots occurring during the first rainfall event after application, whereas the majority of the loads from the shallow disk injection plots occurred more than six months later during a hail storm event.  Total estrogen loads were, on average, two orders of magnitude lower for shallow disk injection compared to surface broadcast.  Independent of the method of manure application, 17\uf061-estradiol and its metabolite estrone were preserved in the field for as long as nine months following application.  Overall, injection of manure shows promise in reducing the potential for off-site losses of estrogens from manure-amended soils.\n\tThe effects of surface broadcast and shallow disk injection on nutrient export dynamics were also investigated and compared to estrogen dynamics.  Various methods of data analysis were employed to investigate the role played by hydrologic and biogeochemical variability on the export of estrogens, identifying similarities and differences to the export of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).  Our data analysis revealed that hydrologic variability was the dominant driver of TDP and DOC transport for both application types, whereas for estrogen transport concentration variability played a more important role with a more pronounced effect for the surface broadcast relative to the shallow disk injection application.  More than 90% of the exported loads were transported during the first event for the surface broadcast plots, whereas the shallow disk injection plots did not generate runoff during that event, and nearly 65% of the estrogen loads were transported during a hail event at the end of April 2015, more than six months after manure applications. \nThe presence of natural and synthetic estrogens in treated wastewater used for irrigation of agricultural fields poses a potential risk to surface water ecosystems. While several recent studies have investigated the occurrence, fate, and transport of estrogens in the environment, the vast majority of these studies have focused on the fate of estrogens in streams and rivers. However, no studies have been conducted to assess the occurrence, persistence, and fate of estrogens in impacted sensitive aquatic ecosystems such as vernal pools. This is of particular importance because vernal pools serve as critical breeding habitat for amphibians, which are known to be sensitive to the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds. A spray irrigation system was implemented over 50 years ago at The Pennsylvania State University\u2019s (Penn State) \u201cLiving Filter\u201d as an alternative to discharging treated wastewater to a high quality trout stream. This system introduces all of Penn State\u2019s treated wastewater onto approximately 250 hectares of agricultural and forested land at a rate of ~ 5 cm ha-1 week-1.  More than a dozen small, temporary surface bodies (pools) are impacted by this wastewater irrigation, with some pools adjacent to irrigation laterals receiving direct inputs of the treated wastewater.  The goal of this study was to assess the impact of these weekly irrigation activities on the transformation, persistence, and fate of estrogens (17\u03b1-estradiol, 17\u03b2-estradiol, estrone, estriol, and 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol) in three vernal pools (VPs) during an eight-week field study.  The spring 2015 study period coincided with wood frog breeding and metamorphosis. Irrigation wastewater was collected weekly and water samples near the sediment-water interface in each VP were collected daily.  Real-time monitoring stations continuously recorded the temperature, pH, oxidation-reduction (ORP) potential, dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity (EC), and water level at each VP. Nearly 100% of the VP daily samples (n = 137) collected contained estrogens, and the concentrations were several times higher compared to the wastewater irrigation water.  Estrone was the most frequently detected estrogen and 17\u03b1-estradiol was detected in almost 52% of the daily samples.  Additionally, the data suggest transformation of estrone back to 17\u03b1-estradiol due to reduced oxygen/anaerobic conditions in the VPs.  This unique field study suggests that more research is needed to quantify the potential impact of estrogenic activity on amphibians, particularly during their critical metamorphosis period.\nThe work completed for this dissertation improves the current knowledge of the fate and transport of natural and synthetic estrogens under environmentally relevant conditions.  The studies improved the current understanding of the transformation, persistence, and overall fate of natural and synthetic estrogens in surface runoff from agricultural fields treated with dairy manure, and in alternating aerobic, reduced oxygen, and anaerobic conditions of VP habitats.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12534], "author_name_tesi": "Mina, Odette ", "last_name_ssi": "Mina", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Odette", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Heather E.

This amounts to nonlinear pricing to achieve particular performance goals. Different subsidization schemes have been developed, and have also been augmented with cross-subsidies among customer classes i.e. residential, commercial and industrial. A variety of targeting mechanisms have been used to allocate the subsidies; the most popular ones being increasing block pricing (IBP), means-tested and geographically targeted subsidies. The Colombian subsidization scheme is particularly interesting because it combines cross-subsidization among customer classes with IBP and geographically targeted subsidies.\nUnder this scheme, residential customers are classified in one of six categories. Customers classified as part of the lower three categories received a subsidy on the first 200kWh of electricity consumed per month, while users in the upper two categories, along with industrial and commercial customers, pay a 20 percent tax on their monthly electricity consumption. Customers classified as part of class four pay the marginal price of electricity for all levels of consumption.\nIn theory, this household classification process is made such that the lower the household\u2019s income, the lower its assigned category. However, in practice, households are being classified according to the neighborhood in which they are located and/or the observable characteristics of the household. The use of neighborhood characteristics results in the creation of subsidized zones, which can constitute an incentive for the migration of high income households to subsidized neighborhoods. Using households\u2019 observable characteristics to identify high income households in poor neighborhoods can result in homeowners changing the observable characteristics of their properties to make them look like those of poorer ones. Hence, the current subsidization scheme as it is being applied may result in subsidizing high income households at the expense of poorer ones, reducing the transfer to those at the bottom of the income distribution, and undermining the policy\u2019s objective of universal access and wealth redistribution. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of this subsidization mechanism on targeting low income households. The importance of this study lies in the diagnosis of the problems associated with the currently used targeting method, and therefore constitutes an input for the improvement of the subsidization scheme. Evidence regarding the subsidization of high income households was obtained. I find that up to 50 percent of households were misclassified as part of class one when they actually belonged to the upper three quintiles of the income distribution. 61 percent of class two and 76 percent of class three households were misclassified. Additionally, I find that households classified as part of class one have a higher probability of exceeding the subsidized consumption level than households from classes two and three. The resulting probabilities of exceeding the subsidized consumption with respect to class four were 17.48 percent for class one, 12.71 percent for class two and 7.78% for class three.

Group IV single and heterostructured nanowires, in particular, have received increasing attention due to their compatibility with the current\nmicroelectronic industry and numerous research has been going on to optimize their growth process. For this purpose, the majority of reports have primarily used silane (SiH4) and germane (GeH4) as their Si and Ge containing gas sources. \n\nIn this thesis, an alternative Si source, disilane (Si2H6) has been investigated which is of interest since it is more reactive than SiH4 and therefore may enable higher growth rates at lower temperature and lower partial pressures. The lower thermal\nstability of Si2H6 could also be an advantage to enable the growth of Si1-xGex nanowires\nover the entire composition range at lower temperatures which are more compatible with\nthe range of conditions typically used for Ge nanowire growth and in turn may enable the\nfabrication of different types of heterostructures. To fulfill the objective of this research,a systematic study has been developed to explore the growth of group IV (Si, Ge, and\nSi1-xGex alloy) single and heterostructured nanowires from Si2H6 and GeH4 precursors.\n\nFirst, the growth kinetics of individual SiNWs from Si2H6 was investigated by examining the effects of growth parameters on their growth rate. The results were compared to that obtained with SiH4. In addition, to gain a better insight into the SiNW growth process, the results were also compared with Si films deposited under similar conditions inside the same reactor. Overall compared to SiH4, the use of Si2H6 enabled higher growth rates for both SiNWs and Si films. For both gases, a nonlinearity was observed in the growth rate of nanowire as a function of gas partial pressure which was explained by a simple decomposition mechanism including the adsorption, desorption and incorporation of precursor molecule on the Au droplet surface. The apparent activation energy of the process was found to be identical for both gases under the conditions examined in the present study, suggesting similar rate-determining step in the nanowire growth process from the two precursors. \n\nUpon completion of studies on SiNW growth, the synthesis parameter space was then determined for undoped GeNWs and the influence of growth conditions on their morphology as well as their growth rate was examined. It was found that the fabrication of GeNWs strongly depends on the growth temperature and is achievable only for a very narrow range. To get nanowires with uniform diameter, growth temperature should be kept low otherwise, uncatalyzed radial growth on nanowire sidewalls results in tapered nanowires. The growth rate as a function of temperature revealed an Arrhenius behavior with a small apparent activation energy and was observed to increase linearly with germane partial pressure in the range examined here. Besides the undoped GeNWs, the fabrication of radial p-n junction GeNWs, which are of interest for photovoltaic cells,\nwas also studied and it was found that the morphology of both the p-type core and the ntype\nshell is influenced by temperature and dopant ratios.\n\nThe outcomes of the studies on undoped GeNWs combined with the results on SiNWs were next used to explore the growth of Si1-xGex nanowires from Si2H6 and GeH4 gases. The variations in Ge fraction as well as growth rate of Si1-xGex nanowires with growth parameters were studied. In general, the higher reactivity of Si2H6 compared to SiH4 enabled the growth of Si1-xGex nanowires with Ge composition over a wide range from x ~ 20 \u2013 80 % which was controllable by varying the inlet GeH4/Si2H6 ratio at a constant temperature. It was observed that at a given inlet gas ratio, the growth rate increases exponentially with increasing temperature and the apparent activation energy of the process reduces as the Ge content of the nanowire is enhanced indicating a change in\nthe rate-limiting step of the process. For different growth temperatures, the growth rate\nof Si1-xGex nanowire was found to have a non-linear dependence on variations in either GeH4 or Si2H6 partial pressures which increases with both parameters when the other is fixed. The observed results were explained through a kinetic model that describes the reactions of precursors on the Au droplet surface.\n\nFinally, the information gathered from single nanowire synthesis was used to fabricate Ge/SiGe and SiGe/Si axial heterostructures. The SiGe/Si nanowires were further processed as a possible approach to form SiNWs with more uniform length by\nselectively etching the SiGe segment away and  releasing the SiNW segment. Producing monodisperse silicon nanowires (SiNWs) with uniform length has been a critical difficulty in the bottom-up assembly of nanowire devices. Currently, ultra-sonic agitation is frequently used to break the wires off of the substrate; however, they break at\ndiffering lengths, degrading the yield of successful wire integration and device fabrication. It was shown here that this problem can be mitigated through the use of SiGe/Si axial-heterostructure nanowire. After the fabrication of these structures, the SiGe segment can be selectively removed using NH4OH:H2O2:H2O solution. The process releases the SiNW segments with narrower length distribution.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5985], "author_name_tesi": "Minassian, Sharis ", "last_name_ssi": "Minassian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sharis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Ali Borhan", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Dissertation Advisor", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Chair", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Member", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanowire", "VLS growth", "Disilane", "Kinetic model"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Interrupting Cinematic Narratives of the First World War", "id": "24879", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "11083", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Contemporary rhetorics of war are increasingly characterized by narrative, visual representations \u2013 war films, video games, and documentaries \u2013 that invite their audiences to rhetorically identify with and participate in the military endeavor.

These characteristics make the robots suitable for many tasks traditionally completed by cranes or other material handling equipment, while providing improved efficiency.\nWhile the issue of load stabilization has been largely solved by using a cable array instead of a single vertical cable to suspend a load, a remaining issue with current cable array robot design, for some applications, is unintended collisions between the cables and obstacles in the workspace. This could damage the cables or the objects, poses a safety risk for anyone in the area, and reduces the size of the work envelope. Solving this issue, for cases such as lowing containers into the hold of a ship, could facilitate quicker acceptance of this robot class for widespread deployment.\nFor this Penn State Masters Degree effort, new prototypes of end effectors which allow for overhead retrieval, similar to the function of a typical crane, have been developed. Two of the prototypes used one set of winches and cables to drive the end effector while the other set drives the crane function. Of these prototypes, one locates the second set of winches on the end effector while the other locates the winches at the masts. Another prototype implemented a cable reeving structure that used one cable from each mast in a continuous loop from the winches, located at the mast, to the end effectors.

While the continuous loop prototype failed to perform well, the clotheslines prototype was successful in providing crane functionality.

However, little research exists that examines only Industrial Engineering students. This thesis examines the learning styles, learning preferences, satisfaction, and motivation of undergraduate junior and senior level Industrial Engineering students at The Pennsylvania State University. Fifty-one students were assessed using the NC State University Index of Learning Styles Questionnaire previously developed by Dr. Richard Felder, and forty-one students participated in a self-created questionnaire. These assessments were used to understand the learning preferences of undergraduate Industrial Engineering students and the course practices that bring them the most satisfaction with their educational experience.\n\tStudent satisfaction was shown to be influenced by several key factors- student motivation, student learning styles, and course design. Student motivation is a critical component of student satisfaction. Instructors can increase student motivation by stimulating student interest in class topics, displaying passion for the course material, offering to help students, and by creating a supportive classroom environment.  Targeting student learning styles allows students to learn more effectively, and therefore, become the most satisfied with their education. Classroom design is also a crucial component to student satisfaction.  Instructors should strive to make grading procedures clear, assessments fair, return assignments to students in a timely manner with productive feedback, and use \u201creal-world\u201d examples in class to best connect to students and bring them the most satisfying educational experience. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8516], "author_name_tesi": "Mines, Jennifer Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Mines", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Carl Lynch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Carl Lynch, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Industrial Engineering Education", "Engineering Education", "Satisfaction", "Learning Styles"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Pipelined Symbolic Taint Analysis", "id": "v979v304g", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12917", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The multifaceted benefits of taint analysis have led to its wide adoption in security applications, such as software attack detection, attack provenance investigation, and data lifetime analysis. Static taint analysis propagates taint values following all possible paths with no need for concrete execution but is generally less accurate than dynamic analysis. Unfortunately, the high runtime overhead imposed by dynamic taint analysis makes it impractical in many scenarios. The key obstacle is the strict coupling of program execution and taint tracking logic code. To alleviate this performance bottleneck, recent work seeks to offload taint analysis from program execution and run it on a different CPU offline or a spare core in parallel. However, since the taint analysis has heavy data and control dependencies on the program execution, the massive data in recording or transformation overshadows the benefit of decoupling. In this thesis, we continue this line of research to take advantage of ubiquitous multi-core platforms.\n\nFirst, we propose StraightTaint, a hybrid taint analysis tool that completely decouples the program execution and taint analysis. StraightTaint allows very lightweight logging, resulting in much lower execution slowdown, while still permitting us to perform full-featured offline taint analysis, including bit-level and multi-tag taint analysis. StraightTaint relies on very lightweight logging of the execution information to reconstruct a straight-line code, enabling an offline symbolic taint analysis without frequent data communication with the application. While StraightTaint does not log complete runtime or input values, it is able to precisely identify the causal relationships between sources and sinks, for example. Our experimental results show that on average StraightTaint can speed up application execution performance 3.32 times on a set of utility programs and 3.25 times on SPEC2006.\n\nThe collected data during online logging for some long running program could be still too large to be saved up for offline analysis. To address this limitation, we propose TaintPipe,  a novel technique for parallelizing and pipelining taint analysis. TaintPipe produces compact control flow profiles and spawns multiple threads as different stages of a pipeline to carry out symbolic taint analysis in parallel. Our experiments show that TaintPipe imposes low overhead on application runtime performance and accelerates taint analysis significantly. Compared to a state-of-the-art inlined dynamic data flow tracking tool, TaintPipe achieves 2.38 times speedup for taint analysis on SPEC2006 and 2.43 times for a set of common utilities, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate the strength of TaintPipe with a set of security applications.\n\nLast but not least, due to the design, both StraightTaint and TaintPipe are an ideal fit for ex post facto security applications, such as computer forensic analysis and reverse engineering. To make the techniques described in this thesis apply to a broader range of such applications, we have integrated the techniques proposed in this thesis into the tasks of binary code control flow profiling, encoding function detection, and speeding up semantics-based binary diffing.\u200b", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12635], "author_name_tesi": "Ming, Jiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Ming", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dinghao Wu", "Dinghao Wu", "Peng Liu", "Sencun Zhu", "Patrick Drew Mcdaniel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dinghao Wu, Dissertation Advisor", "Dinghao Wu, Committee Chair", "Peng Liu, Committee Member", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Patrick Drew Mcdaniel, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["taint analysis", "pipelining taint analysis", "offline symbolic taint analysis", "multi-core architectures"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Ethanol Production on Agricultural Land Use in Pennsylvania\n", "id": "8899", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1859", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research examines the potential influence of biofuel production on\nagricultural land use in Pennsylvania.

In the baseline scenario ($3.99/bu), 11 percent of cropland is\nused to grow corn grain, a higher corn price ($4.43/bu) increases corn grain to 14.7\npercent of cropland, and to 31.4 percent of cropland in the basin when corn price\nincreases even further relative to other crop prices ($4.87/bu).

Recent advances in site-specific nucleases revived the field of genome-editing and promise to treat diseases and to improve crops.  The discovery of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 nuclease (Cas9) system provided researchers with an easy to handle and effective tool for genome-editing. Cas9 can be reprogrammed for a new target by changing a 20 nt sequence in the guide RNA (gRNA). This same feature also allows creation of a flexible multiplex genome-editing tool when several gRNAs are simultaneously provided. However, robust and efficient expression of multiple gRNAs remained a challenge. To overcome this problem, our laboratory developed a robust and efficient method to produce multiple gRNAs from a single transcript expressed by a polycistronic tRNA-gRNA gene (PTG).\nChapter 2 of my dissertation describes successful adaptation of PTGs to create stable transgenic rice lines with up to eight mutated target sites and up to 86% mutation frequency. Comparing the PTG/Cas9 system with the traditional CRISPR/Cas9 system revealed that use of PTGs can boost mutation frequency in stable lines from 40-60% to fully 100% in two studied cases. The ability to mutate several genes at once facilitates the functional analysis of redundant genes and multi-gene families. The phenotypes of single knock-out mutants can be masked by redundant functions shared between closely related genes and creating multiple-tuple mutant is necessary to uncover gene functions. Researcher previously needed to cross mutant lines in a time-consuming process. PTG/Cas9, on the other hand, allows for creation of several knock-out alleles in a single transformation.\nI took advantage of PTG/Cas9\u2019s ability to mutate several genes in chapter 3 of my dissertation to create a mutant library of closely related and stress-responsive rice MPK genes. In this study, I demonstrated 45 to 86% frequency of biallelic mutations and successful creation of single, double and quadruple gene mutants by simultaneously targeting two to eight genomic sites in four MPK genes. I started the analysis of single MPK mutants and identified MPK1 and MPK6 as essential genes for rice development by finding the preservation of MPK functional alleles and normal phenotypes in CRISPR-edited mutants. The true knock-out mutants of MPK1 were severely dwarfed and sterile, and homozygous mpk1 seeds from heterozygous parents were defective in embryo development. By contrast, heterozygous mpk6 mutant plants completely failed to produce homozygous mpk6 seeds. In addition, functional importance of specific MPK features could be evaluated by characterizing CRISPR-induced allelic variation in the conserved kinase domain of MPK6. Indels and fragment deletion were both stably inherited to the next generations and transgene-free mutants of rice MPK genes were readily obtained via genetic segregation, thereby eliminating any positional effects of transgene insertions.\nWhile working on genome-editing with CRISPR/Cas9 during my dissertation research, I discovered that most available online tools fail to predict important off-target sites. I therefore conducted a study described in chapter 4 that aimed to find the reasons for their underperformance. I discovered that all off-target prediction tools I tested were imprecisely developed because they did not adjust their strategy and options for short sequences such as the 20 nt spacer sequences used to guide Cas9. The tested tools especially struggled with similar sequences that required small word-sizes to be aligned to the query and sequences with gaps compared to the query sequence. I developed a new strategy to improve off-target prediction based on sequence similarity by combining global and local alignments to allow for better gap detection and adjusting the options of the used aligners to increase sensitivity. Implementation of this new strategy yielded lists of highly specific CRISPR/Cas9 target sites for seven model and crop plant species. Depending on the species, between 65.4% and 92.6% of the coding sequences in a given genome can be specifically targeted by the spacers provided. These lists will be used to update the CRISPR-PLANT website so that researchers around the world can benefit from these high-stringent target sites in their experiments. My efforts will hopefully minimize some of the current concerns about off-target effect of CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13880], "author_name_tesi": "Minkenberg, Bastian ", "last_name_ssi": "Minkenberg", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bastian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yinong Yang", "Yinong Yang", "David R.

Task-prioritization is especially challenging in an environment consisting of unexpected changes in relative priority between various sub-tasks and workload.

Based on this hypothesis, the overall objectives of my dissertation are to: (1) track physical relationships between microbial cells, biofilms, and minerals with depth of regolith using confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM); (2) evaluate microbial community composition in deep saprolite with one RNA-based and six DNA-based clone libraries; (3) enrich for Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria from deep saprolite and saprock; (4) identify secondary minerals associated with microbial cells in deep regolith using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD); and (5) propose an explanation for biologically mediated mineral formation based on dielectric constant relationships. \nGuaba Ridge in the Rio Icacos watershed is dominated by a 5-8 m layer of saprolite, which is defined as bedrock isovolumetrically weathered in place. The base of the regolith consists of a thin layer of hand-friable, spheroidally weathered material referred to as saprock. At a ridgetop location, two series of saprolite and saprock samples were collected 1 m apart by hand augering until the point of refusal (ca. 5 m) and pounding a cylinder into saprock at the base of each borehole. Microbial cells in saprolite samples were examined by CSLM after staining with BacLight\u00ae viable stain to track associations between cells and three classes of minerals: quartz, biotite, or unidentified opaque minerals. Percent coverage of mineral surfaces by viable and nonviable cells was higher in deeper samples compared to shallower saprolite. Viable cells were consistently located on biotite grains, opaque coatings, and unidentified opaque mineral grains. Uncoated surfaces of transparent quartz particles were virtually devoid of cells throughout the regolith. Microbial community DNA was also extracted from 4.5, 4.7, and 4.9-m deep saprolite/saprock samples from each borehole for construction of six 16S rRNA clone libraries. Clone libraries revealed high bacterial diversity, with 13 bacterial (sub)divisions represented among the total sequence dataset. Representatives of Gammaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Firmicutes were detected in all six clone libraries. Archaeal rRNA sequences were not detected. A few sequences were closely related to bacterial species known or potential Fe(II)-oxidizing capabilities, included Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (99% BLAST identity) and Leptothrix spp. (98% BLAST identity). Clone library results thus provided support for presence of microorganisms that could oxidize Fe(II) during quartz diorite weathering. Three enrichment approaches were applied in an attempt to culture Fe(II) oxidizers from saprolite and saprock samples: an Fe(II)/O2 gradient medium; bilayer plates; and static minireactors. Planktonic cell densities in minireactors declined tenfold in the first five days but remained constant through 45 days. This suggested a persistence of a fraction of the native communities. After 100 days of incubation, DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA clone libraries were constructed from liquid and mineral samples of the minireactor with the thickest iron oxide coatings. Most sequences in these clone libraries had highest DNA similarity to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in the Gammaproteobacteria. Dominance of S. maltophilia sequences in minireactor clone libraries agreed with high frequencies of these sequences in initial libraries derived from directly extracted DNA and sequences cloned subsequentaly from RNA from saprolite. Although culturing and enrichment methods failed to recover Fe(II)-oxidizing organisms, clone library results point to the importance of S. maltophilia in saprolite and saprock. Samples of saprock and deep saprolite were examined by environmental scanning electron microscopy to investigate microbe-mineral associations at the submicron scale. In ESEM images, mineral nanotubes were observed to occur frequently in association with coccus- and rod-shaped structures resembling bacteria. These nanotubes (width 50-140 nm and lengths 150-2700 nm) were identified as halloysite using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Observations of multiple nanotubes on an individual cell surface suggested that external functional groups may interact with Si in pore water to facilitate halloysite nucleation on bacterial cell envelopes. One mechanism for facilitated mineral nucleation could be a lower dielectric constant for water near the cell surface, which would increase tendency of Si to adsorb to the cell. \nThe studies described in this dissertation provide evidence for two mechanisms by which bacterial contribute to rapid weathering of quartz diorite minerals in this regolith.  The first mechanism is enhanced mineral dissolution resulting from microbial Fe(II)-oxidizing activity, and the second is the enhanced nucleation and formation of secondary minerals. Overall, the microbe-mineral associations and clone library sequence assignments suggested that microbes play a role in mineral weathering in the Guaba ridge quartz diorite. Microbes at this site are most likely impacting cycling of the electron donor Fe(II) and also the element Si used to study rock weathering rates.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4219], "author_name_tesi": "Minyard, Morgan Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Minyard", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Morgan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Susan Louise Brantley", "Carmen Enid Martinez", "Sridhar Komarneni", "John Earl Watson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maryann Victoria Bruns, Dissertation Advisor", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Chair", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Member", "Carmen Enid Martinez, Committee Member", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member", "John Earl Watson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["iron-oxidizing bacteria", "halloysite", "microorganisms", "saprolite", "Quartz diorite", "biogeochemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Stochastic Perturbation Methods for Robust Optimization of Simulation Experiments\n", "id": "8246", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "583", "abstract_tesi": "Stochastic perturbation methods can be applied to problems for which either the objective function is represented analytically, or the objective function is the result of a simulation experiment.

Open surgical approaches were compared to MIS approaches.  A subgroup analysis was performed comparing robotic and laparoscopic approaches.\n\nResults: Of the 9,047 patients evaluated, surgical approach was open in 7,511 (83%), laparoscopic in 992 (11%), and robotic in 131 (1%). The laparoscopic and robotic conversion rate to open was 28% (N=387) and 17% (N=26), respectively.  Compared to open, MIS was associated with more distal resections (13.5%, 24.3%, respectively, p <0.0001), shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) (11.3 days; 9.5 days, respectively, p < 0.0001), more margin-negative resections (75%, 79%, p=0.038) and quicker time to initiation of chemotherapy (TTC) (59.1 days; 56.3 days, respectively, p = 0.0316). There was no difference in number of lymph nodes obtained based on surgical approach (p=0.5385).  When stratified by type of resection, MIS offered significantly shorter LOS across head, distal, and total resections. Multivariable analysis suggested there was no significant survival benefit for any MIS approach relative to open (all, p>0.05). When adjusted for patient, disease, and treatment characteristics, TTC was not independently associated with survival (HR 1.09, p=0.084)\n\nConclusion:  MIS appears to offer comparable surgical oncologic benefit with improved LOS and shorter TTC.

Yet lower herbicide-input systems rely more heavily on cultural controls that can differ in their ability to increase soil organic carbon, a goal that is frequently highlighted by organic and reduced pesticide producers. Reduction in tillage and an increase in cover crop use are both highlighted as practices that increase soil carbon. Therefore, a series of studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of low herbicide weed management practices that vary in cover cropping practices and soil disturbance frequency. The approach involved: 1) using soil disturbance and cover crop residue management to rapidly deplete weed seedbanks in high disturbance organic and low herbicide input systems; and 2) using novel cover crop residue management strategies to reduce or eliminate herbicides in no-tillage cropping systems.\n\nField experiments were initiated to quantify the influence of five cover crop systems on weed seedbank flux across a range of initial weed seedbank densities. The influence of soil disturbance and cover cropping on the germinable weed seedbank of common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti L.), and foxtail spp. (Setaria spp.) was assessed. Cover crop systems ranged from a control treatment (summer fallow) that included tillage approximately every 30 days during the summer, to an oat (Avena sativa L.)/red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) cover crop mowed periodically to prevent weed seed production. Field studies were conducted in both Pennsylvania and Maine. Soil disturbance associated with cover cropping resulted in weed seed germination and establishment thereby reducing the density of germinable seed in the weed seedbank. Of the five systems studied, the summer fallow (SF) and yellow mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern.)/buckwheat (Fagopyrum sagittatum Gilib.)/winter canola (Brassica napus L.) (B-BW-B) cover crop consistently decreased seedbanks of a diverse weed community. A quality of both systems is late season disturbance that preempts weed seed rain. If weeds are permitted to reach reproductive maturity in cash or cover crops, the \u201cdebits\u201d to the seedbank resulting from early season disturbance will likely be overwhelmed. The magnitude of decline in these high disturbance systems reached complete depletion of the germinable seedbank for foxtail spp., 85% depletion of common lambsquarters, and 80% for velvetleaf. Additionally, the effect of initial weed infestation levels on the efficacy of weed management was tested. Seedbank decline was a positively related (linearly) to initial seedbank density. The slope of that relationship was smallest for the SF and B-BW-B, meaning those treatments provided the greatest level of weed suppression. \n\nNested within the SF and B-BW-B cover crop systems from the cover crop systems experiment, and within a separate component study, the influence of soil disturbance and green manuring frequency on giant foxtail (Setaria faberi) and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) seed persistence, cumulative emergence, and mortality (fatal germination and seed death) was determined. In early spring of 2005 and 2006, after-ripened weed seed buried in the previous fall and exhumed, were either: 1) kept in mesh bags and buried in field receiving a high frequency of soil tillage that varied in green manure additions (mesh bag experiment), or 2) removed from the mesh bags and placed into wire mesh cages buried flush with the soil surface (seed cage experiment). Seed cage treatments reflected a gradient of soil tillage frequency and green manuring. Over a one year incubation period, the magnitude of decline for velvetleaf and giant foxtail was 72 and 80% in 2004, and 47 and 87% in 2005, respectively. Weed seed persistence decreased with tillage for both species. Green manuring did not influence weed seed persistence, however, reductions in giant foxtail cumulative emergence was observed.  However, green manure did not influence weed seed persistence. Giant foxtail mortality was primarily due to fatal germination; whereas other factors appear to influence velvetleaf seed death.\n\nThe second area of research tested the efficacy of mechanical control of cereal rye (Secale cereale) cover crop cultivars using a mechanical crimping apparatus (roller/crimper) across a range of planting and termination dates. Biomass accumulation and subsequent weed suppression were quantified. To increase grower adoption of cereal rye covers, a thermal-based phenological model using growing degree days (GDD) to predict cereal rye development was developed. A Julian date-based analysis of cover crop control identified differences between the two cultivars; however, when based on the Zadoks growth stage, they responded similarly to rolling/crimping. Whereas cultivar growth rates differ, the growth stage at which optimal suppression was achieved was remarkably consistent over years and sites. A thermal-based phenological model separating the effects of heat units accumulated in the fall (FallGDD) from those accumulated in the spring (SpringGDD) best predicted the phenological development of cereal rye growth stage and biomass accumulation. Cover crop biomass increased approximately 2000 kg ha-1 from earliest to latest summer and fall planting dates (August 25-Octorber 15) and for each 10-day incremental delay in spring termination date (May 1-June 1). Delay in cover crop termination had the greatest reduction in weed density; early and late emerging summer annuals were both suppressed when cover crop termination date was delayed. Yellow nutsedge was not influenced by cover crop type or the timing of cover crop management. Identifying susceptible growth stages for mechanical control coupled with simple thermal-based phenological models that predict cereal rye development provides a useful decision support framework for farmers interested in such practices. We speculate that the degree of synchrony between weed species emergence periodicity and cover crop biomass accumulation played an important role in defining the extent of weed suppression.\n\nThe body of this work provides compelling evidence that cover crops can be used effectively to suppress weedy plant populations in no-till cash crops. Adoption of such practices will be aided by information provided here on the timeliness of establishment and termination of cover crops. This research underscores that species composition changes will result from such management selecting against small seeded weeds, while leaving larger seeded broadleaves and perennial weeds less affected. Such changes in population dynamics can be offset by changes in the sequence of crops to crop phases with increasing frequency of tillage and cover cropping. Another benefit of coupling rotational tillage practices with cover crop-based management is that negative effects of tillage may be offset by incorporation of 3000 kg ha-1 of cover crop biomass in the crop phases with soil disturbance.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5513], "author_name_tesi": "Mirsky, Steven Brian", "last_name_ssi": "Mirsky", "middle_name_ssi": "Brian", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Curran", "David A Mortensen", "Robert Paul Gallagher Iii", "Mary Ellen Barbercheck", "Katriona Shea"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Curran, Committee Chair", "David A Mortensen, Committee Chair", "Robert Paul Gallagher Iii, Committee Member", "Mary Ellen Barbercheck, Committee Member", "Katriona Shea, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cover crops", "population dynamics", "weed seedbanks", "no till", "sustainable agriculture"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "On Analysis of Discrete-time Piecewise Affine Systems", "id": "18934", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8725", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Piecewise affine systems play an important role in tractable modeling of general nonlinear systems. A piecewise affine system models a nonlinear system as a finite number of affine subsystems that describe possible continuous dynamics, and of a discrete logic that determines which subsystem is active at each instant of time. These subsystems are linearizations of the nonlinear system about different operating points.\nThis dissertation is concerned with stability and relative stability analysis of discrete-time piecewise affine systems. Common and multiple Lyapunov functions approaches are the usual approaches for the analysis of piecewise affine systems. However, these approaches only provide sufficient conditions for the analysis and they are inherently conservative, in the sense that if they fail, they do not provide alternative options to solve the analysis problem for piecewise affine systems.\nTo tackle the stability and performance analysis problem for piecewise affine systems in the presence of bounded additive disturbances we present a novel method by bridging two approaches: the symbolic model\u2013based and the Lyapunov function\u2013based approaches. By the former approach, we construct a nested se- quence of finite-state symbolic models, each of which abstracts the original piece- wise affine system. By the latter approach, we provide stability and relative stabil- ity analysis conditions for the obtained symbolic models. The presented approach addresses the limitations of existing results and provides a scalable solution; one can obtain a larger stability region or smaller performance bound by analyzing the stability and performance using a tighter abstraction of the piecewise affine system.\nMore precisely, we show that if a symbolic model turns out to be equivalent to the piecewise affine system, then solving an increasing but yet finite number of linear matrix inequalities yields exact analysis. In addition, we characterize a class of piecewise affine systems for which a finite-state symbolic model within the sequence of symbolic models is guaranteed to be equivalent to the piecewise affine system.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8588], "author_name_tesi": "Mirzazad-barijough, Sanam ", "last_name_ssi": "Mirzazad-barijough", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sanam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano", "Qian Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Dissertation Advisor", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano, Committee Member", "Qian Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hybrid systems", "linear matrix inequalities", "Lyapunov functions", "semidefinite programs", "simulation", "bisimulation", "invariant sets"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "CARBON AND HYDROGEN ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF METHANE OVER THE LAST 1000 YEARS\n", "id": "9284", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2535", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "New measurements of the carbon and hydrogen isotopic ratios of methane (&#948;13C of CH4 and &#948;D of CH4) over the last millennium are presented from the WAIS Divide, Antarctica ice core (WDC05A), showing significant\f changes that likely were influenced by humans even before the industrial revolution.

The first experiment examined weed suppression from a rolled cereal rye cover crop compared to no cover crop with and without post emergence weed control in no-till soybean, the rye was terminated at two different dates (early and late) and the study was conducted at two different locations (Rock Springs and Landisville) in PA. The results showed that a rye cover helped suppress weeds, and achieved acceptable weed control without post emergence herbicide. The added cost of a rye cover crop was $127.71 ha-1 or $74.36 ha-1 if a post emergence herbicide application could be avoided. In this study, weed control alone did not justify the use of a cover crop managed with a roller/crimper but with an increase in yield the system can be affordable. \n The second field experiment was conducted at three locations in Pennsylvania and examined rolling/crimping hairy vetch in no-till corn. Hairy vetch was planted in late August and was rolled and planted to corn at four different dates between the end of May and the middle of June. At one location, the corn was managed organically and at two of three locations, no cover crop and herbicide controlled plots were included for comparison.  The results showed that hairy vetch control with the roller/crimper varied through the flowering stage, but was consistent once pods began to develop. The hairy vetch cover crop reduced total weed biomass dramatically compared to no cover plots. Overall, results showed that it is possible to control cover crops with a roller/crimper and manage cover crops in organic or reduced input systems. However, later planting dates and appropriate no-till planting equipment are necessary to achieve successful cover crop control, cash crop population and yield. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5076], "author_name_tesi": "Mischler, Ruth ", "last_name_ssi": "Mischler", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ruth", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sjoerd Willem Duiker", "Sjoerd Willem Duiker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sjoerd Willem Duiker, Thesis Advisor", "Sjoerd Willem Duiker, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["rye", "no-till", "cover crops", "roller/crimper", "reduced input systems", "hairy vetch", "weed suppression", "residue management"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "How do schools and teachers mediate the influence of state testing policies on arts education?

While quantitative studies have explored the impact of testing on the arts (von Zastrow, 2004; Center on Education Policy, 2006), there is a lack of qualitative research in this area.\n\tIn this dissertation, I address three questions: 1) How are visual arts teachers in four elementary schools, two that have a strong focus on the arts and two that do not, across a range of poverty levels, responding to Virginia\u2019s high-stakes Standards of Learning (SOL) exams? 2) Are visual arts teachers\u2019 responses to these high-stakes exams consistent or incongruous with principals\u2019 views of the tests\u2019 impacts on instruction, resources, and classroom assessment? 3) If the views and practices of both visual arts teachers and principals are consistent in their positive outlook towards the SOL exams, what principal and teacher practices allow schools to maintain their arts instruction? To answer these questions, I interviewed and observed visual arts specialists at the four schools, and also interviewed principals, classroom teachers, and district personnel. Interviews and observations were analyzed with the help of N6\u00ae qualitative software.\n\tFindings yielded a mixed picture. Strong district support of the arts, strong arts missions at arts-focused schools, a belief in the efficacy of the arts at non-arts-focused schools, and a willingness among specialists to connect art lessons with tested content led to a general lack of negative testing influence on the visual arts specialists\u2019 practice. However, art as practiced by classroom teachers had been either reduced or highly modified to serve the tested areas, and communication between specialists and classroom teachers was constrained by common classroom teacher planning time. Thus, this study provides confirming and disconfirming evidence for testing policy theory, depending on where one looks in the school. This supports the idea of the uneven implementation of reform (Tyack & Cuban, 1995). Future studies on testing policy impact should examine these intra-school differences.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2736], "author_name_tesi": "Mishook, Jacob Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Mishook", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Jacob", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mindy L Kornhaber", "David Alexander Gamson", "Hoi Kin Suen", "Dr Christine Thompson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mindy L Kornhaber, Committee Chair", "David Alexander Gamson, Committee Member", "Hoi Kin Suen, Committee Member", "Dr Christine Thompson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["school reform", "assessment", "arts education", "NCLB"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Design and Analysis of Heterogeneous Networks for Chip-Multiprocessors", "id": "11995", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "191", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Rarely has there been as challenging and exciting a time for research in computer architecture as now. While, the proverbial Moore\u2019s law has consistently helped architects integrate more and more silicon transistors in a single die, device constraints of power, heat, and reliability has forced the computer industry to shift focus from single processor core performance to instantiating multiple processor cores on a chip. In this quest for integrating a large number of cores on a single chip, one particular area of computer architecture that has come into prominence is the interconnection network on a chip (also called network-on-chip or NoC). NoCs seek to provide a scalable, energy-efficient and high-bandwidth communication substrate for future multi-core and many-core architectures - an aspect that critically dictates future chip designs. \n\nMost of the prior research in NoC has focussed on optimizing the NoC considering it as a homogeneous system i.e. all optimizations proposed, equally affect all the components in the NoC substrate. However, this dissertation demonstrates that the resources in the NoC (precisely, buffers and links) are not always equally utilized, and that not all applications demand similar resources from the underlying interconnection substrate. Hence, this dissertation argues that better and smarter NoCs can be architected by considering the inherent heterogeneity in NoCs from both the network architecture perspective and from the applications\u2019 perspective. Further, considering the fact that future multicores and systems-on-chip architectures will have heterogeneous cores and compute engines, and host diverse applications, it is also inevitable that not all components will demand similar responses from the NoC and neither will these compute engines stress the NoC uniformly. Thus, it is compelling to think of heterogeneous NoCs for such heterogeneous systems. To this end, this dissertation argues in favor of NoCs that factor heterogeneity as a first-order design objective while architecting them for future multi-core systems.\n\nIn this pursuit, this dissertation investigates micro-architectural techniques that exploit heterogeneity at the network resource consumption level (following a bottom-up approach) and from applications\u2019 demand/requirement perspective (following a top-down approach). With the bottom-up approach, heterogeneity is exploited with the key observation that not all resources in an NoC are equally utilized when employing a typical network topology and a network routing protocol. With the top-down approach, heterogeneity is exploited starting from the applications\u2019 demand perspective with the key observation that not all applications require similar resources from the underlying network substrate. Based on these two approaches, this dissertation proposes four techniques with the overall goal of designing high-performance and energy-efficient NoCs. \nThe first scheme, called Router Architecture with Frequency Tuning (RAFT), exploits heterogeneity in the buffers of the on-chip routers and proposes a variable frequency scheme to operate them. This design is the first of its kind to propose a distributed congestion management scheme that is based on operating individual routers at different frequency levels. The second scheme, called HeteroNoC, targets non-uniformity in both buffers and links in the on-chip networks. Using the same amount of link resources and fewer buffer resources compared to a homogeneous network, this proposal demonstrates that a carefully designed heterogeneous network can reduce average latency, improve network throughput and reduce power. The third scheme, argues in favor of designing on-chip networks by taking into account the intrinsic communication requirements of applications. This proposal is based on the observation that, in general, applications can be classified as either network bandwidth sensitive or latency sensitive. Based on this, the proposal consists of two separate heterogeneous networks in the on-chip interconnection substrate, where one network is tailored to optimize for bandwidth sensitive applications and the second network for latency sensitive applications. The fourth scheme presented in this dissertation targets heterogeneity in device technology for improving the memory subsystem performance of multi-cores. This scheme leverages the advantages of an emerging memory technology that is based on spintronics, called spin torque transfer RAM (STT-RAM), for memory subsystem design. STT-RAM can be heterogeneously integrated onto silicon and this proposal argues in favor of designing the NoC in a way that is cognizant of the presence of STT-RAM cache banks.\n\nThis dissertation investigates each of the above proposals at depth and shows that the proposed schemes have minimal overheads in terms of area and power, are simple to implement, and show significant benefits with real applications. Overall, this dissertation makes a strong case for designing heterogeneous networks for improving the performance-power envelope of future multicore processors.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [190], "author_name_tesi": "Mishra, Asit Kumar", "last_name_ssi": "Mishra", "middle_name_ssi": "Kumar", "first_name_ssi": "Asit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das", "Chitaranjan Das", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "Onur Mutlu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das, Dissertation Advisor", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Chair", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Member", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member", "Onur Mutlu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["NoC", "network-on-chip", "router", "heterogeneous NoC", "heterogeneous networks", "multicore", "CMP", "STT-RAM"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PREDICTIVE MODELING OF INACTIVATION, INJURY, AND RECOVERY OF LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENES UNDER COMBINED EFFECT OF HIGH PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE", "id": "11583", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4739", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Milk and dairy products are a rich source of macronutrients, proteins, fats and carbohydrates; they are a very important source of calcium and riboflavin and provide significant amounts of most other essential nutrients. The U.S. and many other countries are supplied with billions of pounds of dairy products each year by 65,000 working dairy farms in the U.S. Therefore, the dairy industry plays a vital role in the U.S. economy. The annual milk production in the year 2000 was 167.7 billion pounds which is worth more than $20 billion (IDFA, 2001). During processing of milk and dairy products, often times, microbial contaminations occur due to improper cleaning and handling of the processing equipment leading to several outbreaks. Among the several pathogenic microorganisms Listeria monocytogenes is one which is a potential threat to milk and dairy product because of its ability to grow at refrigeration temperatures.High pressure processing (HPP) is gaining popularity among the nonthermal food processing technologies as it can maintain the freshness of the food products after the treatment. HPP can inactivate microorganisms in the pressure range of 500-700 MPa, extending the shelf-life of the treated food material. L. monocytogenes shows resistance to pressure when present in milk medium. Therefore, it is important to study and characterize the resistance of L. monocytogenes in milk under combined effects of high pressure and temperature.\nPredictive modeling is an important tool for quantitative determination of the growth and inactivation of microorganisms under specific environmental conditions. At present, only a few predictive models related to inactivation kinetics of L. monocytogenes under the combined effects of temperature and pressure are known. Moreover, very limited work has been done on injury and recovery of microorganisms after heat and pressure treatment. Therefore, the overall goal of the study was to evaluate the inactivation, injury, and recovery of L. monocytogenes and to develop an overall predictive model for injury and recovery of L. monocytogenes under the combined effect of temperature and pressure.In the current study, three pressure levels (400, 500, and 600 MPa) and three temperature levels (27, 43, and 60\u00a2XC) were chosen. The treatment time at 60\u201eaC for pressure levels of 500 and 600 MPa was of very short duration, i.e., in the order of seconds, which was beyond the accuracy and precision level control of the HPP system. So, in total seven treatment conditions were performed for evaluating the inactivation and injury of L. monocytogenes in UHT whole milk immediately after the treatment. For each combination, six treatment times (pressure hold time is used to designate the treatment time) were chosen. Following each treatment, cell counts were obtained on nonselective (TSAYE) and selective (MOX) media to determine the healthy plus injured and only healthy cells, respectively. The inactivation of the microorganism was evaluated in terms of the log reduction values. Plating the milk samples on selective and nonselective media revealed that high treatment temperature promoted the inactivation of L. monocytogenes. For instance, on TSAYE media at 400 MPa and 60\u00a2XC, 6 log10 reduction was obtained in 100 sec; whereas, at 43\u00a2XC and 27\u00a2XC the maximum reduction obtained was 4.17 and 2.59 log10 at treatment times of 18 and 30 min, respectively. At a constant treatment temperature the effect of increasing the pressure was also evident. For example, on TSAYE media at 43\u00a2XC, approximately 4 log10 reduction was obtained for 400 MPa and 18 min treatment time; whereas, the same log reduction was obtained at 500 and 600 MPa for treatment time of 3 min and 40 sec, respectively. As the treatment times for the seven combinations of pressure and temperature were different, the effectiveness of the treatments was evaluated by comparing the D-values of all the combinations by Tukey\u00a1\u00a6s pairwise comparison. Tukey\u00a1\u00a6s pairwise comparison on both media showed that the D-values of treatment condition 400 MPa, 27\u00a2XC and 400 MPa, 43\u00a2XC were significantly different from each other (p < 0.05) and from the rest of the five pressure and temperature combinations. Furthermore, the remaining five combinations were not significantly different from each other (p > 0.05). To determine the effect of plating media for a particular combination of pressure and temperature, the D-values obtained for both the media were also compared by Tukey\u00a1\u00a6s pairwise comparison. The comparisons showed that for 400 MPa, 27\u00a2XC and 600 MPa, 27\u00a2XC there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the D-values of both the media; whereas, for rest of the five combinations the D-values were significantly different (p < 0.05).Mathematical representations for log reduction vs. time were obtained for both TSAYE and MOX media using the conventional two-parameter Weibull model. The R2 values obtained for TSAYE and MOX media were from 0.96 to 0.99 showing the two- parameter Weibull model was the best fit. However, it was found that the value of the parameter \u00a3 (i.e., characteristic time) did not satisfy the physical interpretation. So Weibull model, with \u00a3 predetermined, was then fitted to the log reduction values obtained on the TSAYE and MOX media. Predetermining the \u00a3 value from expereimental data reduced the two-parameter Weibull model to one-parameter model. Additionally, by following this approach a trend for parameters \u00a3 and \u00a3] was found for the first time for all the treatment conditions. Although, the one-parameter Weibull model represented the correct interpretation of \u00a3, the R2 value of the predicted curve decreased (range was from 0.81 to 0.97 for TSAYE media and 0.82 to 0.95 for MOX media). So a four-parameter Weibull model with two characteristics times (\u00a3) and two curvatures (\u00a3]) were fitted to the log reduction values which improved the R2 values (range was from 0.95 to 0.99 for both TSAYE and MOX media) of the predicted curve.The log reduction of injured cells was calculated at seven combinations of pressure and temperature by using the log reduction values obtained on the nonselective TSAYE) and selective (MOX) media. Like inactivation, the effect of pressure and temperature was also evident on log reduction of injured population. For instance, the maximum reduction of injured cells at 400 MPa and the three temperatures 27, 43, and 60\u00a2XC were 2.72, 4.18, and 4.58 log10 for treatment times of 30, 18, and 1 min, respectively. This clearly shows the effect of temperature. Similarly, at 27\u00a2XC the maximum reduction of injured cells obtained at three pressure levels of 400, 500, and 600 MPa were 2.72, 5.14, and 5.52 log10 for treatment time 30, 6, and 2 min, respectively. The predicted injury curve was established by taking the difference between the Weibull model developed for the log reduction vs. time for the TSAYE and MOX media. Predicting the injury curve from the one-parameter Weibull model resulted in decreased R2 values (range was from -1.69 to 90) compared to the two-parameter (range was from 0.77 to 0.99) Weibull model including negative R2 value. This problem was overcome by predicting the injury curve using the four-parameter Weibull model (range of R2 values was from 0.66 to 0.95).Micro-differential scanning calorimetry (mDSC) study of UHT whole milk, inoculated UHT whole milk, and high pressure and temperature-treated inoculated UHT whole milk samples were done using a VP-DSC MicroCalorimeter. The purpose of the study was to determine if mDSC results can sufficiently differentiate between the untreated inoculated and treated inoculated whole milk samples with respect to the amount of cellular proteins content. Since sufficient differentiation between the inoculated untreated and inoculated treated UHT milk was not observed, mechanistic features could not be incorporated into the combined predictive model for injury and recovery.With the purpose of developing a combined model for injury and recovery following the high pressure and temperature treatment one combination of pressure and temperature was chosen, i.e., 400 MPa, 60\u201eaC and 50 sec, which was also considered for the mDSC study. After the treatment, milk samples were kept for 30 days at 4\u201eaC and plated at 2-day intervals on TSAYE and MOX media to evaluate injury and recovery. However, upon analysis it was found that complete recovery occurred between day 6th and 8th. Hence the predictive model was developed by taking the data upto day 6th. The different terms of the predictive model are Nt* (population of microorganisms on TSAYE plate after time t following the HPP treatment), It* (population of injured microorganisms after time t following the HPP treatment), Gt (population of microorganisms on growth curve at time t (initial inoculum of the growth curve = H0*; H0*, being the population of microorganisms on MOX plate immediately after the HPP treatment), Rt (population of recovered microorganisms after time t following the HPP treatment). The observed data for each term was described by a mathematical model and used for validation of the predictive model. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study on the development of a combined predictive model for bacterial injury and recovery under high pressure and temperature conditions. The predictive model enables the determination of the population of total, healthy, injured, and recovered cells at any time during the storage of milk product at 4\u00a2XC following HPP treatment. In addition, this model can also help to estimate the product shelf-life and assess risk due to the recovery of the pathogenic microorganisms during the storage period. The procedure for development of this model is expected to be helpful in advancement of the field of predictive microbiology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4704], "author_name_tesi": "Mishra, Niharika ", "last_name_ssi": "Mishra", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Niharika", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Virendra Puri", "Virendra Puri", "Ali Demirci", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "Stephen John Knabel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Virendra Puri, Dissertation Advisor", "Virendra Puri, Committee Chair", "Ali Demirci, Committee Member", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Committee Member", "Stephen John Knabel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Predictive Modeling", "High pessure and temperature", "Listeria monocytogenes", "Inactivation", "Injury", "Recovery"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "TAILORING WELD GEOMETRY AND COMPOSITION IN FUSION WELDING THROUGH CONVECTIVE MASS TRANSFER CALCULATIONS", "id": "6928", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5845", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fusion welding is characterized by various complex physical processes where the heat source interacts with the material leading to rapid heating, formation of the weld pool, vigorous circulation of the liquid material in the pool, heat transfer in the entire weldment, and solidification of the molten material. All these physical processes have a profound impact on the mass transport in the weldment. Mass transport during fusion welding has a significant impact on various weld features like the weld pool geometry and the creation of weld defects like liquation cracking. For example, surface active elements like sulfur alter the fluid convection pattern in the weld pool, and lead to a high depth to width ratio under favorable welding conditions. Furthermore, the fluid convection pattern becomes very complex when two plates with different amounts of surface active elements such as sulfur are welded together. Similarly, during gas metal arc (GMA) welding of aluminum copper alloys, the amount of solute (copper) in the solidifying weld metal is a key factor in determining the susceptibility of the weld to liquation cracking. In the past two decades, numerical transport phenomena based models have provided useful information about the thermal cycles and weld pool geometry. However, no effort has been made to apply these concepts to design weld consumables, to study the weld bead shape on welding two plates with different sulfur contents and to tailor weld pool geometry to specified dimensions. The present research focuses on these unexplored areas. The research proposed here seeks to develop a quantitative understanding of mass transport during fusion welding, with special emphasis on the role of surface active elements and the effect of solute distribution on weld defects like liquation cracking. A comprehensive model, incorporating numerical three-dimensional calculations of temperature and velocity fields and solute distribution in the weld pool is developed for the proposed quantitative study. \n\nThe currently available numerical transport phenomena based models are faced with some major difficulties including lack of reliability of output and limited utility because of the ability to go only in the forward direction. The output of these models is not generally reliable because of the presence of some uncertain input parameters such as arc efficiency. Furthermore, these models cannot go backwards, i.e., calculate multiple combinations of welding process variables such as current, voltage and welding speed to obtain a target weld attribute such as weld pool geometry. Also, these models are complex, require specialized training to develop and test, and consume a large amount of computer time to run. These shortcomings of the numerical transport phenomena based models are addressed in the present thesis research. New methodologies are developed in the present study where the reliability of output of the numerical transport phenomena based model is enhanced by developing a computational procedure, where the uncertain input parameters of the model are optimized by combining it with a genetic algorithm optimization model and limited volume of experimental data. The resulting numerical model providing more reliable output is validated by comparing its predictions of weld pool geometry with the corresponding experimental results. In order to reduce the computation time a neural network, trained by data generated from the numerical transport phenomena based model, is developed in the present study. Next, the neural network is combined with a genetic algorithm to go backwards, i.e., find multiple combinations of welding variables to obtain a target weld geometry. Finally, this model is applied to study solute distribution in the weld pool when joining two steel plates with different sulfur contents, and to determine the copper content of the solidifying weld metal in aluminum-copper alloys welded with different copper containing filler metals. The study identifies the factors that affect the weld pool geometry on joining two plates with different sulfur contents, and predicts the susceptibility of an aluminum-copper alloy GMA weld to liquation cracking.\n\nThe specific contributions of the present thesis research include (i) development of a numerical solute transport model for fusion welding; (ii) improving the reliability of output of the numerical model; (iii) achieving computational efficiency and economy by developing a neural network trained by data generated by the numerical model; (iv) creating a bi-directional methodology where a target weld attribute like weld pool geometry can be attained via multiple combinations of input process parameters like arc current, voltage and welding speed; (v) calculating sulfur distribution during gas tungsten arc welding of stainless steel plates with different sulfur contents and predicting the resulting weld pool geometry; and (vi) calculating copper distribution during gas metal arc welding of aluminum-copper alloys by incorporating the heat and mass addition from filler metal and a non-equilibrium solidification model, and using the copper content of the mushy zone to predict the occurrence of liquation cracking.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5842], "author_name_tesi": "Mishra, Saurabh ", "last_name_ssi": "Mishra", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Saurabh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tarasankar Debroy", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare", "Long Qing Chen", "Judith Todd Copley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tarasankar Debroy, Committee Chair", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Judith Todd Copley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Neural Network", "Genetic Algorithm", "Mass Transfer in Welding", "Liquation Cracking", "Effect of Sulfur"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Integrative genome-wide studies to elucidate regulation of lineage choice in hematopoiesis ", "id": "21426", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9644", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Regulation of gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes allows their cells to express heterogeneous transcriptomes despite possessing the same genome, thus resulting in tissue-specific gene expression, which in turn drives cellular differentiation. Hematopoiesis in mouse is an ideal system in which to study specification of cell fate and cellular differentiation after lineage commitment. Differential gene expression drives lineage commitment and maturation during differentiation, but few studies have addressed changes in gene expression genome-wide across these processes. Much is known about the transcriptome landscape of differentiated erythroblasts and megakaryocytes; however, the transcriptome of the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor is relatively unexplored. Till date, comparative transcriptome studies elucidating the alteration in transcriptional output between bipotential progenitors and differentiated, monopotent erythroblasts and megakaryocytes have not been performed. Additionally, even though these sister lineages are regulated by a common set of well-studied transcription factors, it is still unclear as to how these factors exert lineage-specific actions. \nI have examined changes in the transcriptome during the commitment of the bipotential megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor into its daughter lineages to infer models of how these changes drive commitment to either of two radically distinct lineage outcomes. I used RNA-seq to map the transcriptome of the bipotential megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP) prior to commitment to its two daughter lineages and also the transcriptomes of maturing erythroblasts (ERY) and megakaryocytes (MEG) after commitment. Comparison of these transcriptome maps revealed that MEPs already express much of the MEG program while continuing to express genes associated parallel myeloid lineages such as granulocytes. In contrast, greater numbers of genes are induced in ERY than MEG, along with repression of pan-hematopoietic genes and genes involved in proliferation, signaling, and cell growth. These results suggest a model of broad expression of genes in MEPs that are both a memory of previous myeloid potential and permissive for MEG differentiation, while active induction and repression are needed to execute the erythroid program. This model is supported by genome-wide maps of transcription factor (TF) occupancy. Genes specifically expressed in MEG were preferentially occupied by TFs in early, multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and continue to maintain occupancy post-commitment, whereas erythroid genes were primarily occupied in committed erythroid cells. These results suggest that the default commitment outcome for MEP is MEG, and commitment to ERY requires a radical rewiring of transcription circuitry.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9405], "author_name_tesi": "Mishra, Tejaswini ", "last_name_ssi": "Mishra", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tejaswini", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison", "Michael Axtell", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Robert Paulson", "Debashis Ghosh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Axtell, Committee Member", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Debashis Ghosh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hematopoiesis", "genomics", "gene regulation;RNA-seq;erythroblast;megakaryocyte"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Asymptotic analysis of Ginzburg-landau superconductivity model", "id": "16044", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8026", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The thesis is devoted to variational problems and PDEs related to the Ginzburg-Landau superconductivity theory and consists of two parts.

Such an analysis attempts to underscore how the broadcasters positioned themselves within a Cold War context that explicitly linked the Cuban Revolution to the United States Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, therefore, illustrating how an analysis of alternative media de-centers United States\u2019 national discourses about civil rights struggles. Furthermore, it explores how the concepts of racism, imperialism and socialism were simultaneously integrated and separate on Radio Free Dixie. \u2003", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9159], "author_name_tesi": "Mislan, Cristina ", "last_name_ssi": "Mislan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cristina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Elavsky", "Charles Elavsky", "James Ford Risley", "John Spicer Nichols", "Solsi Del Moral"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Elavsky, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles Elavsky, Committee Chair", "James Ford Risley, Committee Member", "John Spicer Nichols, Committee Member", "Solsi Del Moral, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cuba", "Radio", "Race", "Transnationalism U.S.-Cuba Relations", "Civil Rights Movement", "Black Power Movement"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Cyber Infrastructure for Hard and Soft Data Fusion\n\n\n", "id": "10882", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3599", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multi-sensor Data Fusion; utilizing sensors of various natures and denominations, is gradually finding implementation in many fields from Defense and Security to \u201cHuman Landscape\u201d Evaluation and Environment Impact Assessment.

Such blocks in elongation are widespread in the Drosophila genome. However, the mechanism by which DSIF and NELF participate in setting up the paused polymerase remains unclear. I purified the Drosophila NELF complex and analyzed the interactions between DSIF, NELF, and a reconstituted Pol II elongation complex to gain insight into the mechanism of pausing. Using gel-shift analysis, I observed that DSIF and NELF associate stably with the Pol II elongation complex and a nascent transcript of length greater than 18 nucleotides is required for this association. Protein-RNA crosslinking analysis revealed that Spt5, the largest subunit of DSIF, contacts the nascent transcript as it emerges from the elongation complex, which is contrary to the existing model of promoter-proximal pausing which suggests that NELF contacts the emerging nascent transcript. These results provide a possible model by which DSIF binds the elongation complex via association with the nascent transcript and subsequently recruits NELF. Since phosphorylation of Pol II by P-TEFb is thought to inhibit the association of NELF with the elongation complex and alleviate transcription inhibition, I also analyzed the effect of P-TEFb phosphorylation on the association of NELF and DSIF. My results suggest that phosphorylation by P-TEFb may not be sufficient to dissociate NELF or relieve transcriptional inhibition by DSIF and NELF.

This specific type of thruster relies on an inductive discharge to produce positive ions that are accelerated by an external electric field in order to produce thrust. Analyzing the particle dynamics within the discharge vessel is critical for determining the performance of these thrusters, particularly as scaling down the size and thrust level of ion thrusters remains a ma jor challenge. Until now the \napplication of this type of propulsion system has been limited to large satellites and space platforms. \nThe approach taken in this work was, first, to perform a simple analysis of the inductive discharge using a transformer model. However, the dimensions of the thruster and the pressure ranges at which it operates called for a different approach than those used in larger thrusters and reactors as the collisional domain and non-locality effects differ significantly. After estimating the non-locality effects by calculating the non-locality parameter, a kinetic description of the discharge was \ndeveloped. From the input power, mass flow rate, and the properties of the gas used in the discharge, the density numbers, temperatures of the particles, and thrust are calculated. Simulation values are compared with experimental values obtained with the Miniature Radio-frequency Ion Thruster being developed at The Pennsylvania State University. \nThe approach employed to model this small scale inductive discharge can be summarized as follows. First, conditions of operation and the various plasma parameters of the discharge were derived. Then, a one-dimensional kinetic model \nof an inductive discharge, using a Maxwellian electron distribution, was built. Results from this model were validated on data available in the literature. Finally, from the beam current derived from the 1-D model, using a two-grid ion optic configuration, thrust was calculated. \nIn addition, an existing model of transition between capacitive and inductive modes was applied to the Miniature Radio-frequency Ion Thruster geometry and its electrical properties.

This is of interest for variable twist helicopter rotor blades where the outboard 12-32% of the blade can undergo large quasi-static twist variations for optimal performance over diverse operating conditions.\n\nThe first concept presented in this thesis considers the use of an I-beam spar situated within the blade which acts as both a load bearing member and the actuating mechanism. The twisting of the I-beam spar, in this particular case, is achieved through the application of differential axial loads (Vlasov bimoments). For this concept a design space study was conducted to understand the dependence of the variables on the twisting behavior of two different types of I-beams: Flat flange I-beam and Curved flange I-beam. The design space variables considered were web height, flange width, beam span and beam wall thickness. The study was conducted using Vlasov beam theory and finite element models. Based on the study it was observed that for both types of I-beams, the tip twist increases with an increase in flange width for the same input force. However, the curved flange I-beam was able to produce larger tip twist values for the same input force. Furthermore, it was observed that the beam span has a negligible effect on the tip twist as opposed to a torque actuation, where the tip twist varies linearly with beam span length. However, it was observed that the actuation energy required for the bimoment case was higher than that of the tip torque case. A disparity between the span wise twist distribution results of the finite element models and Vlasov theory was also observed. This disparity was attributed to chord-wise bending associated beam tip effects which increased with incremental flange width values, a phenomenon which is not captured by Vlasov theory.\n\nThe second concept presented in this thesis considers the variable twist actuation of a blade via the forced warping of the skin. In this concept the skin was actuated using a mechanism which was based on the power screw concept. For the concept a prototype blade was built and tested under various external loading conditions to understand its effect on the warp-twist relationship and the required actuation torques for the skin warping. A finite element/analytical coupled model was used to predict the required actuation torques. Based on the experiments it was observed that model was able to predict the required actuation torques well for no external loading condition and moderately for tip bending loads. However, for the case of tip torque loads, the model was unable to properly predict the actuation torque requirements. A majority of the disparities observed were attributed to the approximate modeling methodology of the trailing edge actuator within the finite element model. Overall it was observed that a tip load and tip torque loads have a minimum effect on the warp-twist relationships. However, for the case of tip bending loads the magnitude of the required actuation torques increase proportionally. For the case of the tip torque loads on the other hand, the required actuation torque-warping relationship changes and is biased toward one particular twisting deformation depending on the external loading direction.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4292], "author_name_tesi": "Mistry, Mihir ", "last_name_ssi": "Mistry", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mihir", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi", "Quasi Static Rotor Morphing Concepts For Rotorcraft Performance Improvements"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi, Thesis Advisor", "Quasi Static Rotor Morphing Concepts For Rotorcraft Performance Improvements, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["warp", "aerospace", "helicopters", "Smart Structures", "Variable Twist Rotor", "Smart Rotor Blades", "bimoment"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Quasi-static rotor morphing concepts for rotorcraft performance improvements", "id": "16272", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8282", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current research is focused on two separate quasi-static rotor morphing concepts: Variable span and variable camber. Both concepts were analyzed from the perspective of the performance improvements they allow for, as well as their design requirements. The goal of this body of work is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and implementation challenges of both systems.\n\nFor the case of the variable span rotor concept, the effects on aircraft performance were evaluated for a UH-60A type aircraft. The parametric analysis included the performance effects of the rotor span and rotor speed variation, both individually as well as in combination. The design space considered the effect of three different gross weights (16000 lbs, 18300 lbs and 24000 lbs), for a window of \u00b111% variation of the rotor speed and a range between +17% to \u221216% of radius variation (about the baseline) for a range of altitudes. The results of the analysis showed that variable span rotors by themselves are capable of reducing the power requirement of the helicopter by up to 20% for high altitude and gross weight conditions. However, when combined with rotor speed variation, it was possible to reduce the overall power required by the aircraft by up to 30%.\n\nComplimentary to the performance analysis, an analytical study of actuation concepts for a variable span rotor was also conducted. This study considered the design of two active actuation systems: Hydraulic pistons and threaded rods (jackscrews), and two passive systems which employed the use of an internal spring type restraining device. For all the configurations considered, it was determined that the design requirements could not be satisfied when considering the constraints defined. \n\nThe performance improvements due to a variable camber system were evaluated for a BO-105 type rotor in hover. The design space considered included three different thrust levels (4800 lbs, 5500 lbs and 6400 lbs) for a range of altitudes and seven different camber distribution schemes (with up to 10 degrees of camber). Based on the analysis it was shown that variable camber was capable of reducing power up 18% for high thrust levels at high altitudes. Furthermore, it was found that a linearly distributed camber configuration, wherein the maximum camber was at the root, showed the best power reduction. For an untwisted blade (which would be advantageous in high speed flight), introducing spanwise camber variation would result in hover performance levels comparable to a twisted blade. Furthermore, the power reductions calculated were shown to be the result of a reduction of induced power due to the shift of the blade lift inboard due to the direct lift increase as a result of camber variation.\n\nThe variable camber design presented in the current study exploits the warp-twist relationship of open-section beams. To that effect, a unique actuation structure was developed and implemented in a proof-of-concept variable camber prototype which was built using an existing CH-46E blade section. This prototype was shown to be capable of producing up to 18 degrees of distributed camber with a relatively low input warping of up to 0.18 inches. The results from the specifically developed finite element model of the prototype correlated very well with experimental data. The finite element results indicated the requirement of a shear-deformable core for proper camber deformation in the presence of centrifugal and aerodynamic loads.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8200], "author_name_tesi": "Mistry, Mihir ", "last_name_ssi": "Mistry", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mihir", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Farhan Gandhi", "Dr Farhan Gandhi", "Edward Smith", "Joseph Francis Horn", "Timothy Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Farhan Gandhi, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Farhan Gandhi, Committee Chair", "Edward Smith, Committee Member", "Joseph Francis Horn, Committee Member", "Timothy Miller, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rotorcraft", "rotor", "morphing", "smart structure", "blade", "span", "camber", "RPM", "rotor speed", "variation", "rotating wing", "warping", "twist"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "POSITIVE EMOTIONS IN MATURE ADULTS\u2019 LEISURE TRAVEL EXPERIENCES\n\n", "id": "11103", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4832", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research in positive psychology has shown that positive emotions initiate beneficial processes, culminating in quality of life. Tourism research has suggested that leisure travel is a substantial source of positive emotions. These two areas of research have not connected, however, leaving the processes that foster and follow from positive emotions in the leisure travel context relatively unknown. The purpose of this dissertation is to explain positive emotions associated with leisure travel in terms of their development over time and in terms of the processes that link social contexts to positive emotions. The population studied is mature adults (individuals over the age of 45). Mature adults are an important and lucrative travel market, as well as a population segment that enjoys elevated levels of positive emotions. This dissertation uses a mixed-method approach that combines psychographic and ethnographic perspectives to study the positive emotions of mature adults in two leisure travel experiences. The dissertation is formatted as two article manuscripts. The first manuscript focuses on the processes linking mature adult leisure travelers\u2019 social contexts to positive emotions. Socioemotional selectivity theory is the conceptual foundation. This manuscript takes an interpretive ethnographic method approach, using fieldnotes from participant observation of the two experiences studied as well as conversations with key informants. Findings include four processes: amusement from humor, warmth from friendship, interest in activities, and sublime reactions to loss. These findings reveal the importance of social contexts to positive emotions and suggest that norms among communities of leisure travelers and meaningful, personally relevant activities and interpretations foster emotionally positive leisure travel experiences. The second manuscript focuses on the day-to-day development of positive emotions before, during, and after leisure travel. This manuscript uses a psychometric method perspective, modeling overall positive emotions as well as love, joy, interest, and contentment with mixed-effects linear equations based on the peak model of positive emotion in leisure travel. The peak model suggests that positive emotions increase before leisure travel, remain elevated during, and decline after. Findings were consistent with the peak model for positive emotions overall, joy, and interest. As a whole, the findings of this dissertation carry several theoretical and practical implications. The findings confirm that leisure travel is emotionally positive and contribute to existing knowledge the specific importance of joy, interest, contentment, awe, and amusement. Also, the findings specific to the processes of friendship form a contrast to socioemotional selectivity theory, showing that mature adults engage new friendships as well as established ones. The findings also suggest that in future intervention studies positive psychologists should pursue leisure travel as a context where individuals\u2019 positive emotions may be increased. Finally, the findings suggest that fostering positive emotions before and after leisure travel may further improve the value of leisure travel experiences. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4809], "author_name_tesi": "Mitas, Ondrej ", "last_name_ssi": "Mitas", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ondrej", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Leisure Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Careen M Yarnal", "Careen M Yarnal", "Reginald Adams Jr.", "Dr Harry Zinn", "Garry Chick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Careen M Yarnal, Dissertation Advisor", "Careen M Yarnal, Committee Chair", "Reginald Adams Jr., Committee Member", "Dr Harry Zinn, Committee Member", "Garry Chick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aging", "leisure", "emotions", "group travel", "ethnography", "older adults", "mixed-effects linear growth models", "tourism", "mixed methods"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "RESOLVING COMPETITION IN BILINGUAL STATISTICAL LEARNING PARADIGMS\n", "id": "8359", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "73", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the fundamental issues in bilingual language research has been determining how multiple language representations develop over the course of acquisition.  In an effort to explore this, previous research adapted a traditionally monolingual statistical learning word segmentation task to provide input from two artificial languages, thereby simulating the early stages of bilingual acquisition.  The goal of that study was to determine whether learners could form multiple representations for each input language and encapsulate information in each of the input speech streams, an ability that would facilitate learning in cases where statistical interactions between the languages might interfere with proper learning.  The results demonstrated that adult learners can track two sets of statistics at once (i.e., encapsulating the information within each language), suggesting that they can form multiple representations when confronted with multiple language input.  This process was facilitated by an indexical cue of speaker voice.  In the absence of such an indexical cue, learners combined input across both languages, resulting in reduced learning when presented with statistically incompatible language pairs.  \n\nThe present study examines whether the process of forming multiple representations in bilingual segmentation tasks can be facilitated by visual cues such as videos of faces speaking the artificial languages.  Previous research has demonstrated that synchronous visual displays (such as faces) can facilitate infants' performance on a segmentation task.  Here, two artificial languages with incompatible statistics were paired with videos of two synchronous, dynamic faces.  With the faces serving as an indexical cue to language, participants learned each language significantly above chance, replicating previous results. Further experimental conditions demonstrate that this effect hinges on indexical synchronous information being available to the learner.   Neither a static visual cue of color background nor a dynamic display of faces that produce both languages (and therefore not indexical) facilitated segmentation. These results suggest that faces are particularly effective indexical cues for facilitating the encapsulation of statistical information in a bilingual word segmentation task, underscoring the potentially important role for audio-visual synchrony in the course of normal language acquisition.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [74], "author_name_tesi": "Mitchel, Aaron Daniell", "last_name_ssi": "Mitchel", "middle_name_ssi": "Daniell", "first_name_ssi": "Aaron", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel J Weiss", "Daniel J Weiss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel J Weiss, Thesis Advisor", "Daniel J Weiss, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["language acquisition", "speech segmentation", "statistical learning", "face processing"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Cross-Modal Effects in Statistical Learning\n", "id": "11637", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13221", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A central question of research on language acquisition concerns which types of information in the environmental input are available to language learners, as well as the extent to which learners utilize this information.  Although research examining this issue has traditionally focused on the nature of the auditory input to language learners, there is a growing body of research indicating that the language learning environment is multimodal and that processes supporting language acquisition exploit cues in the visual domain (e.g. cues in the speaker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face).  In this dissertation, I examined how mechanisms of early language acquisition operate over multimodal input, focusing on processes underlying speech segmentation, an early obstacle faced by language learners.  One mechanism believed to support speech segmentation is statistical learning, in which learners use distributional regularities in the input to identify word boundaries.  Few studies have examined statistical learning in a multimodal context, despite evidence that perception is fundamentally multisensory.  Thus, across a series of three studies, I investigated the interaction of visual and auditory input during statistical learning.  \n\nIn Chapter II, I tested adults\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to use distributional cues to segment streams of tone and shape triplets presented simultaneously.  Learners were able to segment each stream so long as the triplet boundaries aligned across streams.  When the streams were misaligned, performance dropped to chance.  In Chapter III, I used an illusion arising from audiovisual integration (the McGurk effect) to alter the statistical representations of two languages, indicating that learners can integrate audio and visual input during statistical learning.  Finally, in Chapter IV, I found that learners were able to use facial cues alone to segment a speech stream.  The results of these three studies provide evidence of cross-modal effects on statistical learning, suggesting that statistical learning does not occur independently across modalities.  In addition, these results provide further evidence for the relevance of visual input, in particular cues in the speaker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face, for processes supporting language acquisition.  I conclude the dissertation with a discussion of how these findings inform models of statistical learning, as well as potential broader applications of these results for atypical language development.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12768], "author_name_tesi": "Mitchel, Aaron Daniell", "last_name_ssi": "Mitchel", "middle_name_ssi": "Daniell", "first_name_ssi": "Aaron", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel J.

This species is able to abstract an H-atom from the substrate and, in the most common outcome \u2013 hydroxylation \u2013 the enzyme subsequently couples the resulting \u2013OH group to a carbon-centered radical on the substrate. Excitingly, the biosynthetic capacity of this platform has expanded to include desaturation, C-O/C bond formation, halogenation, endoperoxidation, epoxidation, stereo-inversion, and even the formation of ethylene. The Fe/2OG oxygenases are considered ideal candidates for biotechnology applications owing to their catalytic diversity, simple and readily available cofactors/cosubstrates, and ability to activate inert C-H bonds. To capitalize on this promise and successfully harness this enzyme scaffold for biotechnology purposes, it is necessary to obtain detailed mechanistic and structural information, particularly for non-hydroxylation systems.\n     The mechanism of \u2013OH installation by the Fe/2OG oxygenases is largely understood. In the non-hydroxylases reactivity likely diverges after the substrate hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) step, resulting in alternate transformation of the carbon-centered radical. It is likely that tight spatial control of the substrate HAT target and the oxygen-derived ligands via interaction with specific active site residues and other components of the Fe coordination sphere are crucial for controlling reaction outcome. Although many Fe/2OG hydroxylases are well-characterized via x-ray crystallography, comprehensive high-resolution structural data for complete enzyme-substrate reactant complexes is lacking for non-hydroxylation systems. Here, we will explore the structural properties of non-canonical Fe/2OG oxygenases, in particular the features that dictate reactivity. A novel set of halogenase crystal structures revealed important active site features for selective catalysis.

It is possible that legislation and regulation may phase out conventional refrigeration systems due to the global warming potential of the working fluids.  Thermoacoustic refrigeration does not rely on these potentially harmful gases, and is therefore a potential successor.  The inline topology is a new topology for a thermoacoustic refrigerator.  This topology consists of parts that would be found in most thermoacoustic devices, such as heat exchangers, regenerators, pistons, drivers, and ducts.  What makes this new topology unique is that the inline topology consists of N identical segments.  Each of the drivers are phased 360/N degrees from one another.  Like many other thermoacoustic devices the inline topology is a complicated system, and there are few tools that can be employed in the design of these systems.\nA model based on lumped element theory will be developed to assist in the design of an inline thermoacoustic refrigerator.  The inline topology that will be modeled consists of three sections (each phased 120 degrees from one another) titled Trillium.  Due to the repetitive sections in Trillium, a model will be created for one section and be constrained so the effect of the rest of the system can influence the single section.  The lumped element model must be simple and accurate so that it can aid in the design process of these devices.  For the lumped element model to be useful, it must agree with the more complex models such as DELTA EC.  After comparisons and validations, it was determined that the lumped element model is accurate enough to facilitate thermoacoustic refrigerator design.  It was also determined that the model is much easier to run, and allows the designer to explore system trends as a function of the system parameters.\nAnother benefit to a lumped element model is that the model is simple enough to add, remove, and change system components.  A system that is oscillating at 60 Hz will reach over five million cycles in one day, therefore the refrigerator must be designed for an infinite number of cycles.  One of the most fatigue-prone parts of a thermoacoustic device is the flexure seal.  A series spring was added into the model, between the driver and the flexure seal, to investigate its effects on reducing the required displacement of the flexure seal while still matching the driver to the optimal system impedance.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7383], "author_name_tesi": "Mitchell, Eric Carl", "last_name_ssi": "Mitchell", "middle_name_ssi": "Carl", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Lurie Garrett", "Robert Mitchel Keolian", "Robert William Smith", "Matthew Ernest Poese", "Victor Ward Sparrow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Lurie Garrett, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Mitchel Keolian, Thesis Advisor", "Robert William Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew Ernest Poese, Thesis Advisor", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermoacoustic", "acoustic", "regenerator", "lumped element model", "refrigerator"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Trajectories of Children's Living Arrangements and Adolescent Outcomes\n\n", "id": "9820", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3367", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While there has been much research on family structure and children\u2019s associated well-being in the last several decades, most studies have employed a static measure of family structure that only measures children\u2019s living arrangements at one point in time.

This project documents the family living arrangements of a cohort of youth born between 1986 and 1992 from birth through adolescence using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.  Factors that are predictive of experiencing various family structure trajectories and the associations between experiencing different trajectories and outcomes in adolescence are examined.  \n\tIn the sample of 1,870 children, 187 distinct family structure trajectories were identified.

However, the mean number of transitions varied greatly depending on family structure at birth, which was also predictive of other future family structure experiences.  Latent class analysis yielded five distinguishable trajectories of children\u2019s living arrangements over the course of childhood: continuously married biological parent families, long-term single mother families, married biological parents who break up, cohabiting biological parents who marry or break up, and a trajectory distinguished by the addition of a stepfather at some point during childhood.  Mother\u2019s education, mother\u2019s family of origin characteristics, mother\u2019s race, and mother\u2019s experience of having a teen birth were predictive of the family structure trajectories their children experienced.  \n\tThe trajectories characterized by parental divorce and growing up with a long-term single mother were generally associated with lower levels of well-being in adolescence.  Family instability, measured by the number of family structure transitions children experienced, was also associated with higher levels of depression and delinquency in adolescence independently of family structure trajectories.  Other family structure variables, including the experience of various types of transitions as well as the percentage of childhood spent in certain family structures, were also predictive of later well-being.

Motor neuron degeneration relentlessly progresses, with death occurring an average of three to five years after onset due to respiratory failure. Despite extensive research, definite causes of thev disease remain unknown for the vast majority of patients. Risk factors for the disease also remain mostly elusive; however, recently studies have identified the H63D HFE genetic variant, but not the C282Y HFE polymorphism, as a possible risk factor. I begin by extending the genetic association of the H63D HFE allele with sporadic ALS.\n\nGenotyping of a large number of ALS patients and control subjects from across the United States, and combining the results with those from populations around the world revealed a dose-dependent association of the H63D HFE allele with sporadic ALS. The association of this allele with other risk-associated alleles was explored, and suggests H63D HFE is unlikely to be merely tagging another allele. Previous functional analyses of HFE also suggest a potential contributory role of HFE variants to ALS pathogenesis. Wildtype HFE is critically positioned as a regulator of cellular iron acquisition. The potential cellular milieu resulting from dysfunctional HFE stands to contribute to pathogenesis of ALS by a variety of mechanisms.\n\nALS pathogenesis is thought to involve a number of converging and cascading pathways including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, and growth factor deficiency. Cellular iron dysregulation may potentiate each of these mechanisms either through generation of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative stress or through other specific means. I assessed biomarkers associated with neuroinflammation and trophic factor signaling for the ability to distinguish ALS patients from control subjects and elucidate mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, and determine the impact of HFE polymorphisms on biomarker expression. In cerebrospinal fluid, expression levels of cytokines suggested an inflammatory profile associated with ALS, and demonstrated utility in classifying subjects by disease status. HFE polymorphisms were also associated with altered expression of several markers. In plasma samples, expression of the iron homeostasis proteins L-ferritin and transferrin was altered by disease status and presence of the H63D HFE allele. These two markers also suggested efficacy in classifying subjects by disease status. Additionally, the H63D HFE allele was associated with changes in inflammatory cytokines and trophic factors suggesting both potentially beneficial and detrimental effects in ALS pathogenesis. \n\nAt the cellular level, our results suggest a contribution of the H63D HFE allele to glutamate excitotoxicity and inflammatory signaling. H63D HFE was associated with increased neuronal glutamate secretion as well as deficient cellular glutamate uptake, in contrast to C282Y HFE, which was associated with the opposite effects. Expression of H63D HFE, but not C282Y HFE, also resulted in increased cellular secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a potent recruiter and activator of microglia and macrophages. The effects of H63D HFE on glutamate regulation and secretion of MCP-1 could generally be mimicked by modulating cellular iron levels. Minocycline, a multifaceted antibiotic, has been explored for use in treating ALS patients due to its myriad effects on multiple pathways associated with disease pathogenesis. Our results suggest that response to this agent may be affected by HFE genotype.\n\nCollectively, our results establish the H63D HFE polymorphism as a risk factor for ALS and demonstrate cellular mechanisms by which it may contribute to pathogenesis of the disease. \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5255], "author_name_tesi": "Mitchell, Ryan  Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Mitchell", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "Zachary Simmons", "John Elliot Beard", "Ian Alexander Simpson", "Willard M Freeman, Ph D"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Committee Chair", "Zachary Simmons, Committee Member", "John Elliot Beard, Committee Member", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Member", "Willard M Freeman, Ph D, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["disease pathogenesis", "ALS", "HFE", "iron", "genetic association"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "UNDERSTANDING URBAN SYSTEMS USING COMPLEXITY THEORY: ANALYZING THE INFORMAL RAILWAY MARKETS OF MUMBAI\n\n\n\n", "id": "8875", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "75", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "All cities have some form of informal spaces within them and these spaces grow along with the city. This growth in informal spaces is perceived as disorganized and chaotic. The traditional role of city planners is to eliminate or curtail this disorganization. In an attempt to organize the growing city structure, planners are still looking at conventional approaches, and, as a result, they end up designing static spaces. But this disorganized structure, when looked closely, is a self-organizing system. The planners need to understand the self-organization of informal spaces and need to take it into account while designing them. \nJohn Holland\u2019s framework of complexity theory explains the self-organization and emergence of a system.

Issues of congestion, messy image, safety, and security were studied to understand the problems of the informal markets.

The aim of this research is to model, design, and experimentally demonstrate passive vibration control of rotorcraft tailbooms using F2MC-based damped absorbers.\nRotorcraft tailbooms are subject to periodic excitation from the main rotor and broadband excitation from aerodynamic forces. These excitations cause excessive driveline component wear, structural fatigue, and passenger discomfort. Lightweight and compact passive tailboom vibration treatments are needed to replace the heavy and bulky vibration treatments widely used in production helicopters today. A lightweight vibration absorber can be produced by fluidically coupling two pairs of F2MC tubes, mounted on the top and bottom of a tailboom, via an inertia track. Partially closing an orifice in the inertia track results in a damped absorber.\nTo demonstrate the performance of F2MC-based damped absorbers, analytical models are developed for a lab-scale tailboom structure and a full-scale tailboom on a Bell Helicopter OH-58C. These models are used to design F2MC-based damped absorbers for the lab-scale and full-scale tailbooms. Simulation results show that F2MC tubes reduce vibration at the first vertical displacement bending mode of the lab-scale tailboom by nearly 78% for the open orifice configuration, and increase damping by nearly 8% at the first mode. For a weight penalty of under 4.5 kg (10 lb), F2MC tubes are predicted to reduce vibration at the first vertical bending mode of the OH-58C tailboom by over 96%, as well as add over 8% damping to the first mode.\nA prototype F2MC-based damped absorber is installed onto the lab-scale tailboom structure and tested to validate the analytical model. Experimental frequency responses show good agreement with model predictions, with the experimental absorber reducing response amplitude at the first vertical bending mode by over 70%, and a partially closed orifice adding\nnearly 8% damping to the first mode. The effect of fluid pre-pressure, orifice size, and tailboom forcing amplitude are studied.\nDesign rules for F2MC-based damped absorbers are developed to enable sizing of the F2MC tubes, as well as proper tuning of the inertia track and orifice. Guidelines are provided for selection of F2MC tube mounting locations, bladder materials and thickness, and fluid. A fluidic circuit with two parallel inertia tracks is proposed and analyzed for applications requiring adjustable tuning for multiple operating conditions.\nPerformance-per-weight comparisons are made between F2MC-based and conventional piston-based absorbers, as well as an active control solution. This research shows that, per added weight, the F2MC tube outperforms conventional piston-type pumpers by almost three times. Furthermore, on a per-added weight basis, the F2MC-absorber may outperform an active solution using piezoelectric actuators, depending on the power limits.\nFinally, ongoing and future work for a prototype absorber on a full-scale OH-58C tailboom is discussed.

D. dissertation, I have studied three subjects of molecular evolution by using statistical methods. (1) Evolutionary changes of the target sites of two microRNAs encoded in the Hox gene cluster of Drosophila and other insect species. (2) Patterns of duplication of microRNA genes and testing if the duplication patterns can support the hypothesis of genome duplication in the teleost fish lineage. (3) Statistical studies of the effects of random fluctuation of selection intensity on the extent of genetic variation. I chose these three subjects, because they are important and I could test hypotheses proposed with recently obtained empirical data. First, I examined the evolution of miRNA genes, MIR-iab-4, MIR-iab-4as, and MIR-10, which are encoded within the Hox gene cluster in invertebrates, and their target sites of 12 Drosophila species, other insects, and Daphnia. The results showed that the numbers and nucleotide sequences of these miRNA genes have been well conserved among the species examined, whereas the number of target sites has frequently changed during the evolution of insects and Daphnia. I also found that the old target sites, which were generated before the divergence of 12 Drosophila species, have been highly conserved through purifying selection. By contrast, some new target sites, which were generated after the divergence of 12 Drosophila species, have often been lost under relaxed selection. Second, I used miRNA genes to test the currently debated hypothesis that an ancestral species of teleost fishes experienced genome duplication. In this study I identified the miRNA genes that existed before the divergence of teleost fishes and tetrapods and examined their evolutionary changes in the teleost and tetrapod lineages. This study could support the hypothesis of genome duplication in the teleost fish. Finally, I conducted a mathematical study on the probability of fixation and fixation time of a new mutant allele and the extent of genetic variation expected under the currently competing models of fluctuating selection; competitive selection and stabilizing selection. As expected, the stabilizing selection model was shown to generate more genetic variation than the competitive selection model. However, when I analyzed the 10,602 polymorphic sites of SNP data from the human populations in Africa, the results obtained showed that the neutral model fit the data quite well and therefore the effect of fluctuation of selection coefficient is not very important whether the fluctuation occurs following the competitive or stabilizing selection models.

Commitment cannot be externally enforced. More precisely, at each date, the young and old agents simultaneously decide how much of their respective endowments to transfer to the other agent, but they cannot be forced to give away any portion of their endowments. I focus on a stationary trigger strategy, in which the old agent does not make transfers, and characterize the subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) stationary trigger strategies. I also discuss the efficiency of these SPE allocations. The main finding is that for some parameter values, the SPE stationary trigger strategy allocations are interim Pareto efficient in the set of all feasible allocations, a set that includes allocations that violate the limited commitment constraint.\n\nChapter 2 studies the role of social security in an overlapping generations model with production and capital accumulation, where the production faces an aggregate productivity shock. In a deterministic model such as Diamond (1965), the rate of return on capital and population growth rate are keys to understand the role of social security. The question of this paper is whether the similar criterion is applicable to a stochastic version of the model. When the variance of the aggregate shock is small, the same criterion is exactly applicable. However, when the variance is not small enough, the phenomenon that does not occur in a deterministic case may happen in a stochastic case, because of the precautionary saving motive that does not exist in a deterministic version of the model. \n\n\nChapter 3 extends a model discussed in Dekel and Piccione (2000) by adding a costly information acquisition stage.

Concerns about national security have grown because of transnational terrorism, but there is also awareness of the need to attract talented international students who can help lead the development of a knowledge economy and maintain international competitiveness. In relation to these issues, NAFSA: The Association of International Educators, whose members are primarily university administrators and advisers, is uniquely positioned to push for changes based on the views of those with expertise in international education.  My starting assumption is that NAFSA has, in fact, worked continuously to shape federal policy to allow greater international student access to the U.S. since its creation in 1948 as the National Association of Foreign Student Advisers. Through the lens of a public policy, Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), this dissertation explores what roles NAFSA has played in the policy process behind the creation of federal legislation and regulations affecting international student access since the late 1940s. Building on key concepts of ACF, the dissertation analyzes continuities and changes in: the relationships between NAFSA and other key actors in the policy process; NAFSA\u2019s beliefs in international student mobility into the U.S.; the resources of NAFSA as a political actor; and NAFSA\u2019s strategies in its attempts to influence the federal policy. Overall, it concludes that NAFSA, representing a substantial portion of international educators in the federal policy arena, has continued to be a special interest group which regards international students as far more beneficial to the U.S. than risky, particularly from a longer term perspective. With its steadily growing membership, NAFSA has expertly led its allies to promote the view that international students are, in fact, a solution to the potential risks (e.g., terrorism, unemployment) that unorganized opponents may see in these students\u2019 presence in the U.S. Although NAFSA has not been a dominant political player, it has had an important role in adding issues to the political agenda and providing policy implementation feedback useful for the development of alternative policies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4749], "author_name_tesi": "Miyokawa, Norifumi ", "last_name_ssi": "Miyokawa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Norifumi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Post", "David Post", "Roger Lewis Geiger", "Lisa Lattuca", "Goktug Morcol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Post, Dissertation Advisor", "David Post, Committee Chair", "Roger Lewis Geiger, Committee Member", "Lisa Lattuca, Committee Member", "Goktug Morcol, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["international educators", "policy process", "international students", "NAFSA", "U.S. higher education", "federal policy"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Analytical and numerical studies on minimal models of crawling cell motion", "id": "14701msm344", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14701", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The motility of eukaryotic cells is ubiquitous in biological systems and is central to various processes such as wound healing and the immune response.

Although the biological pathways driving cell motility are complicated, various mathematical models have had great success in both replicating experimental results as well as\npredicting new phenomena.\n\nIn this dissertation we study two minimal models of cell motion which are derived from a phase-field model of keratocyte motion. The first is derived via the so-called sharp interface limit of the phase-field model. In this limit one recovers a non-linear and non-local geometric evolution law for the motion of a planar curve representing the boundary of the cell membrane. In a particular physical parameter regime we prove well-posedness by establishing existence/uniqueness of solutions. We next demonstrate necessary conditions for the existence of traveling wave solutions which correspond to persistently moving cells. We additionally investigate the sharp interface limit equation numerically: we introduce novel algorithms which resolve the difficulties of non-linearity, non-locality, and non-uniqueness of solutions of the sharp interface limit equation. Simulations reveal wobbling motions as well as rotating cells corresponding to experimental results.\n\nThe second minimal model is derived by reducing the full phase-field system to a differential algebraic equation (DAE) system. In this simplified system we investigate the effect of patterned substrates on the direction of cell motion. In particular we are interested in understanding the motility of cells on substrates with alternating adhesive and non-adhesive stripes. We validate the DAE system by showing qualitative agreement with full phase-field simulation results wherein either parallel and perpendicular motion to stripes are observed depending on physical parameters. Additionally we predict the effect of changing biophysical parameters and substrate geometry on the direction of cell motility; these results have applications to directed cell motion and sorting.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15737], "author_name_tesi": "Mizuhara, Matthew S", "last_name_ssi": "Mizuhara", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonid Berlyand", "Leonid Berlyand", "Mark Levi", "Anna Mazzucato", "Lorraine Santy", "Xiantao Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonid Berlyand, Dissertation Advisor", "Leonid Berlyand, Committee Chair", "Mark Levi, Committee Member", "Anna Mazzucato, Committee Member", "Lorraine Santy, Outside Member", "Xiantao Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["applied mathematics", "mathematical biology", "cell motility", "partial differential equations", "keratocyte motion"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "OPTIMIZATION OF COUPLED MULTIPHYSICS METHODOLOGY FOR SAFETY ANALYSIS OF PEBBLE BED MODULAR REACTOR", "id": "11088", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4961", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe research conducted within the framework of this PhD thesis is devoted to the high-fidelity multi-physics (based on neutronics/thermal-hydraulics coupling) analysis of Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR), which is a High Temperature Reactor (HTR). The Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) will be a HTR design. The core design and safety analysis methods are considerably less developed and mature for HTR analysis than those currently used for Light Water Reactors (LWRs). Compared to LWRs, the HTR transient analysis is more demanding since it requires proper treatment of both slower and much longer transients (of time scale in hours and days) and fast and short transients (of time scale in minutes and seconds). There is limited operation and experimental data available for HTRs for validation of coupled multi-physics methodologies. \nThis PhD work developed and verified reliable high fidelity coupled multi-physics models subsequently implemented in robust, efficient, and accurate computational tools to analyse the neutronics and thermal-hydraulic behaviour for design optimization and safety evaluation of PBMR concept The study provided a contribution to a greater accuracy of neutronics calculations by including the feedback from thermal hydraulics driven temperature calculation and various multi-physics effects that can influence it. Consideration of the feedback due to the influence of leakage was taken into account by development and implementation of improved buckling feedback models. Modifications were made in the calculation procedure to ensure that the xenon depletion models were accurate for proper interpolation from cross section tables. \nTo achieve this, the NEM/THERMIX coupled code system was developed to create the system that is efficient and stable over the duration of transient calculations that last over several tens of hours.\nAnother achievement of the PhD thesis was development and demonstration of full-physics, three-dimensional safety analysis methodology for the PBMR to provide reference solutions. Investigation of different aspects of the coupled methodology and development of efficient kinetics treatment for the PBMR were carried out, which accounts for all feedback phenomena in an efficient manner. The OECD/NEA PBMR-400 coupled code benchmark was used as a test matrix for the proposed investigations.\nThe integrated thermal-hydraulics and neutronics (multi-physics) methods were extended to enable modeling of a wider range of transients pertinent to the PBMR. First, the effect of the spatial mapping schemes (spatial coupling) was studied and quantified for different types of transients, which resulted in implementation of improved mapping methodology based on user defined criteria. The second aspect that was studied and optimized is the temporal coupling and meshing schemes between the neutronics and thermal-hydraulics time step selection algorithms. The coupled code convergence was achieved supplemented by application of methods to accelerate it. Finally, the modeling of all feedback phenomena in PBMRs was investigated and a novel treatment of cross-section dependencies was introduced for improving the representation of cross-section variations.\nThe added benefit was that in the process of studying and improving the coupled multi-physics methodology more insight was gained into the physics and dynamics of PBMR, which will help also to optimize the PBMR design and improve its safety. One unique contribution of the PhD research is the investigation of the importance of the correct representation of the three-dimensional (3-D) effects in the PBMR analysis. The performed studies demonstrated that explicit 3-D modeling of control rod movement is superior and removes the errors associated with the grey curtain (2-D homogenized) approximation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4938], "author_name_tesi": "Mkhabela, Peter Tshepo", "last_name_ssi": "Mkhabela", "middle_name_ssi": "Tshepo", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Robert M Edwards", "Yousry Y Azmy", "Frederik Reitsma", "Ntate D Kgwadi", "Michael Adebola Adewumi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Dissertation Advisor", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Chair", "Maria Nikolova Avramova, Committee Chair", "Robert M Edwards, Committee Member", "Yousry Y Azmy, Committee Member", "Frederik Reitsma, Committee Member", "Ntate D Kgwadi, Committee Member", "Michael Adebola Adewumi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["NEM.

I find that outside directors\u2019 prior involvement in acquisitions is associated with a significant increase in acquisition announcement returns. Further analysis identifies two potential channels for this effect. First, firms with higher board acquisition expertise are better at target selection: they choose targets with higher synergies and experience better post-acquisition operating performance. Second, firms with higher board acquisition expertise negotiate more effectively, by paying lower takeover premiums. Overall, the results demonstrate that outside directors with relevant experience can improve the quality of a firm\u2019s strategic decision-making.\n\nIn the second essay, focusing on corporate acquisitions, I examine how the use of equity in director compensation packages affects director incentives. Equity-based compensation can increase monitoring efforts of directors, resulting in better acquisition performance. However, as acquisitions lead to an increase in size and potentially an increase in director pay, directors might be less willing to preclude the CEO from empire-building. I find that higher director equity-based compensation is associated with better short-run acquisition performance and fewer value-destroying acquisitions. Overall, the results suggest that equity-based compensation is effective in aligning director incentives with those of the shareholders.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8331], "author_name_tesi": "Mkrtchyan, Anahit ", "last_name_ssi": "Mkrtchyan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anahit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Laura B Field", "Laura B Field", "Michelle Lowry", "Peter G Iliev", "Karl A Muller Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Laura B Field, Dissertation Advisor", "Laura B Field, Committee Chair", "Michelle Lowry, Committee Member", "Peter G Iliev, Committee Member", "Karl A Muller Iii, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Corporate Governance", "Board of Directors", "Mergers and Acquisitions", "Director Compensation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Electrical and temperature stress effects on power Mosfets", "id": "24986", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10760", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High electrical field and high temperature stresses are the two main factors that are critical in determining power metal-oxide-Si field effect transistor\u2019s (MOSFET\u2019s) reliability and lifetime.

As the volume of video data increases, most video analysis requires significant human supervision. However, since human supervision is not scalable, a software-aided real-time video surveillance system is desirable. Video anomaly detection problem has been formulated as a well-known likelihood ratio test (LRT) problems, under the idealized assumption of the knowledge of the distributions of both normal events and anomalous events. Often, ample training corresponding to anomalous events is assumed to be available (supervised setting). In many real-world problems, however, both normal and anomalous distributions are generally unknown and difficult to estimate even when the training data is available.\n\nThe key open challenges in video anomaly detection comprise: 1.) presence of noise in surveillance videos and occlusions in transportation videos; 2.) detection of anomalies involving multiple objects; 3.) lack of training samples representing anomalous events; 4.) representation of event using multiple features (known formally as video event encoding); 5.) identification of anomalies in unstructured scenario where preparation of a dictionary clearly separated into class-specific sub-dictionaries is impossible. Recently sparse reconstruction techniques have been used for image classification, and shown to provide excellent robustness to occlusion. This progress has also been leveraged for sparsity-based video-anomaly detection where test events are expressed as sparse linear combinations of example events from a given (normal or anomalous) class. This dissertation explores novel and adaptive sparse representations for addressing open challenges in video anomaly detection. First, we develop a new joint sparsity model for anomaly detection that enables the detection of joint anomalies involving multiple objects and then we propose outlier rejection measure for unsupervised video anomaly detection. Second, we introduce non-linearity into the linear sparsity model and dictionary design and optimization technique to enable superior class separability and dictionary compactness. Third, we propose to extend sparsity models based on single feature representations to more sophisticated sparse models based on multiple feature representations. Finally, we introduce low rank sparsity prior to our sparsity model which perfectly handle the unstructured scenario. The contributions in this dissertation successfully address all the five open challenges mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph. We extensively test on several real world video data sets involving both single and multiple object anomalies. Results show marked improvements in detection of anomalies in both supervised and unsupervised cases when using the proposed sparsity models.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9986], "author_name_tesi": "Mo, Xuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Mo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vishal Monga", "Vishal Monga", "William Evan Higgins", "Kenneth Jenkins", "Jesse Louis Barlow", "Raja Bala"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vishal Monga, Dissertation Advisor", "Vishal Monga, Committee Chair", "William Evan Higgins, Committee Member", "Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member", "Jesse Louis Barlow, Committee Member", "Raja Bala, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["video anomaly detection", "sparsity model", "kernel function", "multi-object", "low rank sparsity prior", "outlier rejection"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "COMPARISON OF THE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF MICROWAVE PHYTOSANITARY TREATMENT OF WOODEN PALLETS TO CONVENTIONAL HEAT AND METHYL BROMIDE TREATMENTS\n", "id": "12211", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6085", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of phytosanitary treatment of wooden pallets with microwave (MW) heating is presented. The focus of the LCA in this study is on the phytosanitary treatments of Grocery Manufacturers\u2019 Association (GMA) wooden pallets. Wooden pallets are used in most international deliveries and they are prone to pest infestation, serving as a pathway for the introduction and spread of pests to living trees. The current ISPM 15 guideline requires wood packaging materials to be either heat treated or fumigated with methyl bromide. These two currently approved methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Conventional heat treating is believed to have the highest impacts in some environmental categories and methyl bromide is being phased out due to its ozone depleting properties. There is a big debate about selecting a phytosanitary treatment method that has less environmental impacts and is less expensive. Temperature required to kill a particular pest and the amount of time needed are two important issues that needs to be considered since they control the amount of impacts a treatment method might have on the environment. The time required to reach the kill temperature depends on many factors including the type of energy source used to generate the heat.\nThe goal of this study is to compare the amount of carbon footprint and emissions released from potential microwave phytosanitary treatment of wooden pallets to conventional heat treatment and methyl bromide fumigation. This goal is achieved by using a life cycle assessment database, which analyzes data collected from pallet manufacturing, treatment companies, and published articles and journals and then quantifies the atmospheric emissions resulting from microwave treatment of 48\u201d x 40\u201d GMA wooden pallets as projected by pilot studies of potential microwave pallet treating technology.\nThe life cycle of wooden pallets was modeled in SimaPro Software 7.1 for carbon footprint and environmental impacts calculations. A model of the product life cycle with all the environmental inputs and outputs during phytosanitary treatments was developed. To accomplish this, we collected data for the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) phase, evaluated the significance of potential impacts on the environment to meet Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) requirement, and finally, interpreted the results from the LCI and LCIA.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6078], "author_name_tesi": "Moadel Shahidi, Seyedeh Shirin ", "last_name_ssi": "Moadel Shahidi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seyedeh Shirin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles David Ray Sr.", "Charles David Ray Sr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles David Ray Sr., Thesis Advisor", "Charles David Ray Sr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Phytosanitary Treatment", "Life Cycle Analysis", "Environmental Impacts", "Pallet"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "VEGETATION CHANGE ON THE TARATA ALLUVIAL FAN:  THE IMPACTS OF IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE ANDEAN HIGHLANDS OF BOLIVIA\n", "id": "9626", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "837", "abstract_tesi": "Semi-arid woodland environments of the Bolivian Andes are a global center of biodiversity and integral parts of an agricultural landscape.  Farmers traditionally relied on spate irrigation; however, a transition to canal-based irrigation began in the early 1990s with the construction of the Laka Laka Dam.  While the goal was to create a system for year-round access and increase water use efficiency, the effects of the Laka Laka Dam project on woody vegetation have not been researched.  The main pattern (>50%) of forest cover consists of ribbon-like strands along water sources, specifically the new concrete-lined canals.  This study will assess the changes in woody vegetation cover along the irrigation canals, and the main flood channel, through a combination of remote sensing and field techniques. The spatial extents and temporal changes of this woody vegetation are explored by the comparison of pre-dam aerial photography (1990) with post-dam Quickbird satellite imagery (2006).  Canals that remained earthen gained an average of 2% in woody vegetation from 1990 to 2006.  Concrete-lined canals lost vegetation (13%) close to the center-line of the canal, but gained vegetation (5%) at distances of up to 20 meters from the canal.  The main channel experienced an increase of 131% in woody vegetation between 1990 and 2006.  Overall, the Taratan alluvial fan experienced a small gain in woody vegetation.  Reasons behind this result are varied, but a large factor is the increase of irrigation efficiency and the total volume of water being applied to the soil for the purpose of agriculture.  In effect, the irrigation water applied to the fields more than compensated for the restriction of soil moisture due to the canals\u2019 concrete lining.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [830], "author_name_tesi": "Moats, Brentley Wade", "last_name_ssi": "Moats", "middle_name_ssi": "Wade", "first_name_ssi": "Brentley", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Stephen Zimmerer", "Karl Stephen Zimmerer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Stephen Zimmerer, Thesis Advisor", "Karl Stephen Zimmerer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Agriculture", "Woody Vegetation", "Irrigation", "Remote Sensing", "Watershed", "Alluvial Fan"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Cross disciplinary instruction through art: a qualitative study of attitude, perceptions and experiences of middle school teachers", "id": "28859", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12458", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this study, I use interviews with two middle school art teachers to discuss attitudes, experiences, and perceptions in relation to cross disciplinary learning.

A parallel wake-vortex simulation code has been written and integrated with a Virtual Reality (VR) system via a separate graphics client. The coupling of computational steering of parallel wake-vortex simulation with VR setup provides us with near real-time visualization of the wake-vortex data in stereoscopic mode.

In another application, an existing computational fluid dynamics code has been integrated with the steering system to enable interactive visualization of complex flow simulations from any remote workstation. Benefits of scalability and dimensional reduction arising from this approach have been imperative in the development of this system. This system makes the visualization of flow simulations easier, efficient, and most-importantly without any delay as and when the results are generated, thus giving the user much greater flexibility in interacting with the huge amounts of data.

At the laboratory visit, mothers fed their infant a food that the infant had not previously tried: hummus or cottage cheese.

Results revealed that infant temperament was related to the infants\u2019 responses to the novel food during the first and later offers of food. Infants who were rated high in approach tended to show acceptance of the first offer of novel food, while infants who were rated high in fear tended to show rejection behaviors in response to the first offer of novel food.

Similarly, food neophobia during early childhood has been linked to poor dietary outcomes, such as less dietary variety and lower consumption and liking of vegetables. For these reasons, it is important to identify factors that may contribute to food neophobia during the first years of life.

Temperamental approach/withdrawal processes have been extensively examined in response to new toys, new people, and new situations, but they have rarely been examined in response to novel foods. Thus, the overarching goal of this dissertation was to examine whether temperamental approach/withdrawal tendencies drive infants\u2019 and young children\u2019s reactions to novel foods. Data for both studies were drawn from a longitudinal study following 115 infants and their families across the first five years of life. Latent profile analysis was used to identify subgroups of children who exhibited similar patterns of approach/withdrawal and affective responses to novel stimuli during toddlerhood. Infants\u2019 responses to novel toys and novel foods were examined as predictors of the resulting temperament groups (inhibited, exuberant, and balanced) in Study 1. In Study 2, the toddler temperament groups were used as predictors of food neophobia at 4.5 years of age. \n\nThe goal of Study 1 was to investigate whether infants\u2019 approach/withdrawal tendencies underlie their responses to novel foods. This goal was addressed by examining whether infants\u2019 acceptance and rejection of novel foods were concurrently and longitudinally related to well-established measures of temperamental approach/withdrawal, such as responses to novel toys and objects. As predicted, infants who exhibited high levels of approach in response to the novel toys at 12 months also tended to show high levels of acceptance and low levels of rejection in response to the novel foods concurrently. Conversely, infants\u2019 responses to the novel toys at 6 months did not consistently predict their responses to the novel foods at the same age. Together, these findings suggest that approach/withdrawal behaviors are only consistent across novel contexts after infants develop the ability to inhibit their approach tendencies and once individual differences in wariness come online in the second half of the first year of life. Furthermore, infants\u2019 responses to the novel foods at 12 months, but not 6 months of age, predicted their temperamental style during toddlerhood. Infants who showed higher levels of rejection in response to the novel food at 12 months exhibited fewer approach behaviors in an unfamiliar environment with an experimenter and were more likely to be classified as inhibited compared to exuberant at 18 months of age. In sum, the results of Study 1 were largely consistent with our proposal that infants\u2019 reactions to novel foods are likely driven by underlying temperamental approach/withdrawal processes. \n\nStudy 2 examined whether temperamental approach/withdrawal processes concurrently and longitudinally predicted parent ratings and behavioral observations of food neophobia at 4.5 years of age. Additionally, this study explored whether parent characteristics and feeding styles moderated the relationship between toddler approach/withdrawal and food neophobia during preschool. As expected, parent ratings and behavioral observations of temperamental approach/withdrawal were associated with concurrent measures of food neophobia at 4.5 years of age. Similarly, temperamental withdrawal during toddlerhood, specifically high levels of negative affect, low levels of positive affect, and the inhibited temperament type, predicted food neophobia over three years later. Collectively, the results of this study emphasize that children who are temperamentally inhibited are at a heightened risk for developing high levels of food neophobia during childhood. Furthermore, evidence emerged to show that these neophobic tendencies in inhibited children were exacerbated by a maternal pressuring feeding style. \n\nIn conclusion, this dissertation adds to the existing literature on food neophobia by revealing that temperamental approach/withdrawal processes were linked to food neophobia during infancy and early childhood. The results across both studies also contribute to the literature on approach/withdrawal processes by confirming that novel foods are another type of novel stimulus that elicits individual differences in approach/withdrawal behaviors. Future work should continue to examine parenting practices and environmental influences that may decrease neophobic tendencies in temperamentally inhibited children, who are most at-risk for developing high levels of food neophobia during childhood.

Anomalies of thermal maturity in southwestern and west-central Pennsylvania along the Allegheny Front are hypothesized to be associated with hot brines driven through Upper Devonian aquifers from the foreland to the east. To test this hypothesis, a total of 402 1-D vertical heat diffusion experiments are conducted in 9 locations to investigate the effects of heating by fluid flow on organic-rich shales in the WPAB. Model simulations are constrained by compiled datasets of maximum reflectance of coal vitrinite, random reflectance of dispersed marine vitrinite in shales, and apatite fission-track ages. Modeling results indicate that the salient or promontory in maturity in Carboniferous and Devonian strata in northern Somerset and southern Cambria Counties is reproduced by an increase in temperatures of 40 \u2013 50 \u00b0C above those expected solely by heat conduction for at least one myr. from 260 \u2013 259 Ma following the end of the Alleghanian Orogeny.

The first part examines the synthesis and characterization of polyphosphazenes as potential scaffolding materials usable for hard tissue repair. The goal of this work was to design polymers containing acidic functional groups in an attempt to encourage the deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite when the polymer is exposed to simulated body fluids. The second part examines the development of a new polymeric architecture which generates elastomeric properties without the use of traditional covalent or physical crosslinks. The goal was to examine the effects of this new architecture on the physical and mechanical properties of the final polymers. While the two main foci are very disparate, they are connected by the fundamental quest to explore and expand the potential application of polyphosphazenes.\n Chapter 1 provides a general background for the two main focus areas mentioned above. More specifically: a brief explanation is provided of the necessary physical and chemical properties of  a suitable hard tissue engineering scaffolding substrate, and the basis of those requirements; together with an examination of the traditional ways in which elastomeric properties are introduced into a polymeric sample. In addition, the chemistry and selected applications of polyphosphazenes are also introduced.\nChapter 2 details the design and synthesis of polyphosphazenes bearing phosphonic acid and phosphoester side groups using two different routes. The first route utilized a linker unit which was functionalized with phosphoesters prior to its attachment to the polyphosphazene backbone, while the second route involved attachment of the same linking group to the polyphosphazene backbone before the introduction of the phosphoester moieties. In both cases, the samples were treated with iodotrimethylsilane to cleave the ester bonds and afford the parent phosphonic acid. Both routes proved successful. However, varying difficulties were encountered for each route. The attachment of a phosphonated side group allowed the synthesis of final polymers with a higher total concentration of phosphonate groups. However, due to insolubility issues encountered during the deesterification, only a portion of the ester groups were cleaved. This resulted in a decreased concentration of acidic groups along the polymeric backbone. These solubility issues were not encountered for the second route, in which the linker group was phosphonated after attachment to the polymer backbone, resulting in complete removal of the ester groups. However, due to a decreased efficiency of the phosphonation step, not all of the linker groups could be functionalized, and this limited the total phosphonic acid content along the polymer chain. The author was responsible for the synthetic work associated with the prior-side-group assembly route, while the post\u00ac-side-groups assembly work was performed by Dr. Nicole Morozowich. The manuscript is published in Macromolecules (year 2012, volume 45, pages 7684 \u2013 7691).\nIn Chapter 3 we examine the ability of the phosphonic acid functionalized polyphosphazenes described in Chapter 2 to mineralize calcium hydroxyapatite when exposed to simulated body fluid, which has the same ion concentration as human blood plasma. Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that those polymers which were synthesized by phosphonation of the linker group after its attachment to the polymer backbone had a higher degree of inorganic deposition along the surface. However, these polymers had a lowed overall concentration of phosphonate groups per polymer chain. The inability to fully remove the ester protecting groups proved to be a key driving force for this increased activity. In addition, Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) analysis was utilized along with X-ray scattering to provide confirmation that the deposited phase was calcium hydroxyapatite, the natural mineral of bone. The author was responsible for the synthesis of the polymers in collaboration with Dr. Nichole Morozowich. The ToF-SIMS analysis was performed by Dr. Jordan Lerach and Dr. Lauren Jackson working in the lab of Dr. Nicholas Winograd. The manuscript is published in RSC Advances (year 2014, volume 4, pages 19680 \u2013 19689).\nChapter 4 describes the development of a family of carboxylic acid functionalized polyphosphazenes and the examination of their ability to mineralize calcium hydroxyapatite when exposed to simulated body fluids. The acid moieties in this system are introduced by the incorporation of the allyl esters of \u03b2-alanine or \u03b3-amino butyric acid, followed by deesterification to afford the parent carboxylic acid. These samples show a significant increase in their ability to nucleate the growth of calcium hydroxyapatite along their surface, with the best sample doubling in mass within 4 weeks, which is a major improvement over the phosphonic acid functionalized samples described in Chapter 3.  The author was helped by Ian Hotham with the synthesis and testing of the polymers. The manuscript is published in Journal of Applied Polymer Science (year 2015, volume 132, DOI: 10.1002/APP.41741)\nChapter 5 contains an account of a new polymer architecture which imparts elastomeric properties without the use of traditional covalent or physical crosslinks. The polymers were synthesized with sterically bulky cyclotriphosphazene side groups linked directly to the polyphosphazene backbone using a hydroquinone linker. The geometry of the linking unit, as well as the large bulk of the side groups themselves, allowed the cyclotriphosphazene units to protrude away from the polymer backbone in a manner similar to the oars on a Viking long ship. This allowed them to interact physically with the \u201coars\u201d on adjacent polymer chains, and lock the chains in place, similar to the way in which the oars on one ship will interdigitate with the oars of another ship if they get too close. These interactions allow the polymers to undergo extensive elongation before breaking (\u2265 1,600 % of their original length) and the ability to recover up to 90% of the elongation when extended to high strain (up to 1,000 % of their original length). The manuscript is published in Macromolecules (year 2014, volume 47, pages 6776 \u2013 6782).\nChapter 6 expands the chemistry of the non-traditional elastomers described in Chapter 5. Specifically, the substituent groups on the cyclotriphosphazene groups are changed from 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy to phenoxy, while the remaining chlorine atoms along the polymer backbone are still replaced with 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxide. The new polymers are shown to have better mechanical properties then the polymers described in Chapter 5. This change is attributed to the increased ability of the cyclotriphosphazene side groups to interact via \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions through the presence of the phenoxy substituents. The ability to tune the final mechanical properties by simply changing the chemical nature on the cyclotriphosphazene groups provides an easy route to tailor the mechanical properties based on the final application. The author was helped by Emily Wilts with the synthesis of the polymers. The intended target journal for submission is Macromolecules. \nChapter 7 describes a further extension of the ideas in Chapters 5 and 6. Specifically it involves the synthesis and mechanical testing of polyphosphazenes bearing oligo-p-phenylene groups co-substituted with 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxide. The oligo-phenylene groups are incorporated to act as variable length cross-linking moieties to further expand the new family of non-traditional polyphosphazene elastomers. The mechanical and physical properties of these polymers reveal a strong dependence on both the length and concentration of the oligo-phenylene minor co-substituent groups. In order to better understand the role that the aryloxy side groups play, the samples were examined using Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS). These studies showed that, once the side groups were long enough, they are able to interact and cause a phase separation. This results in an improvement in the mechanical properties of the final polymers. The author was responsible for all synthesis and mechanical testing. The SAXS data acquisition was performed by Nichole Wonderling, with the data analysis helped by Dr. James Runt.
