Field performance analysis is an engineering task which requires knowledge, time, and the right tools and models. Available tools such as commercial reservoir simulators might not always be the most efficient or the most optimum solution even if they make use of highly sophisticated or detailed models. This is because these sophisticated models often require more input data and longer running time than the less detailed ones. These problems become worse when availability of input data and working time are constrained.\nThis thesis aims to develop a field performance model which will allow engineer to perform analysis and optimization tasks more effectively for the case of gas condensate reservoirs. A gas condensate is one of the many fluid types that can be found in conventional hydrocarbon reservoirs. The development of a two-phase condition below the dew point pressure can significantly increases the complexity in engineering performance calculation. The proposed tool utilizes both zero-dimensional reservoir model customized for gas condensate and pseudo component model. Results indicate that both models can provide fairly good prediction results while requiring much less input and running time. Microsoft Excel with built-in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is selected as the platform to develop this simulator due to the user-friendly interface, useful built-in features, and high flexibility to use and hard-code modification. The proposed model is able to successfully predict field performance while capturing all major fluid behavior characteristics of gas condensates as well as being capable of performing various optimization tasks effectively. Limitations of the implemented pseudo component model, such as negative solution gas-oil ratios at low reservoir pressure, are elaborated and discussed. The possible sources of error and associated preventive measures derived from the use of a gas condensate tank model for the case volatile oil reservoirs are addressed. Further recommended studies on negative value of decline exponent variable and expanding current capability of the proposed model are also presented.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5005], "author_name_tesi": "Vardcharragosad, Pichit ", "last_name_ssi": "Vardcharragosad", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pichit", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H", "Luis F Ayala H"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H, Thesis Advisor", "Luis F Ayala H, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Zero-Dimensional Reservoir Model", "Gas Condensate", "Field Performance"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Long-term Well Performance Prediction in Unconventional\ntight Gas And Shale Gas Reservoirs: A Density Approach", "id": "23541", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10299", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Unconventional tight gas and shale gas are the largest and fastest growing natural gas supply in the US. Natural gas produced from tight gas and shale gas reservoirs accounts for 60% of U.S. natural gas production in 2011. This number is expected to increase to 73% in 2040 (EIA, 2013). The lack of understanding and the lack of tools that can be applied to these unconventional plays are the major challenges. In unconventional tight gas and shale gas, the conventional reservoir engineering tools have been proven to be unsuccessful because they fail to capture the large differences in physical properties which heavily impact the production behaviors. The main differences include the ultra-low permeability of the formation, presence of adsorbed phase, and the need for multi-stage hydraulically fractured horizontal well completion to create massive flow area.\n\nThis study aims to develop new reservoir engineering analysis techniques which fully apply for unconventional tight gas and shale gas reservoirs. The new techniques should be able to capture the reservoir responses that are characterized by the transient flow regime and the multi-mechanistic flow in ultra-low permeability formations, the complex flow pattern from hydraulic fracture completion, and the natural gas desorption. We focus on formulating the fundamental, physics-based governing equation for these tight gas and shale gas reservoirs, as well as the long-term analysis and prediction tools that can capture their physical properties. The research applies new promising tools, a density approach, which was proposed to the industry by our research group. In the density method, gas diffusivity equation will be solved in a density-based form, and effects of reservoir depletion on fluid properties are captured through dimensionless variable, \u03bb \u0305-\u03b2 \u0305. The density method has been proven to be a reliable production data analysis tool applicable to conventional gas reservoirs produced under constant flowing pressure, constant flow rate, variable pressure/rate constraint as well as in reservoirs with significant rock compressibility. \n\nIn this thesis, we prove that density-based technique can be further extended to analyze production data from i) gas linear and fractal flow under boundary dominating condition, ii) gas radial, linear, and fractal flow with significant transient flow period, and iii) gas flow under slippage and desorption effects. We demonstrate that \u03bb \u0305-\u03b2 \u0305 can effectively quantify effects of depletion on gas properties in reservoirs with linear, radial, and fractal flow. We also show how to incorporate slippage and desorption effects as well as transient flow effect by properly modified definitions of \u03bb \u0305-\u03b2 \u0305. Based on these results, we are able to show that the density-based production analysis tools, originally developed for conventional gas reservoirs under boundary dominated radial flow, can be applied to predict and analyze production from unconventional gas reservoirs. In addition, we are able to use these density-based tools to analyze the impact of flow geometries on production decline behavior of gas wells.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9978], "author_name_tesi": "Vardcharragosad, Pichit ", "last_name_ssi": "Vardcharragosad", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pichit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H", "Luis F Ayala H", "Shimin Liu", "Mathieu Philippe Stienon", "Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H, Dissertation Advisor", "Luis F Ayala H, Committee Chair", "Shimin Liu, Committee Member", "Mathieu Philippe Stienon, Committee Member", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["A Density Approach", "Well Performance Prediction", "Tight Gas", "Shale Gas", "Production Data Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "RAINWATER HARVESTING: \nA SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION TO\nSTORMWATER MANAGEMENT\n\n\n\n", "id": "9171", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1511", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-01-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In most urban areas, conventional stormwater management has lead to increasing environmental and economical problems.  It is becoming increasingly important to better utilize the limited amount of available water resources as global population growth and climate change are forecasted to increase water stresses such as flooding and drought.  Locally in the Borough of State College and at the University Park Campus of the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) stormwater flooding has caused infrastructure damage and environmental ecosystem damage in terms of erosion, sedimentation, flooding and potential pollution.  Stormwater can be viewed either as an expensive threat to environmental protection and social wellbeing, or it can be viewed as an opportunity to promote micro-watershed sustainable development through the use of decentralized stormwater solutions such as rainwater harvesting (RWH). \nThe overall goal of this thesis is to demonstrate how RWH is a sustainable solution to stormwater management. Therefore, a study was conducted to investigate whether RWH could mitigate future climate change effects on stormwater runoff and help restore natural pre-development stormwater flow patterns; hence, improving stormwater quantity and quality before the runoff enters receiving waters.  RWH was also tested to determine whether it was a financially feasible answer to stormwater management.  \nIn order to conduct an urban stormwater impact assessment, hydrologic discharge data were collected from an outlet storm-sewer in the East Campus Drainage Area (ECDA) at Penn State and used to calibrate the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM).  Also, a financial comparison between a RWH system and the implementation of a green roof on a building under construction at the university with a conventional subterranean stormwater facility was assessed.  Through the simulation of five storm events, the ECDA-SWMM hydrologic results indicate that RWH at Penn State has the ability to decrease stormwater quantity peak runoff by 52.7% and total volume runoff by 46.1%.  This resulted in a potential decrease of possible future flooding events, a decrease of potential constituents of water quality pollution, and assisted in water conservation.   Results from the financial analysis indicate that through the use of rainwater harvesting instead of green roofs and conventional stormwater infrastructure, indicated that Penn State could realize savings of between $10 to $30 million dollars over the next 30 years if Penn State would invest in RWH in future buildings instead of green roofs and conventional stormwater management facilities. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1496], "author_name_tesi": "Vargas, David Mark", "last_name_ssi": "Vargas", "middle_name_ssi": "Mark", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Schuhmann", "Peggy Ann Johnson", "Richard Schuhmann", "Arthur Carl Miller", "James Michael Hamlett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Schuhmann, Thesis Advisor", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Thesis Advisor", "Richard Schuhmann, Thesis Advisor", "Arthur Carl Miller, Thesis Advisor", "James Michael Hamlett, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["stormwater management", "rainwater harvesting", "sustainability", "SWMM"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Attributional Style in Multiple Sclerosis: Examining the Learned Helplessness Model in a Chronically Ill Population", "id": "11530", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2026", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "If cognitive factors could be identified that explain additional variance in depression in the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) population, they would represent a promising target for treatment and prevention of depression in MS.

In addition, the specific vulnerability theory states that the attributions and negative events must be in the same domain.  This theory has barely been studied in MS.  Disease-related helplessness has also been shown to be associated with depression and to interact with attributional style, but there are mixed findings as to whether perceived control over illness is adaptive.  The proposed study differentiated MS-related and non-MS-related attributional style, and analyzed them along with disease-related helplessness in an attempt to determine whether the learned helplessness theory or the specific vulnerability theory apply to this population.  52 MS patients and 49 controls were included in this study.  Participants were given the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ) as well as disability and depression measures.  The majority of causes listed on the ASQ were non-MS related, and more disabled and helpless participants listed more MS-related events.  In patients, non-MS-related attributional style correlated with both stress and depression, but MS-related attributional style did not correlate with either disability or depression.  Stress mediated the effect of non-MS-related and overall attributional style on depression.  These results suggest that attributional style is an important construct in depression in MS; however, attributional style does not appear to lead directly to depression but instead to more perceived stress, which in turn leads to increased depression.

Depression prevalence in MS is high, but the etiology is not well understood.  A specific group of brain regions, the frontal-subcortical network, has consistently been shown to be related to depression in the general population.  The MS population thus represents a unique opportunity to study how neuropathology might disrupt networks in the brain and make individuals with MS more vulnerable to depression, especially if they also experience psychosocial stressors and have low social support.  Twenty-five individuals with MS completed a functional MRI scan while performing an emotional face matching task, and also completed several self-report measures.  Unified structural equation models were generated using a Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation program to examine effective connectivity during affective and neutral trials.  Data were analyzed at the individual and group level, as well as by comparing high and low depression group models.  Several connectivity measures were found to relate to depression symptoms and depression proneness.  On the individual level, fewer subcortical to cortical paths during affective trials and more cortical to subcortical paths during neutral trials were associated with depression.  When comparing high versus low depression group models, the high depression group had fewer connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and subcortical regions and fewer cortical to subcortical paths during affective trials, and fewer cortical-subcortical paths, fewer cortical to subcortical paths, and increased subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC)-amygdala connectivity during neutral trials.  Furthermore, several of these connectivity measures interacted with psychosocial variables to predict depression.  For some interactions, lower connectivity in this network interacted with higher stress to predict depression.  However, for some measures, especially during neutral trials, increased connectivity was associated with increased depression symptoms, especially if associated with higher stressors.  This study demonstrates the feasibility of testing effective connectivity in an MS population and shows that there are meaningful differences in connectivity that relate to depression in this group.

Here, molecular water is converted to oxygen and hydrogen gas via multiple proton- and electron-transfer steps. Although the product of interest is high-purity hydrogen gas fuel, the thermodynamic and kinetic requirements of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the main limiting factor. The goal of this dissertation was to develop and understand model electro- and photoelectro-catalytic systems that can address the kinetic limitations of the OER, as well as guidelines for the future development of water-splitting devices. Chapter 1 introduces the kinetic theory of heterogeneous electron-transfer reactions and how it is applied to the understanding of the water-splitting reaction. The chemical properties that make iridium oxide an ideal model electrocatalyst for the OER are discussed, as well as an overview of previous work on this material. Furthermore, the fundamentals of photo-electrochemical water-splitting are presented. Here, sunlight is used as the main driving force for producing oxygen and hydrogen. \n\nIt has been previously demonstrated that the synthesis of IrOx\u2219nH2O colloids by alkaline hydrolysis of Ir(III) or Ir(IV) salts proceeds through iridium hydroxide intermediates. Chapter 2 is a detailed spectro-electrochemical and DFT study of such intermediates and their effect in photoelectrochemical water-splitting cells. Primarily, we have identified the monomeric nature of this hydroxide intermediates as well as  their most likely chemical composition and their relative ratio between Ir(III) and Ir(IV). The results from this study address a very important, current dilemma in IrOx\u2219nH2O\u2013based photoelectrochemical water-splitting cells: how does the chemistry of the catalyst and its interface with the semiconductor influence the photoresponse of the cell? The careful preparation and characterization of both IrOx\u2219nH2O catalysts and photoanodes provide reasonable explanations to previously observed discrepancies in photoelectrochemical cells that utilize IrOx\u2219nH2O colloids as co-catalysts on the photoanode electrode. \n\nThe recent development of inexpensive electrocatalysts for the OER has suggested that efficient photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) might be constructed from terrestrially abundant materials, such as cobalt, nickel and iron. However, since these catalysts operate in aqueous buffer solutions at neutral to slightly basic pH, it is important to consider whether electrolytic cells can have low series loss under these conditions. Membranes are important components of water-splitting PECs because they prevent crossover of the cathode (e.g. hydrogen gas) products from oxygen produced at the anode. Chapter 3 is a detailed study of the resistive series losses in model electrolytic cells that utilize buffers and commercial monopolar and bipolar ion exchange membranes. Here, we have identified that long-term electrolysis of water (for periods greater than 24 hours) cannot be sustained efficiently in buffered-monopolar membrane systems due to a migration-induced concentration polarization of the electrolytic cells. In the case of buffered\u2013bipolar membrane systems, we have determined that there is a significant trade off between the resistivity of the membrane and the losses due to concentration gradients. However, under reverse bias conditions and in a pH-polarized electrolyte, bipolar membranes minimize the series losses of the membrane resistivity as well as those due to pH gradients. This configuration is particularly promising because it allows the de-coupling of the optimization of anode and cathode materials for overall water-splitting. \n\nIn Chapter 4 we focus again on the IrOx\u2219nH2O electrocatalyst and focus on a fundamental and thorough kinetic characterization of the OER on IrOx\u2219nH2O films. In a solely electrochemical study, we study the effects of temperature, pH and hydrogen/deuterium isotope on the overall OER kinetics. Preliminary results suggest that the rate of the OER in these films does not depend on the proton concentration. Interestingly, however, measurements of the hydrogen/deuterium kinetic isotope effect suggest that the mechanism in the films is rate-dependent, i.e. the kinetically-relevant surface intermediates of the OER change as a function of overpotential on IrOx\u2219nH2O films. \n\nChapter 5 is a brief compilation of Chapters 1\u20134 and their implications for future research in water-splitting systems. Finally, Appendix A focuses on introducing the reader to hydrodynamic electrochemical techniques, namely rotating ring-disk electrochemistry (RRDE). Here, the characterization of N(5)-ethylflavinium ion, a fully-organic homogeneous OER catalyst, is presented and the RRDE results confirm its catalytic performance. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10875], "author_name_tesi": "Vargas-barbosa, Nella Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Vargas-barbosa", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Nella", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Benjamin James Lear", "Lasse Jensen", "Darrell Velegol", "Barbara Jane Garrison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Chair", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Barbara Jane Garrison, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electrochemistry", "iridium oxide", "solar fuels", "catalysis", "membrane", "buffer", "photo-electrochemistry", "heterogeneous kintetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "RESPONSES TO A FIRE EMERGENCY: STUDENTS\u2019 KNOWLEDGE AND WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST ANOTHER STUDENT \n", "id": "10910", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6103", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent statistics have shown an increasing trend in the frequency and severity of emergency situations around the world, with women and people with disabilities being disproportionally impacted by these emergencies.

With the increasing enrollment of women and students with disabilities on college campuses it has become essential to assess the knowledge levels of students regarding emergency procedures, and the willingness of students to assist others during a campus emergency. For this study, quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 436 undergraduate students through a paper and pencil survey. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of four vignettes describing a fire emergency on campus with a student (male with disability/male without disability/female with disability/female without disability) seeking assistance from the participant. The vignette was followed by questions to assess participants\u2019 knowledge of emergency procedures and their willingness to assist others, a demographic questionnaire, the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, the Self-Report Altruism Scale and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that male participants reported higher levels of knowledge regarding emergency procedures than female participants. Participants who had previous experience with fire emergencies and previous training in emergency procedures also reported a higher level of knowledge of safety measures. Participants reported having less knowledge to help a student with disability as compared to a student without disability. Willingness to assist another student was positively influenced by personal factors such as higher levels of knowledge regarding emergency procedures and higher scores on the social desirability scale and the self-report altruism scale. Participants were more willing to assist another student if the student had a disability, and if the student was female. Analysis of the qualitative data revealed that students were more likely to seek input from a person requiring help if the person did not have a disability or was male. Further, willingness to help was influenced by stereotypes regarding disability and gender. Implications of these findings on research, training and practice are discussed. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6096], "author_name_tesi": "Varghese, Susan ", "last_name_ssi": "Varghese", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Susan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counselor Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa M Conyers", "Keith B Wilson", "James Taylor Herbert", "Lisa M Conyers", "Dr Beverly Vandiver"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa M Conyers, Dissertation Advisor", "Keith B Wilson, Committee Member", "James Taylor Herbert, Committee Member", "Lisa M Conyers, Committee Chair", "Dr Beverly Vandiver, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["emergency", "disability", "willingness to help", "knowledge", "gender"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "An Exploration of how Women Probation and Parole Officers Learn to Negotiate Power and Interest in the Criminal Justice System \n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "10570", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "677", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\tThe purpose of this narrative inquiry was to explore the ways women probation and parole officers learn to negotiate power and interests in the criminal justice system.

Critical feminist theory makes visible the gendered experiences of all women within patriarchal systems as they attempt to challenge systems of power.\nThe women in this study are situated within the constraints of the criminal justice system that is embedded within historical traditions that have been created and dominated by the system of patriarchy and other relations of power that affect human needs and interests. \t\n \tThis study made use of a narrative research methodology.

The first notes how the women focused on the clients, and emphasized their caring and connectedness in negotiating for them, even though that also meant being tough when necessary. The second emphasized the importance of the community, and negotiating power and interest by networking and building relationships.  The third highlights the fact that they de-emphasize gender in their focus, at the same time that they recognize patriarchal gender dynamics at play in the workplace. Thus they appear to try to reduce the salience of gender in what they say, though it is interesting that they emphasize skills and abilities often associated with women (caring, connectedness, relationship-building as networking) in negotiating power and interest. \n\tThe conclusion examines what the study contributes to critical feminist theory, the field of adult education, and criminal justice education.It also offers suggestions for further research.            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [673], "author_name_tesi": "Varner, Barbara  Eileen", "last_name_ssi": "Varner", "middle_name_ssi": "Eileen", "first_name_ssi": "Barbara ", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Irene C Baird", "Holly L Angelique", "Heather L Stuckey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Dissertation Advisor", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Chair", "Irene C Baird, Committee Member", "Holly L Angelique, Committee Member", "Heather L Stuckey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Narrative", "Negotiating Power and Interest", "Criminal Justice Education", "Women Probation and Parole Officers", "Probation and Parole", "Adult Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Optimization and control of multiscale process systems using model reduction: Application to thin-film growth\n\n", "id": "6903", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "559", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multiscale modeling has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for processes where product quality specifications range from macroscopic length scales to microscopic length scales. These multiscale models typically couple continuum macroscopic descriptions obtained from conservation laws with discrete atomistic descriptions obtained from microscopic simulations to obtain a unified description of the process which is capable of predicting phenomena at all range of length scales involved. With the increase in global competition and decrease in profit margins, efforts are being made to incorporate multiscale process models into process optimization and control frameworks. However, extensive computational requirements and the unavailability of microscopic models in closed-form present key challenges for the above task. This thesis outlines a series of methodologies developed in order to address the above problems. Initially, a framework aimed at\nefficient solution of dynamic process optimization problems constrained by partial differential equation (PDE) constraints is developed by combining nonlinear order reduction techniques for dissipative PDEs with the control vector parameterization (CVP) approach. Subsequently, the above approach is augmented to account for multiscale process models which also include microscopic simulations coupled to PDE based macroscopic description. Similarly to the previous case, the central idea is to develop a reduced order multiscale model which is computationally efficient but simultaneously preserves the accuracy of the original full-order\nmodel. This is achieved by combined nonlinear order reduction for dissipative PDEs with {it in situ} adaptive tabulation of microscopic simulation data.\n\nThe problem of feedback control of microscopic processes is also considered. The issue of non-availability of closed-form dynamic models is circumvented by deriving low-order state-space models that approximate the detailed microscopic simulations. A system identification algorithm based on Carleman linearization and subspace identification is developed for the above task. Applications of the above approach for surface roughness control during thin-film growth are presented.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [556], "author_name_tesi": "Varshney, Amit ", "last_name_ssi": "Varshney", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Antonios Armaou", "Costas D Maranas", "Ali Borhan", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Andrew Zydney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Antonios Armaou, Committee Chair", "Costas D Maranas, Committee Member", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Carleman Linearization", "System Identification", "Optimization", "Dynamic Optimization", "Modeling", "Multiscale", "Stochastic", "Model Predictive Control", "Receding Horizon Control", "Thin film growth", "Epitaxy"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Beneficial Effects Of White Button Mushrooms On The Gut Health", "id": "15408", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7213", "abstract_tesi": "White button (WB) mushrooms have been reported to have beneficial effects in the gut.

The most striking results from the metagenomic sequencing were the decrease in the Clostridia species of bacteria and increase in the Bacteroidetes species in the WB fed mice. The Clostridia species belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. This phylum contains various pathogenic groups of bacteria including Clostridium spp., Bacillus spp. and Erisypelotrix spp. The decrease in the Phylum Firmicutes in mice maintained on WB diet compared to the controls indicates that the WB helps in decreasing the pathogenic microflora in the gut. Though, the role of Bacteroidetes as a beneficial bacterium in the gut is still unclear. Both the groups of mice were experimentally challenged with Citrobacter rodentium, which induces gut inflammation that is very similar to lesions that appear in patients suffering from Ulcerative colitis and Inflammatory Bowel disease. The bacterial counts of the C. rodentium, from feces of each group of mice, were measured during its peak days i.e., day 10th and day 14th post infection. It was observed that, there was no significant change in the bacterial loads of C. rodentium in the WB fed mice compared to controls. Cytokine profile analysis of the inflamed gut tissue indicated that the WB fed mice showed higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as, IFN-g and IL-17 in the colon. Also, it was observed that WB fed mice showed increased resolution and healing of the gastrointestinal mucosa following C. rodentium infection.  The reasonable hypothesis can be that the pro- inflammatory cytokines work locally on the gut to induce a faster protective gut immune response in the WB fed mice. Thus, adding modest amounts of WB mushrooms to the diet changed the composition of the normal flora and these changes resulted in better control of inflammation and healing in the colon following infection with C. rodentium.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7203], "author_name_tesi": "Varshney, Jyotika Brajesh", "last_name_ssi": "Varshney", "middle_name_ssi": "Brajesh", "first_name_ssi": "Jyotika", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mushrooms", "mice", "infection", "immune response", "gut health"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Design of Horizontal Curves with Downgrades using Low-Order Vehicle Dynamics Models", "id": "11859", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6250", "abstract_tesi": "Geometric design of highways is an important aspect of highway engineering, and in particular, horizontal curves on highways have higher accident rates compared to straight roads.

Previous research in this area has almost exclusively relied on primarily white, non-Hispanic/Latino samples, with little attention to ethnic minority groups.  Objective: The first aim of the present study was to use a person-centered approach to identify cultural orientation profiles of Hispanic/ Latino college students and their mothers.  The second was to examine profile differences in student drinking and consequences and determine which social and intraindividual influences accounted for differences.  Two competing cross-sectional theoretical models of these influences were tested. In the first \u201cproximal-distal\u201d path model, distal influences (i.e., social influences) were associated with drinking and consequences via more proximal (i.e., intraindividual) influences. In the alternative \u201cconcurrent\u201d path model, social and intraindividual influences were concurrently associated with drinking and consequences.  Methods: A sample of 362 Hispanic/Latino first-year students and their mothers was recruited from a public university in the southeastern United States.  Students\u2019 and mothers\u2019 acculturation (U.S. and Hispanic orientation), ethnic identity, and familismo were assessed.  In addition, students completed measures related to their drinking, alcohol-related consequences, peer influences, alcohol-specific maternal behavior, contextual factors, and intraindividual factors (e.g., attitudes, beliefs).  To achieve the first aim, latent profile analysis identified distinct profiles of mother-student dyads based on their U.S./Hispanic cultural orientation, ethnic identity, and familismo.  To achieve the second aim, cross-sectional path analyses assessed the \u201cproximal-distal\u201d and \u201cconcurrent\u201d path models.  Results: Three profiles emerged: one in which students and mothers identified strongly with Hispanic culture and students identified strongly with U.S. culture (Bicultural Hispanic [BH]); one in which students and mothers identified strongly with U.S. culture but had mismatched levels of ethnic identity and familismo (U.S./Mismatched attitudes [USMA]); and one in which neither students nor mothers identified strongly with either Hispanic or U.S. culture (Marginalized [M]).  There were no differences in drinking or consequences by profile.  The \u201cproximal-distal\u201d model was selected, and indicated that membership in the M profile had significant and positive indirect effects on drinking and consequences through its associations with higher levels of maternal permissiveness and more positive attitudes about alcohol use.  Implications: Findings from the present study suggest students who feel detached from Hispanic and U.S. culture are at highest risk for heavy drinking and related consequences, and may be most in need of prevention materials.

By the time the disease has clinically manifested itself, the pathology has progressed to the neocortex. Currently, early diagnosis and understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s pathology on functional deficits is the key for the development of therapy. While volumetric measurements of the hippocampus provide excellent diagnostic assistance, post-mortem studies have shown that the earliest pathological markers of Alzheimer\u2019s (amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) are found first in olfactory areas of the brain. Clinically, olfaction is affected in the earliest stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and mild cognitive impaired (MCI) patients, a group considered to be at the highest risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. Often olfactory deficits appear prior to the manifestation of cognitive symptoms.  \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides the ability to noninvasively examine the functional and structural changes that occur prior to presentation of behavioral symptoms in individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and MCI. Therefore, in this dissertation, MRI techniques were utilized to investigate the involvement of the primary olfactory cortex in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and MCI subjects, and to determine the sensitivity of these techniques as potential diagnostic markers of disease. The same subjects were used in each analysis, therefore the subject information, behavioral tests, and data collection is the same for each chapter.  \nIn chapter 2, we used both volumetric and functional MRI (fMRI) measurements to study the diagnostic potential by investigating the primary olfactory cortex. Behavioral tests, including the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), as well as cognitive tests demonstrated olfactory and memory impairments in both Alzheimer\u2019s and MCI patient groups (one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), P < 0.0001). The volumetric MRI of the primary olfactory cortex showed decreased volume in both Alzheimer\u2019s and MCI subjects compared with age-matched normal controls (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.001). However in terms of both volume measurement and behavioral performance, MCI values ranged between those of Alzheimer\u2019s and those of normal controls. \nOn the other hand, the olfactory fMRI results showed that activation signal change in the primary olfactory cortex was significantly and nearly equally decreased in the Alzheimer\u2019s and MCI subjects when compared with normal controls (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.0001). This suggests that although behavioral and volumetric measurement may be variable in MCI subjects, their activation signal in the brain is already changing. We also established that combining the UPSIT score, hippocampal volume, and activation signal change in the primary olfactory cortex increases the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of Alzheimer\u2019s and MCI. \nIn chapter 3, the dominant role of the central olfactory system in Alzheimer\u2019s and MCI was established. Whether olfactory deficits in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and MCI are more dominantly due to peripheral or central olfactory system deterioration is unclear. While several studies agree with central olfactory system deterioration based on observations, olfactory fMRI and pathological evidence are inconclusive. The olfactory paradigm used in this study had a visual cue \u201cSmell?\u201d accompanied by either odor presentation or no odor presentation. The presentation with \u201cSmell?\u201d without congruent odor presentation allowed for analysis of the primary olfactory cortex with an afferent stimulus that was perceived as equal to the subjects. The visual and motor systems were not impaired in AD and MCI subjects therefore all no stimulus provided could be perceived as unequal. We hypothesized that if the dysfunction is outside the brain similar activation signal change would be observed in all three groups when the visual cue \u201cSmell?\u201d was presented without congruent odor and group differences would only be found when the visual cue and odor were presented congruently (this is when stimulus is perceived differently between the groups since both MCI and AD subjects have trouble with olfactory function). Without an odorant; however, the normal controls exhibited greater activation signal change compared with both the Alzheimer\u2019s and MCI subjects (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.05). This suggested central olfactory system dominance; however, our study was not able to disprove concomitant dysfunction of the peripheral olfactory system in Alzheimer\u2019s and MCI.\nIn chapter 4, functional connectivity analysis was performed on our olfactory fMRI data to learn further about the olfactory network. Functional connectivity is defined as the correlation of interregional neural interactions during particular tasks or from spontaneous activity during rest. We observed functional connectivity of the piriform was decreased to the striatum, thalamus, and anterior cingulate cortex for both Alzheimer\u2019s and MCI subjects (ANOVA, P < 0.001). The Alzheimer\u2019s group trended toward greater disconnection of the olfactory network compared with MCI subjects, although the difference did not achieve statistical significance. The trend toward preservation of connectivity in MCI subjects may explain their observed higher behavioral function.\nTherefore, we conclude that the central olfactory system is the dominant system involved in Alzheimer\u2019s and MCI patients, and is causing olfactory deficits. We demonstrated that fMRI showed decreased activation in the primary olfactory cortex of MCI subjects, and was in fact similar to the decreased activation of Alzheimer\u2019s disease subjects. This indicates consistent early functional changes in the brains of MCI subjects despite variability in their behavioral and volumetric measurements. fMRI, thus has great potential to be used as an early diagnostic marker in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and MCI, and may also be used to study the progression of disease.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9505], "author_name_tesi": "Vasavada, Megha M", "last_name_ssi": "Vasavada", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Megha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qing X Yang", "Paul Joseph Eslinger", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy", "Ralph Norgren"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qing X Yang, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Joseph Eslinger, Committee Member", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy, Committee Member", "Ralph Norgren, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Mild cognitive impairment", "olfaction", "MRI", "fMRI"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EXPLORING THE NARRATIVES OF EXPERIENCED MALE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHERS WHO VOLUNTARILY DECIDED TO LEAVE THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING", "id": "14039sjv3", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14039", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Male elementary school teachers in the United States are rare.

Eight such teachers were extensively interviewed to acquire their thoughts and stories concerning their experiences in the job of teacher, and to explore their reasons and motivations for making the decision to leave their jobs and seek new careers outside the school system.

The assumption is that countries with BITs should have higher levels of FDI than those without them. However, the effects of BITs on FDI are empirically ambiguous. This contradiction motivates the current research. A signaling game-theory model of strategic interaction between a foreign investor and a state hosting an FDI identifies the conditions under which the designs of BITs facilitate FDI. Inherent in the designs of BITs is a tradeoff between the protection of foreign investor\u2019s rights and the host state\u2019s rights. Due to the investor\u2019s uncertainty regarding the host state\u2019s environment, a BIT serves as a signaling device, indicating the quality of the latter\u2019s investment environment. The stringency of the design features becomes critical to whether or not the foreign investor decides to initiate a new investment project or reinvest earnings. The proposed model contributes to the study of foreign direct investment and international institutions. To test empirically the theoretical implications of the model, this study considers the content of expropriation provisions in 915 bilateral investment treaties (BITs) for the period 1984-2007. The data indicates not only commonalities, but also striking differences in BITs\u2019 provisions for protection against expropriation, among treaty obligations, countries, and over time. To identify variations in the protection from expropriation, a newly developed categorization of BITs arises from analyzing the content variations in all obligations regarding expropriation. This study offers a new quantitative measure for the degree of legal protection against expropriation based on the systematic design variations in BITs\u2019 expropriation provisions. Empirical analysis uses generalized method of moments (GMM). The empirical findings of the dissertation conform to the theoretical expectations that in high-risk countries, more stringent BITs facilitate FDI inflows, and in low-risk countries, BITs\u2019 designs have no statistically significant effect on FDI. The research also suggests that, without more nuanced measures in institutional design variations in BITs, conclusions regarding the causes and effects of BITs can become overly general and biased.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6306], "author_name_tesi": "Vashchilko, Tatiana ", "last_name_ssi": "Vashchilko", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tatiana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Scott Bennett Jr.", "Dr Scott Bennett", "Quan Li", "Errol Anthony Henderson", "Douglas William Lemke", "Kathy Powers", "Wenpin Tsai"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Scott Bennett Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Scott Bennett, Committee Chair", "Quan Li, Committee Chair", "Errol Anthony Henderson, Committee Member", "Douglas William Lemke, Committee Member", "Kathy Powers, Committee Member", "Wenpin Tsai, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["international investment", "signaling theory", "game theory", "design of international institutions", "BIT", "FDI", "investment agreement", "GMM"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Manufacturing and characterization of adaptive structures with fluidic flexible matrix composite tubes ", "id": "22619", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10273", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Adaptive structures are structures that have the ability to change shape, stiffness and provide damping and actuation force.

F2MC tubes have been embedded in elastomeric potting materials to create plate-like structures with similar properties as the tubes.

Rigid matrix composite (RMC) are composites reinforced with a strong fiber such as carbon fibers in a rigid matrix such as an epoxy. Matrix plays an important role in the determining the properties of the fiber composites, for instance mechanical and thermal properties can be tailored by changing molecular structure of the polymer matrix or incorporating nanoparticles in the matrix. The objective of this research is to evaluate, experimentally and analytically, at multiple length scales, the effects of adding spherical nanosilica (NS) particles on the thermomechanical properties of carbon/epoxy composites. \nStarting from a molecular scale, a novel thermodynamically fundamental mechanism is developed that simulates the cross-linking of epoxide and an aromatic amine (DETDA) curing agent. Good agreement between the simulations and the experimental results were seen for tensile modulus, glass transition temperature, and mass density. The complete simulation procedure, including cross-linking, equilibration and testing of the polymer, was carried out using reactive force fields.\nEpoxies cured with three different curing agents (3,3\u2019-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS), 4-4\u2019-DDS, and DETDA) were included in all the experiments. Epoxies with variable concentrations of NS were mechanically characterized for modulus, fracture toughness, density, and glass transition temperature. The addition of NS improved the modulus and fracture toughness, although it also decreased the glass transition temperature slightly, possibly due to the diluent component of the master batch of NS-filled bis F. This investigation provides, for the first time, a full set of 2-D lamina properties of T700 carbon fiber composites with 0 wt % NS (0NS) and 37 wt % NS (37NS) cured with DETDA. Equations for predicting the 2D properties as functions of NS and carbon fiber contents were developed using micromechanics principals and backed-out properties of T700 fibers. At the lamina level, NS increased the longitudinal and transverse compression strengths and descreased the transverse coefficient of thermal expansion, which are beneficial for overall composite performance. Using these predictive equations, a simple design exercise was conducted for [\u00b1\u03b8]5 carbon/epoxy driveshafts with and without NS, considering strength, buckling, torsional stiffness, and whirl. The use of NS improved the safety factors for strength, buckling, and torsional stiffness for all ply angles.  However, using NS increased the weight of the shaft and consequently reduced the safety factor for whirl at ply angles less than approximately 60 degrees, which is the realm where NS does not significantly increase the bending stiffness of the shaft due to the dominating effect of the fibers.\nTubular specimens with 0, 15, 25 and 34 wt % NS cured with 4,4\u2019DDS and 0 and 37 wt % NS cured with DETDA were ballistically impacted at normal incidence and evaluated for damage area and residual torsional strength. This is the first study on NS-filled composites with ballistic impact where the projectile punctures through the composite. Incoporating NS into the composite decreased the projected damage area, increased the residual torsional strength, and increased the energy absorption per unit projected damage area. Specimens manufactured with 15NS/DDS and 25NS/DDS exhibited the highest residual strengths. An analytical model was developed to calculate the damage area and residual projectile velocity after normal-incidence impact. This model is an extension of a previous energy-based model for cross-ply laminates, with original modifications developed for angle plies and dual walls. Good agreement between the experimental and analytical residual velocities was obtained. Analytical and experimental damage areas display a similar trend with NS content, but the analytical damage areas were always less than the experimental areas. \nTubular specimens with 0 and 15 wt % NS with DETDA curing agent were obliquely impacted with a ballistic projectile and subjected to residual torsional strength testing. No significant change in damage area or residual torsional strength was seen in these experiments, indicating a negligible effect of NS in an impact scenario where the oblique path of the projectile, rather than the toughness of the composite, is the main factor affecting the size of the damage zone.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16242], "author_name_tesi": "Vashisth, Aniruddh ", "last_name_ssi": "Vashisth", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aniruddh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Charles E.

This study uses longitudinal data to examine the directionality of this association.  METHOD: Our sample included college students who had not engaged in sexual intercourse prior to the start of the study (N=180).  The sample was 49% female, 29% African American and 27% Latino American, and had a mean age of 18.4 years old at T1. At four time points students reported whether they had engaged in sexual intercourse and rated themselves on appearance orientation and appearance evaluation.  RESULTS: Participants who were more satisfied with their appearance were more likely to transition to first intercourse during college, but appearance orientation did not predict engaging in first sexual intercourse.  This association existed for both men and women, but not for African Americans.  We also found limited evidence for an increase in appearance evaluation after first intercourse, particularly for male and European American students.

Future studies should follow students from early adolescence to determine if these associations are similar in those who engage in first intercourse at an earlier age.\n \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5500], "author_name_tesi": "Vasilenko, Sara A.", "last_name_ssi": "Vasilenko", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Sara", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eva Sharon Lefkowitz", "Eva Sharon Lefkowitz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eva Sharon Lefkowitz, Thesis Advisor", "Eva Sharon Lefkowitz, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sexual behavior", "body image"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Sexual behavior and mental health in late adolescence", "id": "12200", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13279", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Much of the research on sexual behavior in adolescence has focused on factors that predict whether adolescents engage in sexual behavior or use contraception, with the goal of preventing STIs and pregnancy.  However, sexual behavior may be associated with a broader range of health outcomes, and relatively little is known about how sexual behavior impacts mental health.  In this dissertation, I extend the literature on associations between sexual behavior and mental health in late adolescence in three papers.  In Paper 1 I present a conceptual model of how sexual behavior may be associated with physical, mental and social health in adolescence, and review the relevant literature in these areas.  This paper emphasizes how sexual behavior may be associated with different outcomes due to individual and relationship factors, and how individuals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perceptions of their behavior may affect how sexual behavior is associated with later mental and social health.  In Paper 2 I examine how college students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 daily affect may vary depending upon whether they had sex on that day and by  situational factors of their sexual experience, using a subsample of students from the University Life Study (ULS) who engaged in vaginal sex at least once during 14 days of daily data collection during their first six semesters in college (N=364; 57.4% female; 29.1% Hispanic/Latino [HL], 25.0% non-HL European American, 17.3% non-HL Asian American, 17.0% non-HL African American, 11.5% non-HL multiracial).  Students had more positive affect and less negative affect on days they were sexually active compared to days they were not.  In addition, students reported more negative affect on days they had sex with a non-dating, compared to dating partner.  They also had more positive affect on days they perceived more positive consequences of sex, and more negative affect on days they perceived more negative consequences of sex.  In Paper 3, I examine whether college students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 psychological distress changed after they engaged in first intercourse, whether these changes were temporary or persisted in the long-term, and how such changes differed depending on situational factors of the sexual experience.  I use data from a subsample of participants in the ULS who reported first intercourse between their second and sixth semester of college (N=119; 47.1% female; 22.7% Hispanic-Latino [HL], 30.3% non-HL European American, 13.5% non-HL Asian American, 17.6% non-HL African American and 5.9% non-HL multiracial).  Students reported less psychological distress after they engaged in first intercourse compared to their pre-sex trajectories, and this effect was not temporary but persisted for several semesters after first intercourse.  Participants who had sex with a non-dating partner experienced a greater increase in distress over time, but experienced a greater decrease in distress after first intercourse compared to those who had sex with a dating partner.  In addition, students who perceived more positive consequences experienced a smaller decrease in distress after first intercourse.  Taken together, these papers suggest that sexual behavior is associated with better mental health in college students.  However, associations between sexual behavior and mental health may differ depending on factors such as perceptions of the event and relationship with sexual partner, highlighting the variability in individuals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sexual experiences and the importance of studying individual, relational and situational factors as moderators.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12826], "author_name_tesi": "Vasilenko, Sara A.", "last_name_ssi": "Vasilenko", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Sara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eva S.

Both cognition and biomarkers of physical health, such as blood pressure, grip strength and pulmonary function, are complex traits, influenced by both genes and environments. They are also dynamic traits, with the contributors to their variances changing across time. The purpose of this dissertation was to evaluate to what extent cognitive function and physical function share genetic and environmental influences and how these genetic and environmental factors contribute to changes in cognitive function and physical function over time. The first study evaluated to what extent cognitive function and physical function share genetic and environmental influences and to what extent are these influences unique to each phenotype. Through quantitative genetic modeling, a common phenotype was revealed to underlie the relationship between cognitive function and two biomarkers of physical health: grip strength and pulmonary function. The majority of the variance in this common phenotype was accounted for by genetic factors.  This common phenotype, though, did not load onto two other physical health measures, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. However, these blood pressure measures were moderately correlated with the common factor that included cognitive function. The second study examined to what extent sex influences the quantitative genetic relationship between cognitive function and both grip strength and pulmonary function. Across several cognitive domains, the covariation between cognitive function and these two biomarkers differed between sexes. This difference was also evident in measures of longitudinal change for each trait. The final study incorporated APOE e4 allele status as a moderator in a quantitative genetic model of the covariation between blood pressure and cognitive ability, and the longitudinal relationship between these traits. APOE e4 allele status significantly moderated environmental pathways. Specifically, the amount of environmental variance in each trait, and the environmental covariance between blood pressure and cognitive ability, was greater in APOE e4 carriers, suggesting that the relationship between blood pressure and cognitive function is more sensitive to environmental factors in the presence of the APOE e4 allele. This study also presented a useful tool in integrating measured genotypes into quantitative genetic models. This technique provides a way to quantify the influence of both measured genetic and environmental factors on the quantitative variation of complex traits. The findings of this research shed light on how genetic and environmental factors contribute to the relationship between cognitive ability and physical function. Moreover, these findings support the need for more research to uncover what underlying phenotypes may be contributing to this relationship and to evaluate how specific genes and environments interact to influence the relationship between cognitive ability and physical function.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6120], "author_name_tesi": "Vasilopoulos, Terrie ", "last_name_ssi": "Vasilopoulos", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Terrie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George Patrick Vogler", "Jenae Marie Neiderhiser", "David John Vandenbergh", "Gerald Eugene Mc Clearn", "George Patrick Vogler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George Patrick Vogler, Dissertation Advisor", "Jenae Marie Neiderhiser, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Member", "Gerald Eugene Mc Clearn, Committee Member", "George Patrick Vogler, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["biomarkers", "pulmonary function", "grip strength", "blood pressure", "quantitative genetics", "twins", "aging"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A quantitative assessment of product form and its impact on customer perception and design education ", "id": "19013", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8588", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tQuantifying the geometric form of a design artifact has vast implications in product design ranging from the ability to foster a better understanding of engineering design concepts to predicting customers\u2019 perceptions of aesthetics qualities.

However, the reproductive efficiency of dairy farms has decreased due to the excessive focus on milk production and inadvertent inattention of reproductive performance in genetic selection decisions. This has led to a near 50% reduction in conception rates and high economic loss to the industry. Most of the embryo loss occurs during peri-implantation period. The hypothesis for this study is that conceptus secretions alter the uterine mucosal immune system to facilitate a tolerogenic environment for the conceptus and failure or inadequate modulation leads to embryo loss\n Whether Natural Killer (NK) cells and other lymphoid lineage cells have a role in the uterine environment during early pregnancy in cattle was investigated as their dysfunction causes infertility in other species. A 30% increase in CD45+ CD8+ (cytotoxic T cell) and CD45+ NKp46+ (NK) cells in the endometrium during early pregnancy using flow cytometry was observed. This is the first report of these cells increasing during bovine pregnancy and it was further established that CD8 and NKp46 molecules are co-localized on significant portion of cells. These cells could be similar to nonconventional CD3+ NK cell subset reported in bovine peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC). To assess whether uterine immune cells from pregnant animals could suppress autologous peripheral T cells, T cells were cultured in the presence of uterine immune cells. No effect of uterine immune cells from pregnant heifers was observed on peripheral T cell proliferation. Interestingly, uterine immune cells from cyclic heifers did stimulate proliferation of autologous peripheral T cells. Therefore, uterine immune cells from pregnant animals are less stimulatory compared to those from cyclic animals. CD45+ uterine cells from day 17 of pregnancy exhibited greater degranulation against K562 cells compared to those from day 17 of cycle and to autologous peripheral immune cells from day 17 pregnant animals. Interferon tau can induce cytotoxicity of NK cells and this could explain increase in degranulation during day 17 of pregnancy.  Inhibitory interactions between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells (APC) could be regulating immune cell function to facilitate a tolerogenic environment during pregnancy.  The inhibitory molecule, CD274 can interact with programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1) on lymphocytes and induce T cell anergy. An 18-fold increase in CD274 transcripts were observed with pregnancy and also a decrease between day 17 and day 20 of pregnancy in the endometrium. An increase in cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) with pregnancy was also noted. When CTLA-4 interacts with CD80/86 on APC, it leads to development of tolerogenic APC, which can, in turn, cause T cell anergy. This is the first report of the presence of these inhibitory molecules during pregnancy in the bovine endometrium. \nThe secretion of cytokines by uterine immune cells during pregnancy was also investigated. An increase in CD45+ interleukin (IL)10+ cells with pregnancy and increase in CD45+ interferon gamma (IFNG)+ cells between day 17 and day 20 of pregnancy was observed. The proportion of CD45+ CD8+ cells decreased between day 17 and day 20 of pregnancy along with the abundance of cytotoxic granule, Granzyme A (GZMA) mRNA suggesting CD8 T cells are functional. Endometrial protein expression was evaluated and a decrease in IL10, transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein expression between day 17 and day 20 of pregnancy was observed.  This decrease in protein expression of several immune related factors between day 17 and 20 of pregnancy led to investigation of effects of conceptus secretions, interferon tau (IFNT) and pregnancy specific protein B (PSPB) during this period.\nPregnancy specific glycoprotein B is a member of the large the pregnancy associated glycoprotein family and is produced by the bovine trophectoderm during early pregnancy. These proteins are detectable in the maternal blood stream as early as day 24 of gestation. A 200-fold increase in the concentration of PSPB in the uterus between day 17 and 20 of pregnancy was observed. This led to evaluation of whether PSPB affects immune cell function during pregnancy. Uterine immune cell proliferation was inhibited by addition of physiological concentrations of PSPB in vitro. This effect was more pronounced in the CD3 (T cell) subset of uterine immune cells. There was no effect of PSPB on peripheral blood immune cell proliferation even in the presence of uterine parenchymal cell secretions. This led to the conclusion that uterine immune cells are unique in their response to conceptus secretions. No effects of PSPB on degranulation of immune cells were observed. \nTo summarize, this study aimed at evaluating the lymphocyte phenotype and functions during early pregnancy in dairy heifers. There was an increase in CD8+ immune cells in the endometrium with pregnancy. The uterine immune cells from day 17 pregnant animals have higher degranulation, increased production of IL10 and were not able to suppress proliferation of autologous immune cells. Data from this study suggest a role for conceptus secreted protein PSPB in inhibiting immune cell proliferation. Thus results from the study provide new insights into the role of immune cells and their regulation during early pregnancy in cattle and can lead to further studies evaluating the immunological causes of infertility in mature lactating dairy cows.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13073], "author_name_tesi": "Vasudevan, Sreelakshmi ", "last_name_ssi": "Vasudevan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sreelakshmi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Troy L Ott", "Troy L Ott", "Joy L Pate", "Magherita Cantorna", "Alan L Johnson", "Na Xiong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Troy L Ott, Dissertation Advisor", "Troy L Ott, Committee Chair", "Joy L Pate, Committee Member", "Magherita Cantorna, Committee Member", "Alan L Johnson, Outside Member", "Na Xiong, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pregnancy", "Natural killer cells", "Cytotoxic T cells", "Endometrium", "Dairy heifers", "Immunology", "cytokines"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Methods for Autonomous Planning and Guidance of Endobronchial Ultrasound", "id": "14434viv5030", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14434", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Multidimensional Image Processing Lab (MIPL) at The Pennsylvania State University has\nbeen developing software to help physicians stage and diagnose lung cancer for over twenty years.\nIn particular, MIPL has developed the Multimodal Virtual Navigation System (MVNS) that can\nbe used to help physicians navigate to regions of interest (ROIs) for lung biopsies.

Seventeenth-century Spanish theater reveals both practical and aesthetic value for such characters; while authors, particularly playwrights, utilized artist characters for literary ends, they concurrently allied themselves with real artists fighting for greater social recognition for their work and allowed their artists characters to express those concerns on the page as well as on the stage.  The development of the artist novel and the K\u00fcnstlerroman (the novel of artistic development) in the nineteenth century reflected not only the achievement of social recognition sought by artists of prior generations, but also the development of the Romantic \u201ccharismatic myth of the artist,\u201d which would go on to characterize general societal perception of artists (and their literary representations) for the next century. While the artist figure never disappears from Spanish literary production, the scholarly study of such figures wanes in current contemporary investigation. However, the sheer number of contemporary novels featuring artist protagonists suggests a startling phenomenon which deserves critical recognition. My dissertation aims to fill this lacuna by asking how the representation of the artist has necessarily changed, both in the repressive atmosphere of Franco\u2019s Spain and the Spain of the Transition to democracy, which experienced a veritable explosion of freedom and excess, and subsequently, of a profound disappointment with the new social systems. \n\tMy dissertation explores, in short, the literary representation of the contemporary Spanish art world and demonstrates how the authors of modern Spain have confronted the myth of the artist carried over from the Romantic period. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s theories of the \u201ccultural field,\u201d I examine the ways authors confront the notion of the artist as genius who creates not for material gain or recognition, but because he or she is moved by some unseen force of Art. The demythification of the artist is most often achieved textually by the author\u2019s exposing of the complex systems which undergird the art world, thus destroying the notion of \u201cdisinterestedness\u201d and a \u201cpure aesthetic\u201d which ostensibly drives artists to create. I explore several variations on this theme as the Spanish authors represent them. In Chapter 1, I look closely at the representation of bohemian artists as frauds in post-war three novels of female development: Carmen Laforet\u2019s Nada (1944) and La isla y los demonios (1952), and Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite\u2019s Entre visillos (1958). The idea of the bohemian artist as a different kind of person and a true \u201cfree spirit\u201d is dismantled as the young female protagonists find in the artist\u2019s studio and in their company that the same closed-minded attitudes towards women, and even towards art, that they find in the wider world are found in the studio as well. Chapter 2 is a study of the contemporary artist novel or K\u00fcnstlerroman as embodied by \u00c1ngeles Caso\u2019s El mundo visto desde el cielo (1997) and Julio Llamazares\u2019s El cielo de Madrid (2005). These novels portray the artist protagonists\u2019 attempts to enact the charismatic myth of the artist even when the realities of the postmodern art word and the changing face of Spanish society in the Transition and post-Transition deny them that option. Chapter 3 examines two contemporary K\u00fcnstlerrinromane, or female artist novels: Almudena Grandes\u2019s Castillos de cart\u00f3n (2006) and Clara Us\u00f3n\u2019s Coraz\u00f3n de napalm (2009).  In these novels, the feminine protagonists face a very different set of challenges than their male counterparts studied in Chapter 2. Rather than the dilemma of living out the myth or not, the female artists struggle to accrue cultural capital and become professionally and commercially successful, all the while battling the social pressure to marry, have children, and conform in traditional ways that do not correspond to the \u201cartistic personality.\u201d I explore these societal pressures through a post-feminist lens while considering their implications for the female artist protagonists. In Chapter 4, I consider the representation of the art-historian protagonist in la novela hist\u00f3rica culturalista, a heretofore unexplored aspect of the artistic field as depicted in the Spanish novel of the twenty-first century. Though there are actually a surprising number of this type of novel from which to choose, I study Eduardo Mendoza\u2019s Ri\u00f1a de gatos, Madrid 1936 (2010) and Lourdes Ortiz\u2019s Las manos de Vel\u00e1zquez (2006), both of which feature art historian protagonists who study Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. \nThe recognition of the societal forces which shape the artist and his or her work is one of the central tenets of my project, as those forces contribute integrally to the demythification of the artist which all of the authors in question in some way undertake. While they reveal the inner workings of the cultural field, the novels as cultural artifacts become yet another voice in that field which constructs our understanding of artists. Through their reflection on the economic, cultural, spiritual, and personal effects that the art market in Spain has on the artists in their novels, they are also able to add their own voice to the many others that help to construct the contemporary vision of the artist. At the same time, they are able to comment, by extension, on the changing socio-economic conditions in Spain, as well as their own participation in the literary cultural field. Balanced between attention to canonical authors (such as Carmen Laforet, Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite, Eduardo Mendoza, Almudena Grandes, and Julio Llamazares) and rising stars, my work complements current scholarly trends in Spanish literary studies and proposes a fresh look at the way contemporary Spanish authors view the role of art and artists (both visual and literary) in their society.  \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9722], "author_name_tesi": "Vater, Katie Jean", "last_name_ssi": "Vater", "middle_name_ssi": "Jean", "first_name_ssi": "Katie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew J Marr", "William Robert Blue", "Guadalupe Mart\u00ed Pe\u00f1a", "Maria Rosa Truglio", "Charlotte Marie Houghton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew J Marr, Dissertation Advisor", "William Robert Blue, Committee Member", "Guadalupe Mart\u00ed Pe\u00f1a, Committee Member", "Maria Rosa Truglio, Committee Member", "Charlotte Marie Houghton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Novel", "Artist", "K\u00fcnstlerroman", "historical novel", "post-war novel", "Bourdieu", "cultural field"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Assembly and characterization of complex biomimetic membranes\n", "id": "9376", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3610", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-01-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Biomembranes are complex and heterogeneous dynamic systems, which play vital role in numerous cellular processes such as signaling and membrane trafficking.  Model membranes provide simpler alternative platforms for studying biomembrane dynamics under well-controlled environments.  In this Dissertation, we present an assembly of complex biomimetic systems based on supported lipid bilayers that mimic the cell membrane and yield information about lipid-protein and lipid-lipid interactions at the molecular level.  \nHere, we discuss a modified polymer lift-off based model system in which chemical complexity is introduced into supported planar membranes by constructing arrays of micrometer-sized domains of a particular lipid composition that are surrounded by a different lipid composition (Chapter 3).  Fluorescence microscopy and correlation spectroscopy are used to characterize these patterned backfilled samples.  We observe that lipids within the majority of domains undergo anomalous diffusion, which results from nonideally mixed gel phase lipid clusters within the fluid domains.  These results suggest that, while membrane patterning is useful for biophysical and biosensor applications, a thorough and systematic characterization of the assembled complex biomimetic membrane is essential.  Only then can biomimetic membranes provide a useful platform for assembly of integrated biosensors and screening tools of biological relevance. \nIn another study, chemical complexity is introduced into supported planar bilayers for use as a possible drug discovery platform (Chapter 4).  To validate our assay, we used supported membranes containing haptenated lipids in two different environments, haptenated fluid bilayers and immobilized haptens, to challenge immunoglobulin E (IgE)-sensitized mast cells.  The haptenated bilayers are characterized with fluorescence imaging and correlation spectroscopy, and cell activation is assessed using imaging and biochemical assays (e.g. stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and degranulation).  This assay may eventually allow for screening and identification of possible agonists and antagonists.\nAnother area where model systems can play a crucial role includes deciphering the physical mechanisms leading to protein and lipid self-organization in biomembranes.  This area is inadequately understood due to the dynamic and complicated nature of intact cellular membranes, where multiple processes occur in parallel.  We discuss the assembly and characterization of chemically complex biomimetic membranes in which a representative peripheral protein, annexin A5 (anx A5) is specifically bound or not (Chapter 5).  (Anx A5 binds specifically to anionic membranes in the presence of calcium.)  Anx A5 protein binds as monomers or clusters to phosphatidylserine-containing bilayers.  Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was used to measure the lipid lateral diffusion, both in the presence and absence of bound anx A5.  We determined that anx A5 binding to lipid membranes affects the lateral motion in a lipid-specific manner, which is interesting given that anx A5 specifically interacts with anionic lipids in the presence of calcium.  In a related study, cholesterol is included to form ternary planar bilayers.  We investigated the effect of anx A5 binding on lipid distribution and lateral diffusion (Chapter 6).  Interestingly, we observed protein-induced lipid-lipid demixing, (phase separation) in cholesterol-containing membranes only for the anionic lipid analog, but not for a zwitterionic lipid analog.  We conclude that protein-induced lipid domain formation is not only sensitive to lipid composition but also to calcium concentration.  Taken together, this Dissertation establishes that chemically well-defined biomimetic membranes can yield molecular level insight into fundamental cellular processes.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3590], "author_name_tesi": "Vats, Kanika  ", "last_name_ssi": "Vats", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kanika ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Erin Elizabeth Sheets", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Tae Hee Lee", "Dr, Ahmed A Heikal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Erin Elizabeth Sheets, Dissertation Advisor", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets, Committee Chair", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Tae Hee Lee, Committee Member", "Dr, Ahmed A Heikal, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["protein-lipid interactions", "micropatterning", "biomimetic membranes"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "FRACTURE HEIGHT CONTAINMENT IN THE STIMULATION OF ORISKANY FORMATION\n", "id": "11871", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6348", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Oriskany formation has been a prolific producer of natural gas in the Appalachian basin since 1930s.

However, the storage wells suffer from an annual deliverability loss of 5% owing to the various damage mechanisms.\nA lot of work pertaining to the issue of identification of damage mechanisms, and subsequent development of stimulation technology in order to mitigate the damage and restore the wells deliverability has been done in a joint effort between The Gas Research Institute, Department of Energy, American Gas Association and the various other operator companies involved in the storage industry. Operators mostly rely on traditional methods such as blowing, washing, reperforating, acidizing, infill drilling to restore wells deliverability. These traditional methods do provide short term benefits but the longevity is not sustained and the overall situation remains same. Hydraulic fracturing is not preferred in terms of legitimate concerns over excessive vertical height growth, long fracture fluid clean up times, lack of expertise and cost.\nThis research study was carried out to understand the various damage mechanisms affecting the Oriskany wells, with a focus on gas storage wells. I then developed a dataset of reservoir properties, rock properties and fracture treatment data for Oriskany based on a complete literature review and calculations from a sonic log. New stimulation methods were developed based on a systematic parametrical study on the type of fracture fluids, injection rate, types of proppant, treatment volume, reservoir pressure and treatment schedule. These new methods lead to increased well deliverability, fracture height containment and higher average fracture conductivity.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6348], "author_name_tesi": "Vatsa, Tushar ", "last_name_ssi": "Vatsa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tushar", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yilin Wang", "Yilin Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yilin Wang, Thesis Advisor", "Yilin Wang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Oriskany Sandstone"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "POLLEN NUTRITION,  THE FOUNDATION OF BUMBLE BEE FORAGING", "id": "13355adv124", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13355", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Angiosperms and insect pollinators, especially bees, share a rich ecological and evolutionary history in which the radiation of the groups occurred through coevolutionary processes. This is because flowers facilitate reproduction through the transfer of pollen by attracting bees to flowers, and providing bees their entire source of nutrition. Historically, it was believed that bees were innately destined to visit flowers that provided specific or attractive morphologies, colors, or scents, known as pollination syndromes. However, individuals within bee species may visit and collect resources from different plant species during the day, season, and across years. Bee nutrition is partitioned between floral nectar which provides energy (carbohydrates) for foraging bees to collect nutritionally complex pollen (protein, lipids, and micronutrients). Because pollen quality differs between plant species and affects the health and development of bee larvae and adults, we expect that bee species forage to collect the right balance of pollen nutrients from their host-plant species. Therefore, if bees have species-specific nutritional needs, it may explain the foraging patterns among host-plant species observed. In this dissertation, I reveal that bumble bees (Bombus impatiens, Hymenoptera: Apidae) may actively select and balance their pollen diet among host-plant species to meet their optimum nutritional needs of protein and lipids, or protein:lipid ratio. This discovery was confirmed by 1) relating bumble bee pollen foraging preferences among host-plant species to pollen nutritional quality 2) assessing bumble bee preferences for pollen isolated from the host-plant species, 3) assessing bumble bee preferences to single source pollen modified to different protein:lipid ratios and concentrations, 4) assessing bumble bee regulation of synthetic diets modified to different protein:lipid ratios and concentrations, and finally 5) verifying these results in field studies by determining the nutritional value of pollen collected by free foraging colonies in which colonies defended their nutrient intake ratios independent of landscape. This dissertation presents a new theory that bees may be floral generalists, but nutritional specialists, adding a new dimension to previous assumptions of pollination syndromes. The particular floral traits involved in syndromes (i.e. color, morphology, scent) may have evolved as discriminative stimuli that bees associate with reward quality.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13534], "author_name_tesi": "Vaudo, Anthony Domiano", "last_name_ssi": "Vaudo", "middle_name_ssi": "Domiano", "first_name_ssi": "Anthony", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christina M Grozinger", "Christina M Grozinger", "John Frazier Tooker", "Heather M Hines", "David A Mortensen", "Harland Martin Patch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christina M Grozinger, Dissertation Advisor", "Christina M Grozinger, Committee Chair", "John Frazier Tooker, Committee Member", "Heather M Hines, Committee Member", "David A Mortensen, Outside Member", "Harland Martin Patch, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pollination", "nutritional ecology", "pollinator", "foraging preferences", "colony development", "nutrient regulation", "pollen nutrition", "behavioral ecology", "conservation ecology"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Nanosheets by Design: The Controllable Synthesis of Group IV-VI Layered Semiconductor Chalcogenide Nanostructures Using Colloidal Chemistry", "id": "20013", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9578", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nanosheets, a class of nanomaterials with two-dimensional structure and atomic or molecular scale thickness, have attracted a great deal of interest from the scientific community due to excellent physical properties and several promising applications in optoelectronics, energy conversion and storage, and catalysis. While advances in the synthesis of 2D nanostructures using \u201ctop-down\u201d chemical and physical strategies such as exfoliation and mechanical cleavage have been achieved, improved synthesis may be realized by applying \u201cbottom-up\u201d colloidal strategies where nanosheets are \u201cbuilt\u201d directly from solution in an atomic layer-by-layer fashion.  In this dissertation, I will discuss recent advances in the synthesis of semiconductor nanosheets with controllable lateral dimension, thickness, hierarchical structure, and porosity, specifically focusing on a class of group IV-VI layered semiconductor chalcogenides (GeS, GeSe, SnS, and SnSe) as a model system. Finally, I will highlight my efforts for expanding the synthetic framework mentioned above to access other materials, including the colloidal synthesis of germanium and Ge-based nanostructures.  \n\nTo begin, a solution-based chemical approach for the synthesis of colloidal germanium sulfide (GeS) and germanium selenide (GeSe) nanosheets is described. It is found that the GeS and GeSe nanosheets adopted a uniform hexagonal crystallite morphology with lateral dimensions on the order of several microns and thicknesses that ranged between <10 to 100 nm. The nanosheets were characterized by various analytical techniques including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and current-voltage (I-V) conductivity measurements. The results of these experiments confirmed the initial hypothesis that the group IV-VI layered semiconductor chalcogenides (LSC) can be made as nanomaterials using colloidal methods and that they indeed form as 2D nanosheets.\n\nIn a follow-up study it is shown that the chemistry used for producing 2D nanostrucures of GeS and GeSe could be extended to the synthesis of the tin-based analogues including SnSe. The resulting SnSe nanosheets formed as size-uniform square-like crystallites with lateral dimensions on the order of 0.5 microns and thicknesses that could be controlled between 10-40 nm by modifying the starting tin and selenium reagent concentrations. Time-dependent aliquot studies helped to rationalize this observation and a formation pathway for the nanosheets is proposed. The conclusion of this work provided evidence that nanosheets with controlled thickness can be synthesized using \u201cbottom-up\u201d chemical methods and that potential colloidal nanosheet design strategies may be plausible.\n\nUtilizing similar chemical methods, this hypothesis was further confirmed in the synthesis of laterally controlled 2D SnS nanostructures. It was demonstrated that nanosheets of SnS with square, disc-like, hexagonal, and rectangular lateral dimensions on the order of 0.5 microns could be prepared by simply modifying the coordinating ligands used in the starting tin precursor. This is significant in that the edge sites of layered materials, in many cases, are the active sites for catalytic reactions and therefore understanding the parameters leading to lateral control in these 2D nanomaterials may afford better catalysts. Further studies using an iodide-based metal tin precursor (SnI2) revealed that the assembly of 2D SnS nanosheets into 3D hierarchical \u201cflower-like\u201d nanostructures could be achieved. These results provided evidence that not only were nanosheets of controlled thickness obtainable, but by the use of bottom-up colloidal strategies, nanosheets with arbitrarily controlled lateral dimension and hierarchal structure were accessible as well.\n\t\nIn collaboration with Dr. Ian Sines, a former member of the Schaak lab, the nanosheet design strategy is further validated with the development of an anion exchange pathway that converts SnSe nanosheets to single crystal NaCl-type SnTe nanosheets. The chemical transformation is accomplished by the reaction of the SnSe nanosheet substrates described in the work above with a novel trioctylphosphine-tellerium anion exchange precursor developed by Dr. Sines. The reaction resulted in a SnTe product with preserved 2D nanosheet morphology, however, in the process acquiring a secondary porous structure. The results of this study showed the ability to convert one 2D nanomaterial into another using a colloidal conversion process and that this preservation of 2D morphological structure (SnSe) can occur in a primarily 3D bonded material (SnTe). In addition, it demonstrates a novel pathway for introducing secondary morphology, such as porosity, into colloidally designed 2D nanostructure templates.\n\nNext, it is shown that flat 1D nanostructures of GeSe with rectangular cross-section can be synthesized. Maintaining the planar geometry of the underlying 2D crystal structure, the resulting GeSe nanobelts showed an average diameter of approximately 80 nm, a thickness to width ratio of \u223c1:2, and lengths that ranged from approximately 1-25 micrometers. Due to the elongated morphology, individual GeSe nanobelts could be easily aligned between gold electrodes for single particle 2- and 4-point electrical measurements. In addition, an indirect band gap of approximately 1.1 eV was determined by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements. Overall, this work improved upon the colloidal design strategy by extendeding capabilities for the modification of the underlying IV-VI LSC 2D crystal structre to give shape-controlled 1D nanomaterials, in addition to the 2D nanostructures presented above. \n\n0D nanocrystals could also be produced in the IV-VI LSC system using a rapid injection protocol. The as-synthesized SnS nanocrystals were both uniform in size and morphology with average diameters of approximately 10 and 12 nm for the SnS spherical polyhedra and nanocubes, respectively. In collaboration with Adam Biachhi, a colleague in the Schaak lab, it was discovered that a modification in crystal structure occurs for tin(II) sulfide when confined to a 0D nanoparticle geometry. For both spherical and cubic SnS nanocrystals, it is found that the typical orthorhombic GeS-type crystal structure adopted by bulk SnS is distorted to give a slightly modified pseudo-tetragonal polymorph for the SnS nanocrystals. Collectively, these results show that the crystallographic driving force for 2D growth in the layered IV-VI materials can be overcome to give spherical particles and that when confined to this 0D non-planar geometry a distortion in crystal structure occurs.\n\nFinally, it is demonstrated that the synthetic methods developed for the synthesis of group IV-VI layered semiconductor nanocrystals can be extended toward the synthesis of novel germanium and Ge-based nanomaterials. In this case, elemental germanium nanoparticles were made in a one-pot reaction under milder conditions than those previously used in the literature and the first colloidal synthesis of hexagonal Fe3Ge2 nanocrystals and monoclinic FeGe nanowires is described. These studies represent a rare example of the synthesis of colloidal Ge and Ge-based nanomaterials and suggest that other Ge-based material systems may be accessible using colloidal strategies. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9346], "author_name_tesi": "Vaughn, Dimitri Duval", "last_name_ssi": "Vaughn", "middle_name_ssi": "Duval", "first_name_ssi": "Dimitri", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "Thomas E Mallouk", "John B Asbury", "Donghai Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "John B Asbury, Committee Member", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanoscience", "Layered Semiconductors", "Nanosheets", "Germanium", "Colloidal Synthesis", "Chalcogenide"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Multidimensional Information System for Human Reliability Assessment: Applied to Patient Adherence\n", "id": "12632", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4070", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Patient non-adherence with treatment goals and medical guidance poses significant health risks for the patient and a financial burden on the health care system. Diabetes is a highly prevalent chronic condition the treatment of which is confounded by high levels of treatment non-adherence. In the context of health care, adherence is defined as the extent to which a patient meets his/her treatment goals (diet, exercise, medication, disease monitoring, etc.) that are guided and informed by the provider. Throughout the treatment period, several performance shaping or prognostic factors may enhance or hinder the patient\u2019s ability to adhere to treatment goals. Human Reliability Assessment (HRA) can be proactively implemented to elucidate and quantify the factors impacting and resulting from patient adherence. This research aims to provide reliable and systematic measures for patient adherence risk identification, evaluation and mitigation using a HRA approach.  \n\nThe Multidimensional Information System for Human Reliability Assessment (MISHRA) was developed to identify the significant causal factors and manifestations of patient non-adherence. This information is presented in a clinical decision making framework to support risk mitigation with the ultimate goal of improving patient self-management. MISHRA\u2019s empirically-driven methodology is structured into three-stages: 1) Identify human response (behavioral modeling of adherence dimensions \u2013 when, how, why); 2) Estimate response probabilities (statistical modeling to determine significant dimension factors and interactions); and 3) Support the development of mitigating measures (network heuristic modeling to inform factor selection). The human response dimensions provide an empirically based and contextually specific approach for risk assessment that goes a step beyond traditional causal factor analyses.\n\nMISHRA was empirically built and validated for self monitoring of blood glucose adherence in diabetes patients. Empirical study results and patient case studies are presented for the aforementioned methodological stages to provide preliminary guidance for diabetes providers in the selection of significant dimension factors. MISHRA has the potential to be applied to wide variety of health behaviors and other high-risk domains. Potential long-term beneficial outcomes of integrating MISHRA in treatment decisions include: 1) an increase in patient self-management, 2) a reduction in chronic and acute conditions in the patient population and 3) a significant decrease in patient and healthcare system resource utilization. \n&#8195;\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4045], "author_name_tesi": "Vaughn-Cooke, Monifa ", "last_name_ssi": "Vaughn-Cooke", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Monifa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard", "Harriet Black Nembhard", "Jan Ulbrecht", "Andris Freivalds", "Gul Kremer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harriet Black Nembhard, Dissertation Advisor", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Committee Chair", "Jan Ulbrecht, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "Gul Kremer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["diabetes self-management", "risk assessment", "human error", "human reliability assessment", "self-monitoring of blood glucose", "patient adheernce"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Stakeholder Perceptions of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Effectiveness in Increasing School Enrollment in India", "id": "16371", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "8283", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines how diverse stakeholders involved with school enrollments perceive the effectiveness of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in increasing school enrollment in India.

Crystal structures of the ribozyme have been solved in both precleaved and product forms and reveal an intricate network of interactions that conspire to catalyze bond cleavage.  In addition, extensive biochemical studies have been performed to work out a mechanism for bond cleavage in which C75 and a magnesium ion catalyze the reaction by general acid-base chemistry.  Some questions that have remained unclear in this and other ribozymes is the nature of long-distance communication between peripheral regions of the RNA and the buried active site, the roles of metal ions within and near the active site, and the structural effects of varying pH and its consequent impact on catalysis.  \n\nWe performed molecular dynamics simulations and non-linear Poisson Boltzmann electrostatic calculations on the HDV ribozyme in the precleaved and product forms and assessed the above probing questions. Overall, these studies indicate that small functional RNAs have the potential to communicate interactions over long distances, and that wild-type RNAs may have evolved ways to prevent such interactions from interfering with catalysis. We identified a rare reverse G\u2022U wobble close to the active site and show that this motif in conjunction with surrounding phosphates forms an anionic pocket in the active site. This anionic pocket likely serves to bind metal ions and to help shift the pKa of the catalytic nucleobase, C75. Thus, the reverse G\u2022U wobble motif serves to organize two catalytic elements, a metal ion and catalytic nucleobase, within the active site of the HDV ribozyme. We further identified two types of Mg2+ ions associated with the ribozyme, chelated and diffuse, at the reverse and standard G\u2022U wobbles, respectively, which appear to contribute to catalysis and stability, respectively. These two metal ion sites exhibit relatively independent behavior. Protonation of C75 was observed to locally organize the active site in a manner that facilitates the catalytic mechanism, in which C75+ acts as a general acid and Mg2+ as a Lewis acid. The simulations also indicated that the overall structure and thermal motions of the ribozyme are not significantly influenced by the catalytic Mg2+ interaction or C75 protonation. This is suggestive of a reaction pathway of the ribozyme dominated by small local motions at the active site rather than large-scale global conformational changes. These results are consistent with a wealth of experimental data and pave the way for a greater understanding of structure-function relationships and the role of metal ions in RNA.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4713], "author_name_tesi": "Veeraraghavan, Narayanan ", "last_name_ssi": "Veeraraghavan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Narayanan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Sharon Hammes Schiffer", "Philip C.

This city has existed for many centuries and has a rich, deep-rooted religious significance. In the midst of transformation Varanasi is facing major environmental threats due to rapid urbanization, exponential population growth, and incompetent urban planning regulations. The Varanasi Development Authority (VDA) has not been able to efficiently address issues of architectural heritage deterioration, traffic congestion, insufficient infrastructure, and natural resource depletion. \n      A field study conducted as part of this research revealed that the Indian National Trust For Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) is ill-equipped and able to preserve only a few of the existing monuments, while many have been consistently neglected leading to deterioration and demolition of historic structures. Traffic congestion on main streets due to heavy motor vehicular use on narrow streets causes immense discomfort for the people who reside within the historic site. The religious rituals performed by pilgrims along the riverfront of sacred Ganges and disposal of untreated wastes in the river have resulted in health hazards for many users who directly consume the river water. The immediate concerns that need to be addressed for the urban renewal of Varanasi are the conservation of historic fabric, transportation management, and environmental planning. \n      The cultural practices and religious belief system of the inhabitants play a major role in the city\u2019s growth. In order to conserve this historic city and its urban environment, an adaptable strategy is essential not only for architectural preservation of Varanasi, but also for promoting sustainable practices so that future generations can witness the original city and its sacred architecture for many more centuries to come. This thesis recognizes the importance of cultural, religious, political, economical and ecological aspects for the sustainable development of a historic city and proposes viable design and planning strategies to enhance the quality of the overall environment in Varanasi.

Gas phase species have been studied in great detail and are well understood, causing a warming effect on the atmosphere. The less understood major contributing factor in the atmosphere are aerosol particles, which range in size from nanometers up to microns. Aerosol particles can directly scatter and absorb light and also have secondary effects such as acting as a surface for gas phase reactions to occur or seed particles for cloud formation. Aerosol particles can cause health problems ranging from serious cardiovascular to respiratory effects. All Climate and health effects of aerosol particles are dependent on particle composition, morphology, concentration, and size. \nSince a large variety of particulate types exist in the atmosphere, we have focused on understanding the effect of mineral dust composition and morphology. Mineral dust is important because it is the second largest emission by mass. In order to study the optical properties of aerosol particles, we built a cavity ring-down spectrometer and developed methods to interpret the excinction cross section results for particles with a varied shape. We have studied the major components of mineral dust that include calcium carbonate, hematite, quartz, aluminosilicate clay minerals, and feldspars, along with a heterogeneous dust sample. We have found that non-absorbing species that have surface roughness and an aspect ratio close to one (such as calcite, quartz and feldspar) can be treated as spheres. Aerosol particles that are absorbing (hematite) that have an aspect ratio near one with a roughened surface need to be treated with more complex models; otherwise the extinction cross section will be underrepresented. For aerosol particles that are non-absorbing but have a high aspect ratio (aluminosilicate clay minerals), additional modeling parameters are also needed that will account for shape and orientation. We have used Arizona Test Dust to determine if the models we have developed can be used to model the optical properties of a heterogeneous mixture. We have shown that the extinction cross section of the Arizona Test Dust can be modeled as long as individual components are treated independently and significant error would be introduces if all species were treated as spheres.\nOrganic aerosol particles are chemically complex species that originate from primary or secondary emissions. We have described mixed organic/ammonium sulfate particles in the submicron regime using TEM to understand phase separation. When the organic component has a high aqueous solubility, all particles exhibit a homogeneous morphology while at low aqueous solubility all particles exhibit a phase separated structure. Intermediate solubility organics show a size dependent morphology. For pimelic and succinic acid, small particles (under approximately 200 nm) have a homogeneous structure while the larger particles exhibit phase separated structures. \n\tWe have studied samples collected in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia to better understand the types of particles and the effect of aging on these particles in an urban environment. The majority of the particles are soot, small spheres, or mineral dust. When we compared the monthly particle composition, we saw that there was an increased aging of the particles during the winter months due to pollution and a lower boundary layer leading to reduced atmospheric mixing. By understanding the particle composition present in areas and modeling the optical properties of individual particle types, better models can be created to give insight into aerosol particles affects on the atmosphere.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10621], "author_name_tesi": "Veghte, Daniel Philip", "last_name_ssi": "Veghte", "middle_name_ssi": "Philip", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Miriam Arak Freedman", "Lasse Jensen", "Karl Todd Mueller", "Jose Dolores Fuentes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Miriam Arak Freedman, Dissertation Advisor", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Member", "Jose Dolores Fuentes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aerosol", "Atmospheric", "Chemistry", "Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy", "CRD", "Electron Microscopy", "TEM", "SEM", "Mineral Dust", "Organic"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Insights into the Synthetic Mechanisms behind Ligand-free Metal Nanoparticle Formation", "id": "28615", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12259", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "       The reactions catalyzed by metal nanoparticles are of great importance in a number of industries that range from synthesizing methanol to designing more efficient catalytic converters. An issue facing many of these processes comes in the form of nanoparticle sintering: coarsening and growth of metal nanoparticles caused by their need to lessen overall surface energy. The resulting nanoparticle growth that arises from this energetic need dramatically diminishes their catalytic activity. This, in turn, costs major industries time and money as they work to replenish the catalyst. \n\tPast work has been done to more fully understand catalytic systems involving metal oxide/hydroxide nanoparticles deposited on a variety of early transition metal oxide supports. Through this work, it was found that an anomalous stabilization of the metal nanoparticles was possible when they were deposited on certain types of metal oxide supports. These studies were then expanded to include preliminary periodic trends that have been garnered from work done by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and X-Ray diffraction (XRD). More recently, ligand-free, OH- - stabilized Pt and Pd nanoparticles have been synthesized and characterized via the methods listed above. These ligand-free nanoparticles hold greater catalytic relevance because of their lack of bulky surface ligands, granting them with a higher available surface area for large-scale industrial reactions. \n\tWhile the synthesis of these OH- - stabilized ligand-free metal nanoparticles is of great importance, it is also necessary to understand their behavior in solution \u2013 how they form, how they remain dispersed, and so on \u2013 in order to formulate conditions that will preserve their stability. Presented here is work done to synthesize and characterize ligand-free Pt and Pd metal nanoparticles. Their reaction progress was monitored by UV-Visible spectroscopy, and intermediate reaction species will soon be determined by 195Pt NMR. The final product was confirmed via TEM and XRD. The metal nanoparticles were then deposited onto sheets of calcium niobate (KCa2Nb3O10), and the resulting reaction setup was exposed to temperatures up to 900\u00b0C to monitor their sintering under harsh conditions, with the overarching goal of understanding how metal nanoparticles interact with their support systems.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11645], "author_name_tesi": "Veghte, Rosemary Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Veghte", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Rosemary", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanoparticle", "sintering", "transmission electron microscopy", "x-ray diffraction", "solid state"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "The Disability in the Physically Active Scale: The Psychometrics of an Outcome Scale for Musculoskeletal Injuries", "id": "6684", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3764", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Outcomes assessment is an integral part of ensuring quality in athletic training. Unfortunately, no validated outcomes instruments have been created to measure disablement in a physically active person with a musculoskeletal injury. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the psychometrics of the Disability in the Physically Active (DPA) scale: a self-report instrument created to measure disablement. \nDesign and Setting: Data were taken from participants at five settings. Participants entered at baseline or after a musculoskeletal injury (acute or persistent). Participants were asked to complete the DPA, global functioning (GF) scale and global rating of change (GRC) scale on multiple occasions.\nParticipants: A sample of 368 participants were included at baseline. Fifty-four participants with persistent symptoms and twenty-eight participants with an acute injury participated in the study. Test-retest reliability analyses were performed in 52 participants.\nMeasurements: We assessed the DPA\u2019s internal consistency by calculating a Cronbach alpha value. Test-retest reliability was determined with ICC (2,1) values. An exploratory factor analysis determined the factors in the DPA scale. Concurrent validity was assessed with a linear regression while sensitivity to change was assessed by calculating effect size (ES). Responsiveness was calculated by constructing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and a minimal clinical important difference (MCID) value.\nResults: The Cronbach alpha score of the DPA was 0.908 and 0.890 in acute and persistent participants respectively. The ICC2,1 value of the DPA for all participants was 0.969. The factor analysis revealed that the DPA had three factors. The DPA group mean scores accounted for 97.5%-100% of the variation in GF group mean scores. The DPA demonstrated large effects on multiple occasions. The DPA demonstrated statistically significant AUC values and the MCID value for the DPA scale was established.\nConclusions: This study demonstrated that the DPA is a reliable, valid, sensitive and responsive instrument that measures multiple dimensions of disablement. In addition, the MCID value presents useful information for clinicians who use the DPA to measure treatment outcomes. Research should be completed using the DPA to measure the clinical efficacy of intervention used in athletic training.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3743], "author_name_tesi": "Vela, Luzita Isabel", "last_name_ssi": "Vela", "middle_name_ssi": "Isabel", "first_name_ssi": "Luzita", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig R Denegar", "Jay N Hertel", "William E Buckley", "Samuel William Monismith", "Peter Andrew Arnett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig R Denegar, Committee Chair", "Jay N Hertel, Committee Member", "William E Buckley, Committee Member", "Samuel William Monismith, Committee Member", "Peter Andrew Arnett, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Disablement scheme", "Saad Nagi", "Validity", "Reliability", "Responsiveness", "Sensitivity to change"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF DIET INDUCED OBESITY ON SECRETION, MILK COMPOSITION, AND MAMMARY GLAND MICROENVIRONMENT IN A MOUSE MODEL", "id": "12232", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6423", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Breast milk is the ideal food for infants, offering essential nutrients and energy for growth and proteins from the mother to develop immunity. Exclusive breastfeeding is therefore recommended for the infant during the first 6 months of life. Obese women however are less likely to initiate breastfeeding, breastfeed for shorter durations, and often suffer a delay in the onset of lactogenesis. 34% of reproductive age women are obese, thus obesity-impaired lactation is a significant problem. Recent research is focused on the impaired onset of lactogenesis with little information on how obesity affects milk secretion after the onset of lactogenesis and limited information on milk composition. DBA/2J mice were used to characterize how diet induced obesity (DIO) affects early, established lactation in a series of 3 studies. Female mice were fed either a high fat diet (HFD) with 45% kcal from fat or a control diet (CD) with 10% kcal from fat throughout the study.  Mice were bred ~5 weeks after start of experimental diet and the body weights of the HFD group were significantly heavier than the control group. Experiments were performed during early lactation at LD 4-6. In study 1, we explored effects of DIO on secretion during established lactation. Milk secretion was measured by weigh-suckle-weigh, mammary gland morphology and the number of alveoli were visually assessed by hemoatoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining.  The expression of major milk proteins was analyzed by real-time PCR and immunoblot. There was no significant effect of a high fat diet on milk secretion, mammary gland morphology, number of alveoli, or mRNA expression of secretory proteins &#946;-casein and &#945;-lactalbumin between mice fed HFD vs. mice fed CD. The mRNA expression of whey acidic protein (WAP) in the mammary gland was significantly lower (P<0.01) in mice fed HFD compared with mice fed CD, yet protein expression of WAP in the mammary gland was not different between groups.  The protein expression of &#946;-casein was significantly (P<0.05) greater in the mammary glands of mice fed HFD compared with mice fed CD. Study 1 determined that DIO does not impair secretion during established lactation as evidenced by no impairment in volume of milk secreted, no abnormalities in mammary gland morphology and no impairment in the expression of secretory proteins.  These findings emphasize the importance of an obese mother receiving adequate lactational support in order to establish the onset of lactogenesis as obesity should otherwise cause no secretory impairment.  In study 2, we explored effects of DIO on milk composition. Fat content, lactose and total protein concentration, protein composition and zinc concentration were analyzed. There was no significant effect of a high fat diet on % fat, lactose, or zinc concentration. Mice fed HFD had significantly lower (P<0.001) total protein concentration in milk. When the protein composition of milk was analyzed, serum albumin in milk was lower (P<0.05) but expression of caseins was greater (&#945;-casein, P = 0.065; &#946;-casein, P < 0.01; &#947;-casein, P < 0.01; &#949;-casein, P < 0.05) in milk from mice fed HFD.  Study 2 determined that DIO results in deceased total protein in milk but increased casein secretion, which could impact infant health.  This study emphasizes the necessity for additional research on the effects of milk from an obese mother on infant growth and health.  In study 3, we explored effects of DIO on the mammary gland microenvironment, as the cells and molecules that surround mammary epithelial cells may influence their function. Mammary gland adiposity was compared between groups using H and E staining.  Macrophage infiltration was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the macrophage marker F4/80 and the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor &#954; B (RANK) was analyzed by real time-PCR.  We observed larger adipocytes and more macrophages present in mammary glands from mice fed HFD compared with mice fed CD. The mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, P<0.05; MCSF, P<0.01; and IL-6, P=0.07) in the mammary glands of mice fed HFD was greater compared with mice fed CD.  The mRNA expression of RANK was significantly higher (P<0.05) in mice fed HFD compared with mice fed CD. Study 3 determined that DIO alters the mammary gland microenvironment by increasing adiposity, macrophage infiltration and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and RANK.  The altered cytokine milieu of an inflammatory lactating mammary gland microenvironment could offer insight into the mechanisms that delay lactogenesis.   In conclusion, DIO produces an inflammatory microenvironment in the mammary gland, which may impact the expression of proteins in the mammary gland and in milk.  These studies offer preliminary data for many new avenues in research including additional regulatory mechanisms of secretary proteins, the safety of milk from an obese mother, and RANK as a target for obesity-impaired lactation.  Our studies also conclude that if an obese mother decides to breastfeed, she should be offered lactational support to allow her to initiate lactogenesis, as obesity should not cause any additional impairment on lactation.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6424], "author_name_tesi": "Velasquez, Vanessa Renee", "last_name_ssi": "Velasquez", "middle_name_ssi": "Renee", "first_name_ssi": "Vanessa", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shannon Leanne Kelleher", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Thesis Advisor", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["obesity", "DIO", "mouse mammary gland", "lactation", "milk secretion"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Understanding the Effects of Positive and Negative Affect on Perceived Usability\n\n\n", "id": "11371", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3998", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Emotions (or affective states) are mental and physiological states associated with a variety of cognitive activities such as memory, learning, decision making, appraisal, and judgment.

Our hypothesis is that the perceived product usability will be higher in the presence of positive emotion than negative emotion.  \nThe effect of emotion on perceived usability was tested for different controlled usability scenarios. The experiments were conducted using smart phones and software applications within the smart phones. Two smart phones with different input modalities (keypad and touch screen) were used in combination with two software applications, one of which was designed with good usability and the other with poor usability.\nA total of four experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, the emotion elicitation strategy was validated. The second and third experiments explored the effect of emotion on perceived usability for a single product, and provided data on experiment parameters to be used in the fourth experiment. The fourth experiment explored the effect of emotion on perceived usability of smart phone/software systems and the software applications in isolation.   A randomized complete block design was used.  \nThe results from experiment 1 showed that our emotion elicitation strategy is effective for both positive and negative emotions. Experiments 2, 3, and 4 proved that there is a statistically significant effect of user affective states on perceived product usability. Overall, the results suggest the existence of carry-over effects of affective states on usability appraisals. Thus, for the specific products, scenarios, and emotions elicited, user affective states prior to product interactions were determinant factors of  perceived product usability. In general, users in positive affective states believed that products were better. Likewise, users in negative affective states believed that products were worse. No significant differences were observed for the effect of emotion for different smart phones and software applications.\nThe results of this study provide insight into the importance of previous emotional states on product interactions. This information will help designers to create products that are able to overcome negative emotions and elicit positive ones that improve product interactions, and by extension, quality of life.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3972], "author_name_tesi": "Velazquez, Maria Angelica ", "last_name_ssi": "Velazquez", "middle_name_ssi": "Angelica ", "first_name_ssi": "Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gul Kremer", "Andris Freivalds", "Frank Edward Ritter", "David Arthur Nembhard", "Gul Kremer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gul Kremer, Dissertation Advisor", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Chair", "Frank Edward Ritter, Committee Member", "David Arthur Nembhard, Committee Member", "Gul Kremer, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["emotion", "affect", "usability"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "WHAT HAVE LOW INCOME SMOKERS LEARNED FROM A LIFETIME OF EXPOSURE TO PUBLIC HEALTH PEDAGOGY?

The slower rates of decline in these groups are possibly due to the unexpected ways that public health messages are received, understood, and assimilated into the lives of individuals in these groups.  \n\nThis qualitative study used narrative inquiry methods to understand what 15 low income smokers with less than a bachelor\u2019s degree have learned from a lifetime of exposure to public health pedagogical messages and how this learning may have contributed to their smoking behavior.  This study was informed by critical theory which assumes that power and influence within society are unequally distributed, and experiential learning and public pedagogy which consider what people learn from public sites.  Data were analyzed by using the constant comparative method to code the data into themes and by re-storying the participant narratives.  \n\nThe findings from this study suggest, for the most part, participants were accepting of many public health pedagogies including things such as indoor smoking bans and paying more in cigarette taxes, and they were willing to comply with most messages.  However, some of the messages that participants\u2019 received from public health pedagogies and public health professionals were received in unintended ways.  Most importantly, they had negative or mis-educative experiences that caused them to either doubt, resist, or rebel.  Finally, some experiences prompted participants to distrust public health professionals who they perceived as having power in society and who they felt were treating them unfairly, judging them, or providing them with suboptimal care.  Many mis-educative experiences revolved around failing to successfully quit smoking and the participants did not identify any public health pedagogies that challenged these mis-educative experiences.  \n\nThis study makes a contribution to the growing body of public pedagogy literature by suggesting that learning does occur through public sites and that personal experiences can either lead to confirmation or resistance to messages individuals receive.  The findings also suggest that public health professionals should work to restore the trust of smokers while also exploring new public pedagogical messages designed to challenge the mis-educative quitting experiences that smokers have accumulated throughout their lives.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16469], "author_name_tesi": "Veldheer, Susan J", "last_name_ssi": "Veldheer", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Susan", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robin Redmon Wright", "Robin Redmon Wright", "Karin Sprow Forte", "Jonathan A Foulds", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robin Redmon Wright, Dissertation Advisor", "Robin Redmon Wright, Committee Chair", "Karin Sprow Forte, Committee Member", "Jonathan A Foulds, Committee Member", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Smoking", "health disparities", "Public Pedagogy", "Adult Education", "Narrative Inquiry", "Public Health Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Thermoelastic Modeling of Brain Mechanics: An Imaging Approach\n", "id": "11966", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4844", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE), also called palpation by imaging, is a relatively new, non-invasive, in vivo imaging technique used to estimate the elasticity of a biological tissue subject to dynamic or static mechanical stress.

Extant literature has presented evidence of decreasing returns to scale at the hedge fund level. Employing a newly developed, unbiased estimation method based on recursive demeaning, I find no evidence of decreasing returns to scale at the hedge fund level. However, I do find evidence that hedge fund returns are decreasing in hedge fund industry size. Further tests suggest that inter-hedge fund competition drives this result. Additionally, I examine the evolution of raw managerial skill of hedge funds over time and find that fund performance deteriorates as funds grow older, but this does not take away from the detrimental effects on performance due to the industry becoming more competitive.\nThe second chapter is on the subject of style drift in mutual fund management and documents that small-cap mutual funds allocate on average 27% of their portfolio to mid- and large-cap stocks. I find that larger and older small-cap funds are more likely to hold mid- and large-cap stocks, consistent with funds straying from their objective over time. Funds that invest heavily in mid- and large-cap stocks expose their investors to unanticipated risks but investors do not experience higher abnormal returns or performance persistence overall.

Radiated noise associated with high-speed military style engines is the main contributor of the overall noise produced by modern aircraft, especially in military applications where the jets typically are at very high velocity and temperature, and have low bypass ratios. The acoustic and aerodynamic properties of high-speed jets are investigated experimentally in this thesis. Measurements are conducted in the Penn State high speed jet noise facility, after the validation of the newly upgraded rig. Axisymmetric Nozzles are investigated as well as nozzles with a military style shape. \nThe database of flow measurements in supersonic shock containing jets is very scarce.  This research focuses on performing flow measurements in shock containing jets in an effort to obtain valuable parameters for the modeling of the noise propagated by such flows. Mean flow measurements of the jets are performed with pitot probes traversing the flow. These measurements are used as a qualification tool for a CFD simulation of the flow field with good overall agreement.  Measurements in supersonic rectangular jets also uncover the presence of axes switching in fully, over- and under- expanded cases, with the location of this axes switch being further downstream in the fully expanded case.  Acoustic data are gathered in shock containing screeching jets. Different techniques are investigated in order to provide some reduction of the screech tones.  Optical Deflectometry measurements are performed in shock containing jets and show that the screech tones have no effect on the properties of the convecting structures. On the other hand, the strength of the shock present in the flow seems to have an effect on the convection velocity.  Finally, the simultaneous correlation between the flow field fluctuations and the acoustic far field is measured.  This suggests that the OD sensors can be used for localizing the noise generation in the jet.  Preliminary results of this kind show that the highest frequencies are generated close to the exit plane of the nozzle.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3215], "author_name_tesi": "Veltin, Jeremy ", "last_name_ssi": "Veltin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jeremy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["D.K.

Agile Enterprise Architecture can be defined as a process for handling Enterprise Architecture (EA) by applying agile development principles and methods. However, there is a research gap in the adoption of agile Enterprise Architecture. In this paper, I analyze the factors that influence agile EA adoption in large organizations using a grounded theory approach.

My design uses each firm as a control for itself to control for firm-specific unobservable factors in addition to using a sample of control firms to control for economy-wide factors.

Further the change in precision of idiosyncratic information is strongly related to the change in precision of common information.

The nature and mechanism of formation of these deposits depend on the fuel composition, metal surface properties, and operating conditions of the engine. The objective of this study was to characterize the deposits obtained from the pyrolytic and oxidative degradation of jet fuel, and deposits collected from commercial high-pressure diesel injectors (hpdi) to better understand the mechanisms of deposit formation. Short duration stressing experiments were conducted to observe the initial steps that lead to deposit formation under both pyrolytic and autoxidative conditions.  This is the first study that attempts a systematic examination of solid deposits produced from thermal oxidative stressing of fuels and captures initial stages of pyrolytic deposition processes.\nA commercial aviation Jet A fuel sample was stressed in a flow reactor under pyrolytic and oxidative conditions on different metals (SS316 and Inconel 600) and inert (alumina coated SS316) surfaces. The deposits formed were examined by a combination of microscopic, chemical, and spectroscopic techniques. The same techniques were also used to characterize the deposits obtained from hdpi and deposits formed from the thermal oxidative stressing of a diesel range model compound, n-hexadecane. There are no earlier reports of a systematic examination of the solid degradation products from the thermal oxidative stressing of fuels.\nPyrolytic degradation of jet fuel for short durations produced metal sulfides first on alloy surfaces, followed by the formation of carbonaceous solids. The solid carbon deposits consisted of amorphous films produced by a heterogeneous process similar to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and of spheroidal particles formed by homogeneous nucleation and growth in the fluid phase. Although the formation of film-type deposits was suggested in earlier studies, this is the first time their presence has been confirmed. \nThe deposits formed from the oxidative degradation of Jet A and from the hpdi consisted of condensed polyaromatic hydrocarbons showing varying degrees of structural order in solid particles. The spherical morphology of the deposits indicated formation and growth in the fluid phase. Formation in an oxidative environment led to the incorporation of oxygen complexes both on the external and internal surface of these deposits. The heteroatom compounds in the fuel did not seem to affect the nature and amount of solid deposits formed under autoxidative conditions.\nThe formation of PAH from Jet A, a predominantly aliphatic fuel, and n-hexadecane showed that aromatization of straight chain alkanes and polycondensation of aromatic rings was possible at temperatures as low as 160 \u00baC in the presence of oxygen. Alkylperoxy and alkoxy radicals which are reactive intermediates formed during the oxidative degradation of fuels are proposed to aid in aromatization reactions by facilitating hydrogen abstraction. \nThe results from this study indicate the sulfur content of the fuel and the substrate composition control the heterogeneous carbon deposition, but do not affect the nucleation and growth of deposit particles in the fluid phase.  Since pyrolytic degradation of jet fuel forms deposits by heterogeneous mechanisms, lowering the sulfur content of the fuel and surface stabilization by physical or chemical treatments can inhibit the solid formation under these conditions. Surface treatment may slow down the accumulation of solid deposit under autoxidative conditions by decreasing the adherence of deposits to the substrates.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5356], "author_name_tesi": "Venkataraman, Ramya ", "last_name_ssi": "Venkataraman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ramya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Semih Eser", "Ljubisa R Radovic", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Robert John Santoro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Semih Eser, Committee Chair", "Ljubisa R Radovic, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Solid", "Degradation", "Diesel", "Jet Fuel", "Oxidative", "Pyrolytic", "Deposits", "Carbon", "Sulfides"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PREPARATION, CHARACTERIZATION AND POST-DEPOSITION MODIFICATION OF PULSED-DC MAGNETRON SPUTTERED VANADIUM OXIDE THIN FILMS FOR MICROBOLOMETER APPLICATIONS", "id": "11428", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1277", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vanadium Oxide (VOx) thin films have been at the heart of uncooled microbolometers for several years, however very little is known about their structure and material properties.  Also, process control remains an issue because the films are formed under oxygen-starved conditions resulting in films with \u201cx\u201d less than 2.0 in VOx.  Hence it is desirable to optimize the film deposition conditions so as to obtain the required properties (high temperature coefficient of resistance [TCR], low resistivity and low noise) for the microbolometer application.  In this work, the parameter space for pulsed-dc magnetron sputtering was explored to arrive at optimum deposition conditions.  A metallic vanadium target was used in a reactive environment under different Ar/O2 ratios.  The gas flow rates and oxygen partial pressures were varied systematically, and the corresponding changes in the cathode (target) current were monitored.  The cathode current was found to exhibit a hysteresis behavior between forward and reverse directions for changes in the oxygen percentage as well as the total flow rate.  The width and position of the hysteresis curve depended on the relative values of the gas flow rates and the oxygen partial pressures.  Films were deposited along various points in the hysteresis curve, and their structural and electrical properties were evaluated.  The resistivity and the TCR of the films were also found to exhibit a hysteretic behavior similar to that of the cathode current.  The film microstructure changed from columnar at low flow rates to multi-grained features at higher flow rates.  Also, the TCR of the films exhibited a linear relation with log of resistivity \u2013 the higher the resistivity, the higher the TCR.\nThe current read-out circuitry for VOx microbolometer arrays requires a material with high TCR but low resistivity.  Post-deposition modification was investigated to see if the combination of resistivity and TCR could be improved from the as-deposited properties.  The sputtered films were annealed in inert (nitrogen) and oxidizing (oxygen) atmospheres at four different temperatures for varying time periods.  Depending on the exact annealing conditions, several orders of magnitude change in resistance and significant variations in TCR were observed.  Optimal results were obtained for 300 oC anneal in nitrogen atmosphere.  Ion implantation was also tried out to further enhance the trade-off between resistivity and TCR.  Two species - Hydrogen (active) and Helium (inert) were implanted, which caused both the TCR and resistivity to go up.  Subsequent anneal in nitrogen dropped the resistivity significantly, without changing the TCR much.  This resulted in up to 40% improvement in TCR, for any given resistivity, as compared to the as-deposited films.  In summary, magnetron sputtering, in combination with post-deposition process, can produce VOx thin films comparable to or better than those used by industry.   In addition, cathode current during deposition is a helpful processing metric to produce low resistivity, high TCR films.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1266], "author_name_tesi": "Venkatasubramanian, Chandrasekaran ", "last_name_ssi": "Venkatasubramanian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chandrasekaran", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["S Ashok", "S Ashok", "Mark William Horn", "Michael T Lanagan", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["S Ashok, Dissertation Advisor", "S Ashok, Committee Chair", "Mark William Horn, Committee Chair", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pulsed dc sputtering", "vanadium oxide", "annealing", "ion implantation", "microbolometer", "infrared imaging"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Functional connectivity within posterolateral parietal cortex and its alteration in traumatic brain injury", "id": "14800umv5002", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14800", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Spatially distributed functional brain networks show multiple points of regional convergence (\u201chubs\u201d), suggesting that local network architecture supports global systems communication.

The goal of the dissertation was to examine one such environment, the posterolateral parietal cortex (PPC), in relation to distributed network connectivity and cognition in both TBI (n=18) and healthy controls (n=19). Using resting-state functional MRI in conjunction with seed-voxel and graph theoretical connectivity analyses, the study revealed evidence for increased connectivity, or hyperconnectivity, in TBI from portions of left and right PPC to right-lateralized default mode and frontoparietal control network regions, as well as within the local right PPC network itself. Across groups, right versus left PPC showed increased local connection strength and decreased betweenness centrality, a measure of network hubness. In TBI, strength and global efficiency within the right PPC were strongly negatively correlated with auditory attention span and attentional reaction time, respectively. Overall, these findings substantiate hyperconnectivity on both global and local levels after TBI.

A total of 22 participants in the chronic phase of moderate-severe TBI and 18 healthy controls were included for cross-sectional study. Longitudinal analyses included 13 individuals in the TBI group for whom data approximately three months after injury (subacute) were available. Overall, results indicated dissociable connectivity trajectories of the PCC and hippocampi during recovery from TBI, with PCC alterations characterized by early hypersynchrony with the anterior DMN that is gradually reduced, and hippocampal changes marked by increasing synchrony with proximal cortex and subcortex. The PCC also showed increasing antiphase synchrony with posterior attentional regions, and the hippocampi showed decreasing antiphase synchrony with frontal attentional regions. Antiphase synchrony of the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at the subacute stage of TBI was positively associated with attentional performance on neuropsychological tests at both the subacute and chronic stages. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of regional-whole brain connectivity changes after TBI, and suggest that residual connectivity alterations exist in the clinically stable phase of TBI.

Energy is a key concern in designing MANETs as the nodes usually have limited battery power. As communication will undoubtedly be one of the essential functionalities of such networks, optimizing the energy consumed for data transmissions is of utmost importance. Recently, there has been a growing interest in designing MANETs consisting of special relay nodes whose mobility can be controlled by underlying network algorithms. In this dissertation, we have developed a mobility prediction based framework for deploying controllable mobile relay nodes for optimizing the energy consumption in MANETs. We present two instances of the relay deployment problem, together with the solutions, to achieve different goals. Instance 1, termed Min-Total, aims to minimize the total energy consumed by the traditional nodes during data transmission, while instance 2, termed Min-Max, aims to minimize the maximum energy consumed by a traditional node during data transmission. Our solutions also enable the prioritization of individual nodes in the network based on residual energy profiles and contextual significance. In addition, we also present a mobility prediction based clustering framework to dynamically organize the network into stable sub-structures to assist in an initial deployment of the relay nodes.\n\nWe perform an extensive simulation study to evaluate the performance of the relay deployment algorithms underying network conditions. We also investigate the performance of the proposed framework under different mobility  prediction  schemes. Results indicate that even when the  relay nodes constitute a small fraction of the total  nodes in the network, the  proposed framework results in significant energy savings. Further, we observed that while both the schemes have their potential advantages, the differences between the two optimization schemes is clearly highlighted in a sparse network.

Various components of this system, especially bridges, are highly vulnerable to extreme natural hazards such as earthquakes. Extreme events can cause severe damage to highway bridges and thus can result in disrupted functionality of highway transportation systems. Bridge damage not only causes direct economic losses due to post-event bridge repair and restoration, but also produces indirect losses arising from network downtime and traffic delay. Therefore, it is always desirable to minimize these negative consequences from extreme events and to maximize disaster resilience of highway transportation systems.\n\t\t\nSeismic retrofitting of highway bridges is one of the most common approaches undertaken by state Departments of Transportation (state DOTs) and by bridge owners to enhance system performance during seismic events. In this relation, this study evaluates the effectiveness of different retrofit techniques to enhance seismic resilience of highway bridges. The study considers a reinforced concrete bridge in La Cienega-Venice Boulevard sector of the I-10 freeway in Los Angeles, California. The bridge was severely damaged during the 1994 Northridge earthquake due to shear failure of one of the bridge piers. Post-event reconnaissance indicated that the failure was initiated from inadequate lateral confinement of bridge piers due to which vertical load carrying capacity of the bridge reduced significantly resulting in crushing of core concrete and buckling of longitudinal re-bars of bridge piers during the seismic event. Seismic vulnerability of the as-built bridge is estimated through finite element (FE) analysis of the bridge under a suite of time histories that represent seismic hazard at the bridge site.  Appropriate loss and recovery models are used to calculate seismic resilience of the as-built bridge.  Three retrofit strategies are applied to the bridge to observe the effectiveness of these strategies in enhancing bridge seismic resilience in case the bridge was retrofitted prior to the earthquake event.  Seismic vulnerability of retrofitted bridge models are estimated through time history analyses of these models under the same set of ground motions used for the as-built bridge. Seismic resilience of a highway bridge can be represented as a combined measure of bridge seismic performance and its recovery after the occurrence of seismic events. For each method of seismic retrofit, seismic resilience of the bridge is calculated.  Difference in resilience obtained before and after bridge retrofits and the respective costs incurred are evaluated.  Comparison of these values indicates the relative effectiveness of different retrofit techniques in enhancing the seismic resilience of the bridge.  Results show that one of the retrofit strategies is most effective in enhancing the seismic resilience of the bridge, whereas other two strategies are not effective at all.  Cost benefit analysis is performed to calculate the benefit obtained from the most effective retrofit strategy over a period of 30-80 years after bridge retrofit.  Hence, results obtained from this study help in educated decision-making for selecting efficient and cost-effective seismic design and/or retrofit strategies for highway bridges. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8549], "author_name_tesi": "Venkittaraman, Ashok ", "last_name_ssi": "Venkittaraman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ashok", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Swagata Banerjee Basu", "Gordon Patrick Warn", "Andrew Scanlon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Swagata Banerjee Basu, Thesis Advisor", "Gordon Patrick Warn, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Scanlon, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Concrete bridges", "fragility analysis", "resilience", "sensitivity study", "cost analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "HIGH-RESOLUTION GENOME-WIDE ORGANIZATION OF THE YEAST TRANSCRIPTION MACHINERY", "id": "8652", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "707", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The yeast genome is packaged into chromatin, which regulates promoter access to the transcription apparatus.  The current view of transcription initiation is that sequence-specific regulators interact with their cognate DNA motifs in response to cellular signals.  The regulators recruit transcriptional coactivators or corepressors, which in turn alter the local chromatin environment to control the rate of assembly of the pre-initiation complex (PIC).  The PIC is composed of the general transcription factors (GTFs) and Pol II.  The TATA binding protein (TBP) is a central fixture in the transcription of nearly all genes in the cell, and consequently its distribution and activity is controlled by numerous regulatory proteins.  One of them, Mot1, is an essential protein that regulates the genomic distribution of TBP.  To delineate how different conserved regions of Mot1 regulate transcription, I conducted an in vivo structure/function study.  Using genome-wide expression and location profiling of Mot1 mutants, I found that Mot1-regulated genes are equally dependent on all the tested regions of Mot1, except for the ATPase region, which indicates that Mot1 functions in the cell as an indivisible regulatory unit to facilitate the appropriate genomic distribution of TBP.\nRecent studies have illuminated the nucleosomal architecture in yeast with base pair precision, thus setting the stage for understanding how the transcription machinery is organized in its native chromatin context throughout the genome.  To determine the genome-wide spatial distribution of the transcription apparatus at high-resolution, I mapped the locations of protein factors representing different stages of transcription using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to tiled DNA microarray detection (ChIP-chip).  By mapping nearly 30 components of the yeast transcription machinery at ~40 bp resolution, I find that several organizational themes emerge.  First, the -1 promoter nucleosome is the preferred target for all chromatin remodelers except SWR-C, suggesting that this nucleosome plays a major role in regulating promoter access.  Second, GTFs are all found ~60bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) in the nucleosome-free region (NFR) irrespective of whether a TATA-box is present, which indicates that transcription tends to start at a fixed distance from the PIC.  Third, TFIID displays a broad distribution across the NFR, whereas SAGA binding is confined to the upstream promoter region near the -1 nucleosome, indicating that these central complexes in the two coactivator pathways interact with promoters in distinct chromatin environments.  Fourth, although Pol II is widely distributed throughout the genome as previously reported, the pattern of Pol II density across the coding region varies from gene to gene instead of a plateau-like distribution, indicating that Pol II is rate-limited at different stages of the transcription cycle in a gene dependent manner.  Lastly, the location linkage analysis uses binding site information derived from ChIP-chip to define a network of connectivity between transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes, and generates testable hypotheses about genome-wide recruitment dependencies without a priori knowledge of protein-protein interactions.  Taken together, the work presented in this thesis reveals the organization of the transcription machinery at promoters genome-wide, and provides a contextual framework for subsequent location profiling experiments.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [701], "author_name_tesi": "Venters, Bryan Jacob", "last_name_ssi": "Venters", "middle_name_ssi": "Jacob", "first_name_ssi": "Bryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Joseph C.

It is typically considered far too anthropomorphic to be a serious contribution to our understanding of the evolution of reality.

In this dissertation I offer a \u201creclaiming\u201d of the Peircean cosmology.

The majority of the dissertation is dedicated to a historically and biologically informed examination of the relation between agape and growth in Peirce\u2019s philosophy.  My hope, however, is to not only to clarify the specifics of this relationship in theory, but also to apply Peirce's theoretical insights to an experientially persuasive account of the growing self.  In the final chapter I offer a odel of personal growth in which \"existential abduction\" is understood to inaugurate a purposeful but undetermined development of the self's ends or desires.  In the course of the investigation, I will offer interpretive suggestions about the nature of Peircean growth through habit-taking, the importance of feeling and sentiment in Peirce\u2019s philosophy, and the relationship of agape to eros in the Peircean version of agapastic love. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4522], "author_name_tesi": "Ventimiglia, Michael J", "last_name_ssi": "Ventimiglia", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Daniel Joseph Conway", "Carl Ransdell Hausman", "Vincent M Colapietro", "Doug Anderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar, Committee Member", "Daniel Joseph Conway, Committee Member", "Carl Ransdell Hausman, Committee Chair", "Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Member", "Doug Anderson, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["cosmology", "self", "love", "Peirce", "agape"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Understanding The Role Of Storytelling In The Transformation of Female Cocaine Addicts In Narcotics Anonymnous\n", "id": "12734", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7054", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand the role of storytelling in the transformation of female cocaine addicts in Narcotics Anonymous.

Few studies examining the etiology of metabolic syndrome and obesity during childhood have adopted these frameworks and approaches. The present research aims to address these limitations and provide new information about the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome across childhood and adolescence. Data used in the present research were from a longitudinal study of 197 girls and their parents, followed from daughters\u2019 ages 5 to 15 years. In the first study, we used a latent profile approach to identify a metabolic syndrome risk typology based on girls\u2019 values for six metabolic syndrome indicators. Statistical support was strongest for a four group solution: 1) Lower MetS Risk, 2) Dyslipidemia Risk, 3) Hypertension Risk, and 4) Higher MetS Risk. Examination of the antecedents of this risk typology revealed girls in the Higher MetS Risk group consumed significantly more sweetened beverages across ages 5 to 13 years and girls in the Dyslipidemia Risk group had the lowest levels of physical activity.  These findings illustrate ways to identify girls at higher risk for chronic disease and point to potential opportunities for intervention during childhood to prevent the development of metabolic syndrome. In the second study, we used a growth mixture model approach to identify latent growth trajectories for girls\u2019 patterns of BMI change across ages 5 to 15 years. Statistical support was strongest for four patterns of BMI change: 1) Upward Percentile Crossing (UPC); 2) Delayed Downward Percentile Crossing (DDPC); 3) 60th Percentile Tracking (60PT) and 4) 50th Percentile Tracking (50PT). Diet and physical activity patterns did not predict BMI trajectories, but girls in the UPC group had more overweight mothers, were breastfed for a shorter duration, under-reported dietary intake to a greater degree and presented the worst metabolic outcomes. These findings suggest future research is needed to explore factors other than self-reported diet and activity patterns that may distinguish among differing trajectories of childhood weight status. In the third study, we explored the maternal and psychosocial correlates of heterogeneity for girls\u2019 BMI trajectories. Our findings illustrated that girls exhibiting an upward percentile crossing trajectory developed in a distinct ecology compared to other girls in our sample, characterized by a combination of higher maternal weight status, weight concern, and higher levels of maternal restriction of daughter\u2019s diet, and more encouragement of daughter\u2019s weight loss. Overall, the results of the present research illustrate that girls do not follow a single pathway toward metabolic and weight status outcomes and the psychosocial influences associated with these pathways are multifactorial. Both mothers and daughters should be targeted for childhood obesity and metabolic syndrome prevention and intervention efforts, and our findings suggest several modifiable behaviors that may serve as successful targets for these efforts.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [200], "author_name_tesi": "Ventura, Alison Kate", "last_name_ssi": "Ventura", "middle_name_ssi": "Kate", "first_name_ssi": "Alison", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leann L Birch", "Eric Loken", "Susan Mc Hale", "Elizabeth Susman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leann L Birch, Committee Chair", "Eric Loken, Committee Chair", "Susan Mc Hale, Committee Member", "Elizabeth Susman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["obesity", "metabolic syndrome", "girls", "prevention", "latent profile analysis", "growth mixture models", "familial influences"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Do More Generous Medicaid Benefits for Adults Result in Higher Dental Utilization and Tooth Retention?", "id": "19081", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8240", "abstract_tesi": "The two objectives in this study are to examine the association between 1) Medicaid dental benefits (MDB) and dental utilization (past-year dental visit) in 2010 and 2) MDB for 2 years (2002 and 2010) and tooth retention (complete retention, functional dentition, and not having functional dentition).

Additional tools and methods were developed for running simulations and other comparative quality analyses, as well as for SNP discovery in a de novo transcriptome.  The de novo M. cinxia transcriptome was scanned for SNPs that were used in a polymorphism survey to detect candidate genes with the potential to be undergoing long-term balancing selection.  One of the top candidates was juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase gene (jhamt), the gene for the final metabolic enzyme in the Juvenile Hormone synthesis pathway.  After partial molecular characterization, jhamt was found to consist of at least two paralogs in M. cinxia, both of which contain extensive allelic polymorphism.  In addition, these methods were verified in a transcriptome-wide environmental association study of adaptive genetic variation related to environmental variation in natural populations of the two coral species, where several candidate genes potentially involved in environmental stress response were identified.

Although it was a known problem, the full extent was not known. Both small and large droplets were of concern. The effects of both were countered with ice protection systems based initially on computer codes that predict the size, shape, and location of ice on aerodynamic surfaces for small droplets. The codes have been tested and validated for the conditions described in Federal Aviation Regulation Part 25 Appendix C (small droplets, up to 50 \u00b5m) and aircraft only had to be certi\ufb01ed for those conditions. Supercooled large droplets (SLD) reach locations further aft on the surfaces than small droplets making the ice protection systems insufficient in SLD icing conditions. The protection systems remove ice but do not reach the limits of the SLD ice and ridges remain on the wing surfaces which continue to negatively impact the performance of the aircraft. Certi\ufb01cation regulations regarding SLD have been implemented but the codes do not yet accurately predict ice accretion due to SLD. To validate the codes, experimental data on the behavior of larger droplets when impacting a lifting surface are necessary. \n\nThe results of an experimental study on the deformation and breakup of supercooled droplets near the leading edge of an airfoil are presented. The experiment was conducted in the Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand (AERTS) facility at The Pennsylvania State University with the intention of comparing the results to prior room temperature droplet deformation results. To collect the data, an airfoil model was placed on the tip of a rotor blade mounted onto the hub in the AERTS chamber. The model was moved at speeds between 50 and 80 m/s while a monosize droplet generator produced droplets of various sizes which fell from above, perpendicular to the path of the model. The temperature in the chamber was set to -20\u00b0C. The supercooled droplets were produced by maintaining the temperature of the water at the droplet generator under 5\u00b0C.The supercooled state of the droplets was determined by measurement of the temperature of the droplets at various distances below the tip of the droplet generator. A prediction code was also used to estimate the temperature of the droplets based on the size, vertical velocity, initial temperature, and distance traveled by the droplets. The droplets reached temperatures between -5 and 0\u00b0C. The deformation and breakup events were observed using a high-speed imaging system. A tracking software program processed the images captured and provided droplet deformation information along the path of the droplet as it approached the airfoil stagnation line. \n\nIt was demonstrated that to compare the effects of water supercooling on droplet deformation, the slip velocity and the initial droplet velocity must be the same in the cases being compared. A case with a slip velocity of 40 m/s and an initial droplet velocity of 60 m/s was selected from both room temperature and supercooled droplet tests. In these cases, the deformation of the weakly supercooled and warm droplets did not present different trends when tested in room temperature and mild supercooling environments. The similar behavior for both environmental conditions indicates that water supercooling has no effect on particle deformation for the limited range of the weak supercooling of the droplets tested and the selected impact velocity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15177], "author_name_tesi": "Veras-Alba, Belen ", "last_name_ssi": "Veras-Alba", "first_name_ssi": "Belen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Palacios"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Palacios, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supercooled Large Droplets", "SLD"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Sediment and Nutrient Losses in Reduced Tillage Systems on Dairy Farms\n", "id": "9022", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1333", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "No-tillage (NT) cropping systems have been promoted as a way to reduce sediment and nutrient losses in runoff from agricultural fields. However, on dairy farms where manure is surface applied, NT may have lower nitrogen (N) use efficiency along with higher nutrient losses in runoff than when manure is incorporated. The N efficiency of applied manure and the amount of sediment and nutrient loss in runoff may be influenced by soil drainage properties. This study was conducted in 2007 and 2008 to compare the effects of NT and chisel/disking (CD) on the N-fertilizer equivalence of manure and sediment and nutrient loss on a well-drained (WD) and somewhat poorly drained (SPD) soil.\n\nThe first experiment compared the N-fertilizer equivalence of incorporated dairy manure in a CD corn silage (Zea mays, L.) system without cover crop with that of surface-applied manure in a NT system with a cereal rye (Secale cereale, L.) cover crop. The study was done on a well-drained (WD) site (Hagerstown silt loam; fine, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Hapludalf) and a somewhat poorly-drained (SPD) site (Buchanan gravelly loam; fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Aquic Fragiudult), both of which had been in NT for more than 10 years. The trial was laid out in a randomized complete block split-plot design with four replications, with the tillage systems as main-plots and four nitrogen fertilizer rates as sub-plot treatments. The same amount of manure, calculated to supply approximately 50% of N-needs of corn with incorporation within 24 hours, was applied in both NT and CD. In the first year, manure was incorporated in CD in 24 hours, but in the second year manure could not be incorporated in CD until after 7 days due to rainfall shortly after manure application. The N-fertilizer equivalence of surface applied manure and the optimum nitrogen application rates in NT were not significantly different than in CD on both soil types. In the second year of the study, NT yields were significantly greater than CD yields at higher N-rates on  the WD soil, most likely due to greater moisture stress in the CD system as well as reduced soil quality. Pre-sidedress soil nitrate test levels on both soil types and crude protein content of silage on the WD soil was lower in NT in both years, which suggest nitrogen uptake was reduced in NT, although this did not negatively affect crop yield. The study suggests that the nitrogen fertilizer equivalence of surface applied manure in a long-term NT system with cover crop is not significantly different from that of incorporated manure in a CD system without a cover crop.\n\nA rainfall simulation experiment was done in the same study on plots that received 56 kg N ha-1. Rainfall simulations (6 cm hr-1) were performed shortly after planting, at mid-season, and after harvest on runoff plots (2x2 m). In both years and on both soils, NT had significantly lower runoff volumes and lower total sediment loads than CD. Runoff and sediment loss generally did not differ between tillage systems immediately after planting on both soil types. In NT, runoff volume declined throughout the season resulting in NT having significantly lower runoff volumes than CD by mid-season on the WD soil but not until after harvest on the SPD soil. On average, NT had lower total phosphorus loads than CD  on the WD soil, but had higher loads on the SPD soil. Total dissolved phosphorus constituted 73% of total phosphorus in NT, whereas it constituted only 15% in CD with little difference between soils. Highest dissolved phosphorus losses occurred in NT immediately after manure application, whereas particulate phosphorus losses (in CD) occurred throughout the season. Total dissolved nitrogen losses appeared to be primarily affected by runoff volume, and were therefore reduced in NT on the WD site. NT may reduce runoff and erosion on WD and SPD soils, may reduce total phosphorus loss on WD soils, but may increase it on SPD soils. Most phosphorus loss in NT occurred shortly after manure application and was in dissolved form. Runoff and sediment control are significant benefits of NT on WD and SPD soils, however, dissolved phosphorus losses shortly after surface application of manure can be a concern.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1322], "author_name_tesi": "Verbree, David ", "last_name_ssi": "Verbree", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sjoerd Willem Duiker", "Sjoerd Willem Duiker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sjoerd Willem Duiker, Thesis Advisor", "Sjoerd Willem Duiker, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nitrogen", "tillage", "no-till", "runoff", "nutrient", "sediment", "rain simulation", "phosphorus"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A SEMIOTIC ANALYSIS OF THE MISSISSIPPI...

Understanding patterns of care and outcomes for breast cancer is important because breast cancer affects a large segment of the population. One in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer over her lifetime. The first study analyzes factors predicting choice of facility for breast cancer surgery in a region of Appalachian and explores the predictors of hospital choice between metropolitan and non-metropolitan residents. As shown by the mixed logit model, women are more likely to select facilities for breast cancer surgery with higher surgical volume and availability of cancer services such as radiation.  However, hospital accreditation does not influence hospital selection. These findings provide evidence that higher quality hospitals can attract breast cancer patients by reporting surgical volume and promoting availability of cancer treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy. The second study examines the association between treatment delay and survival using Cox and competing-risk survival analyses. Delaying treatment after biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of Stage II breast cancer is associated with higher all-cause mortality, but there is no association between treatment delay and all-cause mortality in other stages. Treatment delay was not associated with  breast-cancer mortality. The third study tests the hypothesis that mastectomy patients in high-deductible health plans respond to the strong financial incentive to schedule breast reconstruction within the calendar year after satisfying a large deductible. The discrete-time survival analysis confirms that women in high-deductible health plans are more likely to have reconstruction near the end of the calendar year than women in other types of health plans, holding time after mastectomy constant. This finding will help oncology providers who serve a large number of patients with high-deductible plans to anticipate increased demand for breast reconstruction near the end of the calendar year. Knowing that the scheduling of breast reconstruction is likely to shift costs from patients to insurers, insurers can forecast claims costs under high-deductible plans more accurately.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11003], "author_name_tesi": "Verevkina, Nina Igorevna", "last_name_ssi": "Verevkina", "middle_name_ssi": "Igorevna", "first_name_ssi": "Nina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pamela Farley Short", "Pamela Farley Short", "Douglas L Leslie", "Kyoungrae Jung", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pamela Farley Short, Dissertation Advisor", "Pamela Farley Short, Committee Chair", "Douglas L Leslie, Committee Member", "Kyoungrae Jung, Committee Member", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Breast Cancer", "Survival", "Cox", "High Deductible Health Plan", "Competing Risk Model", "Breast Reconstruction"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Investigation of Aerosol and Cloud Properties using Multi-Wavelength Raman Lidar Measurements\n", "id": "8382", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5635", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lidar measurements obtained during several field campaigns have provided an extensive dataset for investigating aerosol characteristics and cloud properties. In this thesis we use measurements of multi-wavelength optical extinction measured with a Raman lidar to infer aerosol and cloud particle size variations. Aerosol extinction depends on both size and number density of the scatterers. The optical extinction at different wavelengths depends on the sixth power of the size parameter for aerosols much smaller than the scattering wavelength, and on the second power of the size parameter for aerosols much larger than the wavelength. Changes in the density of a particular size aerosol lead to a proportional response.  The extinction profiles at several wavelengths are simultaneously examined to study changes in the aerosol size distribution over an interesting range of sizes corresponding to accumulation-mode particles. Model calculations based on Mie scattering theory are compared with extinction profiles at different wavelengths, water vapor profiles, and other simultaneous measurements, to investigate the formation and dissipation of cloud structures.   The optical scattering measurements from aerosols and cloud particles demonstrate that various characteristics of aerosols and visibility can be determined. \nWe demonstrate the capability of the new technique using the multi-wavelength extinction ratios to profile information about changes in CCN particle size in the range of 50 nm to 0.5 &#956;m. Examples taken from three different field campaigns demonstrate that changes in the size of the cloud particles during the different stages of growth and dissipation are observed in the multi-wavelength aerosol extinction using this technique. We also show the relationship that exists between particle size increase or decrease in cloud regions, based on the extinction coefficients and changes in relative humidity. \nThe deliquescence relative humidity (DRH) is found to exert a strong control on the optical extinction and visibility. Our results show that relative humidity values above 85% accompany drastic drops in visibility in the U.S. north-east regions. Increase in the relative humidity values beyond the DRH results in rapid growth of particle size, which in turn causes a simultaneous increase in the optical extinction and a drop in visibility. \nComparison of data from the eastern and western regions of the United States show that different sources control the changes in optical extinction values in the lower boundary layer. During the Southern California Ozone Study (SCOS) campaign an increase of optical extinction was observed after sunset in the nocturnal boundary layer due to the growth of particles caused by the increasing relative humidity. On the other hand, the optical extinction during the North-East Particle and Oxidant Study (NEOPS) campaigns was controlled more by pollutant concentrations and showed an increase in values after sunrise and decreased values after sunset; opposite from that observed at Hesperia, Ca. \nWe used theoretical simulations along with field measurements of multi-wavelength extinction coefficients to investigate the differences that particle growth and pollutant concentration have on the extinction coefficient as well as on the extinction coefficient ratios (visible/ultraviolet). Our results show that the increase in the extinction coefficient in a region of pollutants, typically composed of smaller size particles, depends on the number density of the scatterers, which has the same effect at all wavelengths.\nWe additionally demonstrate the capability of the Raman lidar to measure atmospheric visibility conditions and transmission properties using the optical extinction measurements.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5632], "author_name_tesi": "Verghese, Sachin John", "last_name_ssi": "Verghese", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Sachin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Russell Philbrick", "Zhiwen Liu", "Ruyan Guo", "Dennis Lamb", "Richard William Clark"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Russell Philbrick, Committee Chair", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Ruyan Guo, Committee Member", "Dennis Lamb, Committee Member", "Richard William Clark, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aerosol Cloud Raman Lidar"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "METHODS FOR THE DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION OF COMBINED, \n\nMICROWAVE-ULTRASOUND BIODIESEL REACTORS\n", "id": "10406", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4293", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Biodiesel is currently one of the world\u2019s leading biofuels.

The initial steps toward precision medicine involve enrolling individuals into studies\nto link their genotype and phenotype data. Patient data can be used to discover clinically relevant\ngenetic associations. The most common methodology to identify genetic associations is called an\ngenome-wide association study (GWAS), in which tests for associations are performed between\nsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome (usually over 500,000 SNPs) and a\nsingle disease outcome or trait. There is now a growing amount of evidence to demonstrate the\nsuccess of some of these genetic associations. However, the impact of GWAS has been limited\ndue to its focus on a single phenotype, and hence, the effect of a given SNP across multiple\nphenotypes cannot be explored. An alternative approach called a phenome-wide association study\n(PheWAS) has been successful in simultaneously scanning genome-wide significant variants over\nhundreds of phenotypes. Using this approach, we can identify genetic variants associated with a\nwide range of phenotypes, also referred to as cross-phenotype associations. Such findings have\nthe potential to identify pleiotropy (where one variant is affecting two or more independent\nphenotypes with same underlying biological mechanism) or an underlying genetic architecture of\ncomorbidities. The majority of PheWAS have used data from de-identified electronic health\nrecords (EHRs) linked to genotype data, and a few have been performed in large-scale\nepidemiologic studies and clinical trials.\nWhile existing studies have demonstrated the development of PheWAS methodology, the\nfocus has remained on a small set of genome-wide significant SNPs or a genomic region of\niv\ninterest. After advances in genotyping and sequencing technologies, as well as in phenotype data\ncollection, it is imperative to apply PheWAS on a genome-wide scale. It will allow us to\ninvestigate genetic associations across all SNPs and phenotypes in a study population. However,\nthere can be many challenges with expanding the current PheWAS approach to investigate\nassociations across the genome. In this dissertation, I aim to address following specific challenges\nregarding large-scale PheWAS analysis. 1) Evaluating heterogeneous groups simultaneously\nmakes precision medicine impossible; stratifying samples based on context such as age, sex, or\ndrugs can help to improve precision in identifying true genetic associations (Chapter 2). 2) The\nnumber of association tests raise the statistical threshold of significance in such a way that finding\nthe significant associations is difficult. Also, the impact of factors such as sample size, casecontrol\nratio, and minor allele frequency on the statistical power to identify associations have not\nbeen explored (Chapter 3). 3) Integrating results from independent PheWAS using different types\nof data sets (e.g., clinical lab measures) within the EHRs have not been evaluated. We employed\nnew strategies to integrate such results to add robustness to PheWAS associations (Chapter 4). 4)\nLarge-scale PheWAS usually result in large quantities of significant associations. The majority of\nassociations from common variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome. Hence, the\ninterpretation of results is a challenging task. We developed a high throughput strategy to\nprioritize associations based on their biological relevance (Chapter 5). 5) Few methods elucidate\ncross-phenotype connections with shared underlying genetic etiology.

Though GWAS have been successful in identifying many common genetic variants associated with common complex diseases, these studies have some shortcomings in explaining genetic heritability (specifically the broad-sense heritability). Thus, the genetic architecture of complex diseases can be further understood by exploring dominance and interacting variance components along with additive effects. Testing of common variants to understand genetic etiology of common diseases is commonly referred to as Common Disease Common Variants (CDCV) hypothesis where it is believed that many high frequency, or common genetic variants could have large effects on common disease risk. Due to the low cost of sequencing and advancement in technology, a plethora of sequencing data has also been generated which helps in identifying the low frequency or rare genetic variants. Another alternative hypothesis, the Common Disease Rare Variant (CDRV) hypothesis, suggests that low frequency (or rare) variants with high penetrance could largely affect the susceptibility to common genetic diseases. Many pieces of evidence for CDCV and CDRV hypotheses exist in the literature. Thus, both common and rare variant association studies (GWAS and Rare Variant Association Studies or RVAS) have shown importance in understanding missing heritability. To no surprise, it is likely that missing genotypic variance components can be explained by studying common and rare variants together and by integrating both additive and non-additive effects.

The filter press is capable of achieving an operating pressure of up to 150 psi. The unit contains a single set of plates having a filtration area 0.45 m x 0.45 m. Each plate is covered by a poly-propylene cloth with a pore size 0.051 mm.\nThe first slurry sample was obtained from an anthracite cleaning plant located in Pennsylvania. This sample was collected from the plant\u2019s refuse thickener underflow stream, which was feeding a belt-filter press at approximately 24% solids by weight. The sample was a nominal -0.2 mm and had an ash value of 50%. It contained approximately 50% of -0.025 mm material with an ash value of 68%. The second sample was collected from the thickener underflow stream of a bituminous coal cleaning facility located in Pennsylvania. This sample, which was approximately 35% solids by weight, was nominal -0.8 mm and had an ash value of 42%. It contained approximately 25% of -0.025 mm material with an ash value of 64%. The third sample was collected from the thickener underflow stream of another bituminous coal cleaning facility located in Pennsylvania. This sample, which was approximately 22% solids by weight, was nominal -0.14 mm and had an ash value of 15.0%. It contained approximately 65.3% of -0.025 mm material with an ash value of 20.9%. The fourth sample was collected from the thickener underflow stream of a silica-sand processing plant located in Pennsylvania. This sample, which was approximately 10% solids by weight, was nominal -0.14 mm. It contained approximately 37% of -0.025 mm material.\nA statistical design was developed for each sample using Minitab 15. The tests were carried out to evaluate the effects of feed solids concentration, filter time, probe level, air-drying time, and air-blow pressure on filtrate flow, filtrate solids content, final cake moisture, and filter press unit capacity. Overall it was found that the filter time and drying time had the most significant effects on product moisture and the unit capacity. \nFor Plant 1, product moistures ranged from 22% to 28% with filtrate solids content of approximately 0.2% solids by weight. The unit capacities ranged from 0.8 kg/hr/m2 to 3.6 kg/hr/m2 corresponding to filter cake moistures of 17.2% to 26% respectively. For Plant 2, product moistures ranged from 23.5% to 25.5% with filtrate solids content of approximately 1% solids by weight. The unit capacities ranged from 0.81 kg/hr/m2 to 1.1 kg/hr/m2 corresponding to filter cake moistures of 23.8% versus 25.6% respectively. For Plant 3, product moistures ranged from 16% to 21% with filtrate solids content of approximately 0.07% solids by weight. The unit capacities ranged from 2.2 kg/hr/m2 to 4.2 kg/hr/m2 corresponding to filter cake moistures of 16.9% versus 26.1% respectively. For Plant 4, product moistures ranged from 11.9% to 17.5% with filtrate solids content of approximately 0.09% solids by weight. The unit capacities ranged from 1.9 kg/hr/m2 to 3.4 kg/hr/m2 corresponding to filter cake moistures of 28.4% versus 11.9% respectively. The results indicate that the filter press is capable of producing handleable filter cakes without the use of additional flocculants.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6097], "author_name_tesi": "Verma, Shubham ", "last_name_ssi": "Verma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shubham", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Stephen Klima", "Mark Stephen Klima"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Stephen Klima, Thesis Advisor", "Mark Stephen Klima, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["plate and frame filter press", "Fine coal dewatering"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Approaches to Hybrid Synthetic Devices", "id": "9034", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6483", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "All living creatures are made up of cells that have the ability to replicate themselves in a repetitive process called cell division. As these cells mature and divide into two there is an extensive movement of cellular components. In order to perform this essential task that sustains life, cells have evolved machines composed of proteins. Biological motors, such as kinesin, transport intracellular cargo and position organelles in eukaryotic cells via unidirectional movement on cytoskeletal tracts called microtubules. Biomolecular motor proteins have the potential to be used as \u2018nano-engines\u2019 for switchable devices, directed self assembly, controlled bioseparations and powering nano- and microelectromechanical systems. However, engineering such systems requires fabrication processes that are compatible with biological materials such as kinesin motor proteins and microtubules. The first objective of the research was to establish biocompatibility between protein systems and nanofabrication. The second objective was to use current micro- and nanofabrication techniques for patterning proteins at specific locations and to study role of casein in supporting the operation of surface bound kinesin. The third objective was to link kinesin and microtubule system to cellulose nanowhiskers.\nThe effects of micro- and nanofabrication processing chemicals and resists on the functionality of casein, kinesin, and microtubule proteins are systematically examined to address the important missing link of the biocompatibility of micro- and nanofabrication processes needed to realize hybrid system fabrication. It was found that both casein, which is used to prevent motor denaturation on surfaces, and kinesin motors are surprisingly tolerant of most of the processing chemicals examined. Microtubules, however, are much more sensitive. Exposure to the processing chemicals leads to depolymerization, which is partially attributed to the pH of the solutions examined. When the chemicals were diluted in aqueous buffers, a subset of them no longer depolymerized microtubules and in their diluted forms still worked as resist removers. \nElectron beam nanolithography process was used for patterning kinesin motor proteins on glass. This process was then used to fabricate discontinuous kinesin tracks to study the directionality of microtubule movement under the exclusive influence of surface bound patterned kinesin. To study casein and kinesin interactions, a series of microtubule motility assays were performed where whole milk casein, or its &#945;s1 and &#945;s2, &#946; or &#954; subunits, were introduced or omitted at various steps of the motility assay. In addition, a series of epifluorescence and total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF) experiments were conducted where fluorescently labeled casein was introduced at various steps of the motility assay to assess casein-casein and casein-glass binding dynamics. From these experiments it is concluded that casein forms a bi-layer which supports the operation of kinesin. The first tightly bound layer of casein mainly performs the function of anchoring the kinesin while the second more loosely bound layer of casein positions the head domain of the kinesin to more optimally interact with microtubules. Studies on individual casein subunits indicate that &#946; casein is most effective in supporting kinesin functionality while &#954; casein is the least effective.\nKinesin and microtubules self assemble in vitro to form asters that are envisioned to be linked to cellulose fibers. This can be used for creating percolated reinforcing structures that can be used to fabricate composites with reduced fiber content. Technological advances are required to create cellulose orientation during papermaking to reduce the content of fiber while maintaining the paper quality. Microtubule aster assembly can be used as a template to create and study the mechanical properties of percolated cellulose nanowhisker systems. Reducing the fiber content to half will save around 2 billion trees from being used for paper making. We successfully hydrolyzed cotton cellulose using concentrated sulfuric acid and analyzed it by scanning electron microscopy. The whiskers obtained were 400 nm to few micrometers long. Cellulose whiskers were successfully biotinylated and linked to biotinylated microtubules. This study lays down a method to align cellulose nanowhiskers using self assembly of microtubules to create highly percolated cellulose structures using lesser cellulose fiber content.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6480], "author_name_tesi": "Verma, Vivek ", "last_name_ssi": "Verma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vivek", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Jeffrey M Catchmark", "William O Hancock", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Jian Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffrey M Catchmark, Committee Chair", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Kinesin", "Microtubules", "Casein", "Lithography", "Hybrid synthetic devices", "Cellulose"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Molecular dynamics analysis of oxidation, segregation and stress corrosion failures of refractory alloys", "id": "22746", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10117", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The focuses of the thesis are heating induced segregation/mixing of refractory alloys, along with oxidation and stress corrosion properties of selected fcc metals and thin oxide layers formed on the surfaces thereof.\nThe particular studies include segregation and oxidation simulation of Mo3Ni alloy clusters. These reveal favorable stabilizing oxidation resistance properties due to the Ni component, which diffuses during annealing to the surface of the clusters.\nA comparative study has been done for different sized Al grains in Fe or Ni bulk matrices. Its results indicate that Ni matrix is favorable due to the grain dissolution and energetic stability properties upon heating and cooling of the structures. Oxidation simulation of the same structures in slab structures indicate that unmixed metals oxidize first and the alloy layer, which forms only for the Ni matrix, eventually segregates to single-metal layers, which oxidize subsequently.\nThe stress corrosion properties of Al oxide slab/thin film structures in water, noble gas and vacuum environments have been studied with the aim of subsequent stress corrosion simulation of alloys or metals with protective surface oxide layers. The obtained results indicate brittle type failures, which involve shear deformation and localized amorphization. The plasticity enhancing fluid environment effects are found to be similar for both reactive and nonreactive species, which indicates significant pressure effects and passivated reactivity of surfaces. Parallel to the corrosion study, strain rate effects and cyclic loading behavior for slab structures in vacuum have been characterized and compared at different temperatures. These indicate time dependent deformation mechanisms including temperature enhanced local amorphization prior to crack formation. Complementary analyses include extended timescale crack behavior of a slab structure in vacuum using parallel replica dynamics and steady state analysis of a slab structure in water using a Grand Canonical Monte Carlo method. The latter allow for validation of the high strain rate and limited timescale results obtained with classical molecular dynamics.\nHydrogen embrittlement studies have been conducted for Al metal slabs with oxidized surfaces. These have provided evidence for possible grain boundary decohesion and void formation related embrittlement mechanisms at different loading conditions with different initial defects.\nStudies of stress corrosion properties of Ni metal slab structures in water at different temperatures have been performed.

However, this method of density estimation introduces new challenges. Passive acoustic density estimation incorporates several variables, including the number of animal vocalizations detected over a period of time, the probability of detecting vocalizations in a given area, and the vocalization rate of the species of interest. Automatic detectors are needed to quickly and effectively detect vocalizing animals in a large data set. Such detectors need to be assessed for effectiveness, accounting for inefficiencies and quantifying the probability of detecting a vocalization by the species of interest. Another challenge that arises is uncertainty in the geographic distribution of individuals. Estimating distribution through consideration of the horizontal azimuths of vocalizing animals reduces bias introduced by the assumption that on average, animals are uniformly distributed around the sensors.\nLow-frequency ambient noise data ( < 125 Hz) were acquired by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) International Monitoring System, and fin whale vocalizations were detected using Ishmael, an open-access bioacoustic analysis software package. A spectrogram correlation autodetector and a matched filter detector were applied to a portion of the data set to compare performance. The spectrogram correlation method was determined to be most effective and was applied to the full data set considered in this thesis. Bearings were calculated using time delays of received signals in order to estimate distribution of vocalizing animals. Data over three migration seasons (2007 to 2010) were utilized. Results demonstrated that animals were not uniformly distributed around the sensors, highlighting the need to incorporate spatial variability into the density estimation algorithms. Yearly and monthly variations in distribution of animals were also evident at Wake Island, whereas distributions at Diego Garcia were predictable between months and years. When monthly or seasonal variation is evident, density estimation algorithms may need to be adjusted on a monthly or seasonal basis to reflect the changing distribution.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14034], "author_name_tesi": "Vernon, Julia Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Vernon", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Julia", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Miksis-Olds", "David Bradley", "Karl Reichard", "Margaret Brittingham"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Miksis-Olds, Thesis Advisor", "David Bradley, Committee Member", "Karl Reichard, Committee Member", "Margaret Brittingham, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["density estimation", "fin whales"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Investigation of the Prevalence and Spatial Distribution of Salmonella enterica Infections in the Pennsylvania Common Raccoon (procyon lotor)", "id": "18068", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8606", "abstract_tesi": "Salmonella has been shown to have a niche in human, domestic food animal, and pet populations.

This process is guided by the works of researchers who have made their lives a \u201csource of inquiry\u201d (Anzaldua 1987; Negr\u00f3n-Muntaner, 1994; Villenas, 1996; Behar, 1996; Richardson, 1997; Ladson-Billings, 1997; Alvarez, 2001; and Delgado-Bernal, D., Elenes, C.A, Godinez, F., Villenas, S., 2006) in order for readers to hear my inner voice as I reflect about the cultural and educational world that has shaped me (Ladson-Billings, 1997). By doing this, I aim to start decolonizing my mind as I uncover issues that are relevant to members of the colonized and marginalized communities that I am part of.\nThe main reason why I have chosen to pursue such a project is to illustrate the ways in which English, the language that I have chosen to teach others, and which in my country has become associated with U.S. colonial power, can be appropriated and used for the empowerment of my people.  By appropriating the language and making it my own, English stops being the language of the colonizer and becomes a language of liberation that can be used to resist and denounce colonial experience. Therefore, in this dissertation I use personal and professional experiences to explore Puerto Rican colonial experience and the tensions that emerge from it in order to connect my personal experience to that of Puerto Ricans as a people. \nEven though English teaching in P.R has been studied from a variety of historical, critical, socio-cultural and post-colonial perspectives, a perspective that has been long overlooked is that of the Puerto Rican Spanish native speakers who teach English on the Island. This is an area that deserves to be studied because it can potentially empower those responsible for teaching English to Puerto Rican students.  Studies that empower members from historically marginalized groups are important because they help us understand how local appropriations of languages and discourses associated with colonialism provide tools to develop teaching pedagogies that take into account the challenges and possibilities that members from minority communities face. Accordingly, these explorations can help teachers better understand the ways in which they contribute to the oppression or emancipation of their students and communities at large. \nTo this end, the self-study explores my ownership of the English language as I use the language to share my encounters with colonial experience which illustrate how this appropriation serves as an act of ongoing empowerment that helps overcome the legacy of silence fostered in my historically colonized and marginalized communities. While existing literature is rich theoretically and politically, it does not specifically deal with the specific colonial experience of Puerto Rican English teachers. Therefore, throughout the research I draw on concepts from Post-colonial Theory, Latina Feminism, English Language Teaching (ELT), and Critical Pedagogy which contribute to the framing of a theory that fully encompass Puerto Rican colonial reality. That said, this theoriy supports the argument that even within the most constraining colonial relationships or conditions, Puerto Ricans have been able to resist their colonial condition and  empower themselves through the negotiation and appropriation of the languages and discourses that have historically marginalized them.  Consequently, when applied to English language teaching, such a perspective fosters the sharing of these strategies that have been useful to negotiate the cultural and linguistic tensions present within our colonial context. Finally, this perspective also calls for English teachers to reflect on their teaching strategies so that they can accommodate the immediate needs of their students in order to bring about meaningful change to English teaching.\nThe results of this study agree with those of Canagarajah (2003) whose work explores how appropriation and redefinitions of the English language by members of minority communities  contribute to their empowerment as well as for the democratization of English.  According to him, this alternative is beneficial for English as well as for teachers and learners of the language because it contributes to resisting the colonial discourses surrounding English and ELT. These results suggest that when minority communities appropriate English and infuse their local cultures and languages into the language, these communities contribute to the re-constructing of English.  Moreover, this presents learners with the opportunity of questioning not the reasons why they should learn English but rather on how they will do it. When minority teachers and learners engage in this type of questioning, their own knowledge about their cultures, conditions and uses of the language contribute to the transformation of English.  Accordingly, this approach contests the notion that English should be viewed only as a colonial/hegemonic language. By viewing English as such, English then becomes a tool of liberation for minority speakers who as owners of the language are no longer excluded from the Inner Circle of English speakers.\nThese views are fundamental for the decolonizing perspective to English teaching developed for this project because it presents an alternative for English non-native teachers who wish to empower themselves by appropriating English to uncover, denounce and share the tensions present in the ELT field.  Furthermore, by acknowledging these tensions I can become more reflective in my English teaching practice. As I acknowledge my ownership of English, I become more reflective in my practice as I become aware of the struggles and needs that I share with my students. Moreover, this awareness helps me become more sensitive to the issues, strengths and limitations that my students bring into the classroom. This sensibility helps me develop teaching strategies that draw on my students\u2019 strengths rather than on their weaknesses. By engaging in this type of teaching I am embracing the possibilities that a decolonizing perspective to English teaching can offer to my English language learners.  Finally, a decolonizing perspective to English teaching gives me the opportunity to share my ideas and strategies with the larger English teaching community, and by doing so I am actively contributing to the transformation of English and our students.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4720], "author_name_tesi": "Vicente, Nancy  Vanessa", "last_name_ssi": "Vicente", "middle_name_ssi": "Vanessa", "first_name_ssi": "Nancy ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Miryam Espinosa Dulanto", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto", "Bernard Joel Badiali", "Jane Juffer", "Murry R Nelson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Miryam Espinosa Dulanto, Dissertation Advisor", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto, Committee Chair", "Bernard Joel Badiali, Committee Chair", "Jane Juffer, Committee Member", "Murry R Nelson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Auto-ethnography", "Testimonio", "Latino Studies", "Self-study. narrative inquiry"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Political Transitions and National Security: Strategies for Defense and Political Survival in New States, New Democracies, and New Autocracies\n", "id": "7369", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2559", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Governments of new regimes in old states and governments of new states share the common challenge of establishing their political legitimacy and governing in a political environment of heightened uncertainty over whether the leadership and regime will survive or be overthrown by a political competitor, foreign or domestic.  Together, I call this class of states that have recently experienced a major political transition \u2013 regime change or new statehood \u2013 \u201cnewly transitioned states\u201d (NTSs).  In this dissertation, I argue that the challenges of governing an NTS are likely to cause NTS leaders to adopt a decision making calculus on issues of national security that is different from that of other leaders, which makes NTSs both convergent as a group and distinctive from most other states that have served as the \u201cmodel\u201d for generalizations in international relations theory.  In quantitative analyses of states worldwide from 1950 to 1998, I compare national security policies adopted by NTSs to those adopted by other states with respect to militarization, international conflict, alliances, and arms transfers.  In addition, among NTSs, I compare national security policies among sub-types of NTSs, such as new democratic and new autocratic regimes and new and old states.  Drawing on a synthesis of selectorate theory, bargaining theory and democratization theory, I generate several testable propositions of how NTS leaders will adopt national security policies that can allow them to pursue an effective strategy of political survival to maintain power within their new regime, consolidate the power of their regime, and defend their state from foreign rivals.  The findings reveal that NTSs exhibit different policy tendencies from other states across these dimensions of national security policy, which supports my contention that NTSs should be viewed as distinct political entities in international relations theory.  In addition, the analysis of sub-types of NTSs reveals important points of convergence as well.  Furthermore, certain national security policies are found to have different consequences for the political survival of NTS leaders than for leaders of more established governments.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2539], "author_name_tesi": "Victor, Jonah ", "last_name_ssi": "Victor", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jonah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Errol Anthony Henderson", "Douglas William Lemke", "Gretchen G Casper", "Mark Sebastian Anner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Errol Anthony Henderson, Committee Chair", "Douglas William Lemke, Committee Member", "Gretchen G Casper, Committee Member", "Mark Sebastian Anner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["International Cooperation and Conflict", "Political Development", "Democratization", "Foreign Policy", "International Security", "Military Alliances", "Militarization"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "STUDIES TOWARD THE SYNTHESIS OF EFGH RING SYSTEM OF DIAZONAMIDE A;\nPUMMERER CHEMISTRY APPLIED TOWARD THE SYNTHESIS OF 3,3-SPIROCYCLIC OXINDOLES", "id": "6486", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1340", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Synthetic approaches to 3,3-spirocyclic oxindoles, moieties commonly encountered in many natural products, has been described.

The methodology employed a variant of the Pummerer reaction of an indole precursor.  3-Substituted 2-(phenylsulfinyl)indole derivatives were tested under conditions typical for the classical rearrangement.  The corresponding products, 3,3-spirocyclic 2-(phenylthio)indolenines, were isolated in excellent yields and hydrolyzed to uncover the oxindole functionality.  The Pummerer reaction was performed on enantioenriched sulfinyl compounds and the products were obtained with good enantiomeric excess, suggesting additive mechanism of the rearrangement.  The corresponding 3-substituted 2-(phenylsulfenyl)indoles were studied in a Pummerer-like transformation induced by Stang's reagent, PhI(CN)OTf.  The resultant 3,3-spirocyclic 2-(phenylthio)indolenines were obtained in very good yields directly from the thioether compounds, thus shortening the route to the desired 3,3-spirocyclic oxindoles.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1329], "author_name_tesi": "Vidulova, Daniela Boneva", "last_name_ssi": "Vidulova", "middle_name_ssi": "Boneva", "first_name_ssi": "Daniela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ken S Feldman", "Raymond Lee Funk", "Blake R Peterson", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ken S Feldman, Committee Chair", "Raymond Lee Funk, Committee Member", "Blake R Peterson, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["oxindole", "quaternary carbon", "Pummerer reaction", "oxidative cyclization", "hypervalent iodine", "photochemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A modified structure from motion framework based on smartphone imaging for 3D reconstruction of arbitrary shapes", "id": "13939afv5067", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13939", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is a need for scalable open source 3D reconstruction systems for reverse engineering and in other applications involving additive manufacturing.

While current dogma suggests that pAPCs are necessary to activate na\u00efve CD8+ T cells there is evidence that tumors of non-pAPC origin can also directly activate na\u00efve CD8+ T cells.  One of the main problems with identifying the contribution of direct-presentation to the activation of na\u00efve CD8+ T cells is the inability to sequester direct-presentation from cross-presentation.  While direct-presentation by antigen expressing cells can be blocked, no effective strategy has been used to target antigen exclusively for the direct-presentation pathway while maintaining an intact immune system.\n \tThe model antigen used in this study, large T antigen (Tag) from Simian virus 40, is both a known oncoprotein and well-defined tumor antigen.  It was found that Tag minimal epitope I and IV are not cross-presented.  Therefore, expression of these Tag minimal epitopes in a non-pAPC line allowed for the study of direct-presentation of Tag epitopes in isolation from cross-presentation.  The role of direct-presentation was examined in the na\u00efve, activated, and memory CD8+ T cell responses.  Na\u00efve CD8+ T cells did not respond to direct-presentation on non-pAPCs while antigen experienced cells did respond to direct-presentation on non-pAPCs, although this response was less efficient than when antigen could also be cross-presented. \n\tThe roles that costimulation, localization, and short extensions of the minimal epitope had on CD8+ T cell response were also examined.   Only the addition of the costimulatory molecule B7.1 enabled na\u00efve CD8+ T cells to respond to direct-presentation on non-pAPCs.  These results suggest that pAPCs, which provide both MHCI:peptide presentation and costimulation, are necessary for a CD8+ T cell response to SV40 Tag.  While cross-presentation is necessary, a suboptimal CD8+ T cell response developed when cross-presentation on pAPCs was the only source of antigen, however the CD8+ T cell response was recovered when direct-presentation on a non-pAPC was also provided.  These results suggest that direct-presentation on non-pAPCs, though not sufficient to trigger a CD8+ T cell response to cell associated antigen is necessary for optimal accumulation of CD8+ T cells. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [625], "author_name_tesi": "Vigliotti, Beth Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Vigliotti", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Beth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Todd Schell", "Todd Schell", "Satvir Singh Tevethia", "Mary Judith Tevethia", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Hui Ling Chiang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Todd Schell, Dissertation Advisor", "Todd Schell, Committee Chair", "Satvir Singh Tevethia, Committee Member", "Mary Judith Tevethia, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Hui Ling Chiang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CD8+ T cell", "immunology", "cross-presentation", "direct-presentation", "SV40", "large T antigen", "minigenes"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Profit Aware Frequency Binning of Semiconductors", "id": "15070", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7364", "abstract_tesi": "Semiconductors in the form of Integrated Circuits (ICs) have become an integral part of our technology driven world today.

The current trend of increasing wind turbine diameter and hub height increases the interaction of the wind turbines with the upper ASL which contains spatio-temporal velocity variations over a wide range of length and time scales. Our interest is the interaction of the wind turbine with the energetic integral-scale eddies, since these\ncause the largest temporal variations in blade loadings. The rotation of a wind turbine blade through the ABL causes fluctuations in the local velocity magnitude and angle of attack at different sections along the blade. The blade boundary layer responds to these fluctuations and in turn causes temporal transients in local\nsectional loads and integrated blade and shaft bending moments. While the integral scales of the atmospheric boundary layer are  O(10\u2212100m) in the horizontal with advection time scales of order tens of seconds, the viscous surface layer of the blade boundary layer is O(10 \u2212 100 \u03bcm) with time scales of order milliseconds. Thus, the response of wind turbine blade loadings to atmospheric turbulence is the result\nof the interaction between two turbulence dynamical systems at extremely disparate\nranges of length and time scales. A deeper understanding of this interaction can\nimpact future approaches to improve the reliability of wind turbines in wind farms,\nand can underlie future improvements. My thesis centers on the development of a computational framework to simulate the interaction between the atmospheric and wind turbine blade turbulence dynamical systems using a two step one-way coupled approach. Pseudo-spectral large eddy simulation (LES) is used to generate a true (equilibrium) atmospheric boundary layer over a flat land with specified surface roughness and heating consistent with the stability state of the daytime lower troposphere. Using the data from the precursor simulation as inflow conditions, a second simulation is performed on a smaller domain around the wind turbine using finite volume CFD with a body-fitted grid to compute the unsteady blade loads in response to atmospheric turbulence. Analysis of the precursor LES shows that the advective time scales multiple rotation time scales of the rotor. From blade element momentum theory coupled with LES of the ABL, we find that the energy-containing eddies were found to cause large temporal fluctuations (\u00b150%) in the integrated moments, primarily\ndue to changes in the local flow angle relative to the local chord sections.\nA low-dissipation pseudo-spectral algorithm was applied to the ABL LES. A finite volume algorithm was required to resolve the flow features around the complex blade geometry. The effect of the finite volume algorithm on the accuracy of it\u2019s prediction of the rough-surface ABL was assessed using the method of Brasseur and Wei [1]. We found that finite volume algorithms need finer horizontal grid resolution to retain the same accuracy as the corresponding pseudo-spectral simulations. These\nresults were used to design our computational framework to accurately propagate the turbulence eddies through the finite volume domain. The ability of our computational framework to capture blade boundary layer\ndynamics in response to atmospheric turbulence is intimately associated with the extreme care taken in the design of our grid and with the development of a new hybrid URANS-LES turbulence model. The new turbulence model blends a 1-equation LES subgrid model in the far field with the k\u2212w\u2212SST\u2212SAS URANS model to the blade boundary layer adjacent to the blade surface. With this computational framework, we simulated a single rotating blade of the NREL-\n5MW wind turbine in the moderately convective daytime atmosphere using blade-boundary-layer-resolved CFD simulations. The analysis of load fluctuations on a single rotating blade in a daytime atmosphere using blade-boundary-layer-resolved CFD has yielded two key results:\n(1) Whereas non-steady blade loadings are generally described as the response to\nnon-steadiness in wind speed, our analysis show that time changes in wind vector\ndirection are a much greater contributor to load transients, and strongly impact boundary layer dynamics; (2) largest temporal variations in loadings result from three distinct dynamical responses with disparate time scales: advection of atmospheric eddies through the rotor at the minute time scale, blade response at the rotor rotation time scale (5s) and blade response to turbulence-induced forcings\nas the blades traverse internal atmospheric eddy structure at sub-blade rotation time scales. In our simulations at rated wind speed, quasi-2D blade boundary layer separation is observed over most of the outer 50% of the blade with chordwise motions, correlated with time changes in relative wind vector angle, which itself is strongly correlated with changes in blade sectional and integrated loads. Thus, tools based on sectional \u201ctable lookups\u201d like FAST [2] and Actuator Line Methods\n[3], improved using data from high-fidelity simulations and experiment, have the potential to capture the major fluctuations in integrated loads from daytime atmospheric turbulence.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11243], "author_name_tesi": "Vijayakumar, Ganesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Vijayakumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ganesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Gordon Brasseur", "James Gordon Brasseur", "Eric Paterson", "Philip John Morris", "Marcelo Chamecki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Gordon Brasseur, Dissertation Advisor", "James Gordon Brasseur, Committee Chair", "Eric Paterson, Committee Member", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "Marcelo Chamecki, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Atmosphere", "Wind Turbines", "LES", "Hybrid URANS-LES", "ABL", "Atmospheric Boundary Layer"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Protecting Programs During Resource Access", "id": "21412", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9651", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the emergence of targeted malware such as Stuxnet and the continued prevalence of spyware and other types of malicious software, host security has become a critical issue. Attackers break into systems through vulnerabilities in network daemons, malicious insiders, or social engineering, and then attempt to escalate privileges to the administrator to gain complete control of the system by exploiting local vulnerabilities. Thus far, such local vulnerabilities have received little attention, and it has been taken for granted that any attacker break-in can easily be escalated to full control.\n\nIn this dissertation, we identify a class of previously disjoint local vulnerability attack classes that we call resource access attacks, and provide a framework to detect and defend against them. Programs have to fetch resources, such as files from the operating system (OS) to function. However, local adversaries such as spyware also share this namespace of resources, and can trick programs into retrieving an unintended resource using a variety of resource access attacks that make up 10-15% of vulnerabilities reported each year. Such attacks are challenging to defend for a few reasons. First, program checks to defend against such attacks cause a performance overhead, so programmers have an incentive to omit checks altogether. Second, there is a disconnect between the parties involved in resource access. On the one hand, due to this overhead, programmers omit checks under the expectation that the deployment\u2019s access control policy will protect a subset of resources from adversaries. On the other hand, access control policies are framed by OS distributors and system administrators, who in turn have little idea about programmer expectations, causing mismatches with programmer expectations. Third, even when programmers check resource access, such checks are difficult to get right due to inherent races in the system call API. Previous work handles a subset of resource access attacks but in ad-hoc ways.\n\nThis dissertation takes several steps to address resource access attacks. First, we present a technique for automated evaluation of a program attack surface in its system deployment, where checks for resource access are required. Second, we present a technique that uses this attack surface to detect a subset of resource access attacks. We found more than 25 previously-unknown vulnerabilities across a variety of both mature and new programs in the widely-used Fedora and Ubuntu Linux distributions, proving the prevalence of such vulnerabilities. Third, we present the Process Firewall, a system to defend against resource access attacks in an efficient manner without requiring program code change. Fourth, we propose a technique to automatically derive the programmer-expected attack surface of a program, and generate Process Firewall rules to enforce that the only adversary-controlled resource accesses in the deployment are part of the expected attack surface.

In most supply chain optimization models, the decisions on transportation and inventory have traditionally been considered as separate entities to avoid complex mathematical formulations. This thesis incorporates the transportation and inventory decisions in the same model. The model helps in identifying the optimal modes of transport to be used between each stage of the supply chain, the optimal inventory levels to be maintained at each stage thereby minimizing the overall cost incurred in the supply chain. While minimizing the overall supply chain cost, the responsiveness of the supply chain is also maximized by modeling it as a bi-criteria optimization problem.\nIn the proposed model, multiple modes of transport are used between the different stages of the supply chain with an incremental quantity discount cost structure for the freight rates. For inventory, there is a company owned warehouse with a finite storage capacity and a leased warehouse with infinite capacity if the capacity at the company owned warehouse is exceeded. The leased warehouse has an incremental quantity discount cost structure for the storage space. There is only one product flowing in the supply chain. The multi-criteria optimization model is solved using non preemptive goal programming by giving weights to the two objectives and also by preemptive goal programming assigning different priorities to the objectives. The model identifies the right amount of quantity to be shipped by the appropriate mode of transport at each supply chain stage, the right amount of inventory to be stored at the warehouses (company owned and leased) and the accumulated backorder at the various stages (if any) in order to minimize the total supply chain cost and maximize the customer responsiveness.\nThe model is illustrated with simulated data for two scenarios, one for prioritizing the cost over the customer responsiveness and another for prioritizing customer responsiveness over cost.

Helicobacter diagnosis and monitoring, primarily by fecal polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is often included in health surveillance programs for mouse colonies.  These programs often involve transfer of soiled bedding from colony animals to expendable \u201csentinel\u201d mice to facilitate disease diagnosis.  However, recent studies indicate that transmission of Helicobacter to sentinel mice does not always occur. We investigated the mechanisms of transmission failure of H. typhlonius, one of the most recently discovered Helicobacter species. We transferred soiled bedding from female BALB/c mice experimentally infected with H. typhlonius to cages of pair-housed female Swiss Webster (SW) mice once weekly or every other week. After 20 wk, mice in only 3 out of 8 cages (38%) that were exposed weekly became Helicobacter fecal PCR-positive, while none of the mice from the group exposed every other week became PCR-positive. In contrast, 2 cages of 2 female Swiss mice housed in direct contact with an inoculated BALB/c mouse became PCR-positive within 4 wk of exposure.  Some inoculated BALB/c mice remained Helicobacter PCR-positive for up to 31 wk post-inoculation (\u201cconsistently PCR-positive mice\u201d) while others reverted to PCR-negative status after as few as 4 wk of PCR-positive results.  Our qPCR results indicated that mice shed between 103 and 107.4 copies of H. typhlonius genome/\u00ecg fecal DNA. To determine whether there was H. typhlonius transmission failure or elimination of infection in sentinel mice, western blot against H. typhlonius membrane antigens was performed.  Helicobacter fecal PCR results correlate with western blot of mouse sera for detection of H. typhlonius colonization. All inoculated BALB/c mice had mild typhlocolitis but the consistently PCR-positive mice had quantitatively more severe pathology than the inconsistently positive mice. To test the colonization ability of our strain of H. typhlonius, male BALB/c mice and male and female SW mice were gavaged with fresh fecal suspensions from PCR-positive mice. Only 3 out of 15 mice (20%) became infected. We attempted to culture H. typhlonius from mouse feces at 24 hr intervals to determine how long H. typhlonius remains viable in feces.  Although H. typhlonius could be isolated from 100% of fresh fecal samples (immediately after deposition), the isolation rate dropped to 25% for time points 24 and 48 hr.  Our observations show that H. typhlonius transmission to sentinel mice is dependent on both its limited duration of viability in the environment and colonization ability. In conclusion, H. typhlonius is not reliably transmitted to sentinel mice by soiled bedding transfer.   Accurate detection of H. typhlonius by fecal PCR requires that colony mice be tested directly. We postulate that H. typhlonius colonization in our experiments was impeded and controlled by the resident intestinal microbiota of the mice.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3017], "author_name_tesi": "Villano, Jason  So ", "last_name_ssi": "Villano", "middle_name_ssi": "So ", "first_name_ssi": "Jason ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Laboratory Animal Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Catherine Beckwith", "Catherine Beckwith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Catherine Beckwith, Thesis Advisor", "Catherine Beckwith, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Helicobacter typhlonius", "PCR", "sentinel mice", "western blot"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "STUDIES ON MALE DRONES YIELD NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE MECHANISM UNDELYING ODOR-MEDIATED SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IN THE HONEY BEE (Apis mellifera L.)", "id": "13529gwv5020", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13529", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding how chemical signals cause specific changes in behavior, and how these behavioral responses are modulated (possibly due to modifications to the complexity of the signal, how it is detected and/or processed by the olfactory system, and how distinct physiological states of the receiver may impact receptivity to a signal) remain outstanding questions in the fields of chemical ecology and neuroethology. Here I employed comparative studies in honey bees, and primarily utilized drones, to gain new insights into the mechanisms that underlie odor-mediated behavior in this eusocial insect.\nWe have identified that the mechanisms driving maturation-related differences in behavioral receptivity to the queen are likely based in the central brain, not in the peripheral nervous system. This is in contrast with sex-associated differences in response to the queen, which appear to have a significant basis in the periphery (Chapter 2). In Chapter 3, we tested the theory that social pheromones may have evolved from sex pheromones. Our findings on the sex and social pheromone 9-ODA did not support this theory, as we found that the pathways in which 9-ODA affect worker and drone physiology and behavior are likely shared. In testing this theory we also identify a new primer pheromone in honey bees that affects males, a relatively rare biological phenomenon. Pheromone communication in honey bees regulates the social environment and is based on the complexity of the pheromone signal and differential processing based on the receiver\u2019s caste and physiological state. Pheromone profile shifts in response to changes in the queen reproductive physiology further modulate social responses in workers. In Chapter 4 we demonstrate that drones are also receptive to these changes and propose that this may be a mechanism driving drone-queen interactions in and out of the colony. In Chapter 5, we identify the compounds produced in the drone mandibular gland and confirm their biological activity. This is a critical first step in understanding how drones are navigating their social environment.\nIn considering these findings, multiple significant conclusions emerge. First, drones are engaging in their social environment through a more complex chemical communication system than the research community has previously anticipated. Drones are receptive to the same pheromones as workers and are able to respond accordingly to different aspects of pheromone complexity (compounds, blend specificity, and now, profile shifts). Furthermore, they may also be producing their own pheromones, elaborating on the already complex communication system of honey bees. Going forward, drones are likely to prove their value as a resource in advancing our understanding of social behavior and its underlying odor-mediated mechanisms.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13642], "author_name_tesi": "Villar, Gabriel ", "last_name_ssi": "Villar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gabriel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christina Grozinger", "Thomas Charles Baker", "Heather M Hines", "N/A", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite-Read"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christina Grozinger, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Charles Baker, Committee Chair", "Heather M Hines, Committee Member", "N/A, Committee Member", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite-Read, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Honey bee", "Drone", "Pheromone", "Chemical Ecology", "Behavior", "Olfaction"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE SHORT NOVEL AND THE REPRESENTATION OF SUBJECTIVITY:\nMANHUNT BY ALEJO CARPENTIER AND MEMORY OF MY MELANCHOLY WHORES BY GABRIEL GARC\u00cdA M\u00c1RQUEZ\n", "id": "9494", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4373", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines the Latin American short novel, a poorly studied genre of Spanish American narrative.

Research evidence indicates that racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status (SES) differences are related to the educational trajectories of students.

Past studies have shown that extensive immersion in the L2 environment affects production of the L1 at the phonological, lexical, and syntactic levels (e.g., Bullock & Gerfen, 2004, Seliger & Vago, 1991; Linck, Kroll, & Sunderman, 2009). However, fewer studies have investigated the effects of L2 immersion on L1 comprehension (Dussias & Sagarra, 2007). Although this study suggests that L2 immersion can also affect the way speakers read sentences in their L1, results have only focused on certain processing strategies (e.g., the high and low attachment preferences of ambiguous relative clauses). This raises the question of whether L2 immersion can also change the way other strategies are used during sentence processing. Therefore, in this dissertation, I examine whether strategies used to make predictions in the L1 Spanish sentence comprehension are also vulnerable to change when speakers of two languages are immersed in their L2 English. I chose to use the Spanish mood system (i.e., differences between the inflectional morphology in the indicative and subjunctive moods) as my tool to investigate these changes to the L1. Two reasons motivated this choice. First, the mood system in Spanish contains the syntactic requirements needed to test predictive processing. Second, when compared to English, the Spanish mood system is morphologically richer than the English system, making it more vulnerable to change from the point of view of usage- and frequency-based models (e.g., Bybee, 2006; MacDonald, 2013). These models predict that the frequency of exposure to linguistic regularities results in shaping the production and the comprehension system of a language. \nProduction and comprehension data from three groups of native speakers of Spanish in different L2 immersion conditions (non-immersed, immersed, heritage speakers) were collected to (i) evaluate whether they access lexical information to predict inflectional morphology in an upcoming verb and (ii) to assess whether L2 immersion affects the way predictive strategies are used while participants read sentences in their first language.  The results of the comprehension data revealed that all three groups of speakers behaved similarly and used the information encoded in a verb to predict the correct upcoming morphology in an embedded clause. The results of the production data examining the participants\u2019 knowledge of the Spanish mood system in an offline task revealed that participants in the non-immersed and immersed groups used the information encoded in verbs to complete sentences with the correct mood morphology when followed by an embedded clause. However, the group of heritage speakers showed significantly lower production of verbs marked morphologically in the subjunctive mood. Overall, these results not only suggest that L2 immersion does not affect all processing strategies but they also provide evidence that suggests that linguistic representations are used differently in production and in comprehension. Thus, the contribution of this dissertation is twofold. It provides empirical evidence with regards to a neglected area in the immersion literature and it helps advance our understanding about the differences in production and comprehension.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9506], "author_name_tesi": "Villegas Erce, Alvaro ", "last_name_ssi": "Villegas Erce", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alvaro", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Matthew J Marr", "Karen Lynn Miller", "Matthew Carlson", "Carrie Neal Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paola Eulalia Dussias, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew J Marr, Committee Member", "Karen Lynn Miller, Committee Member", "Matthew Carlson, Committee Member", "Carrie Neal Jackson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sentence processing", "Spanish", "Subjunctive mood"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Mindfulness and Psychotherapy: A Mixed Methods Investigation\n\n", "id": "9872", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3997", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Psychotherapy research could benefit from attention focusing on the qualities of the therapist that are beneficial to therapy as well as how to cultivate these qualities (Norcross, 2002).

Presence, being grounded in oneself and one\u2019s experiences while maintaining attunement to another person, is a relatively uninvestigated therapist quality, but there is preliminary evidence that suggests its importance (Geller & Greenberg, 2002). While mindfulness, a nonjudgmental moment-to-moment awareness of one\u2019s experience (Kabat-Zinn, 1997), has been shown to have a range of benefits to individuals, it has not been investigated with respect to psychotherapists. This study was an in-depth mixed methods case design investigating the relationships between therapist mindfulness and presence with empathy, anxiety and session progress from the point of view of the therapist and the client. Quantitative findings show that therapist mindfulness and presence were related to the criterion variables in the expected directions. The qualitative data suggest a number of ways in which therapists might cultivate presence, empathy and reduce their anxiety during sessions with clients. The emerging theory from the quantitative and qualitative data is that by being aware of one\u2019s experience in a nonjudgmental way, the therapist is more effective in his/her relationship with the client. Because therapist training involves a strong emphasis on outward attention to the client, these findings will hopefully shed light on the necessity for a balance between outwardly and inwardly attending. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3971], "author_name_tesi": "Vinca, Maria Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Vinca", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counseling Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Hayes", "Jeffrey Hayes", "Louis Georges Castonguay", "Benjamin D Locke", "Spencer Niles"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Hayes, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffrey Hayes, Committee Chair", "Louis Georges Castonguay, Committee Member", "Benjamin D Locke, Committee Member", "Spencer Niles, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mindfulness", "presence", "psychotherapy"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Parisian Landscapes: Public Parks and Art Urbain, 1977-1995\n", "id": "10633", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "19", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Having evolved from of a profession that has undergone profound transformations since the beginning of the century, renewed municipal political and administrative structures, and Parisians\u2019 own expressed wishes for more and improved green space, the large urban parks created by the City of Paris from 1977 to 1995, including the Parc Andr\u00e9-Citro\u00ebn, Parc de Bercy, and Promenade plant\u00e9e, dramatically altered perceptions of urban landscape design potential. Aesthetically complex, theoretically sophisticated, and mindful of their social role within the city, these parks were developed by architects and landscape architects selected through high-profile design competitions and were grafted into sectors of the city undergoing renovation and renewal. As such, they provided a true alternative to the uniformity, functionalism, and traditional style that had been the trademark of the city parks service, laboring under the weight of Second Empire\u2019s style municipal and the reductive spatial grammar of Modernism. Rather, these parks offered fresh approaches to the garden tradition and reoriented the symbolic geography of the city. \nThis dissertation proposes a cultural analysis of Parisian public parks during the period 1977-1995 with the aims of analyzing these parks from an aesthetic and cultural point of view, and exploring their impact on broader questions of cultural memory, image construction, and contemporary urban design, using this phenomenon as a prism through which to better understand contemporary France. \nMy formal and contextual analysis of these parks is situated at the intersection of two fields: French studies and landscape and garden studies. The former, which draws methods and perspectives from the cultural history of the present as applied to the everyday urban environment, provides an understanding of the socio-cultural context and political stakes of urban park creation. The latter offers concepts and theories addressing society\u2019s culturally-mediated relationship to nature, drawing on related disciplines whose shared purview is the articulation and qualitative perception of space, such as the visual arts, architecture, and cultural geography. Both fields practice poststructuralist readings of visual culture. This study is ultimately conceived as a contribution, through the object park, to French cultural studies, for which the city, public space, the environment, and ecology are subjects of increasing scholarly interest. \nThe study shows how each of the three parks, by using traditional stylistic elements devalued or abandoned in Modernist green space design, and by engaging with history and memory as well as with current contexts, become heterotopic sites (to borrow Michel Foucault\u2019s terminology). Rather than owing this otherness to their soothing vegetal elements in contrast to the roil of the surrounding city, the symbolic and poetic nature of these parks predominates over nature and its representation, so that they stimulate an allusive, metaphorical, or allegorical experience. This quest for an aesthetically and symbolically engaging experience in the urban context resonates with Bernard Huet\u2019s vision of l\u2019art urbain, meaning urban design grounded in principles of interdisciplinarity, a heightened appreciation for the city as the site of everyday life, and sensitivity to perception and representation within the urban landscape. The choice to project complex aesthetic and ecological sensitivity into the public sphere while taking up historical themes and styles in a critical manner suggests a possible definition of a French postmodern garden.

The original model for program delivery for Cooperative Extension is the expert model, which is characterized as a top-down approach, where communication and expertise originate from the university and Extension relays resources determined to meet local needs. Cooperative Extension has been encouraged to adopt a more engaged model of program delivery since as early as the 1960\u2019s.
