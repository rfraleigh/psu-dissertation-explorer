A large number of algorithms and tools have been developed to aid the cyber security analysis, such as vulnerability analysis, intrusion detection, network and system monitoring and recovery, and so on. Although these algorithms and tools have eased the security analysts\u2019 work to some extent, their knowledge bases are usually isolated from each other. It\u2019s a very challenging task for security analysts to combine these knowledge bases and generate a wholistic understanding towards the enterprise networks\u2019 real situation.\n\nTo address the above problem, this paper takes the following approach. 1) Based on existing theories of situation awareness, a Situation Knowledge Reference Model (SKRM) is constructed to integrate data, information, algorithms/tools, and human knowledge into a whole stack. SKRM serves as an umbrella model that enables e ective analysis of complex cyber-security problems. 2) The Bayesian Network is employed to incorporate and fuse information from di erent knowledge bases. Due to the overwhelming amount of alerts and the high false rates, digging out real facts is di cult. In addition, security analysis is usually bound with a number of uncertainties. Hence, Bayesian Networks is an e ective approach to leverage the collected evidence and eliminate uncertainties.\n\nWith SKRM as the guidance, two independent security problems are identified: the stealthy bridge problem in cloud and the zero-day attack path problem. This paper will demonstrate how these problems can be analyzed and addressed by constructing proper Bayesian Networks on top of di erent layers from SKRM.\n\nFirst, the stealthy bridge problem. Enterprise network islands in cloud are expected to be absolutely isolated from each other except for some public services. However, current virtualization mechanism cannot ensure such perfect isolation. Some \u201cstealthy bridges\u201d may be created to break the isolation due to virtual machine image sharing and virtual machine co-residency. This paper proposes to build a cloud-level attack graph to capture the potential attacks enabled by stealthy bridges and reveal possible hidden attack paths that are previously missed by individual enterprise network attack graphs. Based on the cloud-level attack graph, a cross-layer Bayesian network is constructed to infer the existence of stealthy bridges given supporting evidence from other intrusion steps.\n\nSecond, the zero-day attack path problem. A zero-day attack path is a multi- step attack path that includes one or more zero-day exploits. This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to identify the zero-day attack paths. An object instance graph is first established to capture the intrusion propagation. A Bayesian network is then built to compute the probabilities of object instances being infected. Connected through dependency relations, the instances with high infection probabilities form a path, which is viewed as the zero-day attack path.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11987], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Xiaoyan ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaoyan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peng Liu", "Peng Liu", "John Yen", "Dinghao Wu", "George Kesidis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peng Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Peng Liu, Committee Chair", "John Yen, Committee Member", "Dinghao Wu, Committee Member", "George Kesidis, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cloud Security", "Bayesian Network", "Situation Awareness", "System Call", "Zero-day Attack", "Enterprise network security"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "INTEGRATED SERVICE MODEL IN HETEROGENEOUS WIRELESS NETWORKS\n", "id": "9069", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6930", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The development of Next Generation Network (NGN) will integrate\nvarious different networks and services into one single All-IP based\narchitecture. IMS promises a cost-effective evolution path to NGN\nservice convergence. Great effort has been expended to integrate\nfixed and mobile network services. A variety of wireless\ntechnologies are being deployed to provide IP based services.\nHeterogeneity is becoming the norm of future wireless world. We\npropose and evaluate the architectures and algorithms that enable a\nrich set of services to be offered efficiently in widely\nheterogeneous next generation mobile networks.

The Multiple Backhaul Mobile Access Router aims to provide\nhigh capacity and high performance Internet access for emerging\nmobile wireless applications. A set of backhaul interface monitoring\nAPIs are provided to support flexible handover policies. We present\nthe experimental results to validate the performance of our mobile\naccess router and illustrate tradeoffs when designing handover\npolicies. In addition, we extend the framework to support\napplication configurable striping protocols and implement the per\nuser striping protocol on the MAR. The experimental results validate\nthe performance of our mobile access router and different switching\npolicies integration. With the above enhancements, the MAR is able\nto provide aggregated communication channels to the users, and\nenhance reliability by switching wireless interfaces when it is\nnecessary.\n\nLocation based services are becoming increasingly important to the\nsuccess and attractiveness of next generation wireless systems.\nHowever, a natural tension arises between the need for user privacy\nand the flexible use of location information. We present a framework\nto support privacy enhanced location based services and a practical\nLBS system implementation. The key idea behind the system is to\nhierarchically encrypt location information under different keys,\nand distribute the appropriate keys only to group members with the\nnecessary permission. Furthermore, the intrinsic hierarchical\nproperty of location information motivates the design to exploit the\nadvantages of hierarchical key distribution. Hierarchical location\ninformation coding offers flexible location information access which\nenables a rich set of location based services. We propose a key tree\nrebalancing algorithm to maintain the re-keying performance of the\ngroup key management. Our load tests show such a system is highly\npractical with good efficiency and scalability.\n\nThe signaling in IMS is based on the SIP which is already widely\nused for signaling in VoIP networks. IMS networks are expected to\nhave a significant increase in their signaling loads, and a\ncorresponding higher computational cost on network elements. In the\nmean time, by introducing IP connectivity, 3G networks are\nvulnerable to new adversaries. In order to maintain the service\nrequirements of future integrated wireless networks, while reducing\nthe cost of the network, we have to protect the processing servers\nfrom overload in the core network. We design, analyze and implement\noverload control algorithms at different layers. We show the\nperformance results in an experimental SIP network and provide\npractical suggestions for deploying such systems in all IP based\nnetworks. We propose a framework to design overload control in\nkernel when IPSec is used to protect the signaling exchange. In\naddition we evaluate the system under malicious traffic injection\nwith IPSec.

Such crawling activities can be regulated from the server side by deploying the Robots Exclusion\nProtocol in a file called robots.txt. Ethical crawlers (and many commercial) will follow the rules specified in robots.txt files. Since the Robots Exclusion Protocol has become a de facto standard for crawler regulation, a thorough study of the regulation and behavior of crawlers with respect to the Robots Exclusion Protocol allows us to understand the impact of search engines and the current situation of privacy and security issues related to web crawlers.\n\nThe Robots Exclusion Protocol allows websites to explicitly specify an access preference for each crawler by name. Such biases may lead to a ``rich get richer\" situation, in which a few popular search engines ultimately dominate the web because they have preferred access to resources that are inaccessible to others. We propose a\nmetric to evaluate the degree of bias to which specific crawlers are subjected. We have investigated 7,593 websites covering education,\ngovernment, news, and business domains, and collected 2,925 distinct robots.txt files. Results of content and statistical analysis of the\ndata confirm that the crawlers of popular search engines and information portals, such as Google, Yahoo, and MSN, are generally favored by most of the websites we have sampled. The biases toward\npopular search engines are verified by applying the bias metric to 4.6 million robots.txt files from the web. These results also show a strong correlation between the search engine market share and the bias toward particular search engine crawlers.\n\nSince the Robots Exclusion Protocol is only an advisory standard, actual crawler behavior may differ from the regulation rules. In other words, crawlers may ignore robots.txt files or violate part of the rules in robots.txt files. A thorough analysis of web access logs reveals many potential ethical and privacy issues in web\ncrawler generated visits. We present the log analysis results of three large scale websites and the applications of the data extracted from the log analysis including estimating the crawler\npopulation and user stability measures.\n\nTo minimize negative aspects of crawler generated visits on websites, the ethical issues of crawler behavior with respect to the crawling rules specified in websites is studied in this thesis. As many web site administrators and policy makers have come to rely on the informal contract set forth by the Robots Exclusion Protocol, the degree to which web crawlers respect robots.txt policies has become an important issue of computer ethics. We analyze the behaviors of web crawlers in a crawler honeypot, a set of websites\nwhere each site is configured with a distinct regulation specification using the Robots Exclusion Protocol in order to capture specific behaviors of web crawlers. A set of ethicality\nmodels is proposed to measure the ethicality of web crawlers computationally based on their conformance to the regulation rules. The results show that ethicality scores vary significantly among crawlers. Most commercial web crawlers receive good ethicality scores; however, many commercial crawlers still consistently violate\ncertain robots.txt rules.\n\nThe bias and ethicality measurement results calculated based on our proposed metrics are important resources for webmasters and policy\nmakers to design websites and policies. We design and develop BotSeer, a web-based robots.txt and crawler search engine that makes these resources available for users. BotSeer currently indexes and\nanalyzes 4.6 million robots.txt files obtained from 17 million websites as well as three large web server logs and provides search services and statistics of web crawlers for researching web crawlers and trends in Robot Exclusion Protocol deployment and adherence. BotSeer serves as a resource for studying the regulation and behavior of web crawlers as well as a tool to inform the creation of effective robots.txt files and crawler implementations.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6784], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Yang ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Lee Giles", "James Z Wang", "Prasenjit Mitra", "Runze Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Lee Giles, Committee Chair", "James Z Wang, Committee Member", "Prasenjit Mitra, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["botseer", "ethics", "bias", "web crawler", "robots.txt"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "PRHENSION SYNERGIES DURING SMOOTH CHANGES OF THE EXTERNAL LOAD OR TORQUE:\nTIME AND HISTORY EFFECT ON MULTI-DIGIT COORDINATION\n\n", "id": "12095", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6790", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, we explored how digit forces and indices of digit coordination depend on the history of getting to a particular set of task parameters during static prehension tasks. In our first study, the participants held in the right hand an instrumented handle with a light-weight container attached on top of the handle. At the beginning of each trial, the container could be empty, filled to the half with water (0.4 l) or filled to the top (0.8 l). The water was pumped in/out of the container at a constant, slow rate over 10 s. At the end of each trial, the participants always held a half-filled container that has just been filled (Empty-Half), emptied (Full-Half), or stayed half-filled throughout the trial (Half-Only). Indices of co-variation (synergy indices) of elemental variables (forces and moments of force produced by individual digits) stabilizing such performance variables as total normal force, total tangential force, and total moment of force were computed at two levels of an assumed control hierarchy. At the upper level, the task is shared between the thumb and virtual finger (an imagined digit with the mechanical action equal to that of the four fingers), while at the lower level, action of the virtual finger is shared among the actual four fingers. Filling or emptying the container led to a drop in the safety margin (extra gripping force over the slippage threshold) below the values observed in the Half-Only condition. Synergy indices at both levels of the hierarchy showed changes during the Full-Half and Empty-Half trials. These changes could be monotonic (typical of moment of force and normal force) or non-monotonic (typical of tangential force). For both normal and tangential forces, higher synergy indices at the higher level of the hierarchy corresponded to lower indices at the lower level. Significant differences across conditions were seen at the final steady-state showing that digit coordination during steady holding an object is history dependent. The observations support an earlier hypothesis on a trade-off between synergies at the two levels of a hierarchy. They also suggest that, when a change in task parameters is expected, the neural strategy may involve producing less stable (easier to change) actions. The results suggest that synergy indices may be highly sensitive to changes in a task variable and that effects of such changes persist after the changes are over.\nIn the second study, we studied characteristics of digit action and their co-variation patterns across trials during static holding of an object while the external torque could change slowly and smoothly. The subjects held in the air an instrumented handle with an attachment that allowed a smooth change in the external torque over about 12 s; the load was always kept constant. Series of trials were performed with no changes in the external torque, and with slow motion of the load that required a smooth change of the effort from a non-zero pronation value to zero (PR-0) and from a non-zero supination value to zero (SU-0). The handle was kept vertical at all times. Similar to the previous study, indices of variance and co-variation of elemental variables (forces and moments of force produced by individual digits) stabilizing such performance variables as total normal force, total tangential force, and total moment of force were computed at the two levels of the assumed control hierarchy. Adjustments in the total moment of force were produced primarily with changes in the moment produced by the virtual finger, particularly by changes in its normal force. The normal force of the thumb at the final state (which was the same across conditions) was larger in the two conditions with changes in the external torque. The safety margin was significantly higher in the PR-0 condition, and it dropped with the decrease in the external torque. A co-contraction index was computed to reflect moment of force production by the fingers acting against the total moment produced by the virtual finger. It was higher for the SU-0 condition. Most variance indices dropped with a decrease in the external torque. The co-variation indices, however, remained unchanged over the trial duration. They showed signs of a trade-off between the two levels of the assumed hierarchy: Larger indices at the higher level corresponded to smaller indices at the lower level. This study and the previous one document several previously unknown features of prehensile tasks. The results show that characteristics of digit action and interaction in such tasks depend not only on the magnitudes of external constraints but on a variety of other factors including time changes in the constraints and their history.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6788], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Yao ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yao", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Latash", "Mark Latash"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Latash, Thesis Advisor", "Mark Latash, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Synergy", "Safety margin", "Prehension", "History effects"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "DNA sequence analysis: new applications with high throughput sequencing and new methods in studying gene families and human haplogroups", "id": "13771", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6788", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-01-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the sequential information coded in DNA, RNA and proteins is important for both basic and applied researches in life sciences. Extensive efforts have been devoted to the research and development of DNA sequence analysis methods. The studies described in this dissertation explored new applications of existing methods in the context of the recent development of ultra-high throughput sequencing technologies. This dissertation also included new methods developed for studying gene families and human haplogroups. The theories, algorithms and tools for analyzing DNA sequence information concerning these studies are reviewed in Chapter 1 of this dissertation.\n\nWith the recent development in DNA sequencing technologies, came many new research opportunities. Great challenges also came along, mainly because of the large data size of the latest high throughput sequencing technologies. The potential of these new technologies was exploited to complete a 100,000 years old ancient polar bear mitochondrial genome. With this and some additional modern bear data, the matrilineal polar bear\u2019s divergence time was estimated to be around 130,000 years ago, which is significantly older than some recent estimates. This estimate indicated that modern polar bear matrilineal ancestors adapted to the niche polar environment within 30,000 years after the speciation event and propagated along the entire Arctic Circle for the next 100,000 years. This recent speciation and rapid expansion process is analogous to the evolution and migration of modern humans. The lineage characteristics of the latter were also briefly studied using the same technologies. (Chapter 2)\n\nBecause of the increased efficiency from the latest sequencing technologies, more and more complete human mitochondrial genomes have been generated at an increasingly faster speed. Although mitochondrial haplogroups, and their classification and identification were widely used in human evolution and population studies, the current tools could not fully take advantage of the rapidly growing number of new mitochondrial genomes. An updated mitochondrial haplogroup classification system was thus developed with evolutionary models that incorporate the mitochondrial genomic variations within the human population. These variations have not been considered by previous methods, which could lead to incorrectly classified haplogroups. The variation parameters, including the whole-genome substitution rate (0.013 - 0.1 substitutions per generation), the rate heterogeneity among sites (Gamma distribution shape parameter \u03b1 = 0.7078) and the percentage of invariant sites (64%), were estimated based on 7985 full-length human mitochondrial genome sequences. Haplogroups were then classified based on the corrected genetic distance estimation and modeled with position specific matrices. A new haplogroup identification system was developed based on the resulting matrices and the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) method, permitting fast and accurate haplogroup assignment for both known and new mitochondrial genomes. The entire system is available through the HapSearch web application (http://hapsearch.synblex.com). (Chapter 3)\n\nThe latest sequencing technologies also allowed a more thorough study of stage-specific transcriptional activities. To elucidate the transcriptomic profiles and new transcriptomic activities in neural development, nine recent RNA-seq datasets corresponding to tissues/organs ranging from stem cell, embryonic brain cortex to adult whole brain were analyzed. The global similarities between the neural and stem cell transcriptomes were found on both genic and chromosomal levels. A previously undocumented high level of unannotated expression was found in mouse embryonic brain cortices, the intronic part of which was found to be strongly associated with gene ontology (GO) categories that are important for synaptogenesis and neural circuit formation. This suggested potentially novel genes, gene functions and regulatory mechanisms in early brain development. (Chapter 4)\n\nAlthough the speed of generating genomic sequences was increasing rapidly, the development of genome annotation was lagging behind. This slowed down or prevented a broader utilization of the newly sequenced genomes. To partially mitigate this situation, a new tool, called Phoenix, was developed for retrieving homologues of a given gene or gene family from unannotated genomes. Phoenix exhibited fast and accurate performance in simulation using known gene families\u2019 data. Its advantage was further demonstrated by correctly retrieving homologues of a gene family that has a known complex evolutionary history. This tool allows gene family studies in unannotated genomes or even partially assembled genomes. (Chapter 5)\n\nFinally, this dissertation concluded with a discussion of the intrinsic limitations and advantages of the DNA sequence analysis, along with its current and future application potentials.

In the dry experiment free of moist convection, error growth is controlled primarily by baroclinic instability, hence forecast accuracy is inversely proportional to the amplitude of the baroclinically unstable initial condition error.  Therefore, the accuracy of the prediction can be continuously improved without limit through reducing the initial error. On the contrary, in a moist environment with strong convective instability, rapid upscale growth arises from moist convection. As a result, the forecast error becomes increasingly less sensitive to the scale and amplitude of the initial perturbations. These diminishing returns from more accurate initial conditions may ultimately impose a finite-time barrier to the forecast accuracy. Moreover, the inclusion of strong moist convection changes the mesoscale (wavelength smaller than 500 km) kinetic energy spectrum slope from \u22123 to approximately \u22125/3 in our simulations, which is consistent with observations. Since the error spectrum will adjust toward the slope of the background flow, this change in slope of the background flow in our simulations due to moist convection further highlights the importance of moist convection to both the intrinsic and practical limits of atmospheric predictability, especially at meso- and convective scales.\n\nBuilding upon the finding of the kinetic energy slope, in part two of this dissertation, it is further demonstrated that convective systems, triggered in a horizontally homogeneous environment, are able to generate a background mesoscale kinetic energy spectrum with a slope close to -5/3. To investigate the processes that are responsible for generating the -5/3 slope, spectral kinetic energy budget analysis is performed. The analyses show that the buoyancy production generated by moist convection, while mainly injecting energy in the upper troposphere at small scales, could also contribute to larger scales. The injected energy is then transported by energy fluxes (due to gravity waves and/or convection) both upward and downward. Nonlinear interactions, associated with the velocity advection term, finally helps build the approximate \u201c-5/3\u201d slope through upscale/downscale propagation of the energy at all levels.\n\nThe last part of the dissertation focuses on the influence of the upscale error growth to the operational forecast and the predictability gap between our operational forecast and the intrinsic prediction limit using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) state-of-the-art ensemble. We find that from a global perspective, on average, the practical predictability limit of the mid-latitude weather by the current state-of- the-art global models from leading numerical weather prediction centers is about 10 days while the\u00a0ultimate intrinsic limit is estimated to be less than 2 weeks. In other words, even with a perfect model, reducing the initial condition uncertainties to an order of magnitude smaller than the realistic current level of uncertainty will at most extend the deterministic forecast lead times by 3-4 days for mid-latitude\u00a0day-to-day synoptic weather; much smaller room in improving the forecast lead times will be for smaller scale phenomena.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15539], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Yongqiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "first_name_ssi": "Yongqiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fuqing Zhang", "Fuqing Zhang", "David Jonathan Stensrud", "Sukyoung Lee", "Xiaofeng Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fuqing Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Fuqing Zhang, Committee Chair", "David Jonathan Stensrud, Committee Member", "Sukyoung Lee, Committee Member", "Xiaofeng Liu, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Scale Interaction", "Atmospheric Predictability", "Moist Convection", "Gravity Waves", "Butterfly effect"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Effects of Expectation Setting and Agency on Human-Robot Interaction\n\n\n", "id": "12360", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6815", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Autonomous robots have become increasingly popular in recent times, either as toys for entertainment, or as products for performing chores. Given that actual robots do not have the same level of autonomy, setting user expectations about what the robot can and cannot do is quite critical for ensuring a satisfactory interaction experience. \n\nAside from labeling and marketing the robot in specific ways, allowing users to assemble their own robots may serve to build accurate expectations and positively affect their perceptions of interaction. The self-building process may trigger a sense of agency when robot users become the creator or builder of a robot, which may be a significant factor in users\u2019 perception of the robot\u2019s value.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, this thesis examines the effects of expectation setting and sense of agency in human-robot interaction. In a 2 (Expectation Setting: Task- oriented robot vs. Interaction-oriented robot) X 2 (Assembler: Self vs. Others) between- subject experiment (N = 80), a social robot (KT-Gladiator 19) was introduced to the participants as either task-oriented or interaction-oriented in its purpose of use. Participants then set up the robot by themselves in one condition (whereas they let the experiment program it in the other condition). They then interacted with the robot as it performed two pre-programmed motions (dance and greetings). Results showed that participants tended to have better evaluations of both the robot and the interaction process when they set it up themselves. They also tended to evaluate the robot and the interaction more positively when they expected it to be task-oriented rather than interaction-oriented. To further understand the mechanisms underlying these results, perceived humanness, perceived process costs, sense of ownership and sense of accomplishment were tested as mediating variables. Implications for theory and design of robots and limitations of the study are discussed.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6812], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Yuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuan", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Media Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["S.

Although a number of genes have been identified to be important for early anther development and meiosis, information on the relationships among these genes is very limited and many more genes important for anther development and/or meiosis are waiting to be discovered. I used several different approaches to study anther development, as described in this thesis. To identify anther preferential genes and to gain insights into the regulatory networks of several known important genes, I worked with two collaborators to perform microarray experiments using mRNA materials extracted from anthers (stages 4-6) of the wild type, the solo dancers (sds) and male meiocyte death1 (mmd1) mutants, as well as mRNA from wild-type young inflorescences (floral stages 1-9).  The global gene expression profiles of those tissues were compared. Further studies included gene functional categorization and gene cluster analysis. The information gained from these analyses will contribute to the development of anther gene regulatory networks and guide future experiments to understand anther development. I also performed an evolutionary study of a family of Kelch repeat-containing F-box proteins (KFBs). F-box proteins are major components of SCF complexes and can bind to SKP1 and the protein substrates at the N-terminal F-box motif and the C-terminal protein-protein interaction domain(s), respectively. The KFB family is one of the largest subfamily of F-box proteins and has only been reported for human and Arabidopsis previously. To study the possible evolutionary history of KFBs, I performed extensive BLAST searches to identify putative KFBs in selected organisms, and analyzed their relationships phylogenetically. Gene duplication and gene expression of the KFBs were also investigated in rice and Arabidopsis. This study indicated that the origin of KFBs occurred before the divergence of animals and plants, and that plant KFBs underwent rapid gene duplications. My analyses also suggested that the mechanisms for controlling flower timing and the circadian oscillator might be conserved in flowering plants. In addition, collaborating with a colleague in our laboratory, I performed a functional study of the DYSFUNCTIONAL TAPETETUM1 (DYT1) gene. DYT1 encodes a putative transcription factor and was isolated by map-based cloning using an Arabidopsis male sterile mutant. Phenotypic analysis revealed that DYT1 is required for normal tapetum development and function. The mutant tapetal cells formed excess and/or enlarged vacuoles and lacked the densely stained cytoplasm typical of normal tapetal cells. Although most meiotic processes seemed normal, cytokinesis of meiocytes often failed to occur and meiocytes eventually collapsed within anther locules. Double mutant analysis and gene expression studies also suggested that DYT1 acts downstream of two genes, SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE (SPL/NZZ) and EXCESS MICROSPOROCYTES1/EXTRA SPOROGENOUS CELL (EMS1/EXS), which are required for early anther development. The studies also indicated that DYT1 is required for the normal expression of several tapetum genes. These results demonstrated that DYT1 is a crucial component in a genetic network that controls early anther development and function.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6863], "author_name_tesi": "Sun, Yujin ", "last_name_ssi": "Sun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yujin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Ma", "Teh Hui Kao", "Paula Mc Steen", "Naomi S Altman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Ma, Committee Chair", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Paula Mc Steen, Committee Member", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["SCF complex", "Kelch repeat-containing F-box protein", "Anther development", "Arabidopsis thaliana", "Dysfunctional Tapetum1", "Solo Dancers"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS AND APPLICATIONS IN TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONTROL AND MACHINE LEARNING", "id": "ng451h485", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12243", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation introduces and discusses three specific optimization problems and their applications in traffic signal control and machine learning.

However, such benefits come with the inherent security risk of resource sharing: a cloud user needs to share the same set of resources offered by cloud vendors with other cloud users, who potentially can be adversaries to the user.  An adversary controlling shared resources through vulnerabilities in hyperviosrs, malicious insiders, or side channels, can compromise benign users' data that co-locates with the adversary.  Among various attack vectors, one particular vector that was often overlooked previously is the cloud platform itself, namely various cloud services that implement the cloud.  \n\nIn this dissertation, we identify a class of previously overlooked attacks that can be launched via compromised cloud services and explore the design of a framework to mitigate these attacks.  Cloud services are modular programs that work together to provision, schedule and manage users' data (e.g., VM) in cloud.  They are sophisticated software that may contain vulnerabilities.  By exploiting these vulnerabilities, adversaries can launch attacks against benign cloud users.  In addition, cloud service collaborate with each other when performing a cloud user's operation.  Adversary may leverage such cloud service interaction to propagate attacks across cloud services.  Such attacks originating from vulnerable cloud services are challenging to prevent for few reasons.  First, cloud services act on behalf of concurrent cloud users.  Thus, a vulnerability in a cloud service may impact all the cloud users.  Second, cloud services are often privileged on their hosting nodes.  Thus, an adversary controlling a cloud service may further escalate her privilege and control the entire cloud node.  Third, cloud services trust each other.  Thus after compromising one cloud service or node, an adversary can easily propagate attacks to other cloud services or nodes across network, causing a cloud-wide compromise of users' data.  \n\nThis dissertation takes three steps to protect users' data in IaaS clouds against vulnerable cloud services.  First, we perform an in-depth security analysis on the nature of cloud service vulnerabilities and how an adversary may leverage them to compromise the data security of benign cloud users.  We hypothesize that attacks originating from vulnerable cloud services can be mitigated by a mandatory security mechanism that confines cloud services' data access according to the cloud operation they are performing.   Second, we present the CloudArmor, a security mechanism that limits cloud services' data access to a state machine model that is constructed based runtime analysis of cloud services.  We found that without requiring any code modifications of cloud services, we can greatly restrict the freedom offered to an adversary when launching attacks via compromised cloud services with high precision.  Third, we present Pileus, a new design of cloud platform for running cloud services in a way that adversaries cannot obtain unauthorized access to benign cloud users' data through exploiting vulnerabilities in those cloud services.  In Pileus, cloud services run as ephemeral event handlers that are confined to individual users' permissions.  Through enforcing a decentralized information flow control (DIFC), Pileus reduces the amount of cloud service code as well as the number of cloud nodes that a user needs to trust in order to defend against attacks launched by adversaries during a cloud operation.  Our proof-of-concept implementation and evaluation demonstrated that such design can systematically block information flow vulnerabilities reported in OpenStack, including five that were newly reported after Pileus was deployed, while relying on a TCB of cloud nodes that is orders of magnitude smaller than original OpenStack.  The work in this dissertation thus provides a principled starting point to protect cloud users' data against vulnerable cloud services during cloud operations, thus reducing vectors adversaries have to launch attacks in IaaS clouds.

The existing body of literature indicates that E-learning is a means of implementing education that can be applied within varying education models (for example, face-to-face or distance education) and educational philosophies (for example, behaviorism and constructivism). However, the quantitative criteria for improving the online learning system remain a mystery. In this study, an experiment was proposed in which the underlying relationship between personality, perceived workload, EEG-detected emotions and learning performance in online learning is addressed. In the experiment, participants were exposed to two kinds of stimuli in the learning of a semaphore flag-signaling system, during which their emotions, NASA-TLX scores and quiz scores were recorded and analyzed. \nBased on the analysis performed on the study data, the correlation between personality and perceived workload is observed.

The Sen group had previously reported powered motion of striped Pt-Au motors (2 \u00b5m in length and 360 nm in diameter) in aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) \u2018fuel\u2019 solutions. The motors move at speeds of 5 \u2013 10 \u00b5m/s. Transduction of the chemical energy derived from the catalytic conversion of H2O2 to products (H2O and O2), on the bimetallic motor surface results in the observed motility. The motility of these synthetic micromotors is comparable to that of micro-sized flagellar bacteria that convert chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis to power themselves at speeds of few body lengths per second. \n\tInitially, the catalytic decomposition of the peroxide substrate was thought to occur at Pt end alone and the motility was ascribed to interfacial effects. According to this hypothesis, the hydrophobicity of the Au end powered the motor Pt end forward due to the lower interfacial tension at the O2 rich environment. However, further investigation revealed the possibility of bipolar H2O2 decomposition, with both Pt and Au participating in fuel consumption. When bulk Au and Pt wires were placed in aqueous H2O2 solutions a current was observed indicating an electrochemical pathway for fuel decomposition. In the electrochemical pathway for peroxide decomposition, H2O2 is oxidized to O2 at the Pt anode, and reduced to H2O at the Au cathode. Based on the bipolar fuel decomposition, a self-electrophoretic mechanism for rod motility was proposed. According to this hypothesis, the electron current from Pt anode to Au cathode in the rod is accompanied by concomitant proton flux in the surrounding fluid. As the protons migrate from one end to another an electroosmotic fluid flow occurs from Pt to Au, resulting in motor propulsion Pt end forward. Several approaches have been adopted to verify this hypothesis. The approach described in this thesis was to alter the surface charge of the motor. By analogy to electrophoresis where oppositely charged colloidal particles move in opposing directions in presence of an external field, self-electrophoretic micro-motors of opposite charges should also move in opposite directions. Negatively charged Pt-Au rods move Pt end forward. On altering the surface charge of the motors and rendering them positively charged, the rods were found to move Au end forward.  The experiments relating to mechanism of motor motility are discussed in chapter 2. \n\tSynthetic Pt-Au motors could be used as agents for transport and delivery of materials in the microscale regime. In chapter 3, the application of Pt-Au motors for transport of colloidal cargo is demonstrated. A couple of methods for attachment of prototypical microsphere cargo to Pt-Au motors were explored. In the first method, electrostatic attractive forces were used to attach positively charged, amidine functionalized, microsphere cargo to negatively charged Pt-Au-Polypyrrole (PPy) rods. The PPy end of the rod bears a higher negative charge than the metallic segment and the cargo preferably attached to that end. For the second mode of cargo attachment, the more specific biotin-streptavidin based interaction was used. A monolayer of a biotin terminated dithiol was formed on the gold end. Streptavidin-coated microsphere cargo was then bound to the biotin functionalized end of the rod. Motor-cargo doublets were found to exhibit motility.  Subsequently, a quantitative study of the effect of cargo diameter on motor speed was performed. As the cargo diameter was increased, the motor-cargo doublet speed decreased due to increasing drag contribution from larger cargo. The drag force on the doublets was computed and the speeds predicted by theory were found to be in close agreement with empirically observed speeds. \n\tFor maneuvering matter in the mesoscale, in addition to cargo transport the ability to deliver the payloads at desired locations is essential. In chapter 4 strategies for UV-light induced drop-off of cargo attached to motors are described. Applications of Pt-Au motors for delivery of materials or assembly of structures in the meso scale require transport and delivery of cargo. Two strategies for cargo drop-off were explored. In both methods, the link holding the motor and cargo snapped upon exposure to UV light. In the first approach the motor design incorporated Ag segments. Pt-Au-Ag-Au-PPy motors were attached to amidine functionalized cargo. This mode of cargo drop-off was based on the rapid dissolution of the Ag segment in the presence of UV light and chloride ions. In the second mode of cargo drop-off, a bifunctional linker with a photocleavable moiety was synthesized. The photocleavable moiety of the molecule was flanked by an amino group on one end and biotin on the other end. Pt-Au-PPy-PPyCOOH motors were synthesized. Carboxyl groups incorporated in the polymeric segment of the rods facilitated covalent attachment to the amine terminus of the bifunctional linker molecule via amide bond formation. The biotin end of the linker molecule was used to attach streptavidin-coated cargo to the motors. Upon exposure to UV light, the photocleavage of the linker molecule occurred, releasing the cargo from the motor.\n\tIn chapter 5, the feasibility of powering microscale objects using enzymatic reactions is explored. In earlier chapters, the catalytic micromotor system was based on the bimetallic Pt-Au catalytic system. Motor performance can be improved by using better catalysts. Naturally occurring biocatalysts \u2013 enzymes, are among the most efficient catalysts known. In addition to the efficacy in their action, enzymes catalyze a wide range of reactions. The plethora of enzymatic reactions can be explored for design of future chemical locomotors. The enzyme catalase, which catalyzes the decomposition of H2O2 to H2O and O2 was asymmetrically functionalized on 0.5 \u00b5m polystyrene microspheres. The diffusion coefficients of the particles were tracked in the presence and absence of H2O2 fuel solutions. In this system, no directed motility or enhancement in diffusion coefficient of the catalase functionalized particles was observed in the presence of substrate. The most likely cause for this may be the poor activity of the enzyme, post-immobilization. Further investigation of this system is required to determine whether asymmetric gradients of neutral species can power microscale objects.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5871], "author_name_tesi": "Sundararajan, Shakuntala ", "last_name_ssi": "Sundararajan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shakuntala", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen", "Ayusman Sen", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Jeffrey M Catchmark"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen, Dissertation Advisor", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Mary Elizabeth Williams, Committee Member", "Jeffrey M Catchmark, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["autonomous micro/nanomotors", "applications for micro/nanomotors", "catalytic micro/nanomotors"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "CATALYTIC OXIDATIVE DESULFURIZATION OF LIQUID HYDROCARBON FUELS USING AIR\n\n\n", "id": "12291", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5457", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conventional approaches to oxidative desulfurization of liquid hydrocarbons involve use of high-purity, expensive water soluble peroxide for oxidation of sulfur compounds followed by post-treatment for removal of oxidized sulfones by extraction. Both are associated with higher cost due to handling, storage of oxidants and yield loss with extraction and water separation, making the whole process more expensive.\n\nThis thesis explores an oxidative desulfurization process using air as an oxidant followed by catalytic decomposition of sulfones thereby eliminating the aforementioned issues. Oxidation of sulfur compounds was realized by a two step process in which peroxides were first generated in-situ by catalytic air oxidation, followed by catalytic oxidation of S compounds using the peroxides generated in-situ completing the two step approach. By this technique it was feasible to oxidize over 90% of sulfur compounds present in real jet (520 ppmw S) and diesel (41 ppmw S) fuels. Screening of bulk and supported CuO based catalysts for peroxide generation using model aromatic compound representing diesel fuel showed that bulk CuO catalyst was more effective in producing peroxides with high yield and selectivity. Testing of three real diesel fuels obtained from different sources for air oxidation over bulk CuO catalyst showed different level of effectiveness for generating peroxides in-situ which was consistent with air oxidation of representative model aromatic compounds. Peroxides generated in-situ was then used as an oxidant to oxidize sulfur compounds present in the fuel over MoO3/SiO2 catalyst. 81% selectivity of peroxides for oxidation of sulfur compounds was observed on MoO3/SiO2 catalyst at 40 oC and under similar conditions MoO3/Al2O3 gave only 41% selectivity. This difference in selectivity might be related to the difference in the nature of active sites of MoO3 on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports as suggested by H2-TPR and XRD analyses. \n\nTesting of supported and bulk MgO catalysts for decomposition of sulfones showed that these catalysts are effective in decomposing oxidized sulfur compounds such as dibenzothiophene sulfone and 3-methyl benzothiophene sulfone to biphenyl and isopropyl benzene respectively and SO2. Study of catalyst structure-activity relationship revealed that in the range of 40-140 nm of MgO, crystallite size plays a critical role on activity of the catalyst for sulfone decomposition. In testing other alkali oxides, it was demonstrated that CaO was effective as a reagent in decomposing oxidized sulfur compounds in a crude oil at a much lower temperature than used for MgO based catalyst. Preliminary data on potential regeneration scheme of spent CaO is also discussed. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5449], "author_name_tesi": "Sundararaman, Ramanathan ", "last_name_ssi": "Sundararaman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ramanathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Chunshan Song", "Harold Harris Schobert", "Prof Yongsheng Chen", "Sridhar Komarneni"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Dissertation Advisor", "Chunshan Song, Committee Chair", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Member", "Prof Yongsheng Chen, Committee Member", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sulfone decomposition", "Air ODS", "Oxidative desulfurization", "Crude oil upgrade"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "MODELING CARBON FOOTPRINT ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN OF FOOD INDUSTRY \n\u2013 INNOVATION ON REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS\n\n", "id": "12606", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6024", "abstract_tesi": "This work aims to discuss the impact of carbon emissions due to the various steps of the supply chain of an industry.

It is amorphous in that the exact layout of the servers, the load balancers and their functions are neither known nor fixed. Its an agglomerate in that multiple service providers and vendors often coordinate  to form a multitenant system using virtualization. This complex environment offers great potential to providers and adopters, but \nalso introduces great challenges  in managing, combining and providing a variety of highly heterogeneous services. \nIn particular,  users  interaction  with these providers is often cumbersome, as the details of  a  cloud system are often abstracted away and unclear to most adopters.\nFurther,  cloud computing does not offer  strong  security guarantees, or traceability of data, and its indeterminate nature makes accountability of providers and users operations  difficult[1]. This nebulous nature and the lack of security assurances of Cloud services together form the foremost barriers to its adoption.\n\nThe ambiguous nature of Cloud services  also makes choosing the best service challenging. First of all,  users may not be aware of all the service providers available to them.  Secondly, the users may not be aware of the comprehensive list of options offered by the various service providers even if they know a particular provider. In the scenario where the users know which service option they are looking for, they may  not be aware of all the providers supporting the option leading to uninformed choices. Thirdly, users may not be aware of the relationships among service providers, in case the users' requests would be satisfied by a set of providers, and not a single entity. These relationships between the service providers can cause resources, such as storage space, to be overextended. As a result, the process of collecting and analyzing the information required to make a good decision involves a lot of time-consuming computations for consumers.  The time-consuming computations involve identifying all the service providers and the relationships between them before making a final choice. As these arduous computations are repeated by multiple consumers who have similar requirements, it is also computationally wasteful. Protecting the data once the service provider is chosen is also major challenge not only because of the changeable relationships between the service providers, but also due to the potentially untrustworthy components of a single service provider. A major feature of the Cloud services is that users' data is usually processed remotely in unknown machines that the users do not own or operate. While enjoying the convenience of remote storage and processing brought by the Cloud services, users' fears of losing control of their own data, particularly financial and health data or any Personally Identifying Information (PII), can become a significant barrier to the wide-spread adoption of Cloud services [2].\n\nIn this dissertation, we aim to address some of the most significant barriers to the adoption of Cloud services. We propose a novel brokerage-based architecture  called   GABE  - a Cloud brokeraGe system for service selection, AccountaBility and, policy Enforcement. GABE fulfills two major needs of  cloud  users: helping  them understand the Cloud services best suited for them; and providing  security assurances on their data. As the core part of the brokerage system, we design a unique indexing technique for managing the information of a large number of Cloud service Providers. Multiple alternatives to the indexing are studied to address specific needs in service selection. We then develop efficient service selection algorithms that rank potential service providers and aggregate them if necessary.\n\nGABE also helps users protect their data by providing a policy driven node selection methodology for map reduce architectures. GABE seamlessly integrates node selection control to the MapReduce framework for increased data security. It leverages data preprocessing techniques and distributed node verification protocols to achieve strong policy enforcement.We further augment GABE by equipping it with accountability features. In order to support accountability, we propose a novel highly decentralized information accountability framework to keep track of the actual usage of the users' data in the Cloud. In particular, we propose an object-centered approach that enables enclosing our logging mechanism together with users' data and policies. We leverage object oriented programming techniques to create a dynamic and traveling object, and to ensure that any access to users' data will trigger authentication and automated logging local to the JARs. We take a policy-driven approach that strongly couples data and content protection policies (CPPs). This approach constitutes an effective and practical solution for content protection for a number of reasons. First of all, both the CPPs and the protection mechanism travel with the content, which is stored in its original form. Secondly, users do not need to rely on any dedicated management system to specify and apply the CPPs. Thirdly, to strengthen users' control, we also provide distributed auditing mechanisms.We provide extensive experimental studies on real cloud computing testbeds that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed policy driven node selection, auditing, and service selection approaches with real and synthetic Cloud data.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9215], "author_name_tesi": "Sundareswaran, Smitha ", "last_name_ssi": "Sundareswaran", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Smitha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anna Cinzia Squicciarini", "Dongwon Lee", "Dinghao Wu", "John Metzner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anna Cinzia Squicciarini, Dissertation Advisor", "Dongwon Lee, Committee Member", "Dinghao Wu, Committee Member", "John Metzner, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["brokerage", "service selection", "accountability", "cloud computing", "node selection", "security"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A portrait of Santa Claus: An epistemological inquiry of belief and disbelief\n\n", "id": "12240", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3407", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This is a narrative study that explores the subjectivities of knowing within discursive spaces of the social.

Our laboratory is specifically interested the molecular mechanisms underlying elevated retinal microvascular permeability associated with diabetic retinopathy.  This breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier is known to be at least partially caused by an elevation in growth factors and cytokines.  At the molecular level, these alterations are associated with a loss of junctional integrity that is, at least in part, related to an observed increase in occludin phosphorylation, a redistribution of occludin away from cell borders, and a decrease in occludin content.  Critical to the experimental system used in this thesis, this pathology has been effectively modeled in vitro as VEGF stimulation of primary retinal endothelial cells results in increased occludin phosphorylation associated with increased permeability.  \n\nThe role of occludin in regulating the barrier properties of tight junctions has been extensively studied.  In addition to changes in permeability associated with changes in occludin content, several groups reported an association between the state of occludin phosphorylation and the integrity of the paracellular barrier.  Studies utilizing 2D-gel analysis suggest that occludin is phosphorylated on multiple residues in the basal state and three additional residues are phosphorylated in response to growth factors.  Therefore, it is not surprising that studies relying on end points that assess global changes in occludin phosphorylation have often yielded conflicting results.  Given that occludin is phosphorylated on multiple sites, a consensus regarding the state of occludin phosphorylation and tight junction dynamics will depend upon the identification of specific, in vivo phosphorylation sites.   \n\nThe goal of this thesis was to determine the mechanism by which phosphorylation of occludin leads to alterations in tight junction function.  The hypothesis of this dissertation is that VEGF-induced phosphorylation of occludin results in attenuated binding to scaffolding proteins at tight junctions and/or the redistribution of occludin away from tight junctions and into early endosomes.\n\nThe first aim of these studies was to map physiologically relevant occludin phosphorylation sites.  To this end, we partially purified occludin from primary endothelial cells treated with VEGF and identified five putative phosphorylation sites using mass spectrometry and bioinformatics-based inclusion criteria.  Phosphorylation of occludin on Ser490, a residue located within the C-terminal coiled-coil domain, was subsequently shown to occur in vivo with the development of a phosphospecific antibody.  Growth factors known to increase permeability stimulated Ser490 phosphorylation in both epithelial and endothelial monolayers.  Immunocytochemistry studies revealed that pSer490-occludin is localized in cytoplasmic puncta that, in response to growth factors, coalesced into vesicles that appear to be early endosomes.  Protein interaction studies indicate that phosphorylation at Ser490 attenuates the interaction between occludin and ZO-1 while crystal structure analysis of S490D-occludin413-522 demonstrates a disruption in the positively charged ZO-1 binding surface.  \n\nTaken together, these data suggest a critical role for the coiled-coil domain of occludin in the targeting occludin to tight junctions.  Specifically, growth factor stimulation of Ser490 phosphorylation acts as a molecular switch to disassemble occludin from tight junctions.  This is accomplished, at least in part, by an attenuated interaction with ZO-1 and may also involve the movement of occludin into endosomes.\n\nThe second aim of this thesis was to facilitate the identification of in vivo phosphorylation sites.  To this end, we developed MODICAS, software designed to identify PTMs.  Peptide mapping was conducted by MODICAS and merged with bioinformatics-based inclusion criteria.  This approach was tested on AKT1 partially purified in triplicate from a single retina.  While the unambiguous identification of phosphorylation sites with tandem MS was not successful, our combined approach resulted in the identification of 9 phosphorylation sites.  Importantly, 6 of these 9 sites have been previously identified by others as in vivo AKT1 phosphorylation sites.  As such, this combination of empirically derived MS data with bioinformatic-based inclusion criteria was shown to be extremely efficient and accurate in the identification of phosphorylation sites on AKT1.  This approach should prove useful in several contexts, such as clinical samples, in which limited sample material prevents the acquisition of quality tandem MS spectra. \n\nCollectively, these studies strongly suggest that Ser490 phosphorylation of occludin plays a central role in regulating the barrier properties of tight junctions.  In addition, several other sites of occludin phosphorylation have yet to be further characterized and may further illuminate the role played by occludin in the regulation of tight junction function.  Importantly, understanding the mechanisms involved in the inappropriate remodeling of tight junctions may prove to be pivotal in the design of novel therapeutics for treatment of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy.  These studies illustrate the importance of monitoring regulatory PTMs, the identification of which we have greatly facilitated by coupling novel phosphopeptide mapping software with bioinformatics.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2886], "author_name_tesi": "Sundstrom, Jeffrey ", "last_name_ssi": "Sundstrom", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A Antonetti", "John Michael Flanagan Jr.", "Robert A Gabbay", "Bruce A Stanley", "Christopher J Lynch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David A Antonetti, Committee Chair", "John Michael Flanagan Jr., Committee Member", "Robert A Gabbay, Committee Member", "Bruce A Stanley, Committee Member", "Christopher J Lynch, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["AKT1", "tight junction", "phosphorylation", "occludin", "VEGF"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "MODELING ONE-HANDED THUMB TOUCH PERFORMANCE FOR MOBILE DEVICES: Extending Fitts\u2019 Law by Incorporating Grip Span and Hand Anthropometry", "id": "14219kys5239", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14219", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation aimed to develop a thumb performance model that addresses grip span for one-handed interaction on mobile devices.

Fourth, it developed and validated a new predictive model for one-handed thumb touch performance based on the Fitts\u2019 law model by incorporating grip span and hand anthropometry. \nThis dissertation consisted of two experiments. In Experiment I, the effect of grip type was examined through comparison of the cradled index finger and one-handed thumb interaction. In Experiment II, the effect of grip span size on performance was analyzed for one-handed thumb interaction. Using the collected data, a predictive regression model of one-handed thumb touch performance was developed based on Fitts\u2019 law.

First, it raises the issue of grip span and its effect on one-handed thumb touch interaction from a different point of view related to thumb length\u2019s limitation. Second, the raised issue was investigated and proven to exist through the experiments.

This drives researchers to explore efficient approaches for analyzing the data and deriving insights to make better decisions. In this thesis, we develop four different decision support models based on network analytics and machine learning methods to solve four different research problems in online social networks and healthcare systems. \nIn most of the real-world networks such as Facebook networks, each node usually contains multiple attributes representing the node\u2019s characteristics. It is difficult to identify the dominant attributes, which have determining effects on community formation. In this thesis, we disclose the association of node attributes to the community topology by defining dominance ratio and applying correlation metrics. The method is tested on Facebook data of 100 universities for uncovering how the offline lives infer online friendship construction. \nHealthcare systems are known to have huge amounts of data due to recording patient clinical history. In this thesis, we develop three different recommendation and prediction models using network-based methods and machine learning to support healthcare providers in making daily operational decisions. The first model, SuperOrder, is an automated recommendation system for outpatient clinics to predict what medical orders the providers would like to place for the upcoming appointments. The implementation of SuperOrder will increase order effectiveness and ease order documentations. The second model is to predict hospital length of stay (LOS) for patients who are admitted through emergency departments (ED). The LOS model can help ED physicians make better decisions on hospitalization at the time of admission, as well as reduce ED boarding time and solve ED overcrowding problem. The third model is to predict the remaining length of stay (RLOS) for general adult inpatients to determine which patients can be discharged from hospitals today or tomorrow. Unlike the LOS model which helps in admission decisions and demand forecasting, the RLOS model supports in discharge planning and bed availability forecasting. All of these three healthcare prediction models are expected to be implemented in Geisinger Health System and integrated into their daily workflows to support providers\u2019 daily decisions.

It is mainly caused by the turbulent pressure fluctuations passing an edge discontinuity. A promising passive modification for noise reduction is to use porous or partly porous airfoils. Some of the numerical studies of the porous airfoils focus on describing the complete phenomenon. The flow inside the porous region is investigated separately from the outside flow field. However, this is often computationally demanding and time consuming. \n\nFor engineering purposes, a gross description of the effects of the impedance materials on incident acoustic waves is preferred. The method of time-domain impedance boundary condition is attractive to study noise scattering of absorbing surfaces. The acoustic impedance is used to describe the properties of an absorbing material. It is defined in the frequency domain as the ratio of the acoustic pressure to the acoustic velocity normal to the porous or impedance surface. Most classical impedance models were obtained in the frequency domain, and to obtain a time domain impedance boundary condition is not straightforward. \n\nIn this thesis, a three-parameter model based on the mass-spring-damper system is adopted. It is verified to have a stable solution. The key to the implementation of this model is to use a ghost point outside the computational domain. This ensures that the boundary points satisfy both the discretized Euler equations and the absorbing boundary condition. Numerical results for the normal-incidence impedance tube problems show a good agreement with the analytical results. The time domain impedance boundary condition has also been developed into a two-dimensional form. An initial example problem is a Gaussian pressure pulse propagating in a uniform Cartesian grid. After that, the simulation is modified into the curvilinear coordinates to simulate the acoustic scattering around a circular cylinder. The results qualitatively show that the absorbing boundaries do reduce the amplitude of the reflected pulse. \n\nHaving demonstrated simulations for a curved surface, the time domain impedance boundary condition is applied to an impedance-treated airfoil.

Cloud computing has emerged as a new computing paradigm that has fundamentally shaped the business model in terms of how IT services are developed and delivered. A lot of conversations about cloud technologies can be observed in blogs, workshops, magazines, and industry reports, but there seems to be a paucity of either research or formal theorizing with respect to cloud computing implementation in organizations. \nThis dissertation develops a new theoretical framework with which to conceptualize the bidirectional relationships between IT departments and cloud computing implementation. The research seeks to achieve two key objectives. The first is to examine the factors that influence the success of cloud computing implementation in organizations. For this objective, a qualitative study using interview data and grounded theory was conducted. A taxonomy of both the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) and the challenges facing cloud implementation is developed, drawing on theories from organization and management studies. The study on CSFs and challenges indicates that a successful cloud computing implementation not only calls for a good understanding of cloud technologies, but requires a lot effort in, for example, mobilizing internal and external resources; dedicated architectural design; overcoming organization-specific challenges; and addressing political and cultural issues arising inside the IT department. The second objective is to investigate the impacts of implementing cloud computing on the IT function. To achieve this objective, a case study of two community cloud models was conducted. The study has identified a range of areas where the IT function can be impacted as a result of cloud implementation. These areas include the role and functionality; IT leadership; skills and jobs; IT staffing; formal structure; and workplace culture. Propositions with specific observations are provided to show how the IT function can be shaped in each affected area. \nThis dissertation contributes to the literature by extending extant CSF theory into the novel context of cloud computing implementation. It also develops new mid-range theories on IT-enabled organizational change by exclusively focusing on the overlooked effects that an IT innovation can bring about within the IT departments. In addition, this research offers a number of actionable strategies for practitioners regarding how to make cloud implementation successful, and it highlights the importance of anticipating the potential business impacts of cloud computing on IT departments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8646], "author_name_tesi": "Suo, Shuguang ", "last_name_ssi": "Suo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shuguang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sandeep Purao", "Sandeep Purao", "Brian Cameron", "Anna Cinzia Squicciarini", "Barbara Louise Gray", "Angsana Techatassanasoontorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sandeep Purao, Dissertation Advisor", "Sandeep Purao, Committee Chair", "Brian Cameron, Committee Member", "Anna Cinzia Squicciarini, Committee Member", "Barbara Louise Gray, Committee Member", "Angsana Techatassanasoontorn, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cloud Computing Implementation", "Critical Success Factors", "IT Department", "Challenges", "Impacts"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Teaching Chemistry and Other Sciences to Blind and Low-Vision Students through Hands-On Learning Experiences in High School Science Laboratories", "id": "11471", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "932", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Students with blindness and low vision (BLV) have traditionally been underrepresented in the sciences as a result of technological and attitudinal barriers to equal access in science laboratory classrooms.

Participants attended different schools; curricula included chemistry, AP chemistry, and AP physics.\n\tThe ILAB tools were designed to provide multisensory means for students with BLV to make observations and collect data during standard laboratory lessons on an equivalent basis with their sighted peers. Various qualitative and quantitative data collection instruments were used to determine whether the hands-on experiences facilitated by the ILAB tools had led to increased involvement in laboratory-goal-directed actions, greater peer acceptance in the students\u2019 lab groups, improved attitudes toward science, and increased interest in science.\n\tPremier among the ILAB tools was the JAWS/Logger Pro software interface, which made audible all information gathered through standard Vernier laboratory probes and visually displayed through Logger Pro. ILAB tools also included a talking balance, a submersible audible light sensor, a scientific talking stopwatch, and a variety of other high-tech and low-tech devices and techniques.\n\tWhile results were mixed, all four participating BLV students seemed to have experienced at least some benefit, with the effect being stronger for some than for others. Not all of the data collection instruments were found to reveal improvements for all of the participating students, but each of the types of data sets provided evidence of benefit for varying subgroups of participants. It is the expectation of the ILAB team that continuing to implement adaptive/assistive technologies for BLV students in science laboratory classrooms will foster enhanced opportunities in science classes and professions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [924], "author_name_tesi": "Supalo, Cary Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Supalo", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Cary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Karl Todd Mueller", "Mark Maroncelli", "William Carlsen", "George Bodner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Chair", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Member", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Member", "William Carlsen, Committee Member", "George Bodner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chemistry", "blind", "low vision", "hands-on", "laboratory", "science", "multisensory", "teach", "students"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE TEMPERATURE EFFECT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCERS FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE AND HARSH ENVIRONMENT APPLICATIONS", "id": "13134ads303", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13134", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tTransducer technology is an in-demand resource particularly in the fields of ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation (UNDE), structural health monitoring (SHM), and biomedical ultrasound.  For years, transducers have been used to characterize various types of materials, ranging from metals to composites (interwoven conglomeration of various materials) and even organics as well as to establish the integrity of structural components such as bridge struts, subterranean pipelines, and vehicle bodies.  Transducers can even be used to find defects, cracks, delaminations, etc on the micro- and nano-scales.  Most of these processes occur at room temperature or only slightly elevated temperatures (<100 oC).  This means that the physical components have little to fear from the stress and strain of thermal expansion as well as the process of oxidation.  However, when higher temperature (>400 oC) capabilities are necessary, only a select few piezoelectric materials can make the cut.  The piezoelectric material must be combined with the right components from the casing, to the waveguide, to the coupling, to the matching layer, as well as the backing material and work together cohesively with a lead wire to produce the most consistent and cleanest acoustic signals and data possible for their particular application.\n\tThe objective of this thesis is to investigate the influence of the temperature effect on ultrasonic transducers based on a comparison of the effects of high temperature conditions versus those of high temperature and irradiation on the transducer system.  There will also be a preliminary move towards the establishment of the means for optimizing the bulk single crystal transducer fabrication process in order to achieve peak efficiency and maximum effectiveness in both irradiated and non-irradiated high temperature applications.  Optimization of the material components within the transducer will greatly increase non-destructive testing abilities for industry, structural health monitoring, and so much more.\n\tThe following research involves testing several different piezoelectric materials under high temperature conditions.  The viability of aluminum nitride (AlN) as a transducer material in high temperature conditions has been previously explored [1] (Parks, et al, 2010) and shall be further tested to ensure reliability.  Zinc oxide (ZnO) and bismuth titanate (BiT) will also be explored as they have shown promising results in the past.  Data collected from the ULtrasonic TRAnsducers (ULTRA) project will also be compared to the high temperature data since the construction of the transducer was the same.  A preliminary search of various combinations of transducer material components (waveguide and backing materials in order to find the best match for a given piezoelectric material) will be conducted to find the best combination of these components for steady and strong acoustic transmission.

The cohesin complex is comprised of four proteins \u2013 Smc1 and Smc3 that heterodimerize, and Scc1 and Scc3.  Imaging of the Smc heterodimer shows that it forms a V shaped molecule and imaging of the entire cohesin holocomplex suggests that it forms an enclosed ring structure.  The cohesin complex binds to specific loci along the chromosome arms and centromeres known as Cohesin Attachment Regions (CAR).  In lieu of consensus binding sequences at CAR loci, several models have been proposed for cohesin interactions at CAR sites, though no direct structural information about the in vivo interaction of cohesin at CARs has been obtained.\nThis thesis is the first documented effort of the successful isolation and imaging of cohesin-chromatin complexes assembled in vivo.  A minichromosome containing a CAR sequence and a CEN3 sequence was isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the Minichromosome Affinity Purification (MAP) method.  The MAP protocol had to be overhauled to obtain high yield from this low-copy centromeric construct.  Adjustments to MAP resulted in a 100-fold increase over the yield obtained by using the published protocol.  Samples were isolated from G1 synchronized cultures in which cohesin is not bound to CARs and M-phase synchronized cultures in which cohesin is bound to CARs.  These MAP isolated samples were negatively and positively stained for TEM analysis.  Images showed that replicated minichromosomes always interact with one end of a flexible rod.  Length measurements of this protrusion are consistent with a collapsed cohesin ring and width measurements of the rod suggest that multiple cohesins interact at CAR loci.  These images lead to a model that suggests conformational changes within the cohesin complex may be responsible for the topological binding of cohesin to chromatin.  \nPhylogenetic analyses were undertaken of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosome (SMC) family of proteins in an effort to identify conserved sequences within the arms of Smc1 and Smc3 that may explain the interaction observed via TEM along the coiled-coil domains of these molecules.  Extra disruptions to the coiled-coil domains among SMC members were identified.  These disruptions further support an alternative to the evolutionary history of these proteins that is presented in phylogenetic trees based solely on sequence alignments.  In addition, phylogenetic analysis of the meiotic form of Smc1, known as Smc1b, suggests that it arose via a gene duplication event early in animal divergence, even though it has only been maintained in vertebrate lineages.  This study of Smc1b lends support to the evolution of various meiotic regulatory mechanisms among animals.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [435], "author_name_tesi": "Surcel, Alexandra ", "last_name_ssi": "Surcel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alexandra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Ma", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "David Scott Gilmour", "William O Hancock", "Douglas Koshland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Ma, Committee Chair", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Douglas Koshland, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cohesin", "CAR", "Sister Chromatid Cohesion", "SMC", "Structural Maintenance of Chromosome", "Yeast", "Minichromosome Affinity Purification", "MAP", "Phylogeny", "TEM"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Design and Analysis of Ultra-wideband Ad Hoc Covert Wireless Radar-Comm Networks", "id": "12011", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5541", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recently, the wireless networks research community has taken considerable interest in concurrently utilizing the ultra-wideband (UWB) spectrum with narrow-band systems to implement coexisting and cognitive spectrum solutions. In parallel, multi-channel multi-radio wireless systems are being developed to achieve improved network capacity by exploiting non-overlapping channel transmissions. Our motivation is to exploit the synergy between the above two approaches, in developing a multi-functional wireless system with significant support to applications of practical relevance. The goal, therefore, is to provide a flexible framework for situational awareness in infrastructure-less covert surveillance circumstances, such as hostage rescue, first-emergency response, natural disaster recovery, or military surveillance. The primary requirements for such applications include the capability for detection of long range targets, distributed computing, and securely communicating the information across a multi-sensor network. These situations are further characterized by the absence of any central infrastructure, limited spectrum availability, varying topological environments, and growing wireless security concerns.\n\nIt is well known that UWB noise radar achieves covert high-resolution imaging of targets and terrain. The wide bandwidth yields fine range resolution, while the noise waveform provides immunity from detection, interference, and interception. Having multiple noise radars networked with each other can provide significant benefits in target detection and recognition. An ad hoc network harnessing the combined advantages of UWB radar sensing and wireless communications is a viable solution to the above requirement. This dissertation, therefore, proposes a unique scheme to modify the UWB noise radar to supplement it with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based secure multi-user network communication capabilities, thus architecting the multi-functional UWB noise-OFDM netted radar. The salient features of this multi-functional radar system include surveillance with embedded OFDM-based communications, coexistence, multi-user capability, and physical layer security.  Furthermore, with this availability of OFDM's multiple frequencies and a number of radars to share it between, this dissertation solves the problem of multi-user multi-carrier resource allocation by proposing a simple yet fully-distributed and cross-layered channel-diversity-aided algorithm. It constructs a contention-free medium access solution which scales logarithmically with the number of radar nodes, and dynamically adapts to network topology changes and wireless channel variations. Building on this contention-free local connectivity, this dissertation also qualitatively proposes a multi-carrier enhancement to the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. Incorporating this enhancement will not only allow the ad hoc radar network to be resilient to mobility, but also provide routing protocol security, hence bridging one of the drawbacks of AODV.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5532], "author_name_tesi": "Surender, Shrawan Chittoor", "last_name_ssi": "Surender", "middle_name_ssi": "Chittoor", "first_name_ssi": "Shrawan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das", "Chitaranjan Das", "Ram Mohan Narayanan", "George Kesidis", "Randy Young"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das, Dissertation Advisor", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Chair", "Ram Mohan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "George Kesidis, Committee Member", "Randy Young, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ultra-wideband noise radar", "communications embedded radar", "situational awareness", "multi-functional ad hoc radar network", "fully-distributed resource allocation", "secure ad hoc networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Statistical inference of syntax from vocal sequences and implications for neural mechanisms", "id": "ww72bb49x", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12771", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Learned vocalization in animals is a fascinating natural behavior, the neural and peripheral mechanisms behind which are not completely known. In vocal sequences, acoustic units called syllables are produced following certain learned rules or syntax. In order to understand the putative neural correlates of this behavior, we first need a quantitative description of the behavior itself. A vocal sequence, say AAABCCCDD can be parsed into two structures - a non-repeat structure ABCD, on which is imposed a repeat structure A(3)B(1)C(3)D(2). In this dissertation we develop statistical methods to infer concise, finite-state characterizations of both these aspects of the syntax from observed vocal sequences. The need to exercise caution in assigning vocal sequences to syntactic categories based on small sample sizes is emphasized by designing measures that place bounds on model categories that can be inferred from observations. In particular, we focus on the Partially Observable Markov Model (POMM) - a model with a Markov chain of abstract, hidden states that have a many-to-one mapping to observed syllables - to characterize the non-repeat structure.  Through careful quantitative analysis of observed data, we show that the normal song syntax of the Bengalese finch is consistent with the features expected from a POMM. The songs of deafened birds show a deviation from this normal structure. In a statistically significant number of cases among the birds studied, the loss of auditory feedback results in a loss of the many-to-one mappings. The observations suggest that auditory feedback can induce complexity in the Bengalese finch song syntax, but is not sufficient to explain complexity entirely. We suggest that the Bengalese finch song syntax is encoded in the interplay between auditory feedback and the intrinsic song-generating circuitry.

During the manufacturing of carbon anodes, coal tar pitch is mixed with calcined petroleum coke.  The mix of binder, filler and some additives is heated to about 50\u00b0C above the softening point of the pitch, typically 160\u00b0C.  This temperature is sufficient to enable the pitch to wet the coke particles.  The mix is then either extruded, vibrated, or pressed to form a green anode.  The binding between coke and pitch is very important to the anode properties since pitch has to coat the coke particles, penetrate and fill the coke pores during mixing and forming green anodes and to form pitch coke bridges between the coke particles during the baking process.  \nThere are different binder pitches used in this work, which were standard coal tar pitch (SCTP-2), petroleum pitch (PP-1), gasification pitch (GP-115), coal-extract pitch (WVU-5), and co-coking pitches (HTCCP and OXCCP).  Petroleum pitch is a residue produced from heat-treatment and distillation of petroleum fractions.  Production of coal-extract pitch involves a prehydrogenation of coal followed by extraction using a dipolar solvent.  Gasification pitches are distilled by-product tars produced from the coal gasification process.  Co-coking pitch was developed in this work and was obtained from the liquid distillate of co-coking process of coal and heavy petroleum residue.  Understanding of composition and structures of pitches from different sources and processes would lead to greater understanding of the binding properties of pitch in carbon anodes and was one of the main focuses in this study.  Characterization of pitches by using different techniques including gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/mass spectrometry (MALDI/MS), 1H and 13C solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and 13C solid-state NMR yield important chemistry and structural information.\nThe binding, or in other words the interactions in the pitch/coke mixture, is another interest in this study.  Pitch itself is a very complex material.  Studying the binding between pitch and the porous coke even adds another level of complexity to this subject.  The high-temperature 1H NMR has been shown to be a promising technique to study the molecular interaction between different materials.  The fraction of the mobile protons in the sample and their mobility as measured by the spin-spin relaxation time ( ), which is inversely proportional to the peak width at half maximum height ( ), seem to have a potential to probe the extent of the interaction between pitch and coke.  Understanding of the interaction between coke and some simple compounds which are commonly found in pitch, i.e. model compounds, should help identify the binding efficiency between pitch and coke.  The knowledge of 1) pitch chemistry and structure, 2) interaction between model compounds and filler cokes would lead to an understanding of the binding efficiency between pitch and coke.\nThe mass distribution by MALDI analysis showed that the majority of the compounds in these pitches is in the range of 200-700 Da.  The hexane-soluble (HS) fractions of all of the pitch samples in this study mainly consist of four-ring polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) as observed by GC/MS and Pyrolysis-GC/MS techniques.  Coal-derived pitches contained mainly cata- and peri-condensed PACs and a few alkyl- and heteroatomic-substituted PACs, whereas those peteroleum-derived pitches consisted of a number of alkyl-substituted PACs with high sulfur substitution.\nSolid-state NMR results show that SCTP-2 and PP-1 contain six and five fused rings on average, respectively, whereas GP-115 and WVU-5 contain two and three fused rings on average, respectively.  The latter two pitches contained mostly methyl substituents with a few ethyls.  WVU-5 contains a higher degree of naphthenic substituents as compared to other pitches as confirmed by the GC/MS analysis.  HTCCP and OXCCP contained three peri-condensed fused rings on average per molecule.  \n1H in-situ high temperature NMR and the solid echo pulse program were employed to study the change in mobility of model compounds, pitches and their mixtures with petroleum coke.  Due to the limitation in number of model compounds used in this study, no correlation could be drawn between the extent of interaction of the model compound/coke mixtures and the size of the model compounds.  Topology seemed to play an important role in enhancing the mobility of the model compound when mixed with petroleum coke.  Peri-condensed and branched cata-condensed molecules tended to have higher mobility enhancement than the cata-condensed PACs.  In the pitch/coke mixtures, pitch that contains a higher HS fraction tended to greater enhance the mobility between pitch and coke.  Green density and the mobility enhancement were in agreement in comparing the ability of a pitch to wet the coke surface and form a good carbon anode.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6382], "author_name_tesi": "Suriyapraphadilok, Uthaiporn ", "last_name_ssi": "Suriyapraphadilok", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Uthaiporn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert", "Paul C Painter", "Erwin A Vogler", "Karl Todd Mueller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Chair", "Paul C Painter, Committee Member", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pitch-coke interaction", "coal tar pitch", "petroleum pitch", "1H high temperature NMR", "pitch characterization", "pre-baked carbon anode"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ENHANCED PARTICLE DIFFUSION THROUGH ENZYME CATALYSIS AND SILVER TITANIA NANOMOTORS\n\n\n", "id": "11105", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5900", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the first part of this thesis, I explore the use of enzymes as catalytic motors in order to drive nanoparticles.

Ad-hoc wireless networks of such devices may be engineered to perform autonomous missions like \nbattlefield surveillance using sensor networks or multi-robot air campaigns. A critical research challenge is to harness the capabilities of these devices via ad-hoc wireless networks to invoke deliberate processes in response to operational dynamics and perform \ncollaborative missions effectively. The Control, Communication and Computation Language (C3L) is a language designed to capture the semantics of the dynamic architectures of such distributed systems and concisely express complex, time-critical and mission-critical operations within the system. The alphabet of C3L consists of atomic events and actions that may be either controllable or uncontrollable. Atomic events and actions are combined in various ways to represent composite behaviors as event/action \nsequences. This programming paradigm enables heterogeneous, independently-developed \ndevices plug-n-play compatibility in ad-hoc networked applications with either independent or coordinated strategies. By embedding the operational dynamics of the system in the higher-level semantics of the language, this framework permits multi-level fusion of distributed data in an intuitive manner.  \nThe revised syntax and a complete operational semantic description of C3L are presented and detailed. To more fully explore the value of C3L as a tool for rapid development and testing of scalable distributed programs for autonomous devices, a C3L compiler has been developed for the language. The compiler exploits the implicit task-level parallelism inherent in C3L programs to automatically generate multi-threaded \nexecutable programs. Based on the Microsoft Phoenix framework for compiler development and optimization, the C3L compiler can target any architecture supported by the framework; consequently a C3L program may be compiled for a particular architecture for simulation studies and verifications, and then the same program and \ncompiler may be used to create executable programs for the actual hardware implementation of real devices using a different architecture. The compiler design and implementation are described, and the compiler is shown to generate deadlock-free multithreaded applications for any legal C3L program. Initial benchmarking tests show that the executables generated by the C3L compiler achieve near-linear speedups in \nstandard, multiprocessing desktop systems in ordinary operating environments when \nsufficient concurrency exists to offset the inter-processor messaging costs of the \napplication. \nSimulation studies are generally conducted early in the development cycle for most real systems; distributed system development of large-scale heterogeneous sets of autonomous devices operating in real-world environments imposes stringent demands on such simulations. The C3L compiler was integrated with the Visualization Tool Kit to enable native support for sophisticated presentations of either simulation or real-world behaviors. This compiler support for high-performance visualizations and the language extensions needed to exploit this functionality is presented. Finally, to illustrate the utility of the C3L language, its compiler and visualization support, an application study in the domain of the marine mine countermeasure mission is presented. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2933], "author_name_tesi": "Sustersic, John Phillip", "last_name_ssi": "Sustersic", "middle_name_ssi": "Phillip", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Shashi Phoha", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Robert Nickel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Dissertation Advisor", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Chair", "Shashi Phoha, Committee Member", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Robert Nickel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Parallelizing Compiler", "Distributed Systems Programming", "Formal Semantics", "Embedded Systems", "Computer Languages", "Mine Counter Measures"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Development of Novel Ultra-Deformable Cationic Liposomes for siRNA Delivery to Fibrous Tumors", "id": "15235", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7899", "abstract_tesi": "Nanoliposomes continue to be an interesting candidate for overcoming disadvantages in conventional systemic drug delivery, including off-target toxicities and short circulation times.  Various modifications, like surface functionalization, use of charged lipids, and antibody conjugation, can be made to liposomes to assist them in ultimately reaching their intended targets in the body.  While these common liposome modifications have been exhaustively studied, nanoliposomal mechanics, a feature that may be important for delivery, has not yet been studied due to lack of reliable mechanical characterization modalities.  Recently in our lab, we have found that nanoliposomal mechanics can be measured through a series of time-resolved fluorescence experiments.  Interestingly, it has been shown that the mechanical properties of drug carriers can affect the rate of phagocytosis by cells; specifically that softer carriers are less readily taken up by cells, making them less likely to be taken up by non-targeted cells in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and more likely to diffuse through fibrotic tissues characteristic of many cancers.  Researchers have noticed that adding mild detergents to the liposome lipid compositions have resulted in a new class of ultra-flexible nanoliposomes for use in topically administered therapies.  We hypothesized that the ultra-deformable nanoliposomes, like those being used for topical drug therapies, could display increased circulation time in the bloodstream due to their soft mechanical properties, allowing passive targeting to tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.

First, do relatively short 15-week postural stability enhancement programs produce meaningful improvements as measured by center of pressure (COP) metrics?  Secondly, does a 15-week training program in Karate produce better results than a Strength Training program?  Individual program evaluations, and between program comparisons, are based on pre- and post-training COP metrics.\n\nInjuries incurred from falls are a major public health concern.  In the U.S., falls are the leading cause of injury across all ages.  The morbidity and mortality rates increase dramatically for the segment of the population over the age of 65.  Researchers have thus investigated various forms of exercise for their potential to improve postural stability.  One fall prevention strategy that has received much attention recently is the use of the ancient martial art of T\u2019ai Chi to improve balance.  While T\u2019ai Chi has been shown to improve static balance, it may not be effective in reducing the risk of falls in more dynamic tasks such as recovering from tripping over an obstacle while one is walking, or when one experiences sudden perturbations, such as being jostled in a crowd.\n\nIn contrast, other martial arts, such as Karate, incorporate training in both stationary and dynamic postures.  In addition, Karate emphasizes the maintenance of balance against perturbations.  It is hypothesized that improvements in balance can best be obtained through an exercise program, such as Karate, that incorporates both static and dynamic training, as well as practice in postural responses to perturbations.  The purpose of this study is to examine the difference in postural characteristics between Karate students and a control group after a relatively brief 15-week physical training session.  It is hypothesized that the Karate students will show more improvement in balance as their training progresses compared to the control group.  To test this hypothesis, anthropometric measures were obtained from two groups of subjects: Karate students and a control group consisting of students engaged in strength training.  \n\nBefore training, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in their body segment inertial parameters.  Postural stability tests were performed at both the beginning and the end of a relatively brief 15-week training period.  During these tests, data on the movement of the center of pressure was obtained using a force plate while subjects performed balancing tasks; both with and without perturbation.  Analysis of this data indicates that there were only a limited number of statistically significant differences between the pre- and post-training center of pressure motion for the two groups.  These differences did not show any trends in the metrics which were different from the pre- and post-training values.  In summary, there were no statistically significant changes in the center of pressure motion for either the Strength Training group or the Karate Training group as a consequence of training for a period of 15 weeks.  The conclusion of this study is that brief training periods will have no appreciable effect on improving postural stability.  Future research on fall prevention programs should focus on the development of programs of longer duration.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7929], "author_name_tesi": "Sutton, Dane ", "last_name_ssi": "Sutton", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dane", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Henry Challis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Henry Challis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Karate", "Postural Stability", "Center of Pressure", "Fall Prevention", "Balance", "Perturbations"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DEGRADATION OF STARCH SPHERULITES BY &#945;-AMYLASE\n\n", "id": "9063", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4743", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goals of this study were to investigate the structure of starch spherulites using &#945;-amylase and to understand the effect of degree of crystallinity on starch resistance.   Common corn amylose of two different chain lengths, 600 or 120 degree of polymerization (DP), were heated to 180\u00b0C and rapidly cooled to 10\u00b0C in a pressure vessel to form amylose spherulites.  In order to determine enzyme susceptibility of amylose spherulites, the spherulites formed from 600 and 120 DP amylose were hydrolyzed by pancreatic &#945;-amylase and amyloglucosidase at 37\u00b0C for 16 hours according to the official AOAC 2002.02/AACC 32-40 method, and the spherulite residues were analyzed for resistant starch (RS) content.  Amylose spherulites before and after enzyme digestion were characterized using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) .  A two-stage digestion experiment was performed to analyze for RS content of enzyme-hydrolyzed residues.\nBefore hydrolysis, starch spherulites made from both 600 and 120 DP amylose exhibited B-type crystalline pattern containing about 24% and 34 % crystallinity, respectively.  Most spherulites had an average size of about 10 \u00b5m, round shape, rough texture, no pores and exhibited a characteristic \u201cMaltese\u201d cross extinction pattern between cross polarizers.  A small number of spherulites had a smaller diameter (<5\u00b5m), exhibited weak to no \u201cMaltese\u201d cross pattern, and perhaps contained non-spherulitic materials on the surfaces.  \nAfter hydrolysis, spherulites were found to be partially digested by enzymes and had enzyme resistant starch contents of approximately 37% (600 DP) and 62% (120 DP).  Despite the substantial hydrolysis, as determined by RS assay, microscopy showed no extensive erosion of the treated spherulites.  The spherulite residues appeared mostly intact and revealed no significant differences from untreated spherulites, unlike obvious changes normally observed in digested starch granules.  In general, digested spherulites had smoother surfaces and formed larger aggregates than fresh spherulites.  It was likely that the size of spherulite residues also decreased; however, this was difficult to quantify from the images.  The results led to speculation that the enzyme digested a large portion of spherulites from the inside-out.  \nInternal structure of amylose spherulites did not show radially oriented crystalline growth as expected of an ordinary spherulitic material.  There were no cavities or holes present inside of digested spherulites revealing evidence of endo-corrosion pattern as expected from amylolysis.  A blocklet structure was present, which ranged from 20-60 nm and 50-90 nm for 600 DP and 120 DP spherulites, respectively.  The AFM phase images of spherulite residues showed an increase in the crystalline phase evidenced by larger blocklet size.  For all spherulite residues, DSC profiles showed an increasing trend of melting temperature and melting enthalpy of treated spherulites after hydrolysis, suggesting an increase in molecular order and crystallinity.  The two-stage digestion experiment was performed to investigate the formation of enzyme-resistant material after enzyme hydrolysis, higher RS content of treated spherulites after the second round of 16 hours hydrolysis was observed.  Micrographs and DSC profiles of the first and second digestions showed similar finding as of typical spherulite residues.\nThe results obtained in the experiments led to three possible explanations.  First, enzymes preferentially digested a spherulite population which were not fully developed (i.e. exhibited partial or no \u201cMaltese\u201d cross or some non-spherulitic material that might be presented), and thus, this digested population largely contributed to the amount of RS contents measured by RS assay.  Second, the outer surface layer of amylose spherulites (i.e. dangling/ hair like structure or rough surface) was preferentially hydrolyzed by &#945;-amylase, hence, leaving the intact morphology and smooth surface observed on spherulites residues.  Third, &#945;-amylase partially hydrolyzed amylose spherulites creating defect crystallites and shorter amylose chains which were re-crystallized or orderly rearranged during the hydrolysis, thereby, inhibiting further enzyme digestion.  As evident from accretion of spherulitic crystals and higher thermostability of digested spherulites, it is likely that additional resistant material was formed during hydrolysis.  This was confirmed by the observation that there were no significant differences in spherulites morphology before and after enzyme hydrolysis but RS contents and crystallinity of amylose spherulites increased.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4708], "author_name_tesi": "Suwanayuen, Nuttanit ", "last_name_ssi": "Suwanayuen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nuttanit", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gregory Ray Ziegler", "Gregory Ray Ziegler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gregory Ray Ziegler, Thesis Advisor", "Gregory Ray Ziegler, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["degradation", "starch spherulites", "starch", "&#945;-amylase"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Perceptions of Dominican Spanish and Dominican \nSelf-perception in the Puerto Rican Diaspora\n\n", "id": "9736", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1935", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aim of the present project is to investigate the possible consequences of social prejudice on the perception of and attitudes towards minority language varieties and their speakers. A further goal is to examine the possible emergence of linguistic insecurity among \u00e9migr\u00e9s as compared to those remaining in their native country. An ideal setting for this investigation can be found in Puerto Rico. Over the last decades an increased influx of immigrants from the Dominican Republic has led to the existence of a growing minority of Dominicans and consequently to increased contact between Dominicans and Puerto Ricans on this Caribbean island. \nThe contact between Dominicans and Puerto Ricans is targeted for study as much for its linguistic import as for its social context. Dominican and Puerto Rican Spanish are considered varieties of Caribbean Spanish that differ only by a few phonological and syntactic patterns and a small number of lexical items. Although both varieties are heavily stigmatized within the Spanish-speaking world, previous work in Puerto Rico has found a wide-spread discrimination of Dominican Spanish and it speakers. At the same time, Dominican immigrants often are phenotypically dark, possess limited formal education, and as immigrants are also socially and economically disadvantaged relative to their Puerto Rican San Juan cohabitants. These facts beg the question of whether and to what extent Puerto Ricans\u2019 attitudes towards Dominican Spanish truly are based on linguistic differences. Social and racial prejudices cannot always be expressed freely. The possibility exists that they could reemerge as negative evaluations of Dominican Spanish. \nThe aim of the present research includes the following: (1) to uncover linguistic variables that are used in the identification of a speaker\u2019s origin (Puerto Rican vs. Dominican); (2) to examine whether Puerto Ricans\u2019 attitudes and perceptions of Dominican immigrants living in Puerto Rico are reflected in the evaluation of Dominican Spanish; (3) to determine the effects of these attitudes on the perceptions of Dominicans towards their own dialect. A sociolinguistic questionnaire and survey were administered to tap into the perceptions of linguistic differences among members of both groups and to uncover the possible emergence of linguistic insecurity among Dominican immigrants in Puerto Rico, and a verbal guise experiment examined the importance of perceived nationality and social class of a speaker in Puerto Ricans\u2019 evaluations of Dominican Spanish.\n\nThe results of the present study reveal that Puerto Ricans frequently cite dialectal differences as their main means of identifying Dominicans. However, the results of the verbal guise experiment imply that although linguistic differences are decisive in the identification of national origin, ratings on social, educational, and personal attributes are influenced by prejudicial notions of socioeconomic and educational background. Similarly, ratings on perception of \u2018correctness\u2019 and \u2018pleasantness\u2019 of Dominican Spanish as compared to Puerto Rican Spanish indicate social profiling. Accordingly, this research provides insights into the consequences of social prejudice on the perception of and attitudes towards minority language variants and their speakers. \nThe study also develops a deeper understanding of the social sources of the emergence of linguistic insecurity among minority immigrant groups as compared to those remaining in their native country. The results of the survey comparing Dominican linguistic insecurity reveal that linguistic insecurity among Dominicans in Puerto Rico decreases compared to that of the group examined in the Dominican Republic. Two possible reasons for the decrease of Dominican linguistic insecurity are put forth. It is probable that the Dominican speakers\u2019 recognition of a high degree of similarity between both varieties leads to perceptions of equality between these two dialects, a situation that is also unlikely to trigger linguistic insecurity. There is supporting evidence in the data for the argument that the recognition of linguistic similarity leads to a sense of solidarity among some Dominicans. This is likely to be compounded by the low prestige given to Caribbean varieties cross-dialectally in comparison to more prestigious varieties in South America and Spain. Awareness of the stigmatization of both varieties on the part of the speakers is not thought to rouse linguistic insecurity among Dominicans. In sum, the present results reveal that contact between these two equally disparaged varieties does not incur the same degree of linguistic insecurity among Dominicans that can be observed in cases of contact where a minority variety is in contact with a cross-dialectally more prestigious variety. Moreover, the evidence suggests that in spite of the prejudicial environment in Puerto Rico, Dominicans embrace their cultural beliefs and national identity. Within the present data, Dominican \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Puerto Rico hold fast to their identity. The outcome of the survey indicates that the native accent remains a highly salient component of Dominican identity. These results fall in line with previous work on Dominican immigrant communities in the U.S. In sum, Dominican linguistic insecurity does not appear to increase and simultaneously the link between identity and language is maintained in spite of contact with an environment of social and linguistic prejudice.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1917], "author_name_tesi": "Su\u00e1rez B\u00fcdenbender, Eva-Maria ", "last_name_ssi": "Su\u00e1rez B\u00fcdenbender", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Eva-Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Almeida Jacqueline Toribio", "Almeida Jacqueline Toribio", "John Lipski", "Nuria Sagarra", "Barbara E Bullock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Almeida Jacqueline Toribio, Dissertation Advisor", "Almeida Jacqueline Toribio, Committee Chair", "John Lipski, Committee Member", "Nuria Sagarra, Committee Member", "Barbara E Bullock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Puerto Rican Spanish", "Dominican Spanish", "verbal guise", "language attitudes", "dialectal contact", "Dominican Immigration"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Laboratory-scale Blast Testing Of Polymers", "id": "15172", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7431", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There presently exists a great body of work on the blast-relevant properties\nof metals, ceramics, and geomaterials.

Cattle, and consequently beef products, are considered a major source of STEC. E. coli O157:H7 has been regulated as an adulterant in ground beef since 1994. The USDA-Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) has indicated that 6 additional STEC (O145, O121, O111, O103, O45, and O26) will be regulated as adulterants in raw beef trim and ground beef, beginning in June 2012. \nHowever, the overall incidence of non-O157 STEC is difficult to estimate because routine screening of these serogroups is not performed, due to a lack of rapid molecular methods and/or standard culture methods. A standard detection protocol for non-O157 STEC is not currently established, largely due to the broad range of both phenotypic and genotypic characteristics this group of pathogens display. While some methods have been employed to detect STEC in large beef processing environments and/or products, little is known about the presence of STEC in small and very small beef processing plants or the resulting beef products.\nThe first objective of this study evaluated the effectiveness of three different enrichment media (tryptic soy broth (TSB) + novobiocin (TSBn); modified E. coli broth + novobiocin (mECn); and modified TSB (mTSB) containing 8 mg/L novobiocin, 16 mg/L vancomycin, 2 mg/L rifampicin, 1.5g/L bile salts, and 1 mg/L potassium tellurite; and described by Poss\u00e9 et al. (2008) to isolate a non-O157:H7 STEC. Carcass, environmental, fecal, or ground beef samples were artificially inoculated with approximately 10\u00b2 CFU/mL of E. coli O145 and enriched for 24 hr at 42\u00b0C with each of the selected enrichment media. After enrichments, O145 was confirmed using a multiplex PCR assay (DebRoy et al., 2011) which had been optimized for the detection of STEC serogroups O157, O145, O121, O113, O111, O103, O45, and O26. All three enrichment media were effective for the detection of E. coli O145. Interestingly, fewer background microorganisms were detected on agar plates when subjected to enrichment with mTSB. \nThe second objective of this study was to determine if small and very small beef processing plants are a potential source of STEC, utilizing the enrichment and detection methods optimized in the first objective. In this survey, environmental swabs, carcass swabs, hide swabs, fecal samples, and ground beef from small and very small beef processing plants were obtained to determine the presence of STEC. The previously optimized multiplex PCR assay was used to detect the presence of STEC O-groups and the presence of Shiga toxin (stx) and intimin (eae) genes were determined using PCR primers described by Paton and Paton (1998). Results demonstrated that 55.5% (151/272) of the environmental samples, 36.9% (75/203) of the carcass samples, 85.2% (23/27) of the hide samples, 37.5% (12/32) of the fecal, and 18.6% (22/118) of the ground beef samples tested positive for one or more of the serogroups. However, only 7.7% (21/272) of the environmental samples, 5.9% (12/203) of the carcass samples, 0% (0/27) of the hide samples, 0% (0/32) of the fecal, and 0% (0/118) ground beef samples tested positive for stx1 and/or stx2 genes. In addition, 13.6% (37/272) of the environmental samples, 7.9% (16/203) of the carcass samples, 0% (0/27) of the hide samples, 0% (0/32) of the fecal samples, and 0.8% (1/118) of the ground beef samples tested positive for eae gene. \nA second survey was completed to evaluate the effectiveness of three different sampling methods (sponge swab, hide clipping, and a novel M-Vac sampling method (Microbial Vac Systems, Inc., Bluffdale, Utah) for detecting STEC on cattle, swine, and sheep hides at one abattoir. Samples were assayed for eight STEC serogroups, (O157, O145, O121, O113, O111, O103, O45, and O26) using a multiplex PCR assay (DebRoy et al., 2011). The presence of stx genes in samples were identified using an additional multiplex PCR assay (Paton and Paton, 1998). Results demonstrated that 92% (24/26) of cattle hides tested positive for one or more STEC O-groups using the sponge swab and hair clipping methods, while 88% (23/26) of cattle hides tested positive for one or more STEC O-groups using the M-Vac sampling method. Swine hides tested positive for one or more STEC O-group in 93% (28/30) of samples collected with the sponge swab method, as compared with 80% (24/30) of samples collected using the hair clipping method, while 97% (29/30) of samples collected were positive for the STEC O-group using the M-Vac sampling method. Sheep hides were positive for one or more STEC O-group in all (11/11) of the samples collected with the sponge swab and M-Vac methods, while 82% (9/11) of samples collected were positive with the hair clipping method. However, only 3.8% (1/26) of cattle hides, 40% (12/30) of swine hides, and 27.3% (3/11) of sheep hides tested positive for stx1 and/or stx2 genes, when all sampling methods were considered.\nThe data resulting from the beef processing plant survey may establish a baseline for the presence of non-O157 STEC in small and very small processing establishments in Pennsylvania and the resulting beef products. Results from the hide study may serve as an indication of the presence of STEC in small and very small beef slaughter facilities, which also may process multiple species. Collectively, these studies may be useful to regulatory officials, researchers, and public health personnel who are interested in determining the presence of these pathogens in the meat supply. Future studies focusing on specific locations in the beef processing environment or in beef trim, as well as resulting ground beef products, may result in a better understanding the path(s) that these pathogens take to reach the final product. Understanding pathways of transmission in a beef processing environment may help researchers and processors determine interventions that can be employed to control these pathogens, resulting in a safer food supply.

After critically examining traditional approaches in environmental ethics that recognize direct duties to non-human nature, I argue instead that human beings have indirect duties regarding non-human nature. Specifically, I contend that humans have a duty to abstain from causing unnecessary harm to non-human organisms, because doing so erodes one\u2019s virtuous dispositions.\n\nIn the Doctrine of Virtue, Immanuel Kant holds that human beings have duties \u201cregarding\u201d flora and non-human animals. These duties regarding nature arise from a direct duty a human being has to herself, namely the duty to increase her own moral perfection. I argue that such moral perfection is constituted by possessing traditionally recognized virtues, such as benevolence. Kant mentions animal cruelty and wanton destruction of flora as examples of actions that diminish one\u2019s moral perfection and hence violate one\u2019s duty to moral perfection. I argue that one ought to abstain from such actions because they cause unnecessary harm to organisms, a kind of action that erodes one\u2019s virtuous dispositions and hence violates one\u2019s duty to moral perfection. Moreover, benefiting a non-human organism can increase one\u2019s moral perfection, because such beneficence is a way of cultivating virtues and hence fulfilling one\u2019s duty to increase one\u2019s own moral perfection.\n\nKant\u2019s account of organisms, primarily presented in the Critique of Judgment, provides a basis for understanding what it means to harm and benefit non-human organisms. According to this account, human investigators are warranted in taking organisms to be natural purposes, or entities that are natural yet also exhibit teleological features of design. In particular, Kant holds that to judge an organism as purposive is to judge it as an entity that ought to be a particular way. I use the term \u201cnatural goods\u201d to refer to those states and functions that are constitutive of what an entity ought to be as a natural purpose. I argue that judgments about the natural goods of a given kind of organism are best exemplified by the assessment of relevant experts. This conception of natural goods helps ground duties regarding non-human organisms: since organisms have natural goods, it is possible to harm and benefit them by inhibiting or promoting the achievement of their natural goods. These considerations ground a robust, virtue-oriented environmental ethic that has significant advantages over traditional approaches to environmental ethics.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7532], "author_name_tesi": "Svoboda, Toby Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Svoboda", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Toby", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Philip Christman", "Nancy A Tuana", "Jennifer Mensch", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Philip Christman, Dissertation Advisor", "Nancy A Tuana, Committee Member", "Jennifer Mensch, Committee Member", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["environmental ethics", "animal ethics", "Kant", "virtue", "teleology"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "CONSTRUCTION OF WOMANHOOD IN AFRICA: THE CASE OF WOMEN IN RURAL TANZANIA \n\n", "id": "7405", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1888", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThis critical ethnographic study investigates ways in which women in Yuuri and Sufi in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania negotiate their womanhood identities and what factors have influenced their decisions.  My framework for this study is developed from post structural feminist and cultural-historical activity perspectives. I appropriated post-structural feminist perspective to understand ways in women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social positions, spatial locations and their agency shaped their thinking and behavior. From cultural-historical activity perspective, I utilized the notions of history and culture to understand ways in which historical and cultural processes have shaped the current condition of women and shape their interactions.\nSpecifically, this study explores the following three questions: (1) what are the socio-cultural and historical conditions under which the women in my study operate? (2) How are womanhood ideas represented in people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day-to-day interactions? (3) What are particular women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perceptions and actions about womanhood identity?\nData collection included two summer semesters of participant observation, personal interviews, archival research, and published materials. I examined historical processes and practices to understand how the various dimensions of power have operated to separate women from men and to deny them freedom to utilize their agency with equal footing with men. I also examined ways in which womanhood ideas became normalized and maintained in people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day-to-day interactions. Lastly I examined selected women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ideas and behavior as they configure their identity to achieve their life goals.\n By examining historical, cultural and social processes and practices, I challenge the argument that construction of identity is a matter of reiterating or repeating the norms that constitute individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s identity. In this study I found that rather than reiterating the norms, women in this study use various sources not necessarily those prescribed as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwomanly,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but configured their identity within the family and other cultural dynamics.\nThese findings contribute several wider discussions including: how history, culture and social position shape people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interactions and how these interactions in turn transform their culture. I suggest that identity cannot be separated from its historical and cultural processes. Furthermore, learning is very much connected to learner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history, culture and social position in the learning activity.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1871], "author_name_tesi": "Swai, Elinami Veraeli", "last_name_ssi": "Swai", "middle_name_ssi": "Veraeli", "first_name_ssi": "Elinami", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ian E Baptiste", "Fred Michael Schied", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "Paul T Zeleza"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ian E Baptiste, Committee Chair", "Fred Michael Schied, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member", "Paul T Zeleza, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["post structural feminist theory", "identity. learning", "knowing", "CHAT"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The impact of social networking sites on presentation of self and patterns of participation In groups: An ethnographic study of a community of runners", "id": "17406", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8421", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This ethnographic study explored how the social web is impacting the way individuals present themselves to others and function within group settings.

The web-based activity of a community of endurance athletes was observed over a three-month period during the spring 2012 marathon season. Twenty-one athletes spread out across six time zones participated in the study. A connective ethnographical method was used to track the activity of the participants as they interacted on Twitter, Facebook, Dailymile, blog, and podcasting sites. Screen capturing software was used to collect data. Follow-up questions were handled via email, Instant Messenger, and Twitter Direct Message. Filed notes were also compiled. Data was coded by hand and consisted of identifying key words/phrases used by the participants in order to identify prevalent themes. Using this method, 818 tweets, 65 blog posts, 5 podcasts, 54 Facebook updates, and 20 Dailymile updates were collected and coded. The outcome was a thick description of community activity.

This hypothesis is tested by examining how well the classic linear model of this phenomenon matches observations. The classic Kelvin-Helmholtz velocity profile with a rigid lower boundary and a sloping interface is used to approximate a warm frontal region. It is shown that the distance that these wave-like patterns, observed by SAR, extend from the surface warm front into the cool air mass is consistent with a bifurcation along the warm frontal inversion from unstable to neutral solutions. It also is be shown that the maximum wave growth rate occurs near this bifurcation point and hence can explain the SAR-observed pattern of wind perturbation intensity.

In the NEO approach, nuclear quantum effects are incorporated directly within electronic structure calculations by treating specified nuclei quantum mechanically on the same level as the electrons.  Mixed nuclear electronic wavefunctions are calculated by solving the time independent nuclear-electronic Schrodinger equation using molecular orbital techniques.\n\nA formulation of nuclear-electronic orbital many-body perturbation theory (NEO-MP2) for recovering electron-proton correlation is presented.  The molecular structures for a series of bihalides and the hydrogen fluoride (HF) dimer are calculated at the NEO-MP2 level and compared to vibrationally averaged structures obtained using conventional Born-Oppenheimer based approaches and to experimental values.  The bihalide X-X distances are similar for all methods.  For the HF dimer, the NEO-MP2 F-F distance is in excellent agreement with the distance obtained experimentally for a model which removes the large amplitude bending motions.  The NEO-MP2 approach does not include these large amplitude bending motions because it does not recover enough dynamical electron-proton orrelation.\n\nA method which incorporates explicit electron-proton correlation directly into the nuclear-electronic orbital self consistent-field framework is presented.  This nuclear-electronic orbital explicitly correlated Hartree-Fock (NEO-XCHF) scheme is formulated using Gaussian basis functions for the electrons and the quantum nuclei in conjunction with Gaussian type geminal functions.  The description of the nuclear wavefunction is significantly improved by the inclusion of explicit electron-proton correlation. The NEO-XCHF method leads to hydrogen vibrational stretch frequencies that are in excellent agreement with those calculated from grid-based methods.\n\nOverall, these findings demonstrate that dynamical electron proton correlation significantly impacts the qualitative characteristics of nuclear wavefunctions.

The ability to dynamically stabilize Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection using acceleration modulation is of interest to groups who design and study thermoacoustic machines, as the introduction of parasitic convection can have deleterious effects on the desired operation and efficiency of the device. These performance issues caused by suspected convective instability have been seen both in traveling wave thermoacoustic refrigerators and in cryogenic pulse tube chillers. This dissertation reports the results of an experiment intended to determine the vibratory, fluidic, and geometric conditions under which a small, rectangular container of statically unstable fluid may be stabilized by vertical vibration, incorporating the computational methods of R.

There are several issues (such as preferences heterogeneity among household members, differential control of resources) that the unitary approach cannot address.  The more general models of household decision-making explicitly recognize and model the individualistic elements in the household within a collective framework.  Collective models make the assumption of Pareto efficiency in intrahousehold distribution but do not impose a particular solution concept.  The concept of bargaining power plays a crucial role in the collective model.  The model predicts that the household allocation process and the resultant outcomes will reflect the bargaining power of the individual.  Individuals derive bargaining power from multiple sources, many of which correspond to the alternative options available to them in the event of withdrawing from the agreement.  \nThe research undertaken in this dissertation focuses on two aspects of household decision making, labor allocation and consumption expenditures, using the framework of the Nash-bargaining model and the agricultural household model.  The measures of bargaining power used are access to credit and ownership of land.  In this study a distinction is made between access to credit and participation in the credit market. \n\nThe analyses in this research are based on the data set \u2018Financial Markets and Household Food Security, 1995\u2019, that was made available from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Washington D.C.  The data are from a household survey of 404 households in 45 villages spread over five districts in rural Malawi.  \n\n\nThe estimation procedure undertaken in this dissertation follows a two-step approach to correct for choice-based sampling of the survey.  In the first step, the probability choices regarding credit program membership status for the household are estimated using the weighted\u2013exogenous\u2013maximum likelihood multinomial logit model.  The empirical models estimated in the second step include models to estimate the impact of access to credit on work choices and models to estimate the impact of access to credit and land ownership on consumption decisions within the household.  The credit\u2013labor allocation models are analyzed using the random-effects probit model, corrected for endogeneity of access to credit to the labor allocation decision.  The effect of access to credit and land ownership on household expenditure shares are analyzed using ordinary least squares and Tobit models, corrected for endogeneity of total household expenditure.  \n\n\nThe credit\u2013labor allocation models indicate that access to formal as well as informal credit increases participation in off-farm self-employment activities, and reduces participation in own farm work for women in male-headed households.  Access to informal credit increases men\u2019s participation in off-farm self-employment activities.  Women\u2019s access to formal credit also reduces men\u2019s participation in own farm work.  Education in rural Malawi appears to be a differentiating characteristic between those working off-farm and those allocating time to farm work.  More education among men in Malawi encourages their participation in off-farm self-employment, whereas those men with less education are concentrated on farms.  However, this relation does not appear to be true where women are concerned suggesting they are engaging in low-skill self-employment activities.  Locational characteristics were found to be important in explaining participation in self-employment activity.  \n\n\nThe results from the expenditure models do not unequivocally support the hypothesis that men spend more on items of personal consumption while women are more oriented towards children and household welfare.  While women in Malawi do seem to spend more on general household items, health and education, men in Malawi are also spending less on adult goods when they have access to formal credit.  Female heads, on the other hand, increase the share of household expenditure on adult goods with access to formal credit.  Expenditures on health increase in all the models except for female heads\u2019 access to informal credit, suggesting the importance of health care.  Child-related investments are negatively affected by female head\u2019s access to informal credit and women\u2019s (spouses\u2019) share of land.  Combined with the results from other equations in the models, it suggests that child-related investments are not yet a \u2018priority\u2019 area for the household.  \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2350], "author_name_tesi": "Swaminathan, Hema ", "last_name_ssi": "Swaminathan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hema", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis", "David Gerard Abler", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "David Shapiro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis, Committee Chair", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member", "David Shapiro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Malawi", "Consumption-expenditures", "Credit", "Agricultural household model", "Bargaining", "Labor participation", "Tobit", "Endogeneity", "Probit"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "An examination of Post-CMOS computing techniques using steep-slope device-based architectures", "id": "23667", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10609", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As technology scaling results in smaller and smaller transistor sizes, existing CMOS\ntechnology starts to encounter certain fundamental physical limitations.

The model utilizes experimentally measured surface profile data as input. Results indicate that the uncompressed surface morphology of mating materials, elasticity of PEFC components and local compression pressure are the key parameters that influence the characteristics of the MPL and CL contact. The model predicts that a 50% drop in the MPL and CL surface roughness may result in nearly a 40% drop in the MPL|CL contact resistance. The model also shows that the void space along the MPL|CL interface can potentially store significant amount of liquid water (0.9 to 3.1 mg/cm2), which could result in a performance loss and reduced durability. A 50% drop in the MPL and CL surface roughness is expected to yield nearly a 50% drop in the water storage capacity of the MPL|CL interface. The results of this work provide key insights that enhance understanding regarding the complex relation between MPL|CL interfacial structure and cell performance. Additionally, an upgraded (fractal) model is formulated to simulate the bi-polar plate (BP)| diffusion media (DM) interface. The fractal model can potentially provide a better estimate of the aforementioned results when applied to the MPL|CL interface.

How VWM works has been a hotly debated topic in psychology for many years. This thesis focuses on testing predictions generated from a computational model of VWM called the Binding Pool model. In this model, a memory is a set of binding pool nodes activated from concurrent activity of the visual features that compose an object and a token that individuates memories. \n\tThe first prediction focused on how similarity affects memory precision. The model predicts that highly similar and dissimilar stimuli are more precise than stimuli with intermediate similarity. In two experiments, the results supported the prediction of the model.\n\tThe second prediction focused trade-offs in retrieval precision as a function of the number of relevant features. The model predicts this trade-off should be present for multiple objects. In two experiments, participants reported the task irrelevant feature with coarse precision and were significantly less precise when the task irrelevant feature became relevant to retrieval, which support the prediction from the model. However, the ability to code features coarsely needed to be added to the model.\n\tThe third prediction focused on how repetitions are encoded into memory. The model predicts that repetitions will be less precise than a single object. In two experiments, participants were significantly more precise with repetitions than a single object and random multiple objects.

In the past two decades, political theorists have articulated a variety of new conceptions of civic education, including prominent communitarian and deliberative democratic variants, that emphasize the need to halt the increasing dominance of economic rationality within the school and to reorganize the institution to reinvigorate more robustly ethical forms of socialization.  Although many educational critics concur that the narrowly economic goals of contemporary education are detrimental to the stability of society and the psychic health of the individual, serious theoretical debate has arisen around the question of whether it is the cosmopolitan normative principles of deliberative democracy or the culturally grounded ethical schemas of traditional communities that ought to take the lead in reconstructing the institution of the school.  \nI argue in this dissertation that both the deliberative and communitarian trends within civic educational theory alike have insufficiently considered the interdependence of robust ethical culture and a resilient democratic public; the mechanisms of democratic debate, I contend, ought to be understood pragmatically as tools for resolving trans-communal problems, while cultural frameworks of value ought to be understood as sensitive normative instruments for detecting and publicizing emergent threats to social life.  Relying upon a pragmatic conception of democratic citizenship adapted from the work of John Dewey, Michel Foucault, and J\u00fcrgen Habermas, I argue that the work of democratic education accordingly must be reconstructed around the activity of communicative problematization.  If democratic politics is to continue to be responsive to the needs of the public, young citizens must be habituated and encouraged to engage in cooperative practices of social criticism, drawing on the normative motivations of their ethical lifeworld to criticize and publicize the problems encountered in their individual social experience.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8326], "author_name_tesi": "Swanson, Jared ", "last_name_ssi": "Swanson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jared", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Philip Christman", "Vincent M Colapietro", "Christopher P Long", "Jeffrey Nealon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Philip Christman, Dissertation Advisor", "Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Member", "Christopher P Long, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Nealon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Deliberative Democracy", "Civic Education", "Critical Theory", "J\u00fcrgen Habermas", "John Dewey", "Michel Foucault", "Problematization"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Flower development in Theobroma cacao L.:\nAn assessment of morphological and molecular conservation of floral development between Arabidopsis thaliana and Theobroma cacao\n", "id": "6598", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2636", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-12-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Comparative anatomical and developmental studies on Theobroma cacao L. flower development were conducted to provide insight into the general mechanisms that control floral development.

As a sustained and complex form of role play, imaginary companion play becomes more detailed and abstract and functions as a highly complex mode of play expression in early childhood. Narrative, evident in children\u2019s decontextualized language, is a complex form of linguistic expression in early childhood. Imaginary companion play and narrative both require sophisticated, symbolic mental and linguistic construction for creation and duration; both processes require similar decontextualization. This dissertation investigates the imaginary companion play and narrative skills of young children. Designed as an exploratory, qualitative study, this study is contextualized within the \u201cplay-literacy nexus\u201d and utilizes multiple forms of narrative research. Two case studies were conducted with single child-participants and accompanying parent-participants. Parent-participants completed semi-structured interviews prior to the initiation of data collection sessions with child-participants. Through semi-structured interviews, narrative task productions, and artistic and dramatic task productions, child-participants shared their experiences of imaginary companion play and demonstrations of narrative skill development. Also collected were child-participants\u2019 spontaneous narratives about their imaginary companions. Using analysis of narrative and assessment of narratives presented with a creative narrative writing stance, each child-participant\u2019s central story yielded information that addressed or challenged the following themes: the concept of imaginary companion play; the qualities of young children with imaginary companions; the connection between pretend play and narrative skills; and the potential developmental benefits of imaginary companion play for narrative skills of young children. Child-participant and parent-participant interviews yielded striking profiles that aligned with themes of friendship, ownership, and imagination. Study results indicate the potential benefit of imaginary companion play for the narrative skills of young children in areas: abstract thought processes like mental and linguistic constructions; and narrative skill advantages like sophisticated language use, story schema expertise, and psychological causation. Study results also yielded demonstrations of decontextualization in play and language. This study indicates a need for further research in the areas of: refined dynamic systems theory as a lens for analyzing pretend play and narrative development; and connections between imaginary companion play and potential child development.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9962], "author_name_tesi": "Swartz, Suzanne Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Swartz", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Suzanne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson", "James Ewald Johnson", "Vivian Yenika Agbaw", "Daniel Dean Hade", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "James Ewald Johnson, Committee Chair", "Vivian Yenika Agbaw, Committee Member", "Daniel Dean Hade, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["decontextualized language", "dynamic systems theory", "imaginary companion play", "narrative skill", "play-literacy nexus."]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DEFICITS IN FEEDING AND VAGAL RESPONSES IN TWO RAT MODELS OF OBESITY\n\n", "id": "9677", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6162", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Obesity is currently a global epidemic, while in the United States, approximately 33% of the population is obese.  Consumption of a HF diet is linked both with overconsumption and obesity in humans and rodents.  Cholecystokinin (CCK) a peptide hormone, secreted from the duodenum in response to intestinal fats and proteins, is partially responsible for meal termination.  While a HF diet suppresses the satiating effects of CCK, fats also exert orosensory stimulating effects, which promotes further intake of both fats and other nutrients.  Because obese individuals have increased preference for fats compared to lean individuals, it is possible that increased orosensory stimulation causes over consumption.  The Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat is a model of obesity that lacks a functional CCK-1 receptor (CCK-1R).  This rat is hyperphagic compared to Long-Evans Tokushima Otuska (LETO) lean controls.  Therefore, in an attempt to elucidate the role of the orosensory component in hyperphagia in the OLETF.rat, we employed one bottle sham feeding tests.  To examine the role of an energy deficit in preferences of fats, we subjected OLETF and LETO rats to non-deprivation, overnight deprivation, and two hour deprivation and tested their acceptance for fat.  Additionally, to examine the interaction between both the oral and postoral properties of fats, we assessed acceptance and preference for fats using real feeding tests.  We found that OLETF rats\u2019 sham intake was significantly increased at higher oil concentrations during a fed state compared to LETO.  Conversely the concentration curve was shifted left towards the lower concentrations after deprivation.  Real feeding also resulted in increased oil intake at high oil concentrations compared to LETO.  Together, these results suggest that OLETF rats have an increased oral avidity to fats compared to LETO.  During deprived conditions, OLETF consumed more from low concentrations of oils.  To examine bodyweight and adiposity as well as peripheral deficits in an established rodent model that becomes obese when fed a high-fat (HF), we measured 24-hour chow intake, body weight, and relative fat pad mass in dietary induced obese (DIO) and dietary induced obese resistant (DR) rats.  Additionally, we studied the sensitivity of both DIO and DR to CCK at doses of 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 &#956;g/kg when fed chow over 60 minutes.  Finally, to complement our behavioral experiment, we examined CCK-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-Li) in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) after pre-treatment with 4.0 and 8.0 &#956;g/kg doses of CCK.  We found that DIO rats ate more chow in 24 hours and weighed more than DR rats.  However, epididymal and total relative fat pad mass was significantly lower in DIO rats compared to DR.  Lastly, CCK significantly suppressed chow intake more and produced more Fos-Li in the DIO strain compared to DR at the 4.0 &#956;g/kg dose,  These results show that DIO rats are more sensitive to the satiating effects of CCK at 4.0 &#956;g/kg that is most likely due to vagal mechanisms, such as an increase of CCK-1R.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6155], "author_name_tesi": "Swartz, Timothy David", "last_name_ssi": "Swartz", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Thomas Green", "Mihai Covasa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Thomas Green, Thesis Advisor", "Mihai Covasa, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["obesity", "CCK", "satiation", "fats"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "PEER INFLUENCE ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH DIFFERING MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES\n", "id": "10387", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2600", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current study examined the role that peer influences play in physical activity behavior of college-aged students with differing motivational profiles, and aimed to determine whether peers impact physical activity behavior directly or indirectly through the shaping of an individual\u2019s cognitions such as self-efficacy and outcome expectations. College-aged students (N = 817) completed an online survey on peer influence, motivation, and physical activity.  Three hypotheses were tested: 1) self-efficacy and outcome expectations would mediate the effect of peer influence on physical activity, 2) based on previous research by Vlachopoulos et al. (2000), three main motivational profiles would emerge, and 3) the strength and pattern of association between peer influence and physical activity would vary across motivational profiles.  A structural equation modeling analysis revealed that a direct model where peer influence, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations were all directly associated with physical activity was a better fitting solution than the proposed meditational model. The relationships among peer influence, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations also varied by motivational profile such that individuals exhibiting moderate levels of extrinsic motivation and a high level of amotivation had a stronger relationship between peer influence and physical activity. These study findings suggest that individuals exhibiting moderate levels of extrinsic motivation and high level of amotivation may be most responsive to interventions incorporating the involvement of peers for increasing physical activity as compared to individuals with more self-determined or intrinsic motivational profiles.

In these studies, we examine both the important residues in the C-terminus of the TonB protein and the essential residue, His20, in the sole transmembrane domain.\nPrevious to these works, it was found that there are five aromatic amino acids in the C-terminus of TonB participating in an aromatic cluster.  In the first study, discussed in chapter 2, a double mutant cycle analysis is performed on two additional aromatic residues that had been previously uncharacterized.  It was found that F125 is not participating in this aromatic cluster, but Y163 is participating with these other aromatic amino acids.  \nThe relative importance of serine and threonine residues in the C-terminus was examined in this study as well by making alanine substitutions at each of these positions.  None of the serines or threonines examined were important for TonB function and all alanine substitutions at these positions had full wild-type activity.\nIn the N-terminal transmembrane domain, it has previously been shown that His20 has the sole functionally significant side chain.  To examine the function of this residue further, two mutagenesis studies were performed.  In the first study, His20 was substituted by each of the other amino acids.  In this case, only H20N had wild type activity and this suggested that the proton pathway in this system may not be operating as previously thought.  In the second study, the His20 residue was moved to each of the other transmembrane positions on an otherwise inactive H20A template.  The only His relocation mutant to regain activity was V24H H20A.  Because this residue is predicted to be on the same face of the helix as His20, it suggested that His20 was active along a face of the transmembrane domain.  However, because none of the other residues on this face regained activity when substituted to histidines, the His20 residue is only able to function in a narrow depth.\nThe transmembrane mutants described above were also coexpressed with a known suppressor of TonB transmembrane mutations, ExbB A39E.  In these studies, it was evident that this suppressor is not allele specific and that a wide range of these histidine mutations could be suppressed to some extent.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [954], "author_name_tesi": "Swayne, Cheryl Dianne", "last_name_ssi": "Swayne", "middle_name_ssi": "Dianne", "first_name_ssi": "Cheryl", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Postle", "Kathleen Postle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Postle, Thesis Advisor", "Kathleen Postle, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["E. coli", "energy transduction", "TonB"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Perceptions of Patients' Post Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery Related to Health Related Quality of Life and Satisfaction when Nurse Practitioners are Active Participants in Care\n\n\n", "id": "9799", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5024", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The issue of quality health care has a renewed focus since the Institute of Medicine\u2019s 2000 report and has become a primary concern for patients, providers, and payors. Quality needs to be addressed from the perspective of the patient, incorporating patient-centered preferences in all areas where care is received; with special attention for high frequency, high cost, high-risk populations that evaluates all types of providers. The primary aim of this study is to describe patient perceptions of health related quality of life (HRQOL) and satisfaction for patients hospitalized for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery when Nurse Practitioners (NP) are active participants in care. Secondary aims of the study were to: describe the outcomes: adverse events (pulmonary, urinary tract, and wound infections); cost of care; mortality; and hospital re-admissions; and the role of the Nurse Practitioner for patients having CABG surgery. The Quality Health Outcomes Model was used as the foundation for the research. A prospective descriptive multi-site study using a criterion-based sample to select individuals having CABG surgery in mid to large size, non-Magnet community hospitals in northeastern, central, or southeastern Pennsylvania was used. Data was collected from four sources: two surveys, the Short Form-36, version 2 for HRQOL and the Patient Judgment System for patient satisfaction; a Chart Review Tool; and a NP survey.\n Participants were enrolled (N = 91) at two hospitals, with one NP at each facility. Primary data analysis was descriptive with secondary analyses performed to identify the presence of relationships among the study variables. Findings indicated participants had high satisfaction with all aspects of hospitalization and HRQOL mental health; and low scores for HRQOL physical role and physical component score. Mortality and cost of care were lower than State averages, while adverse events and re-admissions were higher than State averages. NPs were actively involved in patient care and spent 80% of their time in direct patient care activities. Implications include the need for continued research, using quasi-experimental designs to identify a cause and effect relationship between the use of NPs and selected patient outcomes. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5000], "author_name_tesi": "Sweeney, Patricia Demko", "last_name_ssi": "Sweeney", "middle_name_ssi": "Demko", "first_name_ssi": "Patricia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mona M Counts", "Mona M Counts", "Kim Kopenhaver Doheny", "Carol A Smith", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mona M Counts, Dissertation Advisor", "Mona M Counts, Committee Chair", "Kim Kopenhaver Doheny, Committee Member", "Carol A Smith, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CABG Surgery", "Nurse Practitioners", "Satisfaction", "Health Related Quality of Life"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Permeability, Drying, and Sintering of Pressure Filtered Ceramic Nanopowders", "id": "6544", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5708", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-04-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Three aspects of nanocrystalline ceramic body formation are examined in this work: permeability, drying stress, and sintering behavior. \n     The permeabilities of nanocrystalline 3 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (3Y-TZP), silica, and boehmite powder compacts are measured during their formation by constant rate pressure filtration.  The classic Carman-Kozeny equation with no account for the effect of adsorbed water often overestimates by a factor of 2 or more the measured permeabilities, with increasing deviation with decreasing permeability.  A permeability equation from the literature and one derived here, both taking into account the effect of adsorbed water, show significant improvement over the classic Carman-Kozeny equation for predicting measured permeabilities.  The equation derived here allows straightforward predictions to be made of how permeability will change as the critical point of drying (when shrinkage stops) is approached.\n     An approximate expression for the maximum tensile stress occurring in an elastic finite cylinder during drying from all sides is derived.  Numerical calculations of the exact state of stress during drying show that for cylinder length-to-diameter ratios up to 2/3, the present expression is more accurate than equations from the literature for an infinite plate and an infinite cylinder.  For cylinders with length-to-diameter ratios greater than 2/3, numerical calculations show an equation from the literature for the drying stress in an infinite cylinder to be more accurate.  To test the validity of the present expression, the drying rates above which fracture occurs are determined for disk-shaped samples of pressure filtered nanocrystalline 3Y-TZP, boehmite, and silica powders.  These maximum safe drying rates are used with the present expression to calculate the maximum drying stresses that can be sustained without fracture, and these stresses are compared to diametral compression-measured strengths of similar samples dried to the critical point of drying (when fracture is most likely during drying).  Agreement between maximum safe drying stresses and measured sample strengths is found to be good (to within better than a factor of 2) for boehmite samples, but not very good (off by a factor of ~7) for nanocrystalline 3Y-TZP samples.  Sub-critical crack growth is indicated as the source of this deviation in nanocrystalline 3Y-TZP samples.\n     Literature studies of the sintering of chloride-derived 3Y-TZP nanopowders have documented numerous sintering problems including inability to reach full density, desintering, cracking, and the formation of a dense shell with less dense interior.  To explain the poor sintering behavior of samples of one nanocrystalline 3Y-TZP powder, the origin of such a dense shell microstructure is determined.  Three possible reasons for a dense shell microstructure are examined and rejected: exothermic reactions with the sintering atmosphere, pre-existing density gradients in the green compact, and thermal gradients occurring during sintering.  A combination of gas flow/diffusion, thermodynamic, and sintering calculations are used to show that the evolution of a structure-coarsening gas (hydrogen chloride) during sintering causes the formation of a dense shell microstructure, and explains the poor densification behavior of this system.  Two solutions to the problem are compared: 1) a thermal treatment composed of an extended hold at 1000\u00b0C to allow HCl gas removal before the onset of closed porosity (at about 90-93% of theoretical density), and 2) a chemical treatment performed by washing pre-sintered (500 \u00b0C/30 min) samples at room temperature using a concentrated ammonium hydroxide solution to remove chlorides.  The thermal treatment is found to be superior for removing residual chlorine and allowing full density to be achieved during sintering.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5703], "author_name_tesi": "Sweeney, Sean M.", "last_name_ssi": "Sweeney", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Sean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David John Green", "Merrilea J Mayo", "Randall M German", "James Hansell Adair", "Gary Lynn Messing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David John Green, Committee Chair", "Merrilea J Mayo, Committee Member", "Randall M German, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["permeability", "drying", "sintering", "zirconia", "boehmite", "silica", "pressure filtration", "adsorbed water", "drying stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Correlates of Changes in Prestige among American Colleges and Universities\n", "id": "8716", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3615", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study is the first to examine changes over time in the U.S. News and World Report peer assessment ratings. The purpose of the study is to examine what variables, if any, relate to these changes in ratings. The study employs two theoretical constructs \u2013 resource dependency and prestige maximization \u2013 in order to inform the selection of variables for inclusion in the study.\n\nA total of 412 institutions are included in the study \u2013 all of which had an above-average difference between their lowest and highest peer assessment rating between 1999 and 2007. These are the institutions that have experienced noteworthy change over time in the reputation (peer assessment) ratings, and they are the schools which motivate this study. Three separate, but similar, analyses are conducted \u2013 one for the entire group of 412 schools, and one for each of the two largest groups of schools represented in the study (master\u2019s universities and comprehensive colleges).\n\nPrincipal components analyses and ordinary least squares regression analyses are both used in order to reduce the variable space. The predictor variables fall under one of five theoretical constructs \u2013 size, finances, selectivity, faculty, and student outcomes. In all three analyses, variables representing three of the five theoretical constructs remain significant over time in predicting changes to peer assessment ratings. The most powerful predictor is student selectivity, measured via the percent of students in the Top 25 percent of their high school class. Six-year graduation rate is the student outcomes variable that remains significant over time. Faculty productivity, as measured by publications per full-time faculty, also remains significant in relating to changes in reputation scores, albeit the relationship is a weak one.\n\nThe results of the study partly confirm many prior studies which found student selectivity to relate to reputation ratings for a one-year period. However, institutional size, the other variable that many studies found to relate to reputation, does not remain significant in explaining changes over time to reputation scores. Institutions simply do not change enough over time in their size to precipitate change in reputation.\n\nWhether changes to student selectivity should relate to changes in reputation depends on how one defines excellence in education. While it is true that students educate students (the concept of peer effects), which would suggest that incoming student characteristics are critical, it is also the case that a student has many diverse experiences both in and out of class during the college years which all sum to the overall student experience. How good any given institution is may differ for each student, and educational excellence may add up to several components and experiences beyond one number. However, in the absence of any agreed-upon measures of student learning or student outcomes, an institution\u2019s reputation just might be the best measure of excellence a prospective buyer has available.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3595], "author_name_tesi": "Sweitzer, Kyle ", "last_name_ssi": "Sweitzer", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Fredericks Volkwein", "Roger Lewis Geiger", "Patrick T Terenzini", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Fredericks Volkwein, Committee Chair", "Roger Lewis Geiger, Committee Member", "Patrick T Terenzini, Committee Member", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["college prestige", "US News", "College rankings", "multilevel modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Professional Identity Development Among Business Doctoral Students: A Social Networks Perspective", "id": "7609", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6407", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explored longitudinally how the friendship, advice, and developmental support provided by peers, faculty, family, friends, and business associates facilitated doctoral students\u2019 early professional identity development leading to persistence to degree or eventual withdrawal in a business doctoral degree program. The case study involved 12 doctoral students enrolled in five business disciplines at a top ranked research university and business college.\nThis research was grounded in four key theories: mentoring, social network, role, and professional identity. Major concepts explored in this study included students\u2019 individual characteristics, their developmental networks and interactions with network partners, the role socialization process and the learning the occurs as a doctoral student, research assistant, and teacher, and how students begin to identify or disidentify with these roles as important to professional identity development and eventual persistence or withdrawal. The study proposes relationships among these concepts and explores students\u2019 changes and development over time. The research question that guided this study is: How does the friendship, advice, and developmental support provided by peers, faculty, family and friends, and business associates facilitate doctoral students\u2019 professional identity development and eventual persistence or withdrawal in doctoral degree programs?\n Data collection included interviews with the focal doctoral students, their self-identified network partners, and other Valley faculty and administrators, direct observations of college-wide orientations, and content analysis of Valley documents. A series of three interviews were conducted throughout the first year of study (September 2005, January 2006, May 2006) to capture students\u2019 development and changes throughout the first year. Each student interview elicited information regarding students\u2019 goals, definitions of success, their personal relationships, the expectations communicated to students by those relationships, and how they identified with the roles of doctoral student, research assistant, and teacher. In the final interview, students were asked to discuss how the first-year experience served as a preview of the faculty career. Network partner interviews were conducted during the Spring, 2006 semester and were used as an opportunity to assess consistency (or inconsistency) in students\u2019 and network partners\u2019 perceptions, as well as to learn more about the Valley culture. \nBecause the study was longitudinal, data analysis was an on-going process. Individual write-ups were created for each student at each interview time that served as stand alone entities (Eisenhardt, 1989). Included in each student write-up were data from corresponding network partner interviews and drawings of students\u2019 developmental networks. Interviews were analyzed to assess changes in students\u2019 developmental networks, perceptions of network partner expectations, and early professional identify developmental in the roles of doctoral student, research assistant, and teacher. \nThe doctoral students differed in terms of their developmental networks (i.e., the network partners they chose to identify as important to first-year success). These differences in developmental networks were associated with variations in support provided to students; expectations communicated by network partners; socialization in the roles of doctoral student, research assistant, and teacher; and students\u2019 resulting conceptions of the faculty career. Two overall groups of students emerged based on these differences: Perceiving Fit and Assessing Fit. Fit, for the purposes of this study, is defined as congruence between students\u2019 goals for performance, placement, and weighting of academic roles with Valley\u2019s goals for student performance, placement, and weighting of academic roles. I developed two models of doctoral student professional identity development (Perceiving Fit - Figure 8-1; Assessing Fit - Figure 8-2) which posit that the process by which most doctoral students begin to develop professional identities as future faculty members is explained, in part, by their susceptibility to socialization, individual differences such as learning orientation and, by the relationships they develop and maintain during their doctoral education experiences.\nI propose working propositions and future research related to the five key findings from the study: socialization susceptibility, emotional support, goal orientation, role prioritization and fit, and professional identity development. I also include practical implications which include the need for doctoral programs to create policies at the college and program levels to monitor student progress throughout all stages of the doctoral student experience, the need for doctoral programs to acknowledge work-personal balance issues by incorporating family relationships into the academic community, and recommend that doctoral programs create formal developmental networks for all students. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6406], "author_name_tesi": "Sweitzer, Vicki Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Sweitzer", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Vicki", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carol L Colbeck", "Lisa R Lattuca", "Robert D Reason", "James R Detert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carol L Colbeck, Committee Chair", "Lisa R Lattuca, Committee Member", "Robert D Reason, Committee Member", "James R Detert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["doctoral education", "social networks", "professional identity", "preparing future faculty"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "X-ray, Ultraviolet, and Optical Flares in Gamma-ray Burst Light Curves", "id": "22447", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10210", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the surprising results of the NASA Swift mission was the discovery of large numbers of flares in gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves. Though they had previously been seen, the Swift data showed that flares appear in approximately 50% of X-ray GRB light curves. Many of these flares are very large and energetic, and a number of studies have been performed analyzing the properties of the observed X-ray flares. Flares in the UV and optical wavelengths have not received the same attention due to the flares being smaller and more difficult to identify in the UV/optical. This dissertation presents a new algorithm for detecting flares which we employ on the data from the Second UVOT GRB Catalog, finding 119 flaring periods, most of which are previously unreported. We also present our analysis of the Swift X-ray data from 2005 January through 2012 December, where we find 498 flaring periods, many representing weaker flares that have not been included in previous studies. Our analysis of these two catalogs shows that the our previous understanding and assumptions about flare properties were very limited, particularly in terms of flare duration, with many of our newly identified flares exhibiting durations of \u2206t/t > 1. Our correlation studies between the UV/optical and X-ray flares shows that X-ray flares are generally larger, both in terms of duration and flux, than their lower energy counterparts and we discuss possible reasons for this trend. We further discuss whether the emission mechanism causing the observed X-ray and UV/optical flares is the same, and contrast the potentially correlated X-ray and UV/optical flares with flares that have no observed counterpart. The broad range of flare properties observed and the number of UV/optical flares observed without X-ray counterparts lead us to believe that the generally assumed internal shock mechanism may not be correct for all GRB flares and that further theoretical work is needed to explain the observed flare parameters.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9897], "author_name_tesi": "Swenson, Craig Arnel", "last_name_ssi": "Swenson", "middle_name_ssi": "Arnel", "first_name_ssi": "Craig", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pete Roming", "John Andrew Nousek", "Eric D Feigelson", "Derek Brindley Fox", "Stephane Coutu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pete Roming, Dissertation Advisor", "John Andrew Nousek, Committee Chair", "Eric D Feigelson, Committee Member", "Derek Brindley Fox, Committee Member", "Stephane Coutu, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["astronomy", "astrophysics", "GRB", "gamma-ray burst", "Swift", "bayesian"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Using discrete-event simulation to improve patient flow in an emergency department\n\n", "id": "8238", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1849", "abstract_tesi": "U.S. hospital emergency departments are experiencing a crisis:  overall capacity is decreasing while patient demands are increasing (IOM, 2007).

Recognizing a need to reform, the U.S. passed the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) authorizing a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation whose mission includes the development of new payment models that transform the nation from volume- to value-based care.  In total joint arthroplasty (TJA), the most common and costly service covered by Medicare, the transformation is manifested in the comprehensive care for joint replacement (CJR).  The CJR is a bundled payment initiative that holds hospitals financially accountable for a patient\u2019s outcome over a 90 episode of care.  Because hospital reimbursement is tied to the total cost of care delivered by multiple independent care providers, hospitals are incentivized to take an active role in coordinating care through the episode to ensure a quality health outcome.  The CJR necessitates a new approach to how hospitals manage joint patients from the pre-operative through the post-operative phase of care.      \nThe overall objective of this research is to investigate how a healthcare market segmentation methodology can be implemented by any hospital subject to the CJR to improve healthcare value.  The methodology applies machine learning, regression, and process improvement methods, and the analysis behind the methodology uses latent data stored in hospital electronic health records (EHRs).  This new methodology has five pillars and addresses four separate but related questions:  1) how can data mining and market segmentation be used to identify unique and distinguishable patient segments (clusters), 2) how do hospitals accurately classify prospective TJA patients such that their assigned segment provides useful information for clinicians or other health professionals, 3) how can clinicians identify cost drivers in TJA that are tied to a patient\u2019s cluster, their attributes, or other clinical factors, and 4) how do hospitals identify patient outcome drivers.   Using operations research to build a methodology around these four questions will help hospitals adapt to the current transformation in healthcare payment models.      \nThe main body of this dissertation is divided into three sections:  1) clustering and classification of patients, 2) identifying cost and outcome drivers, and 3) assessing interventions that reduce costs and improve healthcare value.  In Chapter 3, clustering and classification models applied to EHR data divide a healthcare population into smaller segments for which health interventions can be applied.  In Chapter 4, patient segments along with attributes such as gender, procedure code, and comorbidity burden are shown to be predictors of 30 and 90 day readmission and increased supply costs.  Additionally, Chapter 4 highlights the impact that a small group of patients with complex bony or ligamentous deformities or infection risk have on a hospital under a value-based payment model.  If not managed, this small subset of patients is shown to consume a disproportionate share of the overall implant budget for a hospital.  In Chapter 5, two interventions are studied.  A rapid recovery protocol focused on individual patients is shown to significantly improve length of stay and discharge to home rate while not impacting readmission rates.  Finally, applying a clustering model using attributes related to cost and outcome drivers helps identify a small but high cost segment of the TJA population.  A new approach to managing these high cost patients is introduced and modeled using simulation with significant cost savings.  This dissertation provides a road-map for hospitals seeking to improve healthcare value under value-based payment models.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14381], "author_name_tesi": "Swenson, Eric R", "last_name_ssi": "Swenson", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harriet B.

Within the TiO2 layer photoinjected electrons are transported to a transparent conductor back contact and from there to a dark cathode to reduce protons to molecular hydrogen. WS-DSPECs offer several advantages for alternative solar fuels systems: the use of low-cost materials, tunable molecular sensitizers, and relaxed catalytic turnover requirements to name a few. Despite these advantageous features, power conversion efficiencies in WS-DSPECs are generally low.  Broadly, this thesis explores the fundamental electron transfer processes that control the efficiency of these cells.  \n\tChapter 1 presents a survey of the previous literature and individually considers each component of a WS-DSPEC (water oxidation catalyst, sensitizers, electrode materials, redox mediators, and overall system design). Chapter 2 presents a novel method of preparing a WS-DSPEC that utilizes crystalline IrO2 nanoparticles directly sintered to TiO2 as a water oxidation catalyst and describes a previously unknown electron-scavenging pathway by IrO2.  Chapter 3 explores how electron trapping by and proton intercalation into TiO2 controls the photoelectrochemical performance of WS-DSPECs.  Chapter 4 characterizes how electron recombination with the oxidized sensitizer and electron scavenging by the IrO2 catalyst combine to limit the concentration of conduction band electrons and by extension photocurrent in WS-DSPECs.  Chapter 5 demonstrates the use of the first totally organic sensitizers for light driven water-splitting and explores how the molecular and electronic structure of a sensitizer affects the electron transfer steps of injection, recombination, and hole transfer among others.  Finally, in Chapter 6 a model system that describes electron transfer between an oxidized sensitizer and water oxidation catalyst is demonstrated and provides insight into sensitizer regeneration in WS-DSPECs.  Together the results in these chapters present a detailed picture of how electron scavenging, recombination, and transport combine to generate photocurrent in a fully characterized WS-DSPEC and serve as starting point for the further development of WS-DSPECs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9568], "author_name_tesi": "Swierk, John R", "last_name_ssi": "Swierk", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk", "Thomas E Mallouk", "John B Asbury", "Benjamin James Lear", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Chair", "John B Asbury, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Photoelectrochemical", "Water oxidation", "catalysis", "water-splitting", "TiO2"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Mate choice and competition in the eastern fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus", "id": "21786", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9726", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sexual selection exerts a strong influence on the evolution of phenotypes across taxa. In animals, sexual selection is largely driven by competitive social interactions among individuals of the same sex (often male) for access to the opposite sex (female). Because some traits, such as weaponry or courtship behavior, enhance an individual\u2019s ability to outcompete rivals and attract mates, elaborate phenotypic traits are often selected via mate competition. My dissertation addresses the underlying processes of trait evolution via sexual selection by examining how phenotype affects the outcome of intra- and inter-sexual mating competition. \n\nHere, I present results from inter- and intra-sexual competition studies of eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus)\u2014 a polygamous, territorial species that uses a suite of phenotypic signals and cues in mating competition. Notably, fence lizards perform dramatic physical displays when courting and defending resources, and males bear vibrant blue throat and abdominal badges used in sexual signaling. I examined if female fence lizards used multiple cues and signals (behavioral and morphological) when selecting mates, and found that females not only assess multiple traits, but also weight some male traits more heavily than others in their decision-making. Territory quality is known to have a role in female decision-making, but is rarely controlled when assessing female choice of mates. My results reveal that female choice may directly influence the evolution of male traits, rather than only indirectly selecting for male traits implicated in territory maintenance. I next examined the determinants of male behavior in male-male contests for mate access, to identify how a male\u2019s phenotype, his competitor\u2019s phenotype, and the value of the contested resource (female quality) influenced male competitive tactics. I found that male fence lizards observe rival behavior and respond with finely-tuned signals based on their own quality relative to that of their rival. I also examined whether males exerted mate choice on female traits, by allowing males to choose between two females and found that males discriminate between mates based not only on female body condition, but also on female behavior: males preferred females that performed receptive sexual behaviors. Finally, I tested whether sexual conflict was evident in the production of blue ventral badges in fence lizards \u2013 some females bear rudimentary badges that appear to be merely a byproduct of strong selection for badges in males. My results provide evidence of a tug-of-war in optimal phenotype: males benefited from badges, but rudimentary male-typical badges in females correlated with lower reproductive output and male rejection of females as mates. Together, the results of my dissertation research highlight the role of morphology and behavior on individual fitness via their effects on the outcome of mating competition, and expand our understanding of the processes by which social interactions shape the evolution of phenotypes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9481], "author_name_tesi": "Swierk, Lindsey Noele", "last_name_ssi": "Swierk", "middle_name_ssi": "Noele", "first_name_ssi": "Lindsey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Victoria Braithwaite", "David Peter Hughes", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tracy Lee Langkilde, Dissertation Advisor", "Victoria Braithwaite, Committee Member", "David Peter Hughes, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["behavior", "competition", "courtship", "eastern fence lizard", "mating", "reproduction", "Sceloporus undulatus"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Paul Gauguin and Spirituality\n", "id": "10734", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5729", "abstract_tesi": "My thesis on Paul Gauguin offers a more comprehensive study of his paintings\u2019 relationships to Christianity, Buddhism, Sufism, and Tahitian religion.

The STF comprises parallel and identical nanocolumns of a certain shape sculptured by substrate motion.  Substrate rotation produces chiral STFs whose nanocolumns are helical. Chiral STFs produced by serial bideposition, which either actually or effectively involves two vapor fluxes, possess large local linear birefringence and evince highly intense optical activity, both of which properties are attractive for optical sensor, filter, and display technologies. Specifically, chiral STFs exhibit the circular Bragg phenomenon for normally incident light: in a certain spectral regime, either left- or right-circularly polarized light is preferentially reflected.\n\nTheoretical modeling has shown that if the substrate is rocked, in addition to rotation, the circular Bragg phenomenon is suppressed, even though the deposited thin film should still have a chiral morphology. Instead, an ordinary Bragg phenomenon is exhibited which is insensitive to the polarization state of the incident light. Therefore, an ordinary Bragg filter can be made with just one material, instead of as a quarter-wave stack that requires the deposition of two materials.\n\nFor this work, ZnSe chiral STFs were fabricated with/without substrate rocking, and their transmittance spectrums for linear- and circular-polarized incident light were measured.  During fabrication, a collimated vapor flux was directed at a vapor flux angle of either 20\u00b0 or 25\u00b0 with respect to the substrate plane, which was rotated at 0.5 rpm in a low-pressure vacuum chamber at a base pressure of 1.5   10-5 Torr. At the same time, the substrate was rocked with an amplitude of 5\u00b0, 10\u00b0, 15\u00b0, or 20\u00b0 depending on the initial starting value of vapor flux angle. The rocking period and the rotation period were identical. All chiral STFs produced were 9-periods thick, with the spatial period being 330 nm. With sufficient rocking amplitude, the discrimination between left- and right-circularly polarized (RCP and LCP) light nearly vanished, whereas similar Bragg phenomenons for s- and p-polarized light were observed. Thus, chiral STF technology can be used to produce both ordinary and CP Bragg filters.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7247], "author_name_tesi": "Swiontek, Stephen Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Swiontek", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Stephen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Akhlesh Lakhtakia", "Jian Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Thesis Advisor", "Jian Xu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sculptured thin films", "ZnSe", "circular Bragg phenomenon", "PVD"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Optical Sensing of Analytes in Aqueous Solutions Through Surface Plasmonics and Surface Multiplasmonics", "id": "28754", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12318", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Electromagnetic surface waves (ESWs) straddle the boundary of two dissimilar materials. Those two materials may be as voluminous as the earth and its surrounding atmosphere or as small as two thin films on the order of tens-of-nanometers thick. Of the variety of ESWs that exist, the surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) wave has garnered the most attention for its use in optical sensing of chemical, biological, and biochemical analytes due to its high sensitivity and ease of implementation in academic and industrial settings.\n\nThe SPP wave can be guided by the interface of two thin films of which one is\na metal and the other is a dielectric material. Both of those materials are generally taken to be isotropic and homogeneous. The Turbadar\u2013Kretschmann\u2013Raether (TKR) prism-coupled configuration is commonly used to study the excitation of SPP-wave modes and to employ those modes in optical-sensing experiments. In the TKR configuration, which is easily implementable in a laboratory setting, a linear plane wave of monochromatic light is made incident onto a chip comprising a substrate/metal/dielectric structure, while the intensity of the reflected light is measured and plotted as a function of the angle of incidence. A photodetector is used to measure the intensity of the reflected light in one form of the TKR configuration. In another form, a CCD camera is used to image the reflected light, and that form is called surface plasmonic-resonance imaging (SPRI). Any perturbation along the interface of those two materials will shift the angle of incidence required to excite the SPP-wave mode in reflectance graphs, thus demonstrating optical sensing. Only one SPP-wave mode can be excited when those two materials are isotropic and homogeneous, which severely limits these optical sensors.\n\nMultiple SPP-wave modes can be excited when a periodically non-homogeneous thin film, exemplified by a dielectric chiral sculptured thin film (STF), partners a metal thin film in a chip. The angular locations of those SPP-wave modes on graphs of measured reflectance versus angle of incidence were found to shift when the void regions of the chiral STF were infiltrated with a fluid whose refractive index is greater than of air, thereby permitting optical sensing through surface multiplasmonics. The availability of more than one SPP-wave mode can allow multianalyte sensing, which is otherwise unavailable in single-plasmonic chips. Moreover, if a silver-nanoparticle layer is inserted in the substrate/metal/chiral-STF chip and implemented in the TKR configuration for SPRI experiments, multiple analytes can be simultaneously sensed through surface multiplasmonic resonance imaging (SMPRI). That silver-nanoparticle layer can be eventually functionalized as a site for recognition molecules to bind to analytes of a certain kind, thereby imparting\nspecificity.\n\nIt was found that: (i) a substrate/metal/columnar-thin-film (CTF) chip can\nguide a single SPP-wave mode, and the SPP-wave mode will shift when the void regions of the CTF are infiltrated with a fluid, thereby demonstrating optical sensing via anisotropic surface plasmonics; (ii) a substrate/metal/chiral-STF chip can guide multiple SPP-wave modes, and those SPP-wave modes will shift when the void regions of the chiral STF are infiltrated with a fluid, thereby demonstrating optical sensing of analytes vis surface multiplamonics; (iii) a substrate/metal/chiral-STF/silver/chiral-STF chip can guide multiple SPP-wave modes, and those SPP-wave modes will shift when the void regions of the chiral STF are infiltrated with a fluid, thereby demonstrating optical sensing of analytes via SMPRI; and (iv) a spatially multiplexed substrate/metal/chiral-STF/silver/chiral-STF chip can be\npartitioned into quadrants in which each quadrant acts as a single sensor so that four different refractive-index liquids can be simultaneously sensed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11696], "author_name_tesi": "Swiontek, Stephen Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Swiontek", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Stephen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Akhlesh Lakhtakia", "Zhiwen Liu", "Osama O Awadelkarim", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Dissertation Advisor", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Chair", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sculptured thin films", "surface plasmon polariton", "optical sensing", "Kretschmann configuration", "surface multiplasmonics"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Beyond Euthenics:  Home Economics and the Reinvention of the American House, 1893-1939", "id": "27237", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12173", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the role played by the academic discipline of Home Economics in shaping American house design in the first few decades of the twentieth century.

Whereas the house, as understood and experienced by most Americans, exhibits the ostensibly conflicting traits of traditionalism and modernism, historicism and technical innovation, Home Economics instructors sought to inspire their female students to improve the functional aspects of the home with scientific theories and techniques while, at the same time, reminding them that their natural sphere of influence was confined to its walls.  Beginning with the Lake Placid Conference in 1899, domestic scientists encouraged women to reevaluate the home as not only a space of comfort and repose but as a workspace badly in need of reform.  The efforts toward that reform ranged well beyond the classroom, sparking a cultural phenomenon; its impact was felt in every aspect of American culture, from rural Extension Services to popular magazines, from corporate marketing strategies to Herbert Hoover\u2019s Commerce department.

Specimens were fractured utilizing a dynamic fatigue approach (constant stressing rate) to calculate a stress corrosion resistance parameter.  Analysis of the stress corrosion parameter, variations in loading trends and fracture strengths were correlated to microstructural features of the fracture surfaces and starting material characterization.  Evidence for slow crack growth mechanisms has been identified and strategies for future investigations and microstructure modifications have been suggested.  \n\nThe titanium diboride specimens were tested in molten aluminum at 970\u00b0C, argon atmosphere at 970\u00b0C, air atmosphere at 970\u00b0C and air atmosphere at 25\u00b0C.  Stressing rates ranged from 0.2 to 900 MPa/s.  The fracture stresses of the specimens tested in molten aluminum at 970\u00b0C ranged from 55 to 490 MPa and have low N-values indicating high susceptibility to stress corrosion.

The fracture stresses of specimens which had been pre-exposed to kerosene (for density analysis) prior to mechanical testing in molten aluminum at 970\u00b0C ranged from 180 to 360 MPa and had a negative N-value suggesting a mechanism other than stress corrosion may be operative.  Intergranular fracture mode was observed in the aluminum penetrated samples, while transgranular fractured mode was observed in samples fractures in non aluminum environments.\n\nIncreased exposure time in molten aluminum resulted in increased migration of aluminum along the grain boundaries and significantly decreased the fracture strength of the material.  The fracture strength further decreased when specimens were tested perpendicular to hot pressing direction as compared to tested normal to the hot pressing direction.  The occurrence of TiC precipitates was observed to potentially influence crack propagation at low stressing rates.

ATPases Associated with various cellular Activities (AAA+ ATPases) are ubiquitous and abundant in all kingdoms of life, where they convert ATP binding and hydrolysis energy into various forms of mechanical work to reshape other macromolecules. Dysfunctions in AAA+ ATPases lead to numerous human diseases, and many of these proteins are crucial to the functioning of pathogenic bacteria. Despite the great variety, number, and importance of the AAA+ ATPases, there is not enough structural information available to understand the mechanism of the AAA+ ATPase work cycle. \nAn AAA+ ATPase is required to start transcription by sigma54-RNA polymerase in bacteria. This sigma54-dependent transcription activator changes the conformation of the sigma54-holoenzyme by an unknown mechanism, leading to melting of the promoter DNA duplex and thus transcription initiation. \nIn this work modern methods of structural biology were applied to study the NtrC1 ATPase \u2013 a sigma54 activator from the extreme thermophile Aquifex aeolicus. Prior electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies showed that upon activation NtrC1 forms homo-heptamers that undergo large-scale conformational changes upon ATP binding. As a result the conserved stem loops that interact with the sigma54-holoenzyme are exposed from the NtrC1 surface. \nThe present study continues to concentrate on the structural changes within the AAA+ activator upon its binding to nucleotide. This study presents two new states of the NtrC1 AAA+ ATPase ensemble at resolutions of 2.8 and 3.6 Angstroms. It was further shown that consecutive nucleotide binding events cause a series of large-scale conformational changes in the NtrC1 oligomer. Applying a novel time-resolved SAXS approach revealed how the conformational changes develop in time. These results showed that intersubunit interactions within the homo-oligomeric ring-shaped ATPase cause strong cooperativity for nucleotide binding and complex conformational shifts. These changes lead to asymmetry and alter subunit stoichiometry in the NtrC1 AAA+ ATPase ring. Based on these results, a sequential mechanism of ATP hydrolysis was proposed for the work cycle of the NtrC1 ATPase.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6116], "author_name_tesi": "Sysoeva, Tatyana A", "last_name_ssi": "Sysoeva", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Tatyana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["B Tracy Nixon", "B Tracy Nixon", "Kathleen Postle", "Ming Tien", "Hemant P Yennawar", "Howard M Salis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["B Tracy Nixon, Dissertation Advisor", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Chair", "Kathleen Postle, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Hemant P Yennawar, Committee Member", "Howard M Salis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sigma54-dependent transcription", "transcription activator", "SAXS", "NtrC1", "AAA+ ATPase", "protein motor"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Acting on Behalf of Others: The Developmental Underpinnings of Social Responsibility in Adolescence\n\n", "id": "10889", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "183", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The cascade of changes that occur in young people\u2019s social and cognitive development during adolescence allows them to engage in more sophisticated and other-oriented thinking than when they were children.

In particular, these studies explore adolescents\u2019 feelings of responsibility for others in the context of tobacco and drug use by peers. A multi-method person-oriented research design was used to assess intraindividual change and interindividual differences. Study 1 presented 790 adolescents with vignettes about a friend who begins smoking cigarettes or using drugs and asked how likely they would be to respond using different strategies. Latent transition analysis revealed four adolescent profiles based on the likelihood of seeking adult help, talking to the friend, ending the relationship with the user, and ignoring the situation. There were significant changes from early to late adolescence with fewer youth estimated to fit into profiles that involved ending the relationship or intervening with age. Adolescents who were female, valued social responsibility, understood the risks of and refrained from substance use, and felt that substance use was not simply the individual user\u2019s business were more likely to endorse intervening on behalf of a friend. Using a qualitative approach, Study 2 examined how adolescents reason about marijuana use and whether their reasoning changes when the risks extend beyond the self. A textual analysis of written responses to four open-ended questions provided by 1,127 adolescents revealed that while most young people disagree with a peer using marijuana and offering it to others, they use a broad range of reasoning to justify their opinions and these justifications vary systematically with age and whether other people could be harmed.

Its structural complexity rivals that of proteins and, in some instances, gives rise to catalytic activity.  The process by which an RNA molecule folds into a functional structure and the forces that underlie RNA catalysis are still not fully understood.  The objectives of this thesis were to gain a deeper understanding of the roles of metal ions and nucleobases in RNA catalysis, and the folding mechanisms of RNA in vitro and in vivo using the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme as a model system.  \nExperiments were performed to probe the nature of the divalent metal ion sites in the ribozyme and any specificity for Mg2+.  Kinetics and thermal unfolding data support the existence of two different classes of metal ion sites in the ribozyme: a structural site that is inner sphere with a major electrostatic component and a preference for Mg2+, and a weak catalytic site that is outer sphere with little preference for a particular divalent metal ion.  \nA number of experiments focused on determining the roles of nucleobases in the ribozyme.  Sequence comparisons, free energy minimization, and kinetics data indicate that a base pair located at the active site does not need to be a wobble pair, as was previously suggested, and provides a structural role in catalysis.  Kinetic solvent isotope effect data and proton inventories are consistent with a catalytic mechanism in which a particular cytosine residue serves as a general acid catalyst.  Further efforts to understand the catalytic mechanism were made using single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (SM FRET).  A ribozyme construct was designed and prepared, and ensemble and single molecule measurements revealed that ribozyme activity occurs under a variety of conditions.  In addition, SM FRET experiments showed that the ribozyme construct gives rise to a range of FRET efficiencies.  Efforts were made to determine the molecular origins of these values.  In particular, ribozyme mutants were rationally designed to influence the conformational dynamics of the system so that FRET efficiencies could be assigned to specific ribozyme structures.\nThe folding of the HDV ribozyme was assayed using standard in vitro assays in which full length transcripts are renatured by heating and cooling and self cleavage activity is initiated by addition of Mg2+, and in vivo like cotranscriptional assays in which self cleavage activity is monitored as the RNA is synthesized.  Differences in the results obtained by the two methods are discussed and a model is presented for how wild type ribozyme sequence and flanking sequence work in concert to promote efficient self cleavage during transcription.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [210], "author_name_tesi": "Szakal, Andrea ", "last_name_ssi": "Szakal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Andrea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sharon Hammes Schiffer", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "Philip C.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the mechanisms that allowed velocity fluctuations to cause fluctuations in the rate of heat release in a gas turbine combustor experiencing combustion instability. Controlled velocity fluctuations were introduced to the combustor by a rotating siren device which periodically allowed the air-natural gas mixture to flow. The velocity fluctuation entering the combustor was measured using the two-microphone method. The resulting heat release rate fluctuation was measured using CH* chemiluminescence.\n\tThe global response of the flame was quantified using the flame transfer function with the velocity fluctuation as the input and the heat release rate fluctuation as the output. Velocity fluctuation amplitude was initially maintained at 5% of the inlet velocity in order to remain in the linear response regime. Flame transfer function measurements were acquired at a wide range of operating conditions and forcing frequencies. The selected range corresponds to the conditions and instability frequencies typical of real gas turbine combustors. Multi-nozzle flame transfer functions were found to bear a qualitative similarity to the single-nozzle flame transfer functions in the literature. The flame transfer function gain exhibited alternating minima and maxima while the phase decreased linearly with increasing forcing frequency. Several normalization techniques were applied to all flame transfer function data in an attempt to collapse the data into a single curve. The best collapse was found to occur using a Strouhal number which was the ratio of the characteristic flame length to the wavelength of the forced disturbance. Critical values of Strouhal number are used to predict the shedding of vortical structures in shear layers. Because of the collapse observed when the flame transfer functions are plotted versus Strouhal number, vortical structures are thought to have a strong influence on the response of this multi-nozzle configuration.\n\tThe structure of heat release rate fluctuations throughout the flame is analyzed using CH* chemiluminescence acquired with a high speed camera. Flames with a similar level of flame transfer function gain are found to exhibit similarity in the spatial distribution of their heat release rate fluctuations, regardless of the operating condition. Flames with high gain are found to have high amplitude fluctuations near the downstream end of the flame, with weak fluctuations near the flame base. The phase of the downstream fluctuations changes minimally across the downstream region, indicating that they occur in-phase. Flames with low gain exhibit stronger fluctuations near the flame base, but weak fluctuations in the downstream region. The phase of the fluctuations near the flame base changes continuously along the flame axis, indicating that parts of the flame will fluctuate out-of-phase. Accordingly, from a global perspective, destructive interference between heat release rate fluctuations in different parts of the flame can be expected. The behavior observed in the flame is ascribed to the interaction of acoustic velocity fluctuations, vortical disturbances and swirl fluctuations.\n\tThe response of the multi-nozzle flame to high amplitude velocity fluctuations was tested for a single operating condition. Based on the global flame response, most frequencies responded linearly over the tested range of amplitudes. Nonlinear effects were found to occur at three frequencies. The behaviors observed at these frequencies matched those observed in the literature and included flame response saturation and mode triggering.  For conditions which responded linearly at all amplitudes, the structure of heat release rate fluctuations was found to remain nearly constant. For conditions with nonlinear behavior, the structure of the fluctuations was a function of the forcing amplitude, particularly in the downstream region. \n\tThe behavior of the multi-nozzle flame was compared directly to that of a single-nozzle flame of the same nozzle design. The multi-nozzle characteristic flame length was found to be on average 10% longer than for the single-nozzle flame. The flame transfer functions from the two cases were found to exhibit qualitative similarity, where the frequencies at which the extrema occur are similar. The actual value of gain for the same operating condition and frequency does, however, vary by more than a factor of two in some cases. The phase value can also vary by as much as \u03c0 radians. These differences indicate that single-nozzle flame transfer functions should not be used directly to predict the instability driving force of real gas turbine combustors.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8793], "author_name_tesi": "Szedlmayer, Michael Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Szedlmayer", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Richard A Yetter", "Horatio Perez Blanco", "Cengiz Camci", "Gary Stuart Settles"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca, Dissertation Advisor", "Domenic Adam Santavicca, Committee Chair", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Horatio Perez Blanco, Committee Member", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Member", "Gary Stuart Settles, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["combustion instability", "natural gas turbine", "acoustics", "thermodynamics", "vortex formation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "High Yield Synthesis and Processing of Nanoscale YTZP Ceramics\n\n", "id": "10891", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1022", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-01-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nanomaterials are the subject of increasing interest.  The expectation of new and enhanced mechanical, optical, magnetic, and electronic properties, in part due to the high concentration of interfaces and grain boundaries within the nanoscale microstructure, has initiated many studies on how to synthesize materials and process components with a final grain size below 100 nm.  Several obstacles have hindered the practical application of such materials.  Issues related to the production of sufficient quantities of powders composed of nanoparticles, the tendency of the nanoparticles to aggregate, the production of homogeneous green bodies, and avoiding grain growth during sintering have all been addressed with varying degrees of success.\n\tThe focus of this thesis research is to address several issues inherent to the processing of nanoscale particulates, specifically in yttria tetragonal stabilized zirconia polycrystalline (YTZP) materials, for the purpose of fabricating dense, bulk components with a nano-scale microstructure.  These issues include the synthesis of sufficient quantities of an appropriate material in a dispersed state, the formation of homogeneous green bodies of high green density, and design of sintering conditions that retain the fine-grain microstructure while allowing densification to near theoretical density.  \nA recently-developed hydrothermal precipitation procedure was chosen for the production of nano-YTZP because crystalline, 8-10 nm particles of zirconia or YTZP can be produced with a flexible composition and dispersed for further processing.  A wide range of characterization techniques are employed to verify particle size, phase, composition, and impurity content.  Material yields are increased to 100 g of zirconia or YTZP per liter of stock solution by increasing in the reagent concentrations.  Despite the increased ionic strength of the as-synthesized suspension, a laundering and dispersion procedure is described in which well-dispersed suspensions of up to 20wt% nano-YTZP are recovered.  DLVO theory (named for authors Derjagiun and Landau, Verwey and Overbeek) is applied to the zirconia-water system to characterize the dispersion behavior.  \nTwo green forming procedures are compared:  pressure filtration and dry powder compaction.  Homogeneous green bodies can be formed by pressure filtration; however, due to strong capillary forces that act within the nano-scale pore structure during drying, green bodies could not be recovered without cracks.  Two methods for the recovery of dry powder suitable for compaction are compared:  pan-drying and freeze-drying.  During pan-drying, primary particles tend to agglomerate; agglomerates are compressed into high-strength, low-density aggregates that negatively affect densification and final component properties.  During freeze-drying, the crystallization of water breaks apart agglomerates, primary particles are immobilized, and capillary forces are avoided.  Compaction behavior of pan- and freeze-dried powders is compared using a model that describes powder consolidation as a combination of activated and saturation processes.  \nFormation of a nanograin bulk component requires that grain growth during densification be minimized.  A two-step sintering procedure that accomplishes this is discussed, along with constant heating rate and (CHR) master sintering curve (MSC) models.  Sintering activation energies are calculated with these models and found to be slightly lower than previously reported values.  With the aid of the MSC, a two-step sintering procedure is presented that produces crack-free, bulk YTZP components of >95% theoretical density and grain sizes <100nm.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1012], "author_name_tesi": "Szepesi, Christopher Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Szepesi", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair", "David John Green", "Christopher L Muhlstein", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair, Committee Chair", "David John Green, Committee Member", "Christopher L Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nano-grain bulk ceramics", "yttria-doped zirconia", "YTZP", "synthesis", "green forming", "sintering"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire: Development and Validation\n", "id": "11188", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3752", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Worry and rumination are maladaptive repetitive thought processes that increase negative affect and disrupt cognitive functioning and adaptive problem solving ability, and are generally associated with anxiety and depression, respectively.  Their similarity has led to a debate about whether these types of thought are the same constructs associated with different disorders or whether they are differing constructs that may help to distinguish anxiety from depression.  Studies comparing these repetitive thought styles have used extant or modified instruments that capture different aspects of worry and rumination.  However, comparison studies rarely use equivalent measures when assessing worry and rumination, and it is not clear how respondents conceptualize these two repetitive thinking styles.  These issues influence hypotheses about the relationship between these constructs and incite disagreement over their distinguishable characteristics.  As advances in the field are likely to follow from more precise definitions of worry and rumination and their components, three studies are presented detailing the development and validation of the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ).  The PTQ is a 26-item self-report measure that assesses five shared and unique facets of worry and rumination, including General Repetitive Thought, Future Control, Understanding, Past-Focused Repetitive Thought, and Obsessive Thought.  The PTQ structure was validated using confirmatory factor analysis.  Furthermore, the PTQ and its subscales were positively associated with measures of anxiety, depression, stress, worry, rumination, obsessions, negative affectivity (e.g., neuroticism), and narcissistic vulnerability, and negatively associated with measures of positive affectivity, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.  Although both anxious and depressed individuals scored significantly higher on the PTQ and its subscales than nonanxious and nondepressed controls, anxious individuals were more likely to engage in repetitive thinking as measured by the PTQ than depressed individuals.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3732], "author_name_tesi": "Szkodny, Lauren Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Szkodny", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle Gayle Newman", "Michelle Gayle Newman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle Gayle Newman, Thesis Advisor", "Michelle Gayle Newman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire", "worry", "rumination"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "(DE)CONSTRUCTING TRAUMA: DEVELOPMENT OF IDIOSYNCRATIC STRUCTURAL AND DYNAMIC ORGANIZATIONS OF POSTTRAUMATIC SYMPTOMS TO EXAMINE MECHANISMS OF SYMPTOM MAINTENANCE", "id": "13506les233", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13506", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The dynamic nature of PTSD inherent in the interplay between trauma-related thoughts, emotions, sensations, and behavioral strategies is central to models of PTSD, which implicate avoidance of internal and external trauma-related stimuli in the maintenance of posttraumatic symptomatology.

The dissertation investigates how nineteenth-century theatrical adaptations significantly changed the politics espoused in their parent novels.

The National Science Foundation has supported interdisciplinarity for a number of years, through center programs and other initiatives. In the early 2000s, the National Institutes of Health made an explicit commitment to interdisciplinarity in the \u201cNIH Roadmap.\u201d At about the same time, strategic plans of research universities have increasingly emphasized interdisciplinary scholarship. Universities, however, ground their basic organizational frameworks in the nexus between disciplines and academic departments. Both external sponsorship and university leadership commitment to fostering interdisciplinarity therefore suggest the need to induce change in the way scientists work. These calls for change are not new, and some are skeptical regarding the likelihood that they might cause substantial change.\n\nThis dissertation explores the organizational reactions of universities to current interdisciplinary thrusts in science. Through document analysis, the organizational approaches utilized by research-intensive universities to implement interdisciplinary agendas were examined. These patterns include a move towards strategic university-wide initiatives, the creation of specialized scientific facilities to host interdisciplinary teams, a continuing interest in centrally-supported centers and institutes, and concerted administrative efforts to nurture collaborative research programs, including competitive seed grant programs. A minority of institutions have engendered changes in core university policies and functions, such as faculty hiring, and evaluation and tenure policies. Five case studies provide an in-depth examination of how and why universities implement organizational strategies to foster interdisciplinary research. The cases include institutions whose practices have gained visibility among peers and in the policy community. Going beyond normative arguments, this dissertation advances understanding of interdisciplinary science as an organizational phenomenon in higher education through the empirical investigation of emerging university models.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1076], "author_name_tesi": "S\u00e1, Creso Matutino", "last_name_ssi": "S\u00e1", "middle_name_ssi": "Matutino", "first_name_ssi": "Creso", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger Lewis Geiger", "Lisa R Lattuca", "David P Baker", "Michael John Dooris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger Lewis Geiger, Committee Chair", "Lisa R Lattuca, Committee Member", "David P Baker, Committee Member", "Michael John Dooris, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["organizational strategies", "interdisciplinary research"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Biochips Employing Microelectrodes and Microtransducers for Characterization and Permeabilization of Cell Membrane at the Whole-Cell and Cellular Level\n", "id": "11120", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4291", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this study, two types of biochips, Integrated Microelectrode Array (IMA) chip and Ultrasonic Micro\u2013Transducer Array (UMTA) biochip, were designed and micro\u2013fabricated.  The IMA chip employs cell\u2013size microelectrode array architecture in order to electrically characterize cellular components, especially the properties of cell membrane, at the single\u2013cell level.  The UMTA biochip consists of arrays of high\u2013aspect\u2013ratio piezoelectric micro\u2013transducers that are employed to efficiently permeabilize the cell membrane using ultrasound (i.e., sonoporation) at cellular level with high spatial specificity and resolution.  The device fabrication processes, which are tailored towards technology transfer to biochip industries, include laser lithography, proximity and contact photolithography, Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD), high\u2013frequency pulsed electroplating, Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and Plasma\u2013Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD), furnace annealing and surface passivation, Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) and Inductively\u2013Coupled Plasma (ICP) etching, chemical and mechanical planarization/polishing (CMP), and bottom\u2013up self\u2013assembled monolayer (SAM)\u2013based surface engineering approaches.\n\tIn demonstrating and testing the performance of these devices, firstly, the electrical characterizations of individual cells (mouse fibroblast (NIH3T3) cell line) were carried out using the IMA biochip integrated with phase\u2013sensitive lock\u2013in detection technique.  Bottom\u2013up SAM\u2013based surface engineering approaches were employed to immobilize individual NIH3T3 cells on the working microelectrodes of IMA biochip for the electrical characterizations.  The application\u2013specific models such as equivalent electrical circuits of cell\u2013electrode hetero\u2013structures were also developed and cellular properties such as cell membrane capacity, cell membrane resistivity, and average cell\u2013to\u2013substrate separation distance were estimated by numerically fitting the experimental data to the developed models.  The influence of cell adhesion and spreading, mediated by surface\u2013bound cell adhesion molecules (e.g., fibronectin) or short peptides (e.g., lysine\u2013arginine\u2013glycine\u2013aspartic acid), on the impedance characterizations and sensitivity of cell\u2013based sensors were investigated.  In addition, the significances and advantages of single\u2013cell\u2013level impedance measurements in terms of sensitivity in drug screening and toxicity assays were investigated by monitoring real\u2013time cellular changes in individual human glioblastoma (U87MG) cells, seeded on single\u2013cell microelectrodes, upon exposure to an ion channel inhibitor, chlorotoxin (CTX).  Results show that microelectrode array architecture combined with proper bioinstrumentations and theoretical models are capable of estimating cellular properties, especially the properties of cell membrane, at the single\u2013cell level as well as monitoring cellular responses to drugs or toxins with high sensitivity, rendering a huge potential of IMA chips in high\u2013throughput cell\u2013based sensing and assays at the single\u2013cell level.  \n\tSecondly, experiments were carried out to demonstrate the ultrasound\u2013induced site\u2013specific cell membrane permeabilization (or site\u2013specific sonoporation) at the cellular level using the UMTA biochip.  The site\u2013specific sonoporation was achieved by applying ultrasonic waves, generated by driving the micro\u2013transducer arrays with high\u2013frequency RF signal generator, onto the targeted cancer cells (human melanoma (LU1205) cell line) within the cell monolayer.  Water\u2013soluble Quantum Dots (QD) (carboxylic\u2013acid\u2013surface\u2013derivatized CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs) were employed as optical probes in order to track the diffusion and transport of nanoparticles across the cell membrane after sonoporation and analyses were carried out by fluorescence microscopy and image processing algorithms.  Results show that, above the threshold, moderate ultrasound radiation pressures generated by the micro\u2013transducer arrays can transiently permeabilize the cell membrane at the cellular level with high spatial specificity and resolution.  Furthermore, by comparing with the dynamics of endocytosis\u2013driven QD intake obtained via flow cytometry and time\u2013lapse fluorescence microscopy, the resulting sonoporation showed significant enhancement in the transport and uptake of water\u2013soluble QDs into the melanoma cells (by an QD\u2013uptake enhancement factor of >80) due to passive diffusion of QDs through membrane wounds.  Models representing ultrasound\u2013inflicted cell membrane wounds and mass transport of nanoparticles through wound openings were developed.  Model\u2013based analyses, supported with experimental findings, show that low and moderate acoustic radiation pressures generated from the micro\u2013transducer stress the plasma membrane of LU1205 cells and, above the threshold radiation pressure (~0.12MPa for LU1205 cells), large transient wounds are created in the membrane and are actively resealed.  The effective size of membrane wounds as well as the uptake of water\u2013soluble QDs were found to be linearly dependent on the ultrasonic pressure applied.  These results from site\u2013specific sonoporation show that not only does the UMTA biochips have huge potentials in transfection and gene therapy assays at the cellular level, they also render a promising future as sub\u2013systems in enhancing the delivery efficiency of drug screening and characterization platforms.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4264], "author_name_tesi": "THEIN, MYO MIN", "last_name_ssi": "THEIN", "middle_name_ssi": "MIN", "first_name_ssi": "MYO", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jian Xu", "Jian Xu", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Yinong Yang", "Sulin Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jian Xu, Dissertation Advisor", "Jian Xu, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Yinong Yang, Committee Member", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sonoporation", "microelectrode", "impedance", "cell membrane", "biochip", "transducer"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Social Play Activities on Promoting Social Interactions of High-Functioning Autistic Children in Taiwan", "id": "9388", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6870", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Social play activities mediated by peers with Pivotal Response Training (PRT) are interventions for enhancing high-functioning autistic children\u2019s social behavior.

Since the play sessions comprised the social interactions that occurred between each dyad, the data analysis focused on the occurrences and frequencies of the three targeted social behaviors. Two techniques, trend-line and percentage of overlap, were especially useful for the quantitative analysis.\nThe results of this study showed that the three high-functioning autistic children\u2019s social behaviors for maintaining interactions, initiating conversations, and initiating play were enhanced by the social play activities involving interactions with peers with PRT.

Flooding, and the stored liquid water content, has adverse performance effects on operations at normal operating conditions as well as during start-up at sub-zero temperatures. In this study, the liquid water distribution, storage and flooding mechanisms inside a PEFC were thoroughly investigated using neutron imaging. For the first time, the individual effects of flow field design, land|channel interface and flow channel surface properties on liquid accumulation and distribution were analyzed. The flooded and non-flooded conditions were determined and results were used to develop a novel liquid filling and transport mechanism that better reflects the actual observed operation characteristics. \n  In the first part of this work, the impact of flow field geometry on liquid storage and flooding was investigated through in-plane neutron imaging experiments performed on seven different flow field configurations with land|channel (L:C) ratios ranging from 1:3 to 2:1. The stored liquid amount in each configuration was analyzed and a preferred land/channel ratio is suggested in terms of obtaining minimal residual water content in the fuel cell. For the configurations having same L:C ratio, the number of land|channel interfaces was found to be have determining impact on liquid storage and flooding. The cell performance corresponding to each liquid storage value was also obtained for all configurations. The results revealed that at identical performance between two different cells, it is possible to significantly reduce the accumulated liquid water overhead by only tailoring the flow field design. This advance is important in terms of reducing the parasitic losses required to purge the liquid after shutdown, and eliminating degradation experienced under freeze/thaw conditions. \n  In the second part of this work, the impact of land|channel interface surface energy on through-plane liquid accumulation, distribution and transport was analyzed with the use of high-resolution neutron imaging. Neutron images were taken with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated and uncoated land|channel interface (flow channel walls). Anode to cathode liquid distribution was analyzed for each case at low and high current conditions over twenty minutes of operation. The form and amount of liquid water inside the channels and diffusion media (DM) were compared for hydrophobically coated channels and hydrophilic channels, and a primary liquid transport-flooding mechanism is suggested for each case. The location and value of maximum water storage in DM at low and high current operation were analyzed and slopes of water mass versus distance curve were calculated to compare the significance of capillary liquid flow and phase- change-induced flow within the diffusion media. A significant effect of CL|MPL and MPL|DM interfaces on liquid transport and flooding is found through the analysis of micro-porous layer (MPL) water content and saturation profile along the CL|MPL and MPL|DM interface region.\n  In the final part of this study, the nature of flooding and dry-out was investigated. In-plane neutron imaging was used to determine flooded, non-flooded and dry-out conditions in a PEFC and results were analyzed to identify the liquid mass responsible for the performance loss under flooding or dry-out. Results clearly indicate that common assumptions for liquid filling used in most computational studies are inadequate to represent the actual case. Based on the results, a modified liquid pore filling mechanism is suggested that is more appropriate.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [446], "author_name_tesi": "TURHAN, AHMET ", "last_name_ssi": "TURHAN", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "AHMET", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clinton Matthew Mench", "Matthew M Mench", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clinton Matthew Mench, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew M Mench, Committee Chair", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer electrolyte", "fuel cell", "neutron imaging", "liquid storage", "two phase flow", "flow field"]}]
