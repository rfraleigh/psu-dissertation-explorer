These networks consist of parties with different characteristics, goals, and interests. Although various practical systems have been  developed to enable effective communication between networked parties, the theoretical performance limits of such systems are yet to be understood. In this thesis, we study the social and semantic aspects of communication. Unlike conventional communication networks, this necessitates taking into account the semantic relationships between words and phrases as well as the personal background and characteristics of the communicating parties. In the first part of this thesis, we study a point-to-point communication scenario where a transmitter wishes to send a semantic message, a word that carries a meaning, through a noisy channel. In addition to the received signal from the noisy channel, the receiver also has access to some context information related to the message. An external agent, however, can influence the receiver by affecting the context observed by the decoder. We model this scenario as a game with incomplete information, i.e., a Bayesian game, and study the conditions under which a pure strategy Nash equilibrium exists. The communication scenario is then extended to a dynamic setup, where the transmitter and the receiver can take actions sequentially while forming and updating their beliefs. In the second part,  we consider communicating correlated sources over a multiple-access channel with a fidelity criterion. We show that if the encoders have access to some common observation conditioned on which the two sources are independent, then then separate source and channel coding is optimal if the common observation is to be recovered losslessly. We show that separation is also optimal if the encoders and the decoder has access to some side information conditioned on which the two sources are independent. Using the separation results developed, we provide a new set of necessary conditions for the transmissibility of correlated sources over a multiple access channel, and compare the new bound with the known bounds from the literature. The third part of this thesis studies two-party zero-error interactive communication for function computation, when one of the  communicating parties has partial information about the distribution of the sources. Three communication strategies are considered, indicating different levels for reconciling the missing distribution information. These strategies are termed perfect reconciliation, no reconciliation, and partial reconciliation. We provide sufficient conditions for when one strategy outperforms another, and show that partial reconciliation, i.e., reconciling the missing information up to a certain degree by leaving some ambiguity, can outperform both perfect reconciliation and no reconciliation. Next, we study compressing graph structures up to an isomorphism, and identify the relation between structural entropy and chromatic entropy. The last part is focused on influence propagation in a signed social network. By leveraging the positive and negative relations that exist between the parties in the social network, we identify the optimal propagation strategies for influencing a target node positively, while minimizing the propagation cost or the number of negatively influenced nodes.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15626], "author_name_tesi": "Guler, Basak ", "last_name_ssi": "Guler", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Basak", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aylin Yener", "Aylin Yener", "Vishal Monga", "David Jonathan Miller", "Wang-Chien Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aylin Yener, Dissertation Advisor", "Aylin Yener, Committee Chair", "Vishal Monga, Committee Member", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Member", "Wang-Chien Lee, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bayesian games", "joint source channel coding", "social networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Interference Management for Femtocell Networks", "id": "14480", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7242", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis proposes methods for applying the idea of Interference Alignment (IA) in femtocell networks. In the first method, in order to manage the uplink interference caused by macrocell users (MU) at the femtocell base stations (FBS), cooperation between macrocell users with the closest femtocell base stations is used to align the received signals of macrocell users in the same subspace at multiple FBSs simultaneously. The proposed method achieves IA while providing the QoS requirements of macrocell users, in terms of minimum received SINR at the macrocell base station (MBS). With this approach, the BER performance of femtocell users is shown to improve, while maintaining the quality of the communication channel of macrocell users. In the second method, an interference limited multi-tier multiuser MIMO cellular uplink is considered. Specifically, an interference management scheme is proposed where interference from subsets of macrocell users is aligned at the femtocell base stations in order to ensure acceptable service for the femtocell users.  The scheme employs interference alignment at each femtocell base station, to the set of macrocell users that are causing the high interference specifically at that FBS, and is termed selective IA.

Bilinguals activate information about words in each language in parallel when reading\nor listening to a word in one language alone (e.g., Dijkstra, 2005; Marian & Spivey, 2003), even if the word is embedded in a sentence context (e.g., Duyck, Van Assche, Drieghe, & Hartsuiker, 2007; Libben & Titone, 2009; Schwartz & Kroll, 2006; Van Hell & de Groot, 2008). Two factors have been identified that effectively  eliminate the cross-language effect within sentence context: a highly biased semantic constraint (e.g., Schwartz & Kroll, 2006) and when words differ in grammatical class across both languages (e.g., Baten, Hofman, & Loeys, 2010). \n\nOne contextual factor that has been ignored is the presence of language-specific syntactic\nconstraints. In the current study, highly proficient Spanish-English bilinguals read sentences in each language across separate blocks. Half of the Spanish sentences contained syntax that was structurally specific to Spanish in two ways: (a) the indirect object of a ditransitive verb was realized pleonastically with the proclitic le and its corresponding noun phrase, and (b) the grammatical subject of the object relative clause was not expressed overtly (e.g., Las monjas (a)le llevaron las mantas que (b)(pro) hab &#769; bordado a la directora del orfanato. [The nuns took the &#305;an quilts that they had embroidered to the director of the  orphanage.]) The English translations were controls in that the initial phrase of the sentence was not syntactically specific to either language. Bilinguals read sentences presented word-by-word and named a target word aloud. Critical target words were language-ambiguous cognates (e.g., bus in English and Spanish), which were matched to a set of unambiguous control words (e.g., hairspray-laca).\n\nThe results indicated that language-specific syntactic constraints did not reliably modulate\nthe cognate effect for all bilinguals. This suggests that the bilinguals activated both languages even in sentences with syntactic structure specific to only one language. However, a subset of the bilinguals, those who were dominant in Spanish, did appear to make use of the syntactic constraints to switch off the unintended language. However, there was not sufficient power to find an effect statistically. The current study shows that it may be premature to conclude that language-specific syntactic constraints do not modulate nonselectivity.

This series experiments on L1 Spanish -- L2 English bilinguals shows that syntactic information that is specific to Spanish modulates lexical co-activation. A set of word reading studies shows that bilinguals experience cross-language co-activation when reading language ambiguous words (i.e., cognates and homographs) in isolation and in sentence context. However, the magnitude of cross-language co-activation in sentence context depended on the type of sentence structure in which the target words were embedded. Active and passive structures share word order in English and Spanish and exhibit cross-language syntactic priming (CLSP; a measure of syntactic co-activation) between the two languages, suggesting that they are syntactic structures that are non-specific to Spanish and English. In contrast, prepositional object structures optionally differ in word order across English and Spanish and could therefore be considered language-specific (but the propensity for CLSP has not been tested in previous empirical studies). Cross-language effects shifted when comparing the language non-specific actives and passives to the language-specific datives and when comparing the dative condition with non-overlapping word order to the dative condition with overlapping word order, indicating that that the syntactic information provided by a sentence context influences word recognition and cross-language co-activation.\n\nA follow-up CLSP experiment provides independent evidence that actives and passives are language non-specific structures and that datives are language-specific. Participants were more likely to produce a passive structure in Spanish after they heard a passive structure in English. This cross-language syntactic priming effect suggests that bilinguals co-activate these structures and that the structures share representation across the two languages. In contrast, prepositional object dative structures showed no evidence of cross-language priming, indicating that the two structures are not shared and do not become co-activated during processing.  \n\nOverall, the results of this dissertation show that bilinguals share representations and experience cross-language co-activate at both the lexical level and the syntactic level. Further, the results indicate that there is considerable interaction between the two levels. Word order appears to function as a cue that allows a bilingual speaker to differentiate between the two languages, reducing co-activation at each level. The results here also highlight the complicated nature of the interactions between language co-activation and other factors including sentence context, executive function ability, and language proficiency. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11174], "author_name_tesi": "Gullifer, Jason William", "last_name_ssi": "Gullifer", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith Fran Kroll", "Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Judith Fran Kroll", "Carol Anne Miller", "Adriana Van Hell", "Bradley Paul Wyble"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith Fran Kroll, Dissertation Advisor", "Paola Eulalia Dussias, Dissertation Advisor", "Judith Fran Kroll, Committee Chair", "Carol Anne Miller, Committee Member", "Adriana Van Hell, Committee Member", "Bradley Paul Wyble, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["syntactic constraints", "word recognition", "syntactic priming", "psycholinguistics", "bilingualism"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ULTRASONIC CHARACTERIZATION OF CRYSTAL DISPERSIONS AND FROZEN FOODS\n", "id": "8291", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2454", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nUltrasonic wave propagation is sensitive to the physical properties and structure of materials and so ultrasonic sensors are used in the non-destructive evaluation of materials. Since ultrasonics is a non-invasive, relatively inexpensive technology that can be adapted to hygienic requirements and processing conditions that occur in the food industry, it is possible to use ultrasonic sensors in the analysis of foods, in particular online during production. The relationships between the ultrasonic properties of foods and many physical and structural parameters have been well-established (Coupland, 2004) and the motivation of this work is to establish similar relationships for frozen foods.  Phase transitions (i.e., freezing) are characterized by rapid changes in physical properties of materials, including ultrasonic properties so it should be possible to relating the changes in ultrasonic properties of food systems to other physical properties such as ice content. In order to do that, however, the influence of food composition and microstructure on the ultrasonic properties must be well understood. \n\nThe first objective of this study was to investigate the effect of ice content on the \nultrasonic properties of model frozen solutions. The speed of sound was measured in sucrose, glycerol and orange juice solutions as a function of temperature (10\u00b0C- -10\u00b0C).   Ultrasonic velocity rapidly increased starting at the onset of freezing as the samples were frozen. For samples below -8\u00b0C (i.e., closer to thermal equilibrium), the ice content in the samples was approximately a linear function of the change in ultrasonic velocity. The ultrasonic attenuation in the frozen model systems was unexpectedly high.\n\t\nThe ice-solution system is difficult to precisely characterize experimentally so to investigate the mechanisms for the large ultrasonic losses seen a simpler model system was considered.  The ultrasonic attenuation from solid or liquid emulsion can be well-described by scattering theory, except at their melting point when there are large excess losses (McClements et al. 1993).  The solid-liquid equilibrium in emulsion droplets is similar to the ice-solution equilibrium in frozen samples and has the advantage of being readily controlled and described.   The second objective was to investigate the excess attenuation for melting lipids in emulsion droplets and suggest a mechanism for the losses that may be responsible for the very high attenuation. Large losses were seen at the melting point but these could be described by an extended version of scattering theory that incorporated effective values of the physical properties of the droplets accounting for the rapid changes in solids content at melting point (i.e., the effective specific heat and thermal expansion coefficient were much larger over the melting range).  The influence of oil and emulsifier type and particle size on the excess losses on melting was investigated in detail to show the validity of extended theory. \n\nThe final objective was to measure the attenuation in model frozen foods and interpreting relevance of the losses in terms of the mechanism developed for the emulsion droplet model. Ultrasonic velocity and attenuation was measured as a function of temperature in partially frozen sucrose solutions that had been prepared either with or without prior degassing.  Ultrasonic velocity increased approximately linearly with ice content in all samples; however the rate of change in velocity was dependent on initial sugar concentration and to a lesser extent on degassing.  Attenuation increased rapidly on freezing but the final value was more a function of the degassing step and hence the presence of air bubbles than on the final ice content.  This finding suggests that contrary to my initial hypothesis, air bubbles rather than ice crystals are most significant in determining the ultrasonic attenuation of partially frozen model foods.\n\n\nReferences\n1.\tCoupland, J.N. 2004.

It\u2019s vital to design and construct energy efficient buildings with improved indoor environmental quality for reduction in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, and provide comfortable indoor environments to building occupants. Although the green building industry is improving steadily, major challenges still exist against the production of such buildings that are called high performance green. These include: lack of standards in new green technologies, high upfront building costs, and most importantly fragmented design practices in complex green project delivery process. An increasing potential lays in early interaction and integration of project team members in delivery process, to improve building performance. The delivery process for high performance green buildings, is especially important due to the increased number of design consultants and specialty contractors that must interact during design and construction. \nThis research aimed to use quantitative methods to select statistically correlated integration variables based on level of green, cost, and schedule performance of the project. The sample set included 51 green building projects compiled from two previous research projects with similar data collection infrastructure. Owners, architects, and contractors of every project were involved in the data collection process. The distribution of delivery methods (i.e., construction management at risk, design-build, and design-bid-build) and LEEDTM certification levels (i.e., from certified to platinum) were checked before data analysis to eliminate sampling bias. Cost and schedule growth variables were also checked for normal distribution. \nThe study yields to statistically significant corresponding weightings from 18 to 20 in-process metrics to predict project performance in each category. According to this evaluation, the most important delivery factors are choosing design-build delivery, setting an owner-initiated vision statement that includes sustainable goals, having all relevant parties in design charrettes, running energy and lighting simulations starting from conceptual phase and not later than schematics phase, owner\u2019s capabilities on scope definition and decision making, selecting a contractor from a restrained pool, and contractor\u2019s involvement on design development stage or earlier. These decisions are common factors that were found to impact all performance outcomes.  Extracting these in-process metrics will highlight the important decisions and specific strategies need to be taken (e.g., who will be involved, when and how the involvement will occur) during the high performance green building delivery. Focusing on these indicators will shed more light into the integrative delivery process and decrease uncertainties of decision making process.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4945], "author_name_tesi": "Gultekin, Pelin ", "last_name_ssi": "Gultekin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pelin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Assoc Prof David R Riley", "David R Riley Ii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Assoc Prof David R Riley, Thesis Advisor", "David R Riley Ii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Construction Management", "Green Building Delivery", "Process Metrics"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "An Integrated Process Model And Decision Support System For Energy Efficient Retrofits", "id": "25666", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10686", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The importance of the built environment in tackling current energy and sustainability challenges is widely recognized. There is significant value in retrofitting existing buildings. Owners, project managers, designers, and contractors now actively seek opportunities to upgrade the energy performance of standing buildings. These prospects lie in the retrofit process, within which many collaborative decisions take place at critical stages. The procedure is currently inefficient, with decision makers unaware early in the process of the ultimate implications of their actions on the energy-efficiency outcomes of the building they are creating. Thus, there is substantial room for a decision support system (DSS) that can guide facility owners and project managers in undertaking advanced energy retrofits of existing buildings by considering effects of decisions on energy performance. \n\nApproaches that support decision-making prediction in energy performance include checklists, databases, and forward and inverse modeling. We know that integrated system upgrades result in more significant energy reduction rates than do standard approaches. Because all team members do not inform these synergies early in the process, however, energy-efficient decisions do not occur. In a typical energy-efficient retrofit design, decisions are entered into simulations without collaboration to document them and predict the design\u2019s energy performance. Such late evaluations cannot go beyond the projection of energy performance that is already selected for the design. Thus, there is a need for a decision-support system that stimulates both the collaborative design process and early decision-making on system performance information.\n\nThe research methodology consisted of a literature review on critical design activities and energy conservation measures (ECM) as the first stage, followed by interview design and testing the need statement with experts. Then we collected decision variables through involvement in case-study meetings and interviews with project participants. For the process delineation, we mapped three \u201cas is\u201d process models to cross-case with recommendations from the literature, and delivered a \u201cto be\u201d process model. The refined \u201cto be\u201d process model we offer is also fed by the ECM measure that is tracked in case studies, project participant interviews, and project documents. To inform the design team lead by PMs, a simplified comparative energy-consumption prediction methodology is developed. \n\nConsequently, this research creates a project management DSS to manage the deep-retrofit process during collaboration meetings and design charrettes. It aims to improve the integrated design process by providing a just-in-time relative energy analysis compared to a standard baseline. This energy-efficiency prediction methodology is scalable to other project values such as IEQ or cost. The knowledge we add to the field combines process with critical ECM performance measures. The opportunity to have a comparative energy analysis of decisions early in the design process will also improve system option opportunities and present the ability to change them.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10317], "author_name_tesi": "Gultekin, Pelin ", "last_name_ssi": "Gultekin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pelin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba", "Robert Michael Leicht", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba", "James Freihaut", "Gul Kremer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Michael Leicht, Dissertation Advisor", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba, Committee Chair", "James Freihaut, Committee Member", "Gul Kremer, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Energy Efficiency", "Retrofits", "Decision Support System", "Construction Management"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Green Towers: Production and Financial Analyses of Urban Agricultural Systems   \n", "id": "26454", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11583", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "By the year 2050, the population of planet Earth is expected to reach over nine billion people. In the next 35 years, we will have the task of supporting an additional two billion lives on a planet that is already struggling to provide a stable and acceptable food supply as well as an effective means of food distribution. Estimates show that of the seven billion people living on planet Earth, 870 million suffer from hunger.         \n\n\tThe fight against world hunger is a complex, challenging, and multi-faceted issue that can only be fought through innovative solutions that address the multiple aspects comprising it. One of these aspects is simply limited access to food in urban neighborhoods and rural towns which are referred to as \u201cfood deserts\u201d. These are prevalent throughout the United States and have resulted in food-insecure households. \n\n\tSolutions to limited access do exist today in the form of innovative growing on developed land. The use of controlled agricultural environments through the means of greenhouse structures, LED lights, hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics have made this possible. Multiple companies have come into existence and have built their businesses out of providing these innovative growing systems or growing food through their utilization. \n\n\tAlthough these techniques and systems do exist, there is limited information and data on production yields both from the companies themselves as well as from existing scientific literature.\n\nGreenTowers, LLC is an Urban Agricultural Design Company that came into existence in the past three years as a result of Penn State University\u2019s College of Agricultural Science\u2019s 2012 Ag Springboard Competition. The four co-founders; Dustin Betz, Jared Yarnall-Schane, Michael Zaengle, and Jonathan Gumble have transformed GreenTowers from a student competition team, to a full-time business. GreenTowers\u2019 mission is \u201cto reconnect individuals with nature and with food to help consumers realize the interconnection shared between ecological systems and food systems\u201d. This is primarily accomplished through the use of two innovative growing systems developed by the company; the Rotating Living Wall and Living Furniture. \n\nThe goal of this master\u2019s program through these sets of experiments was to understand not only the production potentials of these two systems, but the financial aspects as well to determine economic viability in specific case scenarios. The Rotating Living Wall was tested through the growing of 12 varieties of microgreens. Experiments were performed from June 2014 to June 2015 to understand differences in seasonal yields, differences in yields based on variety of microgreen, yield comparison to a traditionally grown microgreen control group; both on a yields per/trough method as well as a yields per/ft.\u00b2 method, rotational timing, moving versus stationary growth, differences in growth based on media depth, and differences in production yields from supplemental lighting. \n\nPerformance criteria were based on measuring fresh weight, dry weight, height, and SPAD-meter readings (soil plant analysis development). Differences in yields throughout seasons were significant as well as differences between the Rotating Living Wall systems compared to the control group. The use of LED supplemental lighting provided significant differences in yields throughout winter season growing. Rotational timing, media depth, as well as physical movement of plants showed minimal or no significant influence on yields. By establishing the potential revenues and various costs that are part of growing with the Rotating Living Wall system, financial viability was analyzed showing that these systems can be profitable when used in State College, PA, within certain operating parameters.     \n\nLiving Furniture, which is a small scale aesthetic aquaponics system, was tested through the course of ten trials to understand not only the yield potentials for a variety of microgreens, but the operating costs as well. Number of fish and fish food mass did not result in significant differences in production yields with chelated iron supplementation, but did result in significant differences for water chemistry (specifically concentrations of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate). Water chemistry overall did prove to be better in the Living Furniture systems compared to a control setup tank with a standard mechanical filter. Chelated iron supplementation resulted in significant improvement for overall production of the systems; even resulting in the aquaponic systems surpassing the production yields from control-grown microgreens produced in a commercial potting mix.   \n\nThe research completed throughout these studies has not only provided a base line of operation for both these systems, but has also given insight into future studies and research that can be completed for further optimization and increased efficiency. Developed and improved growing systems may have the potential to provide solutions for fighting food deserts and ultimately the big picture of world hunger.      \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11087], "author_name_tesi": "Gumble, Jonathan James", "last_name_ssi": "Gumble", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Berghage Jr.", "Dan Thomas Stearns", "Mark A Gagnon", "Andrew Scott Lau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Berghage Jr., Thesis Advisor", "Dan Thomas Stearns, Thesis Advisor", "Mark A Gagnon, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Scott Lau, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["\"GreenTowers\"", "\"food deserts\"", "\"urban agricultural design\"", "\"Rotating Living Wall\"", "\"Living Furniture\""]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "AERODYNAMIC AND HEAT TRANSFER ASPECTS OF TIP AND CASING TREATMENTS USED FOR TURBINE TIP LEAKAGE CONTROL", "id": "8976", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "854", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Axial flow turbine stages are usually designed with a gap between the tips of the rotating blades and a stationary outer casing. The presence of a strong pressure gradient across this gap drives flow from the pressure side of the blade to the suction side. This leakage flow creates a significant amount of energy loss of working fluid in the turbine stage. In a modern gas turbine engine the outer casing of the high-pressure turbine is also exposed to a combination of high flow temperatures and heat transfer coefficients. The casing is consequently subjected to high levels of convective heat transfer, a situation that is aggravated by flow unsteadiness caused by periodic blade-passing events. \n\nAn experimental investigation of the aerodynamic and heat transfer effect of tip and casing treatments used in turbine tip leakage control was conducted in a large scale, low speed, rotating research turbine facility. \n\nThe effects of casing treatments were investigated by measuring the total pressure field at the exit of the rotor using a high frequency response total pressure probe. A smooth wall as a baseline case was also investigated. The test cases presented include results of casing treatments with varying dimensions for tip gap height of t/h=2.5%. The results of the rotor exit total pressure indicate that the casing treatment significantly reduced the leakage mass flow rate and the momentum deficit in the core of the tip vortex. The reductions obtained in the tip vortex size and strength influenced the tip-side passage vortex and other typical core flow characteristics in the passage. Casing treatments with the highest ridge height was the most effective in reducing the total pressure loss in the leakage flow of the test blades. This was observed at a radius near the core of the tip vortex. It appears that casing treatments with the highest ridge height is also the most effective from a global point of view, as shown by the passage averaged pressure coefficient obtained in the last 20% of the blade height.\n\nThe effect of the new blade tip concept, inclined squealer tip, on tip leakage flow with and without casing treatments is also investigated. The results of the rotor exit total pressure indicate that the inclined squealer tip arrangement has significant effects on both passage core flow and the interaction between the leakage vortex and the tip side passage vortex.\n\nA steady-state method of measuring convective heat transfer coefficient on the casing of an axial flow turbine is also developed for the comparison of various casing surface and tip designs used for turbine performance improvements. The free-stream reference temperature, especially in the tip gap region of the casing varies monotonically from the rotor inlet to rotor exit due to work extraction in the stage. In a heat transfer problem of this nature, the definition of the free-stream temperature is not as straight forward as constant free-stream temperature type problems. The accurate determination of the convective heat transfer coefficient depends on the magnitude of the local free-stream reference temperature varying in axial direction, from the rotor inlet to exit. The current investigation explains a strategy for the simultaneous determination of the steady-state heat transfer coefficient and free-stream reference temperature on the smooth casing of a single stage rotating turbine facility. The heat transfer approach is also applicable to casing surfaces that have surface treatments for tip leakage control. The overall uncertainty of the method developed is between 5% and 8% of the convective heat transfer coefficient.\n\nThe test cases presented show that the casing heat transfer is affected by the tip gap height. The heat transfer coefficient increases as the tip gap increases for both with and without casing treatments. It is also shown that the effect of ridge height on heat transfer coefficient is negligible for tip gap height of t/h=0.9%.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [847], "author_name_tesi": "Gumusel, Baris ", "last_name_ssi": "Gumusel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Baris", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci", "Cengiz Camci", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Timothy Francis Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci, Dissertation Advisor", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Chair", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Timothy Francis Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Turbine Tip Leakage Control", "Inclined Squealer Tip", "Blade Tip Shape", "Casing Treatment", "Shroud Heat Transfer", "Tip Leakage Desensitization"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Photoelectron Imaging Spectroscopic Investigations of Transition Metal Silicides and Oxides", "id": "13133", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7066", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-01-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation presents the experimental progress in the use of photoelectron imaging spectroscopy to probe the electronic structure of negatively charged transition metal silicides and oxides. By measuring the electronic transitions that occur due to the use of an appropriate photon energy, the electron affinity of the neutral species can be measured and the ground and excited electronic states of the anion and neutral can be deduced. The introductory chapter explains the basics of photoelectron spectroscopy and how it is coupled with recently developed imaging techniques to simultaneously obtain energy and angular distribution of the photodetached electrons. The \u03b2 parameter, which is instrumental in quantifying the angular distribution, is discussed in detail. The motivation for pursuing the transition metal silicide and oxide studies and their increasing importance in technology is also emphasized.\nPhotoelectron imaging spectroscopy employed in our laboratory involves custom-built ultra high-vacuum instrumentation which couples a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer with an electron imaging apparatus. Chapter 2 discloses the details of the experimental setup required to conduct these studies; from the laser ablation techniques that form the species of interest, to the mass selection of the negatively charged clusters and the subsequent photodetachment of electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbitals of the anion. The modifications made to the safety features of the instrument, in addition to the improvements to the high-vacuum configuration, are described in detail.\nThe first known photoelectron spectroscopic investigation of the ZrSi- diatomic species has been conducted as part of this dissertation. Chapter 3 discusses the results of the 532 nm and 355 nm wavelength experiments on ZrSi-. Conflicts between the two previous theoretical studies which proposed the ground state of the neutral has been noted while new electronic state assignments have been assigned based on experimental evidence. This study supports the 2\u03a3+: (1\u03c3)2 (1\u03c0)4 (1\u03b4)0 (2\u03c3)2 (3\u03c3)1 anion ground electronic state (and valence orbital electron configuration) which is in agreement with theoretical results. The assigned ground state of the neutral, however, differs from that based on current theoretical results. The ground state of ZrSi was assigned as the 3\u03a3+: (1\u03c3)2 (1\u03c0)4 (1\u03b4)0 (2\u03c3)1 (3\u03c3)1 based on the angular distribution and the relative intensities of the photoelectron signal. A low-lying excited state of the neutral was assigned as 3\u03a0i with valence orbital configuration, (1\u03c3)2 (1\u03c0)3 (1\u03b4)0 (2\u03c3)2 (3\u03c3)1. The electron affinity of ZrSi is measured as 1.584 eV, while a low-lying excited state of the neutral is identified 0.238 eV above the ZrSi neutral ground state. Additionally, Franck-Condon simulations were performed to compare with the experimental photoelectron spectrum and estimate the vibrational temperature of the anions created in our cluster source.\nExtending the transition metal silicide studies to other metals, Chapter 4 presents results of NbSi, MoSi, PdSi and WSi diatomic anions which were photodetached by photons with a wavelength of 532 nm. Similar to ZrSi, two major transitions originating from the anion were observed and the transition energies are reported. A significant finding of this study is the change of photoelectron angular distribution among the 4d-row transition metal-silicon diatomics. The main feature (X) changes from having an anisotropic distribution for ZrSi- and NbSi- to an isotropic distribution for MoSi- and PdSi-. The basis of this observed change is explored further and connections are made to the increasing stability of the transition metal d-orbitals when moving from Zr to Pd. Correlated with the metal d-orbital stability is the increased donation of silicon 3p-electrons to the highest occupied molecular orbitals of the diatomic. The atomic electron negativity values also support these conclusions. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first use of  anion photoelectron imaging spectroscopy to examine the evolution of bonding trends in transition metal silicides. \nInvestigations regarding transition metal oxides are presented from Chapter 5 onward. The photoelectron spectroscopic features of ZnOH- are discussed in a combined experimental and theoretical study. The vertical detachment energy of ZnOH- was measured to be 1.78 eV, while that of ZnO- is 0.3 eV higher. The curious broadening of the photoelectron spectra of ZnOH- when compared with ZnO- is investigated. The effects of the vibrational states and even rotational states on the photoelectron spectrum is considered in order to explain the experimental photoelectron signal. The vibrational spectrum could explain the broadening if the source temperature is much higher than the range we estimated in Chapter 3 (150-300 K). Also, as expected, the rotational states were not significantly effecting the broadening of the photoelectron spectrum. \nDue to the importance of ZnO-based material for dilute-magnetic semiconductors, ZnO-cluster formation, growth and stability has been investigated in Chapter 6. Large ZnO-based clusters have been observed with stoichiometries, ZnnOn, ZnnOn+1 and ZnnOn+2 (n=3-6). The ZnnOn+1 unit was concluded to be the relatively stable species and it has been proposed as a suitable building block for doping with magnetic atoms. The electron affinity of Zn3O3 (1.14 eV) is lower than Zn3O4 (2.02 eV), supporting the argument that the Zn3O4 unit is more stable.\nChapter 7 provides a summary of the research presented in this dissertation while sharing insights regarding possible avenues of extending this research.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7059], "author_name_tesi": "Gunaratne, K.

The dissertation is composed of two essays. Using direct product experiences involving real brands, the first essay demonstrates that good experiences with new products have a larger positive impact on attitudes toward low equity brands and COs compared to identical experiences with exemplars of high equity brands and COs.  In contrast, bad experiences lead to more pronounced negative changes in attitudes toward high equity (vs. low equity) brands and COs.  Employing a three-wave longitudinal design, it is demonstrated that the change in attitude toward the brand persists over time and beyond the experimental context.  This essay further reveals that the final attitudes toward the brand and CO are determined primarily by the consistency of the new experience with the brand or CO equity, whereas the weight accorded to the new product experience relative to existing attitudes does not seem to play an important role in the process.\n\tRelying on the inclusion-exclusion model developed in the social judgment literature, the second essay shows that experiences with another brand (X) may transfer to attitudes toward a target brand (Y) in two distinct ways: inter-brand assimilation or inter-brand contrast. When both competitor brands are known to be from the same CO and this information is made salient to consumers, an assimilation effect will occur such that attitudes toward the target brand Y will be congruent with the valence of the experience with brand X. Hence, a good experience with brand X benefits brand Y, whereas a bad experience with brand X hurts brand Y.  On the other hand, when the common origin is not salient or when the brands are from different COs, a contrast effect will occur such that attitudes toward brand Y will be incongruent with the valence of the experience with brand X.  Thus, a good experience with brand X may hurt brand Y and a bad experience with brand X helps brand Y.  I also examine what types of competitive strategies can be undertaken by brand Y in order to share brand X\u2019s success, avoid being associated with brand X\u2019 failure, or even benefit from brand X\u2019s failure. Similarly, I investigate what brand X can do to prevent a competitor brand Y from taking advantage of its success or benefiting from its failure. The implications for marketers and consumers are discussed.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3561], "author_name_tesi": "Gunasti, Kunter ", "last_name_ssi": "Gunasti", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kunter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Johann Baumgartner", "Johann Baumgartner", "William T Ross", "Francis Erin Dardis", "Margaret Grace Meloy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Johann Baumgartner, Dissertation Advisor", "Johann Baumgartner, Committee Chair", "William T Ross, Committee Member", "Francis Erin Dardis, Committee Member", "Margaret Grace Meloy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["inclusion exclusion", "attitude change", "branding", "country of origin", "brand equity", "product experience"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The tumor promoting roles of lymphocytes during RAS initiated inflammation and skin carcinogenesis", "id": "13959", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7091", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The pathological progression of neoplastic tissues requires the concerted activities of normal stromal cells to orchestrate a series of growth promoting effects similar to that found in healing wounds but without resolution.  Bone marrow derived leukocytes are instrumental in initiating and mediating many of these processes through various mechanisms employed during periods of inflammation.  Recently, studies using chemical and genetic tumor models have demonstrated novel tumor promoting roles for immune cells of the lymphoid lineage, a seemingly counterintuitive discovery.\nTo model and study the contributions of lymphocytes to oncogene induced pre-malignant inflammation and tumor development, we targeted a Harvey-RASG12V transgene to basal (K14) and suprabasal (Inv) layers of squamous epithelia under inducible control of a tetracycline transactivator.  Reduced doses of doxycycline (dox) induced expression of RAS transgene in InvtTA/tetORas (InvRas) mice leading to outgrowth of benign papillomatous lesions.  RAS expression on a lymphocyte deficient Rag1-/- genetic background greatly blunted tumor onset and total burdens indicating lymphocyte involvement in the promotion of RAS induced skin carcinogenesis.  Antibody depletion of CD8+ T cells in Rag1+/+ mice partially but significantly reduced the early onset of papillomas while Rag1-/- reconstitution of purified CD8+ T cells briefly stimulated lesional growth similar to WT groups that could not be sustained over the course of the study.  Examination of the acute inflammatory response to RAS expression revealed diverse myelocytic infiltration into cutaneous tissues predominated by intraepidermal infiltration of cytotoxic Ly6G+ neutrophils.  Conversely, when acute RAS expression was observed on Rag1 -/- mice, epidermal proliferation and skin inflammation was greatly attenuated.  Neutrophilia, microabcesses, and keratinocyte proliferation levels similar to Rag1+/+ mice could be rescued by reconstitution of transgenic Rag1-/- mice with total CD3+ T or CD8+ T cells.  Depleting CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells diminished or ablated all of these pathologies as well as reduced Th17 and \u03b3\u03b4-17 cell activation, demonstrating the requirement for CD8+ T cells in driving global RAS inflammatory responses.  Neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 blocked neutrophilic inflammation and keratinocyte proliferation caused by CD8+ repletion of Rag1-/- mice thereby implicating this cytokine as a mechanism of action.\nRAS expression driven by an epithelial basal layer promoter (K14Ras) also activated severe systemic and skin inflammation but was characterized more predominantly by the expansion of Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes capable of suppressing T cell proliferation ex vivo.  This immunosuppressive behavior could be ameliorated by titration of RAS transgene quantities that correlated linearly with reduced GM-CSF expression in keratinocytes.  Strikingly, the acquisition of immunosuppressive functionality in these myeloid subsets could also be abrogated by crossing RAS transgenes onto the Rag1-/- background.  Depletion of CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells was ineffective at reproducing this phenomenon.  However, B cell reconstitution into K14Ras/Rag1-mice completely recovered Ly6Chi mediated blockade of T cell proliferation suggesting B cells were the lymphocyte mediating these activities.  B cell depletion, in contrast, did not reverse these effects because of an anti-CD20 resistant Breg population that likely stimulates MDSC phenotypes through the paracrine activities of IL-10.\nFinally, we show that the unique inflammatory responses observed in basal and suprabasal RAS expressing mice may be caused by inherently different signaling properties in differentiated and proliferating keratinocytes.  RAS activation of ERK1/2 was greatly inhibited in differentiated keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo, whereby MKK4 activation was increased.  As AP-1 blockade during RAS activation revealed a repressive role for AP-1 in cytokine transcription, we hypothesize that increased AP-1 activation due to enhanced JNK signaling in post-mitotic keratinocytes may dampen RAS mediated immunosuppressive pathways in mutated non-dividing epidermal layers.  In turn, this disparity in the ability to provoke regulatory myeloid cells that inhibit anti-tumor immunity may provide a reasonable explanation for the increased malignant potential in basal/stem cell driven epithelial cancers.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7082], "author_name_tesi": "Gunderson, Andrew Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Gunderson", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adam Bleier Glick", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Robert Paulson", "Todd Schell", "Avery August"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adam Bleier Glick, Dissertation Advisor", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "Avery August, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tumor immunology", "RAS", "inflammation", "skin cancer", "lymphocytes"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Precise asymptotics for periodic orbits of the geodesic flow in nonpositive curvature\n\n", "id": "5990", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5396", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis establishes the most precise asymptotic formula known for the number of homotopy classes of periodic orbits for the geodesic flow and proves it for any compact manifold of nonpositive curvature with geometric rank one.\nThis extends a celebrated result of G.A.

At risk/resilient subjects were more likely to be exclusively breastfed for at least 6 months and had a later introduction of solid foods than at risk/overweight subjects.   \n\nConclusions: Feeding behaviors may provide resilience in the face of risk and protect individuals whose infant weight gain increases their likelihood for developing childhood overweight.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1364], "author_name_tesi": "Gungor, Darcy ", "last_name_ssi": "Gungor", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Darcy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia Bartok", "Cynthia Bartok"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia Bartok, Thesis Advisor", "Cynthia Bartok, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["growth", "child", "overweight", "infant"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Social Support among Women in Adult Literacy Classrooms: The Case of the Mother Child Education Foundation (A\u00c7EV) in Turkey", "id": "26798", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11811", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Prior research indicates that social support is strongly related to socioeconomic, physical, and mental well-being. Building on this work, this qualitative research study employed ethnographic tools to examine the perceptions of social support among women in adult literacy classrooms, specifically those provided by Anne \u00c7ocuk E\u011fitim Vakf\u0131 (A\u00c7EV; Mother Child Education Foundation) in Istanbul, Turkey. Paying special attention to characteristics of A\u00c7EV and partnering institutions, A\u00c7EV\u2019s idiosyncratic approach to adult literacy, and the social, economic and historical context in which adult literacy education is provisioned in Turkey, the research examined the relationship between the underlying approach to adult literacy, curricular materials, their implementation in the classroom, and perceptions of social support by women learners. The data sources included interviews with professional A\u00c7EV staff, volunteer teachers and women learners, classroom observations, A\u00c7EV\u2019s curricular materials, a social support survey, and photographs taken at the sites. The data were analyzed using thematic and discourse analyses. Global norm making was used as a lens to understand how A\u00c7EV came to interpret and implement functional literacy in a peculiar way, one that heavily emphasized women\u2019s support. Over time, functional literacy was transformed to become more oriented toward fostering social support, and the curricular materials explicitly, consistently, and repeatedly attempted to create a supportive environment for the women learners. Deconstructing normative gender roles and expectations and helping women become aware of and actively advocate for their rights were salient goals of the program. Women learners reported offering emotional and informational support to each other, and their perceptions were supported by classroom observations. Material and tangible support were rare among the women and mostly flowed from A\u00c7EV to the participants in the form of various educational materials. The findings of this research suggest that adult literacy classrooms can be a venue where women learners perceive and receive various forms of support from their peers, teachers, and other actors they meet while attending the programs.

This investigation aims to address these problems by tailoring the electrical properties of glass-epoxy composites by the addition and electric-field-induced alignment of carbon nanofillers in order to develop a new type of material, which is a suitable candidate for damage detection using electrical resistance method. As carbon nanofillers, short unfunctionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon black (CB) nanoparticles were used due to their low aspect ratio, which is believed to ease their motion between the glass fibers.\nShort CNTs and CB were dispersed in a bisphenol-A based epoxide diluted with alkyl glycidyl ether by using bath sonication and stirring methods. Short CNT-filled epoxy and CB-filled epoxy composites were manufactured with and without electric-field-induced alignment of nanofillers due to dielectrophoresis. In addition to nanofilled-epoxy composites, random and aligned short CNT-filled and CB-filled glass-epoxy composites were also manufactured by using hand lay-up and vacuum bagging techniques. Significant increases were obtained in the electrical conductivity through the thickness of the composites filled with CB by aligning the CB nanoparticles through the thickness. It was further observed that, for a given concentration of nanofiller, higher electrical conductivities are obtained in aligned CB-filled glass-epoxy composites than in aligned short CNT-filled glass-epoxy composites, which turned the focus of this investigation on CBs rather than CNTs for damage detection studies.\nA parametric experimental investigation was carried out for CB-filled glass-epoxy composites by using different CB concentrations, applied AC field strengths and frequencies. Studies showed that increasing CB concentration and AC field strength up to a point increases the electrical conductivity through the thickness while imposing minor effects on the in-plane conductivities, whereas frequency does not have a significant effect on the conductivities. With the use of a proper CB concentration, AC field strength and frequency, a material with an anisotropy ratio, defined as the ratio of through-thickness conductivity to in-plane transverse conductivity, equal to 3.3 was achieved for CB-filled unidirectional glass-epoxy composites. This is the first investigation which shows that through thickness conductivity can exceed in-plane transverse conductivity.\nFinite element analyses were conducted to map the place and the size of damage for four different cases. It was shown that perpendicular electrode configuration is better compared to the parallel electrode configuration and it is possible to detect multiple damage and distinguish different sized damage from each other. A graphic user interface code was created to graphically illustrate the place and the size of the damage by a 3D animation, which permits easier understanding of the nature of the damage.\nDamage detection capability of random and aligned CB-filled glass-epoxy composites by electrical resistance method was investigated using carbon fiber electrodes. It was shown that electrical resistance method is more sensitive for detecting damage in aligned CB-filled glass-epoxy composites compared to random ones. It was further shown that continuous carbon fibers placed on parallel surfaces of composites allow the detection of damage and perpendicular configuration locates damage more precisely than parallel configuration.

We demonstrate a potential strategy to control morphology and donor/acceptor heterojunctions through conjugated block copolymer poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly((9,9-dioctylfluorene)-2,7-diyl-alt-[4,7-bis(thiophen-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole]-2\u2032,2\u2032\u2032-diyl) (P3HT-b-PFTBT).  Block copolymers can self-assemble into well-ordered nanostructures ideal for photovoltaic applications.  When utilized as the photovoltaic active layer, P3HT-b-PFTBT block copolymer devices demonstrate thermal stability and photoconversion efficiency of 3% well beyond devices composed of the constituent polymer blends.  \n    Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSOXS) is used to elucidate the structural origin for efficient block copolymer photovoltaics.  Energy tuning in soft X-ray ranges gives RSOXS chemical sensitivity to characterize organic thin films with compositionally similar phases or complicated multiphase systems.  RSOXS reveals that the remarkable performance of P3HT-b-PFTBT devices is due to self-assembly into nanoscale in-plane lamellar morphology, which not only establishes an equilibrium microstructure amenable for exciton dissociation but also provides pathways for efficient charge transport.  Furthermore, we find evidence that covalent control of donor/acceptor interfaces in block copolymers has the potential to promote charge separation and optimize the photoconversion process by limiting charge recombination.  \n    To visualize the nanostructure in organic thin films, we introduce low energy-loss energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) as an important alternative approach to generate contrast from differences in optoelectronic properties and enable chemical imaging of organic materials.  The widely-studied polymer/fullerene system is used as a test sample to demonstrate the application of this technique for structure characterization in the active layer of organic solar cells.  \n    In addition, well-ordered equilibrium nanostructures and covalent control of donor/acceptor interfaces make P3HT-b-PFTBT an excellent model for studying the effect of crystalline texture in the active layer on charge transport and photovoltaic performance.  Solvent additives are applied to induce a drastic texture change from mainly face-on to edge-on orientations in crystalline P3HT domains of block copolymer thin films.  We find that P3HT-b-PFTBT block copolymer devices demonstrate similar optimal performance, regardless of the dramatic changes in the predominant crystalline orientations adopted in P3HT domains.

The new approach combines the ARMA memory index modeling approach of Bierens (1988) with the semi-nonparametric estimation method that uses wavelet basis to construct a flexible functional form. With this combination, we are able to avoid imposing restrictive constraints on the specification of critical components of conditional probability functions, i.e., the lag structure and distribution functions of error terms. As a result, it is possible that the new modeling approach will lead to improved forecasting performance if the reduction of modeling bias is significant. To test the usefulness of the new approach, we compare the relative performance between the new modeling approach and traditional forecasting models in both Monte Carlo experiments and real-world applications including business cycle regime forecasting and the forecast of rank performance of stock returns. The experimental and empirical results suggest that the new modeling approach can outperform traditional modeling approaches due to the flexibility of the model specification and the way various nonlinearities in the dependence of conditional probabilities on information variables are captured by ARMA memory indices. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2112], "author_name_tesi": "Guo, Guang ", "last_name_ssi": "Guo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Guang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herman J Bierens", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse", "N Edward Coulson", "Philip A Klein", "Timothy T Simin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herman J Bierens, Committee Chair", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse, Committee Member", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member", "Philip A Klein, Committee Member", "Timothy T Simin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wavelet analysis", "stock return forecast", "business cycle forecasting", "probabilistic forecast", "econometric modeling", "semi-nonparametric modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Ab initio study of surface chemistry for fuel processing: adsorptive desulfurization and carbon resistant steam reforming", "id": "11754", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3060", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation studies the surface chemistry of adsorptive desulfurization and steam reforming for on-board or on-site hydrogen production for fuel cell systems. Ab initio calculations examined the structural-functional relationship of the adsorbents and catalysts. Calculated results were correlated with and used to explain experimental observations.\nFor adsorptive desulfurization, a TixCe1-xO2 adsorbent was considered for thiophene adsorption. Surfaces of TiO2, CeO2, and Ce-doped TiO2 were examined to model the mixed oxide system. Since the concentration of TiO2 is much higher than CeO2 in the adsorbent, calculations were first conducted on the adsorption of thiophene over the TiO2 anatase surfaces. The stoichiometric, O-poor (with oxygen vacancies), and O-rich (with activated O2 on the surface) anatase surfaces were built, and the interaction of thiophene molecule with these surfaces was examined. The results showed that thiophene is only adsorbed strongly on the O-rich surfaces through an interaction with activated O atoms on the surface with the S atom in thiophene to form a sulfone-like species. Adsorption interactions were also found to provide for selective adsorption of thiophene over benzene. Though the results indicate that the O-rich sites play an important role in the adsorption desulfurization, the formations of O-rich sites on anatase surfaces are endothermic in most cases. Therefore, the addition of CeO2 might facilitate the formation of O-rich sites. Our calculations results show that CeO2 does not directly contribute to the increase of adsorption capacity because the energetics of thiophene adsorption on CeO2 surfaces and Ce-doped anatase surfaces are not thermodynamically more favored than those on anatase surfaces. However, formation of a CexTi1-xO2 mixed surface decreases the relative surface formation energy of anatase (001), thus a greater fraction of the (001) facet could be exposed on the adsorbent. Ceria could also act as an oxygen storage reservoir, providing oxygen for formation of O-rich sites that strongly adsorb thiophenic species.\nFor steam reforming catalytic reaction, the carbon-resistance properties of the Ni/Rh catalyst were examined. Experimental results show that the carbon deposition on steam reforming catalyst is significantly reduced with inclusion of Rh. Ab initio calculations show that a Ni/Rh alloy is thermodynamically more stable than Ni and Rh alone at the synthesis and reaction temperatures (550 oC), in agreement with the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) analysis results indicating close interactions between Ni and Rh atoms. Adsorption, diffusion and oxidation of carbon species over Ni and Ni/Rh alloy surfaces were examined. Alloying with Rh reduces the stability of deposited carbon atoms and clusters over both terraces and steps of the catalyst. Moreover, Rh addition enhances the competition of oxidation reactions against carbon deposition by altering the relative diffusion and bond formation rates of the two processes. The reforming activity of Ni/Rh catalyst was also studied by examining the energy barrier to methane dissociation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3049], "author_name_tesi": "Guo, Jiahua ", "last_name_ssi": "Guo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiahua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Chunshan Song", "Michael John Janik", "Harold Harris Schobert", "Xiaoliang Ma", "Mark Maroncelli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Dissertation Advisor", "Chunshan Song, Committee Chair", "Michael John Janik, Committee Chair", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Member", "Xiaoliang Ma, Committee Member", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adsorptive desulfurization", "steam reforming", "DFT", "TiO2", "CeO2", "fuel processing"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Three-Dimensional Wrapping of Stiff Elastic Belts around Rollers\n\n\n", "id": "8837", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3165", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research is concerned with quasi-static configurations of axially moving materials helically wrapped onto cylindrical rollers. An elastic beam/rod model is built based on Antman's theory for a slender elastic body. The rod is subject to end forces and moments so that a central portion of it contacts a cylinder; the outer regions are free from external kinematic constraints. The location of the departure point (or contact point) and the configurations of both the contacting and non-contacting parts depend on the end loads. \n\n    Such systems arise in the material handling and processing operations in which axially moving continua are transported over pulleys. Most material processing occurs in a plane to which the guiding roller axes are perpendicular. The travel direction is only changed by altering the wrap angle around a roller. However, due to conditions such as space limitation, it is often necessary to have material move out of this process plane. This is accomplished by a device called a turn-bar.  A turn-bar is a non-rotating roller whose axis is not perpendicular to the process plane and causes material wrapped around it to move out of the process plane.\n\n    Since the equilibrium equations governing the constrained and unconstrained parts are different, it is critical to find the departure point, across which matching conditions are satisfied. Numerical integration and a shooting method are used to solve this boundary value problem. Flexible materials with both circular and rectangular cross sections are investigated. Three-dimensional rod configurations subject to various system parameters are presented. The effect of anisotropy on the wrap angle, wrap length, reaction force and torque is also analyzed.\n\n    One-dimensional beam models can adequately describe the response in cases where the material does not have considerable thickness or width (e.g. thread, tape, rope, and cable). For an axially moving material whose width is much greater than the thickness, two-dimensional plate or shell theories have to be consulted.

The physical parameters of cellulose such as surface area and porosity are important in the development of cellulose composites which may contain valuable additives which bind to cellulose. In this area, the use of acid hydrolyzed nano-dimensional cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs) has attracted significant interest, yet the surface area and porosity of these materials have not been explored experimentally. The objective of this work was to characterize the surface area and porosity of CNWs from different origins (plant cotton/bacterium Gluconacetobacter xylinus) and different acid treatments (H2SO4/HCl) by N2 adsorption; as well as to compare surface area and porosity of bacterial cellulose synthesized by static and agitated cultures. Our results showed that CNWs produced from H2SO4/HCl exhibited significantly increased surface area and porosity relative to starting material cotton fiber CF11. Micropores were generated in HCl hydrolyzed CNWs but not in H2SO4 hydrolyzed CNWs. Bacterial CNWs exhibited larger surface area and porosity compared to plant CNWs. Cellulose synthesized by G. xylinus ATCC 700178 from agitated cultures also exhibited less surface area and porosity than those from static cultures.\nPhage display technology was used to screen peptides that selectively bind to crystalline cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs) from a library of a number of different polypeptides. These peptides were selected on immobilized CNWs by biopanning, by which all possible heptapeptides were screened based on the binding affinity to the crystalline CNWs. A consensus peptide of WHWTYYW was identified to efficiently bind to CNWs. Binding affinities of isolated phage particles were quantitatively analyzed by single-phage biopanning assay and enzyme-linked immunesorbent assay (ELISA). This consensus peptide was synthesized and exhibited a binding affinity of ~105 M-1 towards CNWs as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), in good agreement with ELISA results. In addition, the affinities of this peptide to cello-oligosaccharides were also measured with UV spectroscopy and fluorescence quenching experiments. The molecular details of the interaction of this heptapeptide with cellohexaose were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The interaction with crystalline cellulose was investigated by molecular modeling (MM) studies. Both NMR and MM experiments suggest that this heptapeptide has adopted a bended structure for binding and Y5 can form CH/\u00f0 stacking and hydrogen bond with glucose ring of cellulose.\nFamily I cellulose binding modules CBMCel7A and CBMCel6A were heterologously expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, and the binding properties between these CBMs and cellulose substrates were studied. Cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs), the crystalline portions of cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose Avicel PH101 (partially crystalline cellulose), and phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC, amorphous cellulose), were used as representative models for cellulose to better understand the binding interactions between the CBMs and different regions of native cellulose. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was combined with adsorption-isotherm experiment to analyze the thermodynamics of CBMs binding to various cellulose substrates. N2 adsorption and static light scattering (SLS) data were used to estimate the accessible surface area of cellulose which was then used for ITC data analysis. A new method of determining the cellulose molarity based on the available surface area for CBM binding was developed, which allows different cellulose substrates to be compared for binding experiments. The ITC results showed that the binding constant (Ka) to crystalline CNWs are ~105 M-1 for CBMCel7A, while ~106 M-1 for CBMCel6A, suggesting a higher binding affinity of CBMCel6A to CNWs. For Avicel, lower binding constants for both CBMs were observed, and weak binding to PASC were characterized, suggesting that the binding between CBMCel7A, Cel6A and cellulose to some extent relates to the crystallinity of cellulose. Additionally, the binding reactions were driven by a favorable enthalpy change, offset partially by an unfavorable entropy change. It is suggested that CBMCel6A preferentially binds to the reducing end of cellulose chain while CBMCel7A doesn&#8223;t show such end binding property. Cello-oligosaccharides less than two glucose units did not bind with CBMs, and improved binding affinities were observed for cellooligosaccharides with longer glucose units.\nNatural cellulose binding modules (CBMs) bind to cellulose via hydrogen bonding and CH-\u00f0 stacking interactions between aromatic amino acids (especially tyrosines) and cellulose glucose rings. To identify the CBM binding motif and explore the binding mechanism at the molecular level, tyrosine-containing peptides mimicking CBM key motifs while having simpler structures than natural CBMs were synthesized and the binding properties to cellulose were characterized. In particular, the involvement of tyrosines in cellulose binding was studied. Information obtained by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and quantum mechanical calculations provides evidence that these CBM-mimic peptides had a capacity of binding cellulose. Modeling results reveal that the peptide with more than one tyrosine is favorable for binding towards cellulose and that the binding is enhanced with decreased distance between the two hydrophobic residues (tyrosine). Additionally, the random coiling nature of the peptide backbone provides enough room for intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the cellulose surface along with the weak hydrophobic interaction. A transition of peptide secondary structure was observed when binding to cellulose by FTIR. The peptides transition from regular \u00e2-sheets/turns to random coils to assist binding to cellulose. Analogously, the effect of peptide binding on cellulose was also observed. The structural modification of cellulose suggests that the peptide could disrupt and form new hydrogen bonds with cellulose chains. The binding affinities obtained by ITC of the peptides towards cellulose were comparable with some natural CBMs. The binding mechanism is similar to the adsorption of CBMs to cellulose, suggesting that the CBM-mimic peptides to a large extent represent the key binding motifs. Understanding the binding mechanism of these peptides is of fundamental significance for revealing the adsorption characteristics of natural CBMs. In addition, this study allows for further applications of developing cellulose nanocomposites by using these simple structured peptides as binding linkers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3255], "author_name_tesi": "Guo, Jing ", "last_name_ssi": "Guo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Teh Hui Kao", "Ming Tien", "James David Kubicki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffrey M Catchmark, Committee Chair", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "James David Kubicki, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cellulose binding modules", "cellulose nanowhiskers", "Cellulose nanostructure"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Molecular Genetic Analysis of Development and Pathogenicity in the Filamentous Fungus Fusarium verticillioides", "id": "12466", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3857", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fusarium verticillioides is a filamentous Ascomycete fungus causing disease on corn seedlings, ear and stalk worldwide.

The first addresses gelation kinetics and dynamics of aqueous gelatin solutions.  The second deals with micelle structure changes in aqueous nonionic surfactant mixtures.\nTriple helix reversion kinetics of aqueous gelatin solutions is studied with optical rotation.   A combination of first- and second-order concentration dependence of the reversion rate is observed and, based on this observation, a new two-step mechanism of helix formation distinct from the Flory and Weaver theory is proposed.  The rate limiting step is formation of a two-stranded nucleus, either intramolecular (first-order) or intermolecular (second-order).  The triple helix is formed by subsequent wrapping of a third strand onto the nucleus.  \nGelation dynamics of gelatin solutions is monitored with optical rotation and rheology. Viscosity data below the gel point are used to evaluate the gel point and the viscosity exponent, assuming dynamic scaling theory applies.  Shear modulus data above the gel point are used to determine the dynamic scaling modulus exponent.  As observed in the time-dependent optical rotation, an initial rapid growth region where new helices are formed is followed by a slower growth region involving helix lengthening.  The viscosity and modulus exponents depend on concentration, but not on temperature for cases where the gel point occurs before the helix reversion slows down appreciably. However, anomalous exponents are measured at higher temperatures, where the helix reversion slows down appreciably before the gel point is reached.  The observed concentration dependences of the dynamic scaling exponents are discussed in terms of chain overlap and entanglement.  \nThe structure of nonionic surfactant mixtures in water are probed by rheology and small-angle neutron scattering.  Small amounts of a C14 diol (Surfynol\u00ae 104) cause enormous structural and rheological changes when added to aqueous solutions of an ethylene oxide-propylene oxide-ethylene oxide triblock copolymer (Pluronic\u00ae P105).  The hydrophobic diol incorporates into the existing copolymer micelles and causes a cascade of changes in micelle structure, with resultant changes in rheology.

These adverse events include 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, prolonged length of stay and complications after surgery.  Predicting these events based on clinical and demographic data is critical for pre and post-operative surgical intervention.  In this thesis, we investigate predictive analytics for adverse events for patients undergoing colorectal surgery.  For the design, development and implementation of predictive analytics we use real life data provided by a prominent hospital system located in the Northeastern region of Pennsylvania.  To protect the proprietary aspects of the data, all the variables in the dataset are de-identified.  The longitudinal dataset consists of 8150 original records and 322 attributes from August 2006 to October 2014. In addition, the data related to the provider\u2019s behaviors with respect to colorectal surgery is also used. \n\nThe first step in this thesis addresses data cleaning and filling in the missing values.  We use several statistical methods to perform these tasks.  As the attribute set is large using subjective as well as statistical means we reduce the dimensionality to 120 attributes.  We investigate four methodologies, including Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Method and Logistic Regression for predictive analytics.  We construct regression models with the four methodologies, the models are either tree-based or classifying models.  After the models are constructed, we conduct comparative analysis of the methodologies based on certain performance criteria, and select the most accurate model for further study.  We find that Gradient Boosting Method (GBM) has the best performance.  We examine the most important predictors in the selected model, look for predictor features, and investigate intrinsic implications behind the predictors.  Our conclusions point to the fact that patient\u2019s health condition and surgery information are the most important factors leading to adverse events.  We suggest areas of future research.   \n\nMost of the past work in colorectal surgical adverse event prediction deals with retrospective data collected from several hospitals across several years.  In addition, a fairly large number of specific inputs from surgeons are also used.  This puts considerable burden on the hospital staff to collect data. Our model is developed using the data from only one hospital, with the general inputs from the physicians and surgeons that are normally entered.  This simplifies the data collection and usage. \n\nThe results we have obtained are comparable to the national statistics from the earlier models.

The benefits of using variable rotor speed for rotorcraft are explored with a rotor speed optimization study using a modified GENHEL model of UH-60A Blackhawk. The optimization results recommend to use the optimal rotor speed in each flight condition to improve the helicopter performance. The efforts are made to accommodate the optimal rotor speed schedule into the flight control system design and also address the stability issues due to the rotor speed variation.\n\nThe rotor speed optimization results show significant performance improvements can be achieved with moderate reductions in rotor speed. The objective of the control design is to accommodate these rotor speed variations,\nwhile achieving desired flying qualities and maneuver performance. A gain scheduled model following/model inversion controller is used to control the roll, pitch, yaw, heave, and rotor speed degrees of freedom. Rotor speed is treated as a redundant control effector for the heave axis, and different control allocation schemes are\ninvestigated. The controllers are evaluated based on step responses and the ADS-33E height response requirement. Results show that dynamic variation in rotor speed can improve maximum climb rate and flying qualities for moderate to large commands in vertical speed, but that non-linear effects present significant challenges when integrating control of the aircraft and the engine. The effects of reduced rotor speeds on stability margins, torque required, and stability issues are also studied.\n\nA power command system in the vertical axis is designed to incorporate variable rotor speed while handling torque limits and other constraints. The vertical axis controller uses a fixed nonlinear mapping to find the combination\nof collective pitch and rotor speed to optimize performance in level flight, climbing/descending flight, and steady turns. In this scheme, the controller is open-loop, making it an inexpensive and reliable solution. The mapping is designed to produce a desired power level for a given pilot input. Thus the mapping can take into account the performance limits associated with the vertical axis such as power limits, torque limits, and maximum rate of descent. A model following controller is implemented for the pitch, roll, and yaw axes. The piloted simulation was performed to evaluate the controller.\n\nThe impact of variable rotor speed on closed loop stability of rotorcraft is discussed. The model following controller can provide high bandwidth control and improve performance using variable rotor speed. However, reduction of rotor speed can result in rotor body coupling and even instability.

A quasi-experimental, three-way completely crossed factorial design was used to analyze data from 838 students in 24 classes in a typical Chinese high school. The students rated four well-selected essays written by their peers using the standard Gaokao (National College Entrance Examination) Chinese Wring Rubric. In this study, knowledge of course content is measured by an exam score in the assessed domain. Training experience is measured by (1) the number of times a student has previously participated in a peer assessment, and (2) whether the student received self-paced training in this study. Motivation of the peer rater is measured by (1) whether they were offered monetary incentives, and (2) whether they have been told about the general benefits of completing peer assessment seriously before conducting the peer assessment in this study.

In 2011, it produced over 70% of the world\u2019s GDP and employed nearly 50% of the world\u2019s labor force. In the United States, those shares were around 80%. Meanwhile, total imports of services reached 6% of the worlds\u2019 GDP, almost 1/3 of total goods imports, and it has been steadily growing at 2.63% per annum since 1995, 54% faster than goods trade. Despite its solid presence, services trade is still missing in most existing trade studies. It is often taken as a closed outside sector whose main purpose is to complete the equilibrium. The goal of this thesis is to demonstrate the importance of services trade to our understanding of comparative advantage and welfare implications of trade. In particular, I will introduce services trade and related data sources, provide benchmark quantifications of the gains from services trade, investigate the evolution of comparative advantage of services industries over time, and discuss how trade in services can interact with market entry and technology to generate interesting labor reallocation across sectors.\nThe main results can be summarized as follows. First, standard gravity models fit services trade well. This allows us to apply the widely popular Eaton and Kortum model to services and estimate services productivities. Second, in a series of counterfactual experiments, the same amount of technological progress or friction reduction in services will lead to 3 to 4 times higher gains from trade than in manufacturing. Next, by estimating productivities for 35 industries, 17 in services, from 1995 to 2000, we found that while comparative advantage was weakened in all sectors, relative convergence among services industries was 75% faster than manufacturing industries on average. Such convergence eliminated 3.9% potential gains from trade from the median country, and reduced total trade volume by 25%. In addition, we estimated the speed of technological diffusion across industries within each country to be 3.6% and that across countries for every industry to be 6.0%. Last but not least, inspired by the negative correlation between trade intensity and employment share found in the swift labor reallocation from manufacturing to services in the U.S. since 2000, we discussed how interactions between entry choice, skill-biased technology, and trade may give rise to interesting patterns of structural transformation.\nThis thesis offers basic quantifications of the macro impact of services trade on welfare and structural transformation. From these basic quantifications, we can infer that promoting services trade will unlock considerable amount of potential gains, much higher than the gains from goods trade. At the same time, strengthening services comparative advantage could further hurt employment in other sectors, particularly manufacturing. Fortunately, the manufacturing comparative advantage of the non-OECD countries has diminished in recent decades, reducing the relative cost of re-industrialization that US and other OECD countries are pursuing. Finally, as more granular services trade data becomes available, better economics and econometrics tools can be applied to improve our quantification and deepen our understanding of services trade for policy considerations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13895], "author_name_tesi": "Guo, Yesheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Guo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yesheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Tybout", "James Tybout", "Stephen Yeaple", "Russell Cooper", "David Abler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Tybout, Dissertation Advisor", "James Tybout, Committee Chair", "Stephen Yeaple, Committee Member", "Russell Cooper, Committee Member", "David Abler, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["International Trade", "Structural Transformation", "Services Trade"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "RELIABLE CONTROL AND ONLINE MONITORING DESIGN FOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANT WITH IRIS DEMONSTRATION", "id": "10758", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6835", "abstract_tesi": "Development and deployment of small-scale nuclear power reactors and their autonomous control and monitoring is part of the mission under the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) program.

First, a reliable LQG controller is obtained by solving ARE and LMI and by using output feedback directly.  The simulation results show that the LQG controller can maintain the system stable when sensors drift in allowable range and perform well in tracking the reference signal. Then, based on the dissipative port-controlled Hamiltonian theory, a nonlinear observer-based feedback dissipation controller for the pressure control of the helical-coil steam generator and a high gain online nonlinear state observer are designed. The asymptotical stability of both the observer-based feedback dissipation controller and the high gain online nonlinear state observer is guaranteed by the dissipation theory.

Besides loss of neurons, gliosis is a common pathological process after brain injury, involving the activation of glial cells to proliferate and become hypertrophic to occupy the injured brain areas. Glial scar inhibits brain functional recovery. \nThe primary objective of this thesis is to demonstrate the proof-of-concept that converting reactive glial cells into functional neurons in injured or diseased brain may provide a potential new approach for brain repair. Glial cells, including astrocytes, NG2 cells, and microglia, undergo reactive response to injury in order to form a defense system against the invasion of micro-organisms and cytotoxins into surrounding tissue. However, once activated, many reactive glial cells will stay in the injury sites and secrete neuroinhibitory factors to prevent neuronal growth, eventually forming glial scar inside the brain. So far, there is little success in the attempt to reverse glial scar after its formation. My recent work demonstrates that reactive glial cells in the cortex of stab-injured or Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) model mice can be directly reprogrammed into functional neurons in vivo, through retroviral expression of a single neural transcription factor, NeuroD1 (Guo et al., 2014). Cortical slice recordings revealed both spontaneous and evoked synaptic responses in NeuroD1-converted-neurons, suggesting that they can integrate into local neural circuits. NeuroD1 expression was also able to reprogram cultured human cortical astrocytes into functional neurons. My studies therefore suggest that direct reprogramming of reactive glial cells into functional neurons in vivo could provide a possible approach for repair of injured or diseased brain.\nThe majority of astrocyte-converted neurons are glutamatergic, raising a concern whether in vivo reprogramming might tilt the excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. Therefore, we further demonstrate that co-expression of NeuroD1 with another neural transcriptional factor Dlx2 efficiently reprograms NG2 glial cells into GABAergic neurons both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the NG2-converted GABAergic neurons in the striatum are different from those converted in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting a regional influence on in vivo reprogramming. Brain slice recordings show that the NG2-converted GABAergic neurons are fully functional, with some firing fast-spiking action potentials, a characteristic feature of parvalbumin interneurons. More importantly, we have regenerated both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the same cortical region by reprogramming astrocytes into glutamatergic neurons and NG2 cells into GABAergic neurons. Thus, my studies demonstrate that different glial cells can be reprogrammed into distinct subtypes of neurons to keep E/I balance and help functional recovery. \nAlthough cellular reconstruction by direct reprogramming makes possible new avenues of treatment for neurodegenerative or neurological disorders, functional recovery may depend critically on specificity of neuronal projection. Due to limited neurons converted by retrovirus, we decided to employ adeno-associated virus (AAV), a powerful transgene system, to deliver transcriptional factors, which can reprogram glial cells into neurons in mouse brains more efficiently than retrovirus. More importantly, those newly generated neurons can extend their axons towards contralateral cortex through corpus callosum or towards ipsilateral thalamus to integrate into global neural network. The converted neurons can survive more than 8 months and maintain their connection.  Another advantage of AAV deliver system is to be able to cross blood-brain-barrier without invasive surgeries. And reprogrammed neurons achieved by intravenous injection of AAV without surgeries will make our technique more convenient for future clinical applications.\nTo conclude, my thesis proves in vivo glia-neuron conversion by proneural gene(s). Such reprogramming approach allows us to generate new neurons and simultaneously reduce reactive glial cells. Furthermore, we can rebalance excitation and inhibition through reprogramming different glial cells into distinct subtypes of neurons. At last, our newly converted neurons project their axons to precise sites where the endogenous neurons do. All these findings together indicate that our in vivo reprogramming might be a possible therapeutic approach for various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11153], "author_name_tesi": "Guo, Ziyuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Guo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ziyuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gong Chen", "Richard W Ordway", "Timothy J Jegla", "Yingwei Mao", "Na Xiong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gong Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Timothy J Jegla, Committee Member", "Yingwei Mao, Committee Member", "Na Xiong, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["In vivo reprogramming", "Brain repair", "NeuroD1", "Dlx2", "E/I balance", "Long-range projection", "Reactive gliosis"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Towards Smarter Flash-based Storage Management For Enterprise Workloads", "id": "16021", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7985", "abstract_tesi": "The fast paced evolution in processor and main memory technology has overshadowed the improvements made in the traditional storage subsystem, worsening the performance bottleneck due to the storage subsystem. Systems have traditionally employed the design philosophy of using storage devices as mere data containers with the real smartness residing within the software stack. Policies regarding data layout, allocation/de-allocation, aggregation, pre-fetching, buffering, etc., have been implemented as different layers of the software stack. However, two complementary trends are warranting a reinvestigation of this division of labor between storage hardware and software. First, significant advances have been made in storage device technology rendering hard disk drive (HDD) based solutions sub-optimal. Second, a growing class of applications have emerged that manipulate large quantities of unstructured/semi-structured data, necessitating newer programming paradigms such as MapReduce. Hence, continuing with this division in the future will pose significant hurdles in eliminating the storage bottleneck. \n\nThis dissertation looks at developing a smarter management system for NAND flash based Solid State Drives (SSDs). The proposed mechanisms incorporate workload characteristics such as temporal and value locality into SSD\u2019s internal data management. This paves the path for improving both the device\u2019s behavior and the overall application performance. Furthermore, the dissertation demonstrates that smarter SSDs capable of performing application specific functions can not only deliver a much higher throughput than traditional ones, but also move the performance bottleneck away from the storage subsystem.\n\nOne of the main bottlenecks of SSDs is the poor performance of random writes. These random writes are especially important in the context of enterprise-scale applications where multiple request streams can intermingle producing a highly randomized workload at the device level. One of the key reasons for the degraded performance is the SSD\u2019s internal management firmware called the Flash Translation Layer (FTL). FTL helps in hiding the idiosyncrasies of NAND flash media by performing logical-to-physical address translation, garbage collection, and wear-leveling. The constrained amount of DRAM present on a SSD forces FTL to manage all or part of the address translations at a coarser granularity. This results in poor garbage collection behavior due to write amplification exacerbated by random writes. We develop a smarter fine-grained FTL scheme called DFTL which selectively caches the most popular address mappings in the on-SSD DRAM, leveraging temporal locality in block level access patterns. This workload awareness within the SSD management software significantly reduces write amplification, improving device\u2019s performance and lifetime. Even though DFTL reduces garbage collection overheads significantly, it does not affect the actual write request patterns on the device. A smarter management layer within the SSD can shape the request patterns, especially the write traffic, thus improving device behavior. This dissertation evaluates workloads such as mail server, home directories, etc., and observes that certain content is accessed preferentially over others. This characteristic is leveraged to design a Content Addressable SSD (CA-SSD) which de-duplicates popular content, reducing writes (including garbage collection related writes) on the SSD, thus improving its endurance and performance.\n\nEven though SSDs offer higher throughput than HDDs, the storage media continues to be the performance bottleneck. However, the presence of processing elements within the SSD coupled with internal parallelism and fast NAND flash interface makes SSDs an attractive choice for migrating application specific functionality within the device. This has the potential to move the bottleneck away from the storage devices. This dissertation develops an optimization framework to demonstrate the advantages of these Smart SSDs for both data transfer and compute-intensive workloads. Smart SSDs reduce data transfer costs over the I/O interconnects. They also provide parallel compute elements, meeting the application demands better than their traditional counterparts.\n\nIn summary, this dissertation provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging workload characteristics and NAND flash properties for building a smarter management system for SSDs. The resultant Smart SSDs improve device performance and endurance as well as reduce the storage bottleneck.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7931, 7932], "author_name_tesi": "Gupta, Aayush ", "last_name_ssi": "Gupta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aayush", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bhuvan Urgaonkar", "Anand Sivasubramaniam", "C Lee Giles", "Jelena Srebric"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Dissertation Advisor", "Anand Sivasubramaniam, Committee Member", "C Lee Giles, Committee Member", "Jelena Srebric, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Storage Systems", "NAND Flash SSDs", "Flash Translation Layer", "Data De-duplication"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Organizational Political Ideology And Firms\u2019 Market And Non-market Behavior", "id": "26152", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11538", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the influence of organizational political ideology on firm\u2019s market and non-market behaviors. I investigate how politically liberal and conservative firms differ in their responses to disruption, either in their external environment, or their internal performance. In the first study, I address the question of how liberal and conservative firms adopt different non-market responses to protest by activist stakeholders. Given that liberal and conservative ideologies differ in their preference for incorporating the interests of diverse stakeholders vs. pursuit of the singular goal of shareholder value creation, I theorize that liberal firms may adopt more substantive concession-based responses to activist protest, whereas conservative firms will adopt more impression-management based responses. At the same time, I expect that activists will anticipate differences in liberal and conservative firms\u2019 proclivities and reflect them in their selection of targets. In the second study, I aim to shed light on how liberal and conservative firms may adopt different preferences regarding divestitures of business units. I propose that due to inherent differences in prevailing conceptions of the firm, liberal firms will be less likely to engage in business unit divestitures during periods of poor firm performance. Further, I theorize that, due to underlying values that engender greater concern for the divested unit and its employees, liberal firms will be more likely to sell the unit to an industry-outsider firm, and less likely to sell the unit to a private equity firm, relative to conservative firms. Lastly, I anticipate that liberal firms\u2019 greater concern for social and human costs involved in divestiture decision-making will lead them to have higher post-divestiture firm performance.

The development of these arrays can be of major significance in the field of biological sensing. The present methods used for creating these nanoscale arrays are based on photo or e-beam lithography and the use of these techniques is expensive in terms of cost and time involved in the fabrication. In this report a simple and easy method is presented which is based on the property of self assembly shown by the diblock copolymers. The property of these self assembled polymer templates to pattern metal nanoparticles is also used. Gold nanoparticles have been used and patterned on the thin films of diblock copolymers replicating the exact pattern at nanometer length scale and spacing as shown by the diblock copolymer thin films. \nFor the first case, thin films of polystyrene-b-polymethylmethacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) diblock copolymer were used for their phase separation property. In this case, the two blocks of PS and PMMA show phase separation and form PS-rich and PMMA-rich domains separated by spacing at nanometer scale. PS forms the matrix and PMMA forms the lying down cylinders parallel to substrate, giving a finger print pattern striped structure. Then the property of preferential attraction of gold nanoparticles to the PS rich domains was used to create gold nanoparticle arrays showing the same nanometer spacing and the striped pattern. These gold particle domains were then used to bind DNA/ oligonucleotide molecules using the gold-thiol linkage chemistry and hence one dimensional nanoscale DNA/ oligonucleotide arrays were synthesized. \nFor the second case, we used the micelle forming property of amphiphilic diblock copolymers in a solvent selective for one of the blocks. For this study polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-PVP) was dissolved in toluene which is a good solvent PS as compared to PVP. Gold nanoparticles deposited on these films were seen replicating the same two dimensional hexagonal closed packing of the micelles with nanometer length scale spacing.

My dissertation comprises of a brief introduction, one conceptual essay, one empirical essay, and a conclusion. The conceptual essay sets the base for the second empirical essay. For the empirical essay, I collect primary survey data using an online panel of key account managers across multiple industries and firms to investigate the spillover effect of intrafirm relational ties network on the interfirm buyer-seller relational ties network and seller\u2019s performance.\n\tIn the first essay, I consider, in the context of key account management, (1) the relationship between various governance mechanisms (namely, process control, output control, proscriptive norms and prescriptive norms) available to buyer and seller firms to manage the interfirm relationships and seller\u2019s performance, (2) how the relationship between these governance mechanisms and seller\u2019s performance is affected by identity multiplicity and coordination complexity stemming from knowledge and resource diversity within the selling team (intrafirm aspects), and (3) solutions specific to key account management setting (namely, identity shaping, identity highlighting and centralization) to overcomes issues of identity multiplicity and coordination complexity and improve the relationship between governance mechanisms and seller\u2019s performance.\n\tIn the second essay, I use network conceptualization to evaluate the combined effect of intrafirm consultation network (used to evaluate the knowledge utilization and creation processes) within the selling team and interfirm communication network (used to evaluate information exchange) between buyer and seller firms on seller\u2019s performance. I provide theoretical predictions and empirical evidence that there is a spillover effect of intrafirm consultation network on the interfirm communication network. I show that certain intrafirm network structure and interfirm network structure when combined together improve seller\u2019s performance by 4%-8%.

Reliable predictive models for these devices must not only represent each individual physical process (combustion, turbulence and radiation) with high accuracy, but also must capture the highly nonlinear interactions among these processes. In this work, a comprehensive computational tool is developed for numerical modeling of turbulent combustion systems with accurate representation of turbulence, chemistry, turbulence-chemistry interaction (TCI), radiation, and turbulence-radiation interaction (TRI).  \nA hybrid finite-volume (FV)/particle-Monte-Carlo procedure is employed wherein a compressible FV Large-Eddy simulation (LES) formulation with a composition filtered-density function (FDF) method is used to model turbulence-chemistry interactions (TCI) and emission TRI. Nongray radiation and absorption TRI is modeled through a photon Monte Carlo (PMC) method where stochastic schemes are developed for treating thermal radiation in a turbulent flow field characterized by the notional particles of the Lagrangian-FDF method. LES/FDF/PMC computations are computationally highly expensive, and a novel \"computational time-map\"-based domain-decomposition technique is implemented in this study for effective parallelization of the computational code. A nonpremixed methane/air flame is simulated to demonstrate the accuracy of the code developed here.\nSince LES is inherently time-dependent, the PMC solution at each time step needs to be reasonably reflective of the instantaneous fields to preserve the transient nature of LES, which might require considering large number of photon bundles. Investigations are made in this work for a wide range of flames to estimate the statistical uncertainties in the PMC solution for various number of photon bundles for an instantaneous LES/FDF snapshot. The time-averaged solution is also compared for different bundle sizes.\nThe effect of thermal radiation appears as a source term in the energy equation, which consists of filtered emission and filtered absorption terms in the LES context. In LES, since only large scales are explicitly resolved, the contribution of subfilter-scale (SFS) fluctuations to filtered emission and absorption terms (referred to as SFS emission TRI and SFS absorption TRI, respectively) need to be modeled. The importance of SFS TRI is assessed here for a wide range of flames.\nA state-of-the-art, advanced LES-based numerical tool for comprehensive modeling of turbulent reacting flows, encompassing all key processes in detail, has become available for the first time as a result of this work. An effective parallelization scheme is implemented in the code that scales well irrespective of the computational cost for chemistry calculations. Stochastic PMC schemes are devised that are consistent with the notional particle representation of the FDF method. It is estimated that approximately three-to-four photon bundles per grid-cell are sufficient to ensure accurate time-averaged solutions for a wide range of flames (ranging from small, optically thin to relatively-large, optically thick). SFS emission TRI is found to be more important than resolved emission TRI for all flames for a grid resolution that is representative of engineering meshes, whereas SFS absorption TRI is found to be negligible for all flames.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [495], "author_name_tesi": "Gupta, Ankur ", "last_name_ssi": "Gupta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ankur", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Connell Haworth", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Michael F Modest", "Stephen R Turns", "Philip John Morris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Connell Haworth, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Chair", "Michael F Modest, Committee Chair", "Stephen R Turns, Committee Member", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Filtered-density function", "Photon Monte Carlo", "Turbulence-radiation interaction", "Large-eddy simulation", "Combustion", "Thermal radiation", "Turbulence-chemistry interaction", "Probability density function"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EFFICIENT AND SCALABLE BIOLOGICALLY PLAUSIBLE SPIKING NEURAL NETWORKS WITH LEARNING APPLIED TO VISION\n", "id": "11372", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "574", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Spiking neural networks are more biologically plausible than rate-based neural networks. By incorporating the aspect of time into the model itself, spiking networks are more like biological neural circuits. However, learning methods for spiking neural networks are not as well developed as for the rate-based networks.  In this thesis, it is shown that spiking neural networks can be trained to solve computer vision problems using biologically plausible learning methods. For this, a Hebbian learning method based on spike time dependent plasticity is developed and implemented on different problems. The algorithms proposed have been used to simulate billions of synapses on a laptop and are shown to be efficient and scalable. The largest simulation on a laptop had about 1.5 billion synapses. This method is implemented in a hierarchical network architecture containing only spiking neurons with simple cells combining to form more specialized cells similar to the visual processing in non-human primates. This is in contrast to other approaches, which do not use only spiking neurons and/or use non-biology-based learning methods. The processing in the present approach is feed-forward. Thus, it is very fast. Experimental evidence supports feed-forward processing at least in the initial stages of visual processing in the primate brain. \nThe network and the learning method developed in this work is tested on various cases such as trained on Gabor like cells, LED numbers, and also the MNIST database, which consists of handwritten digits. Simulations on simple cells revealed bell-shaped tuning curves of cells similar to those observed experimentally in the V1, and MT/V5 area of cats and non-human primate brains. Results on the MNIST dataset showed that digits such as 1, 2, and 4 were easier to recognize than digits such as 3, 6, and 5, which is probably because the former have simpler features than the latter. An accuracy of 89% on the MNIST dataset is obtained using a semi-supervised learning approach. The results are encouraging considering only spiking neurons were used throughout, including learning. This work is important as it demonstrates that an all-spiking neural-network approach with only spike-time based learning can solve engineering problems without the use of other traditional learning methods. \nThe network is also extended to process color images. Color is often ignored in visual processing codes due to the complexity involved. The opponent channels theory for color processing is used and preliminary results using color images of fruits are reported. The results suggest that the network is able to correctly identify fruits not just based on shape but also based on color.   \nFor simulations, a new software called CSpike for simulating spiking neural networks is developed in this thesis. The software is developed using C++ in an object oriented manner exploiting object-oriented programming principles of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation so that it is easy to understand, maintain and modify in future. The Qt application development framework is used for handling images. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [571], "author_name_tesi": "Gupta, Ankur ", "last_name_ssi": "Gupta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ankur", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lyle Norman Long", "Lyle Norman Long", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Dr Robert T Collins", "William Evan Higgins", "John C Collins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lyle Norman Long, Dissertation Advisor", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Chair", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Chair", "Dr Robert T Collins, Committee Member", "William Evan Higgins, Committee Member", "John C Collins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biologically plausible learning", "spiking neural networks", "scalable", "vision"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Raman Scattering from n-Graphene Layers (nGLs; n = 1, 2, 3 ...)\n", "id": "9489", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "187", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis addresses the Raman scattering from graphene and n-Graphene Layers(nGLs), where n represent the number of layers in the few-graphene-layer flakes.

Many of the Raman bands exhibit linear dispersion, i.e., d&#969;/dE=constant, where &#969; is the Raman peak frequency and E is the excitation photon frequency. This dispersive behavior stems from DR which involeved the dispersion of the electronic and phonon states. We find dispersion in the\nrange of -40< d&#969;/dE <180 cm-1. We used dispersive Raman peaks of graphene to map out phonon dispersion of graphene and compare it with theoretical calculations. We also find that the frequencies of these Raman peaks changes systematic with n which indicate that they are sensitive to distant interlayer interactions (Chapter 5).\n\nWe studied the effect of the substrate on the Raman scattering of nGLs by performing Raman scattering on suspended nGL films. We find suspended nGLs to show significant differences in Raman scattering of nGLs, presumably intrinsic properties that are not perturbed by the underlying substrate.

New G-bands, more similar to those observed in 1.2 - 1.6 nm diameter single-walled nanotubes than those observed in graphene. We discuss the activation of these new Raman modes in narrow GNRs in terms of transverse phonon confinement. Interestingly, several of these GNRs were observed to NOT exhibit\na D-band (Chapter 9).\n\nOur Raman scattering studies on skewed bi-layer graphene (SkBL) reveal an altogether different Raman spectrum from that seen in commensurately stacked bilayers (CBL) or monolayer graphene. We find that SkBL activates a new band (\u201cI-band\u201d) for\nsp2 bonded carbon near ~1350 cm-1 which has two components I1 and I2: I1 is dispersive at ~50 cm-1/eV, while I2 exhibits little or no  ispersion. These Raman peaks are not due to the ordinary D-band scattering in sp2 carbons which is normally associated with defects. Within a double-resonant model of Raman scattering these unusual features are consistent with a skewed bilayer coupling, wherein one layer imposes a weak but well ordered perturbation on the other. The discrete Fourier structure of the skewed interlayer interaction potential explains the unusual non-dispersive peak near 1350 cm-1 (Chapter 10).\n\nWe also investigated the effect of curvature in graphene and find that curvature in\ngraphene induced a significant D-band in Raman scattering. We also showed that these\nfold can be treated as a one-dimensional defects. These experimental were also supported\nby theoretical calculations (Chapter 11).\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [186], "author_name_tesi": "Gupta, Awnish K", "last_name_ssi": "Gupta", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Awnish", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Peter C Eklund", "Peter C Eklund", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Milton Walter Cole", "Angela Lueking"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof Peter C Eklund, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter C Eklund, Committee Chair", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "Milton Walter Cole, Committee Member", "Angela Lueking, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Incommensuratation", "Raman Scattering", "Nano Ribbions", "nGLs", "Graphene", "Defect Scattering"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PERSONALIZED AND EFFICIENT TOP-K SPATIAL OBJECT RECOMMENDATION IN LOCATION BASED SOCIAL NETWORKS", "id": "11575", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2106", "abstract_tesi": "Location Based Social Networks (LBSNs) have become popular among people in recent\ntimes.

The ferroelectric (FE) material in the gate stack of the FEFET exhibits negative capacitance resulting in voltage step up action which entails sub-60mV/decade sub-threshold swing at room temperature. The thickness of the FE layer (T\u00ac\u00acFE) is an important design parameter, governing the device-circuit operation. This thesis extensively analyzes the impact of TFE on the characteristics of FEFET devices and circuits and presents important design insights for logic and SRAM design.  While it is well known that increasing T\u00ac\u00acFE yields higher gain albeit with the possibilities of introducing hysteresis, our analysis points to other unconventional effects arising from TFE optimization. Depending on the attributes of the underlying transistor, increasing TFE beyond a certain value may lead to loss in saturation and/or negative differential resistance in the output characteristics.  While the former effect results in the loss in gain of a logic gate, the latter yields hysteretic voltage transfer characteristics. We also discuss the effect of T\u00ac\u00acFE on the inherent polarization lag in the FE with respect to the applied voltage and its important consequences on the circuit performance. We show that for high TFE, the delay of the circuit may increase with an increase in supply voltage. We also observe that SRAMs based on FEFETs show better performance in terms of access time and read/hold stabilities but at the cost of higher write time. All these factors need to be considered while optimizing TFE for logic and memory applications. With proper TFE optimization, FEFETs show an immense promise yielding 25% lower energy at iso-delay for supply voltages < 0.25 V.

Mice that are deficient for PERK recapitulate all the defects seen in WRS, including PND. Previous work had shown that diabetes linked with PERK-deficiency resulted from insulin insufficiency because of decreased proliferation of beta-cells and insulin secretion. However, the molecular and cellular basis for the decreased insulin secretion had not been determined. A substantial fraction of PERK-deficient beta-cells exhibit a highly abnormal cellular phenotype characterized by grossly distended Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and retention of proinsulin. In order to determine the cause of this aberrant sub-cellular phenotype, we investigated over-synthesis, lack of Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation (ERAD) and defects in ER to Golgi trafficking as possible causes. ER functions of PERK were investigated in islets isolated from mice in which Perk was impaired or gene dosage modulated. However, when more cellular material was called for, cell-lines where PERK function was ablated using dominant negative and RNA interference strategies were used. The Ins2+/Akita mutant mice (with high levels of turnover of mutant and wildtype proinsulin) were used as a model system to test the role of PERK in ERAD. The severe diabetes associated with PERK deficiency was initially interpreted to be caused by de-repressed protein synthesis and consequently, a failure to regulate the ER stress response leading to apoptotic cell death of the insulin secreting beta-cells. This speculation arose from previous studies of PERK in fibroblast cell culture, which demonstrated that PERK was an important regulator of the ER stress-Unfolded Protein Response pathway in fibroblasts. Contrary to the expectation that the abnormal cellular phenotype was due to runaway protein synthesis, we found that loss of PERK function does not lead to uncontrolled protein synthesis. Instead, we found impairments in ER to Golgi anterograde trafficking, retrotranslocation from the ER to the cytoplasm and proteasomal degradation; the latter two processes being required for proinsulin quality control. We also found that PERK was required to maintain the integrity of the ER and Golgi, and their membrane-lipid composition. Surprisingly, reducing PERK gene dosage led to an amelioration in the progression of mice expressing misfolded proinsulin (Akita insulin mutants) towards diabetes. This, too, is contrary to the uncontrolled ER stress hypothesis as these mice should theoretically suffer from increased ER stress and have a more rapid progression to diabetes. These results suggest that PERK is a positive regulator of ERAD. We therefore, speculate that PERK acts as a metabolic sensor in the insulin-secreting beta-cells to modulate the trafficking and quality control of proinsulin in the ER relative to the physiological demands for circulating insulin. Additionally, PERK signaling has been found to be an important factor in determining growth and angiogenesis of specific types of tumors. Tumor growth is dependent upon high rates of protein synthesis, and previous studies had shown that control of protein synthesis mediated by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2\u00e1 was important for tumor progression. These studies had also shown that tumor implants into nude mice (that lacked PERK-mediated signaling) tended to be smaller. However, the dramatic reduction in growth of the PERK-deficient tumors was attributed to increased rates of apoptotic cell death and impaired angiogenesis but, inexplicably, tumor cell proliferation rates were not examined. To study this question, the SV40 Large T-antigen (Tag) was genetically introduced into the insulin secreting beta-cells of Perk KO mice and their wild type littermates under the control of an inducible promoter. We discovered that the induction of insulinomas in PERK KO mice could rescue the hypoinsulinemia and diabetes in these mice by increasing beta-cell mass. However, while inducing beta-cell proliferation was sufficient to rescue the hypoinsulinemia, we found that beta-cell proliferation was reduced in PERK-deficient mice associated with reduced tumor growth and far fewer tumors. In the small number of large encapsulated insulinomas that developed in PERK-deficient mice, we found a prominent reduction in tumor vascularity compared to similar sized insulinomas in wild-type mice. This led me to conclude that PERK has two roles in the development of beta-cell insulinomas. First, to support rapid cell proliferation during the initial transition to islet hyperplasia and later to promote angiogenesis during the progression to late-stage encapsulated tumors. Cell proliferation and membrane targeting of angiogenic receptors (e.g. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptors) are highly dependent upon normal ER functions. We hypothesize that reduced proliferation and vascularity in PERK-deficient insulinomas is related to defects in ER functions and intacellular anterograde trafficking that we have recently identified.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5816], "author_name_tesi": "Gupta, Sounak ", "last_name_ssi": "Gupta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sounak", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener", "Douglas Cavener", "Robert Paulson", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Kouacou Konan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Chair", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Kouacou Konan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DIABETES", "TRAFFICKING", "PERK", "INSULINOMA", "ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM", "PROINSULIN"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION OF POST-TRANSITION, MAIN-GROUP, HETEROATOMIC CLUSTERS USING MASS SPECTROMETRY, ANION PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY AND VELOCITY MAP IMAGING\n\n", "id": "10429", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6366", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Clusters are group of atoms combined together by covalent or van der Waals interactions, and are usually restricted to the sub-nanometer to nanometer range, where the number of atoms are defined accurately. Properties of clusters can be altered by changing the number of atoms or their composition or geometry. This presents a unique opportunity to create cluster assembled materials, in which bulk properties can be tuned based on the inherent property of the cluster building blocks. The main focus of the research work presented in this thesis is to use experimental observations to identify clusters that are stable and can be used as building blocks, and determine why they are stable. Once the cluster stability has been rationalized, the results are confirmed using first principles theoretical calculations performed by research collaborators at Virginia Commonwealth University. \nThe clusters are synthesized using a laser vaporization cluster source, separated based on their mass/charge ratio using the time-of-flight mass spectrometer and characterized using the magnetic-bottle photoelectron spectrometer and a velocity-map photoelectron imaging spectrometer. \nIt is illustrated, in a synergistic approach, that by using bismuth as a dopant to tin clusters, Zintl clusters with both aromatic and antiaromatic character can be designed. In all clusters, it is found that the aromatic character originates from the combination of the s-electrons, while the antiaromatic character evolves from the interaction of the p-electrons from the bismuth and tin atoms. The singly doped tin cluster Sn4Bi- is stable and aromatic in character with an electronic structure that mimics the Zintl cluster Sn52-. The agreement between vertical and adiabatic detachment energy from the negative ion photodetachment spectra and theoretical calculations confirm the ground state structures of the clusters. \nStudies of nine atom bismuth doped tin clusters established that highly charged Zintl ions, observed in the condensed phase, can be stabilized as isolated gas phase clusters through atomic substitution that preserves the overall electron count but reduces the net charge and thereby avoids instability due to Coulomb repulsion. Mass spectrometry studies reveal that Sn8Bi-, Sn7Bi2- and Sn6Bi3- exhibit higher abundances than neighboring species and photoelectron spectra show that all of these heteroatomic gas phase Zintl analogues (GPZAs) have high adiabatic electron detachment energies. Sn6Bi3- is found to be a particularly stable cluster, having a large HOMO-LUMO gap. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Sn6Bi3- cluster is isoelectronic with the well known Sn9-4 Zintl ion, however the fluxionality reported for Sn9-4 is suppressed by substituting Sn atoms with Bi atoms. Thus, while the electronic stability of the clusters is dominated by electron count, the size and position of the atoms affects the dynamics of the cluster as well. \nIn another study, evidence is presented that the HOMO-LUMO gap can be tuned (1.12 eV-1.89 eV) by changing the Ga composition of Bi3Gay neutral and anionic clusters, some of which display special stability. The Bi3Ga2- cluster is very stable with a large calculated HOMO-LUMO gap of 1.89 eV, and can be viewed as a gas phase Zintl analogue of Sn52-, already synthesized in the solution phase. The stability of Bi3Ga2- is further attributed to the fact that it has 12 valence electrons and possesses a closo structure in agreement with Wade\u2019s rules. \nIt is also shown that In2Bi- is a triatomic cluster anion with a bent structure, where bismuth is the bridging atom between the two indium atoms. It is found that 6 p-electrons (2 &#960; and 4&#963;) are delocalized over the cluster. The In-Bi bond lengths in In2Bi- are identical to bond lengths of In3Bi, which is an all-metal aromatic analogue to Al3Bi, and are shorter than the rest of InxBiy- clusters, showing the presence of a higher bond order. Therefore, the concept of delocalization of electrons in a chain structure can be applied to an all-metal system.\nThe electronic and structural properties of neutral and negatively charged BixIny (x \u2013 1-4, y = 1-6) clusters are also presented. The experimental and theoretical adiabatic and vertical detachment energies of the anionic species are reported. Among the BixIny series many clusters are found to exhibit a special stability and exhibit a large HOMO-LUMO gap in the range of 0.95 to 1.98 eV. This stability is rationalized by different mechanisms. Bi2In- is classified as a gas phase Zintl species despite only having three atoms, making it the smallest possible case. Bi3In2-, with 12 valence electrons and a closo structure in agreement with Wade\u2019s rules, is similar to Bi3Ga2-, a gas phase Zintl analogue of Sn52-. Bi4In- and Bi4In2 are also identified as gas phase Zintl clusters. BiIn3 is a cyclic planar molecule similar to BiGa3 and BiAl3, all-metal aromatic systems. Additionally, an even odd oscillation of the HOMO-LUMO gap, formation energy and adiabatic electron affinities is found correlating with the open-shell/closed-shell nature of the clusters.\nIn this thesis the identification of numerous stable clusters has been made. The experimental design has proven to be a powerful technique for this purpose, and these clusters can be considered as candidates for cluster assembled materials applications going forward. However, to encourage synthetic efforts, an understanding of the reasons for stability is crucial. For this reason, each stable cluster has been rationalized within a theoretical model. In particular, the model of gas phase Zintl analogues has been constructed to rationalize gas phase behavior by using established rules in condensed phase chemistry. The more common models of aromaticity and the Jellium model have also been used to explain the behavior of stable clusters experimentally observed. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6366], "author_name_tesi": "Gupta, Ujjwal ", "last_name_ssi": "Gupta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ujjwal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Mark Maroncelli", "John V Badding", "Nitin Samarth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Chair", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Photoelectron spectroscopy metal clusters velocity"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Vehicle Localization Using Low-Accuracy GPS, IMU and Map-Aided Vision\n\n", "id": "9573", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6443", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation describes the development of vehicle state estimation methods using low-cost sensors, their implementation, and comparison with highly accurate vehicle state estimators available today. This research was motivated by the problem of navigating a vehicle on a highway, where it is desirable to closely measure the vehicle's state (absolute position and orientation, rotation rates etc.) to achieve electronic stability control, collision avoidance, driver alert systems for lane departure and ultimately autonomous navigation. The focus in this thesis is to develop low-cost methods for vehicle localization. Low-cost Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) sensor systems have been used to this effect.\n\nA framework is developed to combine measurements from Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Performance of a low-cost GPS receiver operating in autonomous mode integrated with a MEMS based low-cost IMU is investigated. The error sources in GPS and INS systems are characterized to choose suitable stochastic models for the error sources and to identify parameters for these models. Vehicle velocity vector is used to improve the yaw angle estimate under low yaw angle observability conditions.\n\nTo obtain an independent direct measurement of the vehicle orientation, a novel method based on terrain-aided vision is developed. This method is based on matching images captured from an on-vehicle camera to a rendered representation of the surrounding terrain obtained from an on-board map database. United States Geographical Survey Digital Elevation Maps (DEMs) were used to create a 3D topology map of the geography surrounding the vehicle. The horizon lines seen in the captured video from the vehicle are compared to the horizon lines obtained from the rendered geography, allowing absolute comparisons between rendered and actual scene in roll, pitch and yaw.\n\nWork on terrain-aided vision based orientation estimation has been extended to use near field features like road signs and road markers. Near field features allow the measurement of vehicle position in addition to vehicle orientation. A map-aided vision algorithm is presented which registers features in the rendered images with features in real images using gradient-based minimization of sum of squared intensities.

Although PZT has excellent piezoelectric properties and it has nearly completed its optimization from the industrial viewpoint, PZT and lead-based piezoelectric materials are no longer welcome in piezoelectric applications. The problem revealed when the environmental concerns rose in the last 15 years. Lead (Pb) is a known toxic material for human health and the environment. This fact was also stated by restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) recently in 2006 by the European Union (EU) and alternative lead-free piezoelectric materials have became important. As a result, lead-free piezoelectric materials have been extensively studied in the past decade. However, high power characteristics of the lead-free materials under equilibrium conditions have not been looked into in the literature. This thesis enlightens high power characteristics of a sodium-potassium-niobate (NKN) based ceramic and its application as a candidate material for piezoelectric transformers by comparing to PZT. (Na0.5K0.5)(Nb0.97Sb0.03)O3 was prepared with 1.5% mol CuO addition. Disk-shaped and rectangular plate samples were sintered with conventional sintering methods. High power characteristics were investigated with our high power piezoelectric characterization system (HiPoCS). Distinctly different from PZTs, the disk-shaped NKN ceramics did not exhibit a decrease in mechanical quality factor (Qm) with increasing vibration velocity (up to 0.4 m/s). The rectangular plate NKN ceramics showed a different trend in mechanical quality factor (Qm). In these ceramics, Qm decreased with increasing vibration velocity. This behavior is superior to the one in PZTs because the maximum vibration velocity (vrms measured with 20\u00b0C increase of the temperature on the nodal point) obtained in the NKN ceramics was 0.8 m/s. Ring-dot piezoelectric transformers made from disk-shaped NKN ceramics, revealed power density as high as 25 W/cm3 at the matching impedance point, comparable to that obtained for the conventional PZT transformers. In conclusion, the NKN ceramics possess better high power characteristics\ncompared to PZT, which qualify it to be an alternative lead-free piezoelectric material for piezoelectric transformers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1690], "author_name_tesi": "Gurdal, Erkan Ahmet", "last_name_ssi": "Gurdal", "middle_name_ssi": "Ahmet", "first_name_ssi": "Erkan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino", "Kenji Uchino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino, Thesis Advisor", "Kenji Uchino, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["transformer", "high power", "lead-free", "Piezoelectric"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "High Power Characterization Oflead-free Piezoelectric Ceramics", "id": "23674", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10719", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lead-based piezoelectric ceramics have dominated piezoelectric applications. Lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) is especially suitable for a wide range of piezoelectric applications such as: sensors, sonars, and ultrasonic motors. This is because PZT has excellent piezoelectric properties and its compositional optimization for specific applications is well studied. However, lead-based materials are no longer welcome in electronic applications due to environmental concerns. Therefore, the research for finding alternative lead-free piezoelectric ceramics has been expanded in the past decade. \nOne of the major piezoelectric application types is the high power application such as sonars and piezoelectric transformers. High power conditions cause degradation in material performance and heat dissipation due to increased non-linearity and losses in the material. However, the majority of the lead-free ceramic reports are focused on material properties measured at low power levels. This creates an ambiguity in the reported candidate materials\u2019 actual high power potential.\nConsidering the material properties measured at low power conditions, perovskite type hard-lead-free piezoelectric materials seem to have good high power potentials. Consequently, disk-shape (kp mode) hard-lead-free piezoelectric ceramics, two Bi-perovskite compositions and one alkali-niobate-based composition, were characterized at high power conditions under continuous excitation. Then, mechanical quality factors (Qm: QA at resonance and QB at anti-resonance), and temperature increase (\u2206T) were analyzed as a function of vibration velocity (vrms). \nCu-doped (Na0.5K0.5)(Nb0.97Sb0.03)O3 (NKN-Cu) ceramics did not show any degradation in their mechanical quality factors (QA and QB) up to their maximum vibration velocity (vrms=vmax=0.45 m/s @ \u2206T=20\u02daC), where hard-PZTs typically showed vmax=0.3 m/s with immediate degradation in QA and QB. Different QA and QB trends (NKN-Cu: QA\u2245QB and hard-PZT: QA<QB) showed that NKN-Cu suffered less from the piezoelectric loss (tan \u03b8) compared to hard-PZT. Two Mn-doped Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-based Bi-perovsikte ceramics: BNT-BT-BNMN and BNKLT-Mn also showed superior high power performances (vmax>0.5 m/s) compared to hard-PZT. QA and QB trends (i.e. QA>QB) were completely different from both NKN-Cu and hard-PZT, indicating a very low piezoelectric loss (tan \u03b8\u2019). These ceramics were also compared from the mechanical energy density viewpoint to eliminate the density and vibration mode effects. Even though hard-PZT was able to produce higher mechanical energy density than lead-free ceramics at identical vibration velocity, lead-free ceramics were still able to keep their stable behavior at high mechanical energy density levels.\nRing-dot piezoelectric transformers (PTs) were produced from the NKN-Cu ceramics. Even though the transformer design was not completely optimized, NKN-Cu ring-dot PTs had considerably high output power density (P=25 W/cm3) compared to typical PZT ring-dot transformers, where optimized designs in the literature could reach output power density levels up around 40 W/cm3.\nDoping is one of the effective ways to influence domain wall motion and the material properties, especially in lead-based systems. Based on the domain stabilization studies in PZT, most low valence (acceptor) dopants can stabilize domain configuration via creation of oxygen vacancies, which is called the hardening effect. However, common acceptor dopants in lead-systems (e.g. Mn and Fe) do not seem to be as effective as Cu in hardening of the lead-free NKN system. \nThe NKN system was doped with Yb, Ni, Mn, and Cu. Pellets were sintered around 1100\u02daC for 3 hours in ambient atmosphere. Polarization (P-E) and elastic strain (S-E) hysteresis loops were measured before and after poling to study the hardening in NKN via internal bias field (Ei). Doping enhanced both coercive and internal bias fields overall. NKN-Cu and NKN-Mn showed hard characteristics with lower dielectric losses (tan \u03b4\u22640.01) and higher mechanical quality factors (Qm\u2265300) when compared to the other doped and base NKN ceramics. Cu-doped NKN ceramics had the highest internal bias field and mechanical quality factor (Ei=0.37 kV/mm and Qm=420). Bias field and mechanical quality factor were proportional at high Ei levels. At low Ei levels (Ei<0.1 kV/mm), hardening mechanism was not clear. At higher Ei levels (Ei>0.1 kV/mm), increase in mechanical quality factor thus the hardening was proportional to the created internal bias field in the structure. This result indicated a possibility of a minimum internal bias field level required to stabilize the domain wall structure in NKN ceramics. Moreover, interesting results were obtained in S-E hysteresis loops for Cu-doped and Mn-doped NKN ceramics. Switching fields obtained from S-E hysteresis loops were different compared to the ones obtained from P-E hysteresis loops. This difference was an indication of complex domain wall dynamics in hard-NKN ceramics. These ceramics were also characterized at high power conditions. NKN-Cu and NKN-Mn showed more stable behaviors at increased excitation conditions compared to PZT4 type ceramics, which had similar hardness level.\nIn short, the distinct high power behaviors of lead-free piezoelectric ceramics make them very promising for high power applications. Hard-lead-free piezoelectric ceramics were able to reach high excitation levels without increasing their temperatures and degrading their mechanical quality factors dramatically. Hard-lead-free piezoelectric ceramics possessed superior high power performances compared to hard-PZT piezoelectric ceramics. Additionally, hard-lead-free piezoelectric ceramics showed differences in their losses mechanisms. Piezoelectric loss was not dominant in hard-lead-free piezoelectric ceramics in general compared to hard-PZT, where the piezoelectric loss was proven to be significantly large.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10349], "author_name_tesi": "Gurdal, Erkan Ahmet", "last_name_ssi": "Gurdal", "middle_name_ssi": "Ahmet", "first_name_ssi": "Erkan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino", "Kenji Uchino", "Clive A Randall", "Shujun Zhang", "Wenwu Cao", "Qiming Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenji Uchino, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Shujun Zhang, Committee Member", "Wenwu Cao, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lead-Free Piezoelectric Ceramics", "High Power Characterization", "Piezoelectric Transformer", "Hardening", "Doping"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Characterization of Clostridium perfringens Beta2 toxin\n", "id": "8207", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Clostridium perfringens, a gram positive, sporulating anaerobic bacterium is responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases in animals and humans. Clostridium perfringens-mediated hemorrhagic enteritis and enterotoxemias in livestock, domestic animals, aquatic species and birds have imposed significant economic impact on animal husbandry. The anaerobic, nutrient-enriched environment of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract serves as an ideal habitat for the C. perfringens to proliferate and attain a disease inducing potential. The pathogenesis of the C. perfringens mediated enteric diseases can be attributed to the well characterized, lethal membrane active toxins such as alpha, beta, epsilon, iota, enterotoxin and perfringolysin O. \nIn recent years, a variant of the C. perfringens beta toxin known as beta2 has been widely reported as one of the causative agents in C. perfringens related enteric diseases. The clinical symptoms of beta2 toxin induced enterotoxemias are characterized by watery sporadic diarrhea, edema of affected tissues and loss of body weight. The role of beta2 toxin in the causation of enterotoxemias and or haemorrhagic/necrotic enteritis in humans, domestic animals, birds and aquatic species has generated considerable interest in the field of human and veterinary medicine. \nClostridium perfringens beta2 has been reported as an accessory toxin and may act in synergy with other major toxins of the C. perfringens in the production of necrotic and hemorrhagic enteritis. The beta2 toxin may play a role in hindering the process of nutrient absorption in the intestine and thereby debilitating affected animals. \nIt is strongly speculated that a sudden change in the gut Microbiolflora or the intestinal physiological equilibrium may lead to clostridial disease outbreak. Studies that report on C. perfringens beta2 producing isolates from healthy animals suggest that beta2 toxin as a potential health hazard. \n Very few studies have reported the biophysical and molecular biological properties of the beta2 toxin in detail. It has been hypothesized that the mechanism of the beta2 toxin induced enteritis could include direct effects on transport of ions in the intestinal epithelial cells through membrane binding or pore formation. It is felt that experiments that focus on studying the cytotoxicity of beta2 toxin could lead to better understanding of beta2 toxin in context of C. perfringens related enterotoxemias. Based on these reported findings, elucidation of the molecular and biological properties of beta2 toxin would be of significant value to researchers towards developing a targeted epitope vaccine. \nClostridium perfringens are toxinotyped into types A-E by conventional bacteriology and PCR based confirmation techniques. Owing to the widespread distribution of C. perfringens toxinotypes and its epidemiological significance a highly sensitive diagnostic tool that replaces the conventional PCR is required. In food animal practice, active immunoprophylaxis against C. perfringens is achieved by use of commercial toxoid vaccines against types B, C and D. There are no published reports on vaccines conferring immunity against beta2 toxin.\nThe primary objectives of this dissertation are (1) develop a molecular based toxin typing technique for C. perfringens which has practical application in a diagnostic laboratory and aid in conducting molecular epidemiological studies, (2) Elucidate the structure and function of beta2 toxin, 3) Evaluate in vitro the cytotoxic properties of beta2 toxin, and 4) Evaluate the role of beta2 synthetic lipopeptide vaccine in a challenge study in the mouse model.  \n\tThe results of our study revealed a high prevalence and distribution of C. perfringens beta2 toxin encoding strains in feces of lactating cattle. Among the five toxinotypes, toxinotype A was widely distributed among seven dairy herds screened by multiplex Real time PCR assay. We successfully used a GST fusion system for expression of recombinant beta2 toxin. The purified recombinant toxin was shown to be cytotoxic to CaCo2 cell line at concentration of more than 10 &#61549;g/ml. the toxin treated cells exhibited cytopathic effects such as cell rounding, membrane blebbing and leakage of cytoplasm. These results could suggest that the C. perfringens beta2 toxin could act as one of the pore forming toxins. A monoclonal antibody raised against beta2 toxin completely neutralized the cytopathic effects of the toxin on CaCo2 cells. \n\tTo study the physical structure of the beta2 toxin, recombinant beta2 toxin was crystallized in buffer comprising of 32-36% PEG in one week. Preliminary crystallographic analysis of the recombinant beta2 toxin suggested the crystals of the toxin belonged to space group R3. The triangular prism shaped crystals diffracted up to 2.9\u00c5 resolution and measured up to 200 Microbiolns in size. A novel approach of developing and evaluating a synthetic lipopeptide vaccine against C. perfringens beta2 toxin was demonstrated as part of this study. The lipopeptide conjugate chemically linked to Pam2Cys, successfully elicited a strong protective response in subcutaneously immunized mice. The immune response was characterized as mixed Th1 and Th2 response to the synthetic lipopeptide vaccine.\n\t It is anticipated that the results of our study will provide animal agriculture with an alternate approach to protect food producing animals against C. perfringens infections. The study will lead to the development and the standardization of a real-time PCR based technique to identify and quantify the various toxigenic strains of C. perfringens directly from clinical samples. The structure and function studies demonstrated in our study will provide a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of beta2 toxin and the development of a safe and effective vaccine against beta2 toxin. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6], "author_name_tesi": "Gurjar, Abhijit Arun", "last_name_ssi": "Gurjar", "middle_name_ssi": "Arun", "first_name_ssi": "Abhijit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao", "Avery August", "Blake Peterson", "Arthur Hattel", "Brenda C Love"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Blake Peterson, Committee Member", "Arthur Hattel, Committee Member", "Brenda C Love, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["beta2", "perfringens", "Clostridium", "toxin"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Effect of Religious Salience on Attempting Online Dating", "id": "20095", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9639", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Online dating has become a viable option for mate selection in recent times.

Scholars theorize that families and religious communities rely on each other to thrive, so this interdependency should also exist on the micro level through social ties. Nonetheless, questions remain. Specifically, how do family relationships impact friendships within religious congregations and vice versa? Do families turn to congregational friendships for social support, and do these religious friendships seem to matter to families? Using longitudinal data from the Portraits of American Life Study (PALS, 2006-2012), this dissertation explores the social ties between families and religious groups by testing: 1) the effect of family formation on social ties to religious congregations; 2) the multidimensional role of religion, including congregational friendships, on marital happiness; and 3) the impact of social networks on family religious activities. In general, findings suggest that family relationships and congregational friendships are reciprocally related on the micro level through social ties. Moreover, these social ties operate in complex and surprising ways, revealing the nuanced interconnections between families and religious communities.\n\nChapter 1 serves as an introduction to the dissertation, providing a brief overview of past research as well as a justification for a social networks approach to family and religion. Chapter 2 describes the PALS data source in detail, including sampling strategy, data collection, important survey items, as well as benefits and limitations. Chapter 3 examines the ways in which family formation (e.g., getting married and rearing children) impacts close social ties to religious congregations. Findings suggest that marriage decreases congregational social ties while childrearing increases them. Chapter 4 tests the multidimensional role of religion on improving marital happiness, uniquely incorporating the role of religious social networks. Results suggest that close congregational friendships positively predict marital happiness, and this relationship is actually strongest among the less religious. Chapter 5 examines the role of social networks in predicting the prevalence of religious discussions with family members. Although social networks matter, their effects weaken in contexts where spouses differ in religious importance. Chapter 6 concludes the dissertation by connecting main findings, discussing limitations, and providing future areas of inquiry for those interested in incorporating social networks into the study of family and religion.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13828], "author_name_tesi": "Gurrentz, Benjamin Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Gurrentz", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger Finke", "Roger Finke", "Diane Felmlee", "David Johnson", "David Eggebeen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger Finke, Dissertation Advisor", "Roger Finke, Committee Chair", "Diane Felmlee, Committee Member", "David Johnson, Committee Member", "David Eggebeen, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["family", "religion", "social networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Power Management of Enterprise Storage Systems", "id": "6638", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6043", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Data-centric services, such as transaction processing systems and search-engines, sustain the demands of millions of users each day.

A rapidly increasing population and unmanaged urbanization have severely degraded the city's urban climate and environment, resulting in a dense urban area with little or no open spaces, narrow roads, and a lack of adequate greeneries and green spaces. Nature in urban areas vitally contributes to the quality of urban life, and subsequently the recognition of the importance of restoring and inserting nature within cities is increasing worldwide. Biophilia, popularized by Edward O. Wilson, posits that humans have the innate inclination to affiliate with nature. Recognizing this inherent human need to connect with nature, biophilic city design theory suggests integrating nature into the design, planning, and management of a city through various biophilic urban design strategies that range in scale from buildings to regions. This work presents an applied research of biophilic urban design principles in Kathmandu.\nThis thesis has made an attempt to address Kathmandu\u2019s degrading urban nature by completing a feasibility assessment of the biophilic urban design strategies in the context of contemporary and vernacular Kathmandu, which generated some recommendations for incorporating nature into the city\u2019s urban environment. A general assessment of Kathmandu\u2019s biophilic levels has also been carried out to assess which qualities of a biophilic city are met, which are not and what are new.                                                                                                                                                                   \tIn the course of completing this project I have further identified larger issues: non-Western approaches and spiritual aspects of biophilia within biophilic city design theory. Biophilic city design theory, introduced by Tim Beatley, was developed through observing innovative strategies and practices in North American and European contexts. But these biophilic urban design strategies might not be applicable to the other non-Western cities with different social, cultural, economic, and environmental backgrounds. Further, the moralistic affinity to nature i.e. one of the nine dimension of biophilia, encompasses strong feelings of affinity, spiritual reverence, and ethical responsibility to the natural world. The spiritual reverence to nature also inspires people to conserve and protect nature. In the comprehensive list of key qualities for a biophilic city, this spiritual aspect of biophilia has been overlooked in favor of other moralistic experiences of nature. Therefore, studying biophilia in Kathmandu, a non-Western context, this thesis has endeavored to develop a broader and well- rounded definition of biophilic city design theory. \n                 \n                                                                                                                      ", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10237], "author_name_tesi": "Gurung, Moti Maya", "last_name_ssi": "Gurung", "middle_name_ssi": "Maya", "first_name_ssi": "Moti", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter John Aeschbacher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter John Aeschbacher, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["biophilia", "biophilic city", "urban nature", "Kathmandu"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "The Expanding Polity: Patterns of the Territorial Expansion of the Post-Classic Se\u00f1orio of Tlapa-Tlachinollan in the Mixteca-Nahuatl-Tlapaneca Region of Guerrero\n\n\n", "id": "5958", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2130", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "   The purpose of this dissertation is to study issues associated with the territorial expansion of the Altepetl of Tlapa-Tlachinollan, a middle size autochthonous Mesoamerican polity located in eastern Guerrero, Mexico. Territorial expansion is defined as the annexation of formerly independent political units into one's sovereignty by any means possible.\n    Current interpretations of codices of Azoy\u00fa 1 and Azoy\u00fa 2 suggest that over a 221 year period (A.D. 1300-1521) Tlapa-Tlachinollan was transformed by different methods from a small political unit covering an area of 48 sq. km. into a complex polity covering an area larger than 4000 sq. km. This study traces the different strategies used by the rulers of Tlapa-Tlachinollan to compete politically and militarily at the regional level. This permits a careful study of a pattern of political domination in the region. \n     The codices Azoy\u00fa 1 and 2 were used in the Spanish courts by 16th century Indian elites to claim political and territorial rights under the colonial system. This leaves some doubt about the historical reliablity of the recorded events.  The use of several independent sources correlated with archaeological information helped to evaluate the reliablity of the primary sources and analyze the sequence and direction of the expansion and the rate of territorial growth of this polity. \n   Archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence suggest that Tlapa-Tlachinollan's expansion was designed to control a segment of the trade-route connecting the Pacific coast with Central Mexico.  Tlachinollan's growth followed the lines of minimum political costs and highest expected benefits, conquering weaker neighbors first and bypassing strong ones.  The leaders of Tlapa-Tlachinollan were interested in controlling the labor and specific resources of the region which included small but highly productive irrigation lands. \n      The results of this dissertation provide support to the argument that territorial expansion is a byproduct of the domestic affairs of the expanding polity to meet two fundamental challenges: 1) the quest for security and 2) the pursuit of wealth and satisfaction of their leaders. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2111], "author_name_tesi": "Guti\u00e9rrez, Gerardo ", "last_name_ssi": "Guti\u00e9rrez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gerardo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth", "David Lee Webster", "Matthew Bennett Restall", "Frances M Hayashida"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Chair", "David Lee Webster, Committee Member", "Matthew Bennett Restall, Committee Member", "Frances M Hayashida, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["expansion", "territory", "Mesoamerica", "Guerrero", "Mixteca", "Tlapa", "Azoyu", "Tlachinollan", "Mexico"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Prefetching Optimizations for Emerging Manycores", "id": "26442", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11630", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Prefetching is a memory system optimization that has long been added to processors as a simple way to hide memory latency. Data is brought into on-chip caches ahead of the instructions that will use the data, which can prevent some stalls in the processor.  Other latency-hiding optimizations, such as out-of-order execution, have reduced the usefulness of prefetching in state-of-the-art processors; however, in contexts where memory bandwidth is important to application performance and memory technologies are providing huge amounts of bandwidth, prefetching is still a useful technique to take advantage of the vast available bandwidth.  This project examined data prefetching on a manycore architecture that is particularly amenable to prefetching: the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor.  The Xeon Phi coprocessor has up to 61 in-order cores with 4 threads each and a very high-bandwidth main memory.  The main target applications are many-threaded applications that require large amounts of data and measure their performance in terms of throughput.  On this platform, prefetching is essential to good performance.\n\nIn this project, we studied two types of prefetching available on Xeon Phi: hardware prefetching and software prefetching.  The highest performance gains from prefetching were 9 times for the ideal STREAM benchmark, and more than 3 times on several more realistic applications. Other applications received no or minimal benefits from prefetching, for reasons we will explore.  We observed that the hardware prefetchers in Xeon Phi react to the success or failure of software prefetching.  We also examined how application programmers can add prefetching to irregular codes that the compiler cannot prefetch for.  Finally, we looked at the power and energy implications of prefetching.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11128], "author_name_tesi": "Guttman, Diana Rose", "last_name_ssi": "Guttman", "middle_name_ssi": "Rose", "first_name_ssi": "Diana", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["prefetching", "many integrated cores"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Dark Side to Creativity: Testing an Intervention to Deter Deviance", "id": "22647", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10183", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although creativity is commonly thought to be beneficial for businesses trying to maintain a competitive edge, a relationship has been found between creativity and deviance.

Based on a poetic depiction of five scenes from Nostalghia, this work considers how incorporating time into the production of space reveals that architecture is not an expression of the debates regarding spatial experience, but an agent of a spatial phenomenon capable of shaping and enhancing the lived experience.\nIn order to consider the relationship between filmic and architectonic space, the scenes are considered within the framework of three categories: (1) space subordinating time, (2) time subordinating space, and (3) space and time as equal factors. The first category depicts how collective and private spatial manifestations affect time through an analysis of the La Madonna del Parto and Domenico house scenes. The second category explains how time affects space through a comparison\nof the camera eye (kino-eye) to the dissection of space (poch\u00e9) through an analysis of the Hotel and Pool scenes. In addition, the last category considers how time and space are taken as having equal weight in the poetics of Nostalghia through a series of requiems that appear throughout the film.\nFinally, this thesis addresses space within film as a portal for the expression of the imaginative constructs that underlie Merleau-Ponty\u2019s work: a portal that touches upon the limits of the visible, the invisible, and the spaces in between.

The experiments reported in this dissertation focus, instead, on how Spanish-English bilinguals process codeswitches during reading comprehension.  Two types of intrasentential codeswitches are examined here: a switch between the Spanish progressive auxiliary estar \u2018be\u2019 and an English present participle versus a switch between the Spanish perfect auxiliary haber \u2018have\u2019 and an English past participle.  Despite their superficial similarities, estar+English participle switches are more frequent in natural bilingual production corpora than haber+English participle switches.  The main objective of this dissertation is to examine whether comprehension costs reflect production patterns, by investigating if the more frequent switches involving the progressive structure are easier to process than the less frequent switches involving the perfect structure.  This set of studies also examines whether age of second language acquisition and task play a role in the way these two types of codeswitches are processed.  \nGroups of early bilinguals and late bilinguals took part in an eye-tracking study in which they were asked to read sentences to complete two tasks: a comprehension task and an acceptability judgment task.  The participant groups exhibited similar results in the comprehension task.  That is, estar+English participle switches were processed more easily than haber+English participle switches, reflecting the tendencies found in natural production.  In the acceptability judgment task, the early bilinguals no longer displayed sensitivity to the distributional patterns of these different types of switches, and instead processed both of them with similar difficulty.  The late bilinguals, however, were less affected by the task and, therefore, processed the codeswitches in the acceptability judgment task similarly to the way that they did in the comprehension task.  Both early and late bilinguals displayed no switch costs when reading codeswitched sentences, compared to unilingual sentences.  Overall, these results lend support for constraint satisfaction models of sentence processing (MacDonald & Seidenberg, 2006), such as the Production-Distribution-Comprehension approach (Gennari & MacDonald, 2009; MacDonald & Thornton, 2009).  When bilinguals complete a task that resembles natural comprehension, the comprehension costs that they exhibit are directly related to the distributional patterns of the codeswitches in natural production.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7463], "author_name_tesi": "Guzzardo Tamargo, Rosa Elisa", "last_name_ssi": "Guzzardo Tamargo", "middle_name_ssi": "Elisa", "first_name_ssi": "Rosa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Chip Gerfen", "Rena Torres Cacoullos", "John Lipski", "Judith Fran Kroll"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paola Eulalia Dussias, Dissertation Advisor", "Chip Gerfen, Dissertation Advisor", "Rena Torres Cacoullos, Committee Member", "John Lipski, Committee Member", "Judith Fran Kroll, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["codeswitching", "eye-tracking", "sentence processing", "bilingualism", "task effects", "switch costs"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "MODELING THE EFFECTS OF FUEL ROD CRUD FORMATION ON BOILING HEAT TRANSFER IN A PRESSURIZED WATER REACTOR USING EULERIAN TWO-FLUID CFD", "id": "10623", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "370", "abstract_tesi": "This research focuses on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of subcooled boiling in crudded nuclear reactor coolant passages.

A subcooled nucleate boiling model based on partitioning of the relevant models of heat transfer is implemented.

This dissertation research approached the association between adolescent nicotine consumption and epigenetics through analysis of coat color in the agouti viable yellow (Avy) mouse model, responses to developmental exposure to dietary methyl donor compounds, and observation of maternal care. Four major hypotheses were tested: \n1) Does perinatal nicotine exposure influence expression of the environmentally sensitive epiallele, Avy, as indicated by coat color? Results showed that spectrum of agouti coat color was not influenced by continuous exposure to 200 \u00b5g/ml or 50 \u00b5g/ml nicotine in parental drinking water from 2 weeks before conception to weaning (Chapter 2).\n2) Are individual differences in early embryonic epigenetic programming, as indicated by extremes of coat color in Avy/a mice, associated with subsequent adolescent nicotine intake?  Results showed that neither extreme yellow mice nor fully mottled pseudoagouti mice were different from black or mottled littermates in their oral nicotine consumption on a three bottle choice test at age 36-42 days (Chapter 2).\n3) Does dietary methyl donor availability\u2014which can increase DNA methylation\u2014alter adolescent nicotine consumption? Initial experiments indicated that mice born of parents fed a standard Methyl Supplemented diet during conception, gestation, and lactation showed lower adolescent nicotine consumption than offspring of control diet-fed litters. The effect included interactions with perinatal nicotine exposure (200 \u00b5g/ml free base nicotine in dams\u2019 drinking water) and test day such that methyl diet blocked the perinatal nicotine-induced increase in adolescent nicotine consumption, especially in the first days of the test. Subsequent experiments evaluated the timing of methyl diet and two concentrations of perinatal nicotine exposure (50 and 200 \u00b5g/ml). The 3-5% reduction in adolescent nicotine consumption was consistent across all groups of mice receiving methyl diet during brain development, including an additional group of C57BL/6J mice. Although the effects were not significant in each wave, the overall effect of methyl diet across studies was significant. (Chapter 3) \n4) Are individual differences in maternal care, particularly licking and grooming of neonatal pups, associated with differences in adolescent nicotine consumption? Individual lick counts observed during 4 hours of sampling per day on postnatal days 1-8 were not associated with subsequent adolescent nicotine consumption in four litters of Avy/a and a/a littermate mice (Chapter 4).\nThe failure to detect macroscopic factors associated with the emergence of adolescent nicotine consumption is consistent with the hypothesis that cumulative stochastic molecular events are responsible for the divergence of dizygotic-but-genetically-identical littermates in nicotine use phenotypes. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2924], "author_name_tesi": "Gyekis, Joseph P", "last_name_ssi": "Gyekis", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David John Vandenbergh", "David John Vandenbergh", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli", "Paul Allen Bartell", "Roger John Mccarter", "Laura Klein", "Gerald Eugene Mc Clearn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David John Vandenbergh, Dissertation Advisor", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Chair", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli, Committee Member", "Paul Allen Bartell, Committee Member", "Roger John Mccarter, Committee Member", "Laura Klein, Committee Member", "Gerald Eugene Mc Clearn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["methyl diet supplementation", "agouti viable yellow", "oral nicotine consumption", "perinatal exposure", "folate", "choline", "B12"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Effective viscosity and dynamics of suspensions of micro-swimmers\n", "id": "11317", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6427", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores two problems, all related to modeling and analysis of hydrodynamic\ninteractions between microswimmers, most common example of which are swimming microorganisms, e.g. Bacillus subtilis. Results for both problems\nwere published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nIn Chapter 1 we introduce the subject of the study, its origins and goals, as\nwell as its current state of development.\n\nIn Chapter 2 we present the first problem, in which we study the dynamics\nand interaction of two microswimmers, modeled by self-propelled dumbbell-type structures. We focus on alignment dynamics of a coplanar pair of elongated swimmers, which propel themselves either by \u201cpushing\u201d or \u201cpulling\u201d both in three- and quasi-two-dimensional geometries of space. We derive asymptotic expressions for the dynamics of the pair, which, complemented by numerical experiments, indicate that the tendency of bacteria to align with one another strongly depends on the position of the propulsion force. In particular, we observe that positioning of the\neffective propulsion force inside the dumbbell results in qualitative agreement with the dynamics observed in experiments, such as mutual alignment of converging bacteria.\n\nIn Chapter 3 we present the second problem, where we develop a 2D model for a suspension of microswimmers in a fluid and analyze it analytically in the dilute regime when swimmer-swimmer interactions can be neglected and numerically in the moderate concentration regime accounting for all hydrodynamic interactions,\nusing a Mimetic Finite Difference method \u2013 efficient method for problems with complex geometries. Our analysis shows that in the dilute regime (in the absence of rotational diffusion) the effective shear viscosity is not affected by self-propulsion. But at the moderate concentrations (due to swimmer-swimmer interactions) the effective viscosity decreases linearly as a function of the propulsion strength of the swimmers. These results prove that (i) a physically observable decrease of viscosity\nfor a suspension of self-propelled microswimmers can be explained purely from the view of hydrodynamics, i.e. \u201chigher order\u201d phenomena such as chemotaxis and chemical constitution of fluid can be neglected (ii) self-propulsion and interactions among swimmers are both essential to the reduction of the effective shear viscosity.\nIn Chapter 3 we also present a number of numerical experiments for the dynamics of swimmers resulting from pairwise interactions at moderate distances from one another. The numerical results agree with the physically observed phenomena (e.g., attraction of swimmer to swimmer and swimmer to the wall). This is viewed as an additional validation of the model and the numerical scheme.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6428], "author_name_tesi": "Gyrya, Vitaliy ", "last_name_ssi": "Gyrya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vitaliy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonid Berlyand", "Leonid Berlyand", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte", "Anna L Mazzucato", "Timothy Reluga", "Reka Z Albert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonid Berlyand, Dissertation Advisor", "Leonid Berlyand, Committee Chair", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte, Committee Member", "Anna L Mazzucato, Committee Member", "Timothy Reluga, Committee Member", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Stokes", "bacteria", "microswimmers", "effective viscosity", "rheology", "interactions", "self-propulsion"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Experimental Determination of the Distributed Dynamic Coefficients for a Hydrodynamic Fluid Film Bearing", "id": "18878", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8535", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Most current rotor bearing analysis utilizes lumped parameter bearing coefficients to model the static and dynamic characteristics of fluid film bearings.  By treating the stiffness and damping properties of the fluid film as acting upon the axial centerline of the rotor, these models are limited in their analysis to first order lateral rotor-bearing motion.  The development of  numerical methods that distribute the dynamic properties of the fluid film around the bearing circumference allow for higher order analysis of the motion between the bearing and rotor.  Assessment of the accuracy of  the numerical method used to calculate distributed dynamic fluid film bearing coefficients is performed by developing a novel hydrodynamic journal bearing test rig and experimental testing procedure capable of obtaining measured distributed dynamic coefficients over a range of bearing operating conditions.\nThe instrumented bearing test rig is used to measure the dynamic bearing displacement and fluid film pressure responses from application of an externally applied excitation force.  Least squares solution to a system of perturbated pressure equations, populated by measured displacement and pressure responses, is used to determine the hydrodynamic stiffness and damping properties for a finite region of the bearing surface.  Incremental rotation of pressure sensors embedded in the body of the test bearing allow for measurement of the fluid film circumferential pressure distribution which is used to calculate a set of experimentally determined dynamic bearing coefficients.\nDistributed bearing coefficients derived from experimental measurements are compared to numerically calculated distributed coefficients as well as to lumped parameter coefficients generated from experimental and numerical methods found in the literature.  Overall, the numerically calculated distributed coefficients successfully model both the circumferential distribution and the operating conditions of the experimental distributed bearing coefficient values and show reasonable correlation to results obtained through lumped parameter methods.  Excitation frequency independence is validated through experimental testing over multiple frequencies, and damping cross term inequality of the numerically distributed bearing coefficients is validated by lumped coefficient analysis found in the literature.  While uncertainty and variation of the test rig dimensional and operating parameters have some effect on the accuracy with which the numerical methods model the experimental results, the most significant source of dissimilarity in numerical and experimental results comes from test rig specific features not captured in the numerical methods, such as bearing surface wear and bearing-shaft misalignment.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8425], "author_name_tesi": "Gyurko, John Harrison", "last_name_ssi": "Gyurko", "middle_name_ssi": "Harrison", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen A Hambric", "Karl Martin Reichard", "Eric Russell Marsh", "Martin Wesley Trethewey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen A Hambric, Committee Chair", "Karl Martin Reichard, Committee Chair", "Eric Russell Marsh, Committee Member", "Martin Wesley Trethewey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrodynamic lubrication", "experimental test rig", "fluid film bearing", "dynamic bearing coefficients", "circumferential distribution"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "INTEGRATED CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS IN NANOWIRE STRUCTURES TOWARDS NANO-SCALE SENSORS\n", "id": "6848", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5268", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nanowires composed of metal and conducting polymers with integrated proteins and chemical systems have been investigated as building blocks for next-generation nano-scale sensors and assemblies.

The primary objectives are: 1) to establish an efficient and accurate numerical framework for the treatment of unsteady flame dynamics; and 2) to investigate the parameters and mechanisms responsible for driving flow oscillations in a lean-premixed gas-turbine combustor.\nThe energy transfer mechanisms among mean flow motions, periodic motions and background turbulent motions in turbulent reacting flow are first explored using a triple decomposition technique.  Then a comprehensive numerical study of the combustion dynamics in a lean-premixed swirl-stabilized combustor is performed.  The analysis treats the conservation equations in three dimensions and takes into account finite-rate chemical reactions and variable thermophysical properties.  Turbulence closure is achieved using a large-eddy-simulation (LES) technique.  The compressible-flow version of the Smagorinsky model is employed to describe subgrid-scale turbulent motions and their effect on large-scale structures.  A level-set flamelet library approach is used to simulate premixed turbulent combustion.  In this approach, the mean flame location is modeled using a level-set G-equation, where G is defined as a distance function.  Thermophysical properties are obtained using a presumed probability density function (PDF) along with a laminar flamelet library.  The governing equations and the associated boundary conditions are solved by means of a four-step Runge-Kutta scheme along with the implementation of the message passing interface (MPI) parallel computing architecture.  The analysis allows for a detailed investigation into the interaction between turbulent flow motions and oscillatory combustion of a swirl-stabilized injector.  Results show good agreement with an analytical solution and experimental data in terms of acoustic properties and flame evolution.  A study of flame bifurcation from a stable state to an unstable state indicates that the inlet flow temperature and equivalence ratio are the two most important variables determining the stability characteristics of the combustor.  Under unstable operating conditions, several physical processes responsible for driving combustion instabilities in the chamber have been identified and quantified.  These processes include vortex shedding and acoustic interaction, coupling between the flame evolution and local flow oscillations, vortex and flame interaction and coupling between heat release and acoustic motions.  The effects of inlet swirl number on the flow development and flame dynamics in the chamber are also carefully studied.  In the last part of this thesis, an analytical model is developed using triple decomposition techniques to model the combustion response of turbulent premixed flames to acoustic oscillations.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6834], "author_name_tesi": "HUANG, YING ", "last_name_ssi": "HUANG", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "YING", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vigor Yang", "Philip John Morris", "Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Daniel Connell Haworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vigor Yang, Committee Chair", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "Domenic Adam Santavicca, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Combustion Instabilities", "Large Eddy Simulation", "Level Set Flamelet Approach", "Triple Decomposition Techniques"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Observation of Atmospheric Neutrino-induced Cascades in IceCube with DeepCore", "id": "12119", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1170", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The recently completed IceCube neutrino observatory is composed of more than 5,000 digital optical modules attached to 86 strings and buried in the South Pole ice.

Irrespective of the shape of nozzle, the significant noise source strength is located within ten nozzle diameters from the jet exit. As the observation angle increases, the highest peak of the noise source strength distribution moves closer to jet exit.

Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that melodramas were relatively more persuasive for hostile than for favorable audiences. Study 3 examined the significance of a mediation model that represents the process through which melodramatic sequence (i.e., suffering -> fighting -> ending) exerts influence on the attitude of hostile and favorable audiences. The mediation model was as follows. Character identification experienced in response to the climax mediates the effect of melodramatic sequence on hostile and favorable audiences\u2019 attitudes. The findings from Study 3 indicated that the proposed mediation via character identification in the fighting segment was nonsignificant.

Mechanistically, the effects of ceramide on anoikis and extravasation are mediated by lysosomal degradation of CD44, independent of palmitoylation or proteasome targeting.  SiRNA down-regulation of CD44 mimics ceramide-induced anoikis and diminished extravasation of cancer cells.

Previous research has examined each of these factors separately, but research combining multiple factors into a single analysis is rare.

The cooling system that was used in the TCNS cooling system was a two-phase closed thermosyphon with a reservoir (TPCTR). The reservoir containing neon gas is kept at room temperature. \nIn this study a detailed thermal analysis of the fundamental operating principles of a TPCTR were carried out. A detailed parametric study of the various geometric and thermo-physical factors that affect the limits of the operational capacity of the TPCTR investigated. A CFD analysis is carried out in order to further refine the heat transfer analysis and understand the flow structure inside the thermosyphon and the two-phase nucleate boiling in the evaporator section of the thermosyphon. In order to help the new design, a variety of ways of increasing the operating range and heat removal capacity of the TPCTR cooling system were analyzed so that it can accommodate the anticipated heat load of 10W or more. It is found, for example, that doubling the pressure of the system will increase the capacity index  by 50% for a system with an initial fill ratio FR of 1. A decrease in cryorefrigeration performance angle increases the capacity index. For example taking the current condition of the TCNS system and reducing the angle from the current value of 70 degrees  by half ( 35 degrees ) will increase the cooling power 300%.

According to the interest hypothesis, a fascination with emotional material motivates people to listen to emotional disclosure. In contrast, the belonging hypothesis is that the need to belong motivates people to listen to their friends disclose emotional, but not descriptive, information. Although, because of an association between belonging, mood, and self-esteem, two alternative explanations are that the desire to improve one\u2019s mood or self-esteem motivates people to listen (i.e., the mood and self-esteem hypotheses). Lastly, a fifth possibility is that interest, belonging, mood, and/or self-esteem motivate people not to listen per se, but to validate their friends\u2019 emotional, but not descriptive, disclosures (i.e., the validation hypothesis).\n\nIn support of the belonging hypothesis, Studies 1, 2, and 4 reveal that increased belonging needs are associated with an increased desire to listen to friends disclose emotional, but not descriptive, information. Study 3 suggests that this effect is specific to listening to friends, for belonging needs were not associated with the desire to listen to a stranger disclose either type of information. Study 4 demonstrated that people intended to listen to emotional disclosure because they expected it to increase their own feelings of social connectedness. For when people expected listening to generate distance between themselves and their friend, increasing belonging no longer increased the desire to listen to emotional disclosure. Negating the interest hypothesis, these effects existed above and beyond participants\u2019 interest in the emotional material. Negating the mood, self-esteem, and validation hypotheses, these effectscould not be explained by participants\u2019 concurrent mood, self-esteem, or the desire to validate another person\u2019s experiences for none of them were supported by the data.\n\nTogether these studies provide new insights into the self-disclosure process, by illustrating a potential process that encourages people to listen to their friends. This research makes a unique contribution to our understanding of self-disclosure because of its focus on the listener. That is, it extends prior work by focusing not on how speakers benefit from disclosing emotional information, but on how listeners may benefit from listening to emotional disclosure. The data indicate that people who listen to emotional disclosure with \u201call ears\u201d may do so because they expect that listening to this particular type of information will help them fulfill their own need to belong.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7723], "author_name_tesi": "Hackenbracht, Joy Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Hackenbracht", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Joy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Gasper", "Stephanie A Shields", "Reginald Adams Jr.", "Mary Beth Oliver"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Gasper, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephanie A Shields, Committee Member", "Reginald Adams Jr., Committee Member", "Mary Beth Oliver, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["emotional disclosure", "listen", "need to belong", "social exclusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "National Reckonings: The Last Judgment in Seventeenth-century English Literature", "id": "15342", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "7713", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis examines the relationship between national identity, religion, and literary form in seventeenth-century Britain. Tracing how writers represent the biblical Last Judgment in their works, I explore a contemporary way of thinking about the nation that has been largely unrecognized by scholars. In the period, belief in Christ\u2019s imminent Second Coming was widespread. I show how in moments of national crisis, such as war and revolution, authors turn to the Last Judgment as a powerful mechanism for both deploying and contesting ideas of the nation. The Last Judgment enables writers to break outside the category of the nation into the broader category of the church universal, ecclesia universalis, the mystical body of Christian saints bound together throughout history. In this regard, the concept of reckoning\u2014of giving an account of oneself and one\u2019s nation to God\u2014is of utmost importance. It allows us to understand the double orientation of national identity in seventeenth-century Britain. In this double orientation, a writer\u2019s vertical relationship with the church universal is deeply connected to his or her horizontal relationship with a political community. More generally, this thesis is a reminder of the importance of eschatology to British society. It is an exploration of the seventeenth-century religious imagination and of how writers used their printed texts to create communities of readers anticipating a national judgment, even as they looked forward to their citizenship in the church universal.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7646], "author_name_tesi": "Hackenbracht, Ryan James", "last_name_ssi": "Hackenbracht", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Laura Lunger Knoppers", "Laura Lunger Knoppers", "Patrick G Cheney", "Garrett Sullivan Jr.", "Linda Woodbridge", "John Philip Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Laura Lunger Knoppers, Dissertation Advisor", "Laura Lunger Knoppers, Committee Chair", "Patrick G Cheney, Committee Member", "Garrett Sullivan Jr., Committee Member", "Linda Woodbridge, Committee Member", "John Philip Jenkins, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["last judgment", "nation", "eschatology", "seventeenth century", "English literature"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "On the Development of Modern Ionospheric Sensors Using Software-defined Radio Techniques", "id": "19170", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9092", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As the field of electronics continues its trend to becoming faster, smaller, and lower-powered, opportunities continue to open up for digital systems, that rival, if not exceed, traditional analog systems in performance, reliability, and affordability.

Referrals influence potential customers to purchase (or not) from a specific supplier firm (e.g., Apple Inc.). Thus, referrals affect the supplier firm\u2019s cash flow; and, in the first essay I argue that suppliers should view referrals as assets and liabilities. I develop the concept of referral equity to capture the net effect of all referrals on a supplier\u2018s cash flow. Further, I recognize and define three types of referrals for a supplier - customer-to-potential customer referrals, horizontal referrals, and supplier-initiated referrals - that play a critical role in a potential customer\u2018s purchase decision by influencing the potential customer in favor of, or against, the supplier.\n\nIn the second essay, I focus on the least studied referral type: supplier-initiated referrals. In business-to-business markets, suppliers aim to influence potential customers in the supplier\u2019s favor with a positive recommendation from a specific referrer. Using a mixed-design experiment with purchasing managers as respondents I find that if the supplier has previous experience, versus no experience, with the potential customer, homophily between the referrer and potential customer significantly increases the referrals\u2019 influence on the potential customer. I also find that if the referrer gives an unqualified positive referral, the referral\u2019s positive influence on the potential customer decreases by only 5%; because potential customers perceive a bias in all-positive supplier-initiated referral, which reduces the supplier-initiated referral\u2019s influence on the potential customer. \n\nIn the third essay, I take a deeper look at the effect of referrer characteristics on the referral\u2019s influence on the potential customer in supplier-initiated referrals. I study the relative influence of a supplier-initiated referral for a startup compared with an established firm, contingent on the referrer\u2019s societal status. With two experimental studies, I find that the effect of referrer status on the extent to which the referral influences the potential customer is greater for a startup versus an established firm. This result indicates that while established firms can likely trade-off referrer status for other referrer and referral message characteristics, to influence potential customers startups should focus on selecting a high status referrer in supplier-initiated referrals. I also find that the potential customer\u2019s expectation disconfirmation concerning referrer status reduces the benefit of referrer status for an established firm more than for a startup. Therefore, to positively influence the potential customer with a supplier-initiated referral, an established firm needs to manage the potential customer\u2019s expectations concerning referrer selection.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4383], "author_name_tesi": "Hada, Mahima ", "last_name_ssi": "Hada", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mahima", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rajdeep Grewal And Gary L Lilien", "Rajdeep Grewal", "Gary L Lilien", "Arvind Rangaswamy", "Gary Bolton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rajdeep Grewal And Gary L Lilien, Dissertation Advisor", "Rajdeep Grewal, Committee Chair", "Gary L Lilien, Committee Chair", "Arvind Rangaswamy, Committee Member", "Gary Bolton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Referral", "Business-to-Business Marketing", "Referral Management", "Referral Equity", "Reference Customers", "Word-of-Mouth"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A New Framework for Sustainable Design in Palestine\n", "id": "11551", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2230", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract:\nMany definitions of sustainable design have emerged in the past twenty years, most of which focused on the environmental part of the design process. In recent years, especially with the emergence of sustainable design as an international trend, more attention has been directed towards the social and economic part of sustainable design for a building to be truly sustainable and able of fitting in any context, for the long run. This thesis explores into the different dimensions of sustainable design, studying what makes a building sustainable, and using that as a base to define sustainable design in the region of Palestine, a small country in the northern part of the Middle East and east of Mediterranean, to define a framework of sustainable design.\nThe framework achieved at the end of this study uses the vernacular as a passively sustainable prototype of sustainable design, for its environmental, socio cultural and economic complexity of a building, integrated with modern active techniques, that helped define the framework and helps define the future of the vernacular as a sustainable structure in different regions of the world.\nTo define the framework, a case study is chosen in Nablus; a city in the core of the West Bank (Palestine). This already built case study is examined for its energy use, and social qualities, and later transformed into a courtyard structure, with the same occupancy and spatial praxis. Later the two buildings are compared, to examine the ability of the courtyard structure to serve as a sustainable building from all facets of the sustainable process.\nAt the end of this study, the main features of the courtyard house are going to be extracted into a framework of sustainable design, to help start acclimating the region to sustainable design.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2211], "author_name_tesi": "Haddad, Hala Marwan", "last_name_ssi": "Haddad", "middle_name_ssi": "Marwan", "first_name_ssi": "Hala", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ute Poerschke", "Ute Poerschke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ute Poerschke, Thesis Advisor", "Ute Poerschke, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Framework", "Architecture", "Sustainable Design", "Palestine"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Philosophical Foundation and Political Function of Spain's \"recitado\" in \"celos aun del aire matan\" (1661)", "id": "28873", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12355", "abstract_tesi": "\tThis thesis focuses on the development of opera in one of the world\u2019s largest empires during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Spain. Musicologists such as Louise K. Stein, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Dom\u00ednguez, and Jos\u00e9 Subir\u00e1 have researched the first evidence of the Italian genre in the Spanish royal court. Two contrasting arguments have resulted from their conclusions. The first argument states that the Spanish opera does not follow the Italian model of the late seventeenth century and therefore does not attest to Italian influence. On the other hand, other musicologists argue that the Spanish genre does reflect the Italianate taste of the Spanish court, but that past research is tainted with nationalism. These seemingly opposing conclusions may be reconciled through an analysis of the political and philosophical context surrounding the evolution of opera in Spain.\n\tThe first surviving, fully sung Spanish opera, Celos aun del aire matan (1661), composed by Juan Hidalgo (1614-1685) on a libretto by Don Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca (1600-1681), provides the groundwork for this thesis. An analysis of versification, meter, and vertical sonorities found in the Spanish recitado during key scenes of Celos aun del aire matan delineates the influence of early Italian stile recitativo.

The overall objective of this thesis was to develop a more fundamental understanding of the performance characteristics of zwitterionic membranes by comparing the properties of a series of charged, neutral, and zwitterionic membranes with similar pore size / permeability.\nThe surface-modified membranes were generated by covalent attachment of small ligands to a base cellulose membrane.

The latter was examined using lysozyme and \u03b1-lactalbumin charge ladders, which consist of a series of chemical derivatives of the base protein differing by single charge groups that can be analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. The sieving coefficients were analyzed using available hydrodynamic models based on the partitioning of a charged sphere in a charged cylindrical pore.\nThe zwitterionic membranes showed minimal protein adsorption and a very low degree of protein fouling over a wide range of conditions. The fouling behavior of the charged membranes was strongly influenced by electrostatic interactions, although the zwitterionic membrane had a lower degree of fouling than the charged membranes even when the protein and membrane had like polarity.

The overall objective of this dissertation was to develop a fundamental understanding of the potential of using membrane ultrafiltration for the separation / purification of these polysaccharides and their corresponding conjugates. Experiments were performed using several pneumococcus polysaccharide serotypes provided by Pfizer. Ultrafiltration data were obtained in a stirred cell using cellulose and polyethersulfone membranes with different molecular weight cutoffs. Polysaccharides were characterized using dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography. Polysaccharide transmission in dilute solutions was a strong function of filtrate flux due to concentration polarization effects, with the data in good agreement with available hydrodynamic models. Polysaccharide fouling became significant at high filtrate flux using more concentrated solutions, consistent with the presence of a critical wall concentration for fouling that was dependent on the specific serotype. The flux and polysaccharide transmission were both strong functions of solution ionic strength due to a combination of inter- and intra-molecular electrostatic interactions. The polysaccharide sieving coefficients were well-correlated with the effective polysaccharide size as determined by size exclusion chromatography, with results in good agreement with available hydrodynamic models for membrane transport. The increase in effective size at low salt concentrations could be explained using the worm-like chain model accounting for the increase in persistence length and excluded volume at low ionic strength.

The strict composition control necessary for the synthesis of these phases was achieved through the use of reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) intensity oscillations.  By monitoring changes in the RHEED intensity oscillations as appropriate doses of elemental beams of these constituents are sequentially deposited to grow monolayers of AO and BO<sub>2</sub>, the Sr:Ti, Ba:Ti or Sr:Ru ratio can be adjusted to within 1% of stoichiometry.  Furthermore, the presence of a beat frequency in the intensity oscillation envelope allows the adjustment of the A and B elemental fluxes so that a complete AO or BO<sub>2</sub> monolayer is obtained with each shuttered dose of the A or B elemental constituent in a continuous flux of oxygen or ozone. \n\nEpitaxial SrTiO<sub>3</sub> thin films grown on DyScO<sub>3</sub> and LSAT substrates show dramatically different dielectric properties, as measured with interdigitated electrodes.  On DyScO<sub>3</sub>, SrTiO<sub>3</sub> is under biaxial tensile strain, while on LSAT it is strained in biaxial compression in the plane of the substrate / film interface. The film under biaxial tensile strain shows significant room temperature tunability and a sharp Curie-Weiss peak at 293 K.  Under biaxial compressive strain, the SrTiO3 exhibits negligible room temperature tunability.

The structure and microstructure of the films were investigated by x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microbeam diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in combination with computer image simulations.  Both diffraction and HRTEM studies revealed that the superlattices have nearly atomically-abrupt interfaces that are maintained even after annealing to high temperature.

In the first chapter, we consider coalition formation\ngames with externalities. A natural extension of superadditivity is not sufficient to imply that the grand coalition is efficient when externalities are present. We provide a condition, analogous to convexity, that is sufficient for the grand coalition to be efficient and show that this also implies that the (appropriately defined) core is nonempty. Moreover, we propose a mechanism which implements\nthe most efficient partition for all coalition formation games and characterize the\nresulting payoff division.\n\nThe second chapter, written jointly with Vijay Krishna, studies equilibria of first- and second-price auctions with resale in a model with independent private values. With asymmetric bidders, the resulting inefficiencies create a motive for post-auction trade. In our basic model, resale takes place via monopoly pricing\u2014\nthe winner of the auction makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the loser after updating\nhis prior beliefs based on his winning. We show that a first-price auction with resale has a unique monotonic equilibrium. Our main result is that with resale, the expected revenue from a first-price auction exceeds that from a second-price auction. The results extend to other resale mechanisms: monopsony and, more generally, probabilistic k-double auctions. The inclusion of resale possibilities thus permits a general revenue ranking of the two auctions that is not available when these are excluded.\n\nThe third chapter, written jointly with Vijay Krishna, studies first-price auctions\nin a model with asymmetric, independent private values. Our goal is to compare equilibria of the first-price auction without resale (FPA) with those of the first-price auction with resale (FPAR). For the two major families of distributions for which equilibria of the FPA are available in closed form, we show that\nresale possibilities increase the revenue of the original seller. We also show by example that, somewhat paradoxically, resale may actually decrease efficiency.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2417], "author_name_tesi": "Hafalir, Isa Emin", "last_name_ssi": "Hafalir", "middle_name_ssi": "Emin", "first_name_ssi": "Isa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijay Krishna", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "James Schuyler Jordan", "Susan (Hong) Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijay Krishna, Committee Chair", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Member", "James Schuyler Jordan, Committee Member", "Susan (Hong) Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Coalition Formation", "Externalities", "Auctions", "Asymmetries", "Revenue Ranking", "Efficiency"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Relationship Between Query Length, Parts of Speech Usage and Web Search Query Specificity", "id": "18418", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8757", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the specificity of Web search queries can enable search systems to better address the underlying needs of searchers by providing them with relevant content. Identifying the specificity of Web search queries requires classifying them on a granularity spectrum from narrow to broad for a given topic. The goal of this research is to automatically classify Web search queries as either general or narrow so that the search system can treat queries within each group differently when retrieving results. I use content analysis and prior research to develop a list of nine attributes to identify the specificity of queries, and I then apply these attributes to classify 5,115 unique queries as narrow or general. I then investigate whether (1) query length and (2) part of speech can be leveraged to automatically classify queries as narrow or general. I also explore whether users show distinct patterns in their usage of the parts of speech. I find that query length and parts of speech when combined provide better identification of query specificity (80% accuracy) than either factor can alone (74% and 56% accuracy). Also, I find that I can separate users into four distinct groups based on their usage of parts of speech, indicating that modeling specificity differently for each group of users could be beneficial.

Occurring in at least thirty-three countries worldwide, it is the third most common Mycobacterial disease after tuberculosis and leprosy.  Buruli ulcer is characterized by ulcerative lesions and can lead to severe deformity if untreated.  While methods of treatment for Buruli ulcer are well known and have a high rate of success, the mode of transmission of Buruli ulcer remains elusive.  Multiple hypotheses have been put forward in the search for the vector for this disease.  Studies of Buruli ulcer to date seem to conclude that water is, in some way, closely related to the transmission of this disease.  In particular, changes in water quality due to changes in land use may contribute to the emergence of Buruli ulcer.  I hypothesize that stagnant pools, especially those with low pH, high metals, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations, will provide a favorable environment for M. ulcerans growth and transmission. \nTo determine the relationship between water chemistry and Buruli ulcer incidence, water samples were collected from five communities within Ghana: four in the southern part of the country (three Buruli-endemic communities: Pokukrom, Betenase, and Ayanfuri, and one control: Kedadwen) and one non-endemic community (Nangruma) in the north.  The southern control accounts for differences between endemic and non-endemic communities with similar land uses and geological setting.  The northern community has experienced massive floods in recent years, and it is suspected that this may trigger the onset of Buruli ulcer in the community.\nData from the rainy season in June and July 2011 show distinct differences in chemistry between water bodies.  Gold-mining pits and pools of stagnant water have a significantly different chemical signature than rivers and naturally-occurring swamps.  Trace metals, elements thought to aid in the preferential growth of M. ulcerans, are present in much higher concentrations in mining pits and stagnant pools than in other water bodies.  A pilot study conducted during the dry season in January and February 2011 using different methods yielded similar results, showing a difference between stagnant and flowing water bodies based predominantly on trace metal concentrations.  This work serves as a first step toward characterizing the environmental niche for M. ulcerans growth and persistence in the environment.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7296], "author_name_tesi": "Hagarty, Julianne ", "last_name_ssi": "Hagarty", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Julianne", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kamini Singha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kamini Singha, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Buruli ulcer", "Mycobacterium ulcerans", "Ghana", "water chemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Extracurricular Participation in Rural Pennsylvania High Schools: What Helps?

The activities after school, such as marching in the school band, playing sports, singing at church, or competing in Future Farmers of America (FFA) help structure students\u2019 free time and allow them to explore new interests.  Extracurricular activities also offer social, emotional, and behavioral benefits to those who are involved, and have become part of some college admissions and job application considerations. With increasing importance and attention placed on participation as a part of social development and as a gatekeeping tool in the transition to adulthood, it is crucial to know if all students are equally likely to participate. Identifying the elements of students\u2019 lives that help or hinder participation can shape policies to make activities more inclusive, so that all students have access to the benefits of participation. Using data from eleventh-grade students in the Rural Youth Education Study, a longitudinal study of youth from ten rural school districts in Pennsylvania, this thesis examines the relationship between parents\u2019 participation in school, religious, and community activities with student participation in seven different extracurricular activities: school sports, arts clubs, other school clubs, church youth groups, community sports, volunteer work, and community clubs. It also considers other family, personal, peer, school and community factors that may influence participation. Findings reveal that parents\u2019 participation in school and community activities increases the chances that youth participate in extracurricular activities. Having friends who participate, a parent with a college degree, and aspirations to go to college also make youth more likely to join extracurricular activities. However, overall participation did not always reflect the likelihood of participation in individual activities.

Wastewater re-use is one way to simultaneously reduce freshwater use and recycle valuable nutrients into ecosystems. \nThe Living Filter, located on the campus of The Pennsylvania State University, is an example of a wastewater renovation system. For fifty years, Penn State has sprayed treated wastewater onto agricultural fields and forest ecosystems, leaving natural processes to further filter the wastewater. The localized water recycling process is considered sustainable because the wastewater filters through the soil, providing nutrients to agricultural crops and forests, until it eventually reaches the groundwater system where it is extracted for university drinking water again.\nPrevious studies at the Living Filter have examined soil physical property changes, surface runoff water quality, and phosphorous accumulation. However, most of these studies have only examined these issues in the first 120 cm of the soil profile.  Few investigations into deeper subsurface profile phenomena have been conducted. Given that spray irrigation has occurred for 50 years, the concern for excess nitrogen in the subsurface, and that deeper soil profile studies have not been conducted, the purpose of this project was to analyze the potential for nitrate saturation and more broadly the fate and budget of nitrogen in the system. This study examines the cycling and accumulation of nitrate, and investigates the factors that control nitrate accumulation. Using a combination of soil core and monitoring tools, ecosystem indicators including soil nutrient capacities, moisture levels, and soil characteristics were measured. Comparing data from the time of initial system installation to present illuminates how the system has changed.\nResults reveal a systematic difference between irrigated and non-irrigated soil nitrate concentrations, regardless of land use. Spray field soil nitrate concentrations were elevated compared to non-irrigated sites; however, it is difficult to determine if that is caused by just spray irrigation or by fertilizer input. Although elevated, groundwater concentrations are below the EPA drinking water threshold. Soil analysis including particle size distribution, soil elemental composition, and texture did not distinctively illuminate factors that control nitrate accumulation, whereas it is generally understood that porosity, soil moisture, and soil texture all impact nitrate presence. The results of soil analysis did match previous studies in that only weak relationships were found between specific soil characteristics and soil nitrate accumulation in the field area. The nitrogen budget analysis revealed that the soil incorporation in the Living Filter serves as an important N sink, but there is unaccounted nitrogen that could be incorporated by soil processes besides adsorption accumulation. \nThese findings suggest that spray irrigation at the Living Filter under the current rates of application has not caused the ultimate stage of nitrogen saturation to occur in the spray irrigation site, although there is evidence of nitrate bypass at the site because groundwater concentrations beneath the Living Filter are continually above background levels. Because groundwater nitrate concentrations are below regulated thresholds, and soil nitrate concentrations are less than sprayed nitrate concentration inputs, the system can be interpreted to not have reached capacity nitrogen saturation, and the ecosystem continues to use nitrogen and transform it. Analysis of effects of variation in land use illuminates possible causes of differences in soil nitrate concentrations. From the viewpoint of nitrate accumulation and potential for environmental contamination, the Living Filter continues to serve as a viable mechanism for absorbing nutrient discharge and serving as the final stage of wastewater treatment after fifty years, although should be continually monitored. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12733], "author_name_tesi": "Hagedorn, Jacob Gerrit", "last_name_ssi": "Hagedorn", "middle_name_ssi": "Gerrit", "first_name_ssi": "Jacob", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Demian Saffer", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Susan Louise Brantley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Demian Saffer, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Living Filter", "Nitrogen"]}]
