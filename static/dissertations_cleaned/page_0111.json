A forward swept wing would be required for the stopping and folding process as well as the high speed flight. Divergence velocity of a forward swept wing can be greatly decreased in a standard metallic isotropic wing structure because the bending will cause the angle of attack to increase and cause a feedback of bending and twisting. The addition of the rotor pylon influenced the lift and drag to the wingtip depending on the shape and placement of the pylon. The shape of the pylon on the wing tip was found to have a greater influence on the divergence velocity, than the location of the pylon relative to the wing. Changing the shape of the pylon decreased the divergence velocity by over 15% while changing the location of the pylon only affected the divergence by 4%. The addition of the pylon drag on the deflecting wing caused a torque that had the largest influence on the divergence velocity from the pylon. Depending on the sweep of the wing the drag force reduced the divergence velocity from 25%-60%. Composite tailoring was used to lessen the loss by inducing a bending-torsion coupling in the opposite direction by stiffening the structure off axis. The main concern of the composite tailoring was to maintain the bending and torsional stiffness on the wing. When composite tailoring was included, while maintaining the effective stiffnesses, the divergence velocity was maintained at a value greater than the loss from the lift or drag caused by the pylon. The flutter velocity of the stop/fold rotor was also greatly influenced by the presence of the folded rotor pylon. Unlike divergence the forward sweep on the wing helps the flutter speed. Moving the center of gravity of the pylon caused a decrease of the flutter velocity as much as 60%. It was discovered that if the center of gravity of the pylon was moved far forwards the pylon could be used to effectively mass balance the wing and increase the flutter velocity. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3205], "author_name_tesi": "Slaby, Jason ", "last_name_ssi": "Slaby", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Smith", "Edward Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Edward Smith, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Composite", "Tiltrotor", "Aeroelastic Stability", "stop/fold"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Work, Welfare, and the Informal Economy: An Examination of Family Livelihood Strategies", "id": "6457", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6121", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent decades Americans have witnessed profound changes in the nature of work and the structure of the labor market. The economic uncertainties and dislocation of the current period have led many to question not only the changing relationship between formal work and economic well-being, but also the role of informal economic activities in advanced capitalist economies. These questions are particularly pertinent for those living in rural areas where working poverty has long been more prevalent and the social relations that foster informal economic activities are thought to be more widespread. This research pursues two separate but related lines of inquiry to shed light on these issues. First, drawing on nationally representative cross-sectional data this study assesses the changing relationship between formal employment and family economic well-being between 1980 and 2000, paying special attention to the differences between metro and nonmetro areas. Second, drawing on a combination of interview and survey data, this study provides a broader examination of family livelihood strategies in the context of nonmetro Pennsylvania, including participation in the informal economy. This research shows a rise in working poverty, and a steady convergence between metro and nonmetro areas in this regard over the last 20 years. Further, this research shows a distinct disadvantage suffered by nonstandard workers in nonmetro areas.

In this thesis, non-linear three dimensional FEA models are developed using PAM-CRASH to perform simulations of heavy truck tires running on both rigid surfaces and soils.  These models include an FEA truck tire model and an elastic-plastic FEA soil model.  The FEA models are then used to calculate parameters for a new semi-empirical off-road rigid ring model.\n\nAn FEA truck tire model of a Goodyear RHD 315/80R22.5 drive tire for tractor semi-trailers is generated and the properties are tuned to match the manufacturer\u2019s specifications.  Simulations are performed under typical loading conditions to establish the behavior of the tire.  An elastic-plastic FEA soil model, designed to represent sandy loam, is developed using material properties from published data and is validated using a number of previously published techniques.  The construction of the tire and soil models and the methods used for validation are explained in detail in this thesis.  A comparison between the tire running on rigid road and soft soil is made by performing various simulations for both cases.\n\nA new semi-empirical off-road rigid ring tire model is developed as a simplified model to describe the behavior of a heavy truck tire running on soft soil.  This model is a modification of the rigid ring tire model developed by Pacejka and Zegelaar and includes additional parameters to incorporate the flexibility of the soil.  Rigid ring parameters for the Goodyear RHD 315/80R22.5 truck tire are calculated for both the on and off-road rigid ring models.\n\nThe results show that, in general, for a tire running on a sandy loam the motion resistance coefficient is approximately three times higher than on rigid road.  The longitudinal slip stiffness is about a factor of four lower for sandy loam than for rigid road.  This indicates that the available tractive force on sandy loam is about one-fourth of the available tractive force on rigid road.  Interestingly, the longitudinal, or tractive force, appears to continue to increase with slip on sandy loam, while the tractive forces on rigid road level out after reaching a peak around 20% slip.  When the tire and soil model is run at high slip angle it is noticed that the soil begins to \u2018build up\u2019 in front on the tire, causing an additional lateral force due to the pushing of the soil.  \n\nUtilizing well validated and robust FEA models to predict the off-road behavior of tires may reduce the need to perform physical experiments, thereby reducing the cost and time required to obtain results and affect design changes.  The off-road rigid ring model can be used in industry for full vehicle simulations for durability testing and structural dynamics.  It is safe to assume that the use of finite element analysis in research and development will continue to rise as the available processing power of computers increases and become cheaper.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2812], "author_name_tesi": "Slade, Jeffrey Lawrence", "last_name_ssi": "Slade", "middle_name_ssi": "Lawrence", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Moustafa El Gindy", "Dr Moustafa El Gindy", "Kevin L Koudela"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Moustafa El Gindy, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Moustafa El Gindy, Thesis Advisor", "Kevin L Koudela, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rigid ring model off-road truck tire finite elemen"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Neutrophil-mediated Melanoma Adhesion and Migration in Shear Flow\n", "id": "6938", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4199", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-12-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An in vitro flow-migration chamber was developed and used to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of PMN-mediated melanoma cell extravasation under dynamic shear-flow conditions. In general, melanoma cells lack the adhesion molecules necessary to interact with the endothelium in a manner similar to leukocytes. It is hypothesized here that melanoma cells exploit the adhesive ability of leukocytes to improve their adhesion to and migration through the vascular endothelium under flow conditions.\n\n\nPolymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils; PMNs) were found to increase melanoma cell extravasation under flow conditions via an adhesion-dependent mechanism, specifically ICAM-1/B2-integrin interactions. The migration was characterized over a range of shear stresses and shear rates. The hydrodynamics of PMN-melanoma adhesion and migration correlate with the inverse of shear rate, in contrast to PMN-endothelial adhesion that correlates with both shear stress and shear rate. PMN-facilitated melanoma migration can be described as a two-step process. PMNs must first adhere to the endothelial substrate, which is followed by tumor cell adhesion to a previously adhered PMN. \n\n\nMelanoma cells were also found to alter PMNs\u2019 phenotype and biochemical secretion by cytokine communication using interleukin-8 (IL-8) and possibly other inflammatory mediators. IL-8 secretion is induced in PMNs but not melanoma cells when they are cultured together. In addition, the cell surface adhesion molecule CD11b, a subunit of the B2-integrin Mac-1, is upregulated on PMNs when they are co-cultured with melanoma cells. Blocking the IL-8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 on the PMNs prevents this upregulation of CD11b. Blocking the IL-8 receptors or neutralizing soluble IL-8 also attenuates the increase in melanoma migration due to PMN-facilitation. This suggests that a self-stimulatory microenvironment is created between melanoma cells and PMNs that potentially elicits immuno-editing by tumor cells.\nFinally, a mathematical model, based on population balance analysis, was developed to simulate tumor cell and PMN aggregation near a substrate. The model successfully predicted aggregation results of tumor cells and PMNs over a range of shear rates and two antibody treatments. The model was not successful at modeling changes in the population ratio of tumor cells to PMNs. The model provides a method to simulate collisions near a substrate but does not accurately model adhesion to the substrate, which is a requisite step in PMN-facilitated melanoma migration.\n\n\nPMN-facilitated melanoma adhesion is a complex multi-step process that is regulated by both micro-fluid transport and biological signaling. Together, the flow migration assay and biological data could possibly aid in the identification of pharmaceutical targets for cancer metastasis therapies.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4172], "author_name_tesi": "Slattery, Margaret June", "last_name_ssi": "Slattery", "middle_name_ssi": "June", "first_name_ssi": "Margaret", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheng Dong", "William O Hancock", "Peter J Butler", "Andrew Thomas Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheng Dong, Committee Chair", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymorphonuclear leukocytes", "cancer", "beta2-integrin", "ICAM-1", "interleukin-8"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "SIMULATION AND CONTROL OF DISTRIBUTED MULTI-AGENT BASED LOGISTICS SYSTEMS\n\n\n", "id": "9655", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6451", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis investigates logistics systems in which distributed entities cooperate to serve demands by allocating supplies and transportation resources.  In particular, a simulation framework, the Distributed Resource Allocation Planning and Execution Simulation (DRAPES), was designed and implemented as a distributed discrete-event simulation using agents.  Using an agent-based approach, the simulation\u2019s purpose is to determine how local decision rules and processes followed by an agent affect the global performance of the system.  Agents represent the distributed decision making entities, or units, of the logistics system, and have clearly defined information sensors, communication channels, local knowledge, and actions to change the state of the system.  Also, computationally, the agent-based approach helped to design a successful simulation that has potential in the future to work with emulated software components of a real logistics system.\n\nSimple rules from two different control methods were tested on the simulation.  First, a decentralized approach follows a process of iterative bidding based on demands\u2019 priorities to determine which unit will fulfill which demand.  Second, in a centralized approach, the distributed units send reports to a centralized controller, which in turn assembles the information, solves a mixed-integer program, and distributes the results as orders to the rest of the system.  Simulation runs were made using scenarios that tested not only each approach\u2019s ability to generate an initial plan but also its ability to re-plan as the system state changed.  The centralized control approach was found to consistently fulfill more demands, and achieve a better system utility than the decentralized approach.  Because of computational limitations for solving the mixed-integer program, future work is recommended to improve each of these control methods and consider how a hybrid approach could be implemented.\n\nThis work was designed and implemented to simulate a real-life logistics system.

The differential exposure-reactivity model provides support for the role of neuroticism in increased reactivity to daily stress, and the cognitive-hyperarousal model of insomnia provides support for the role of neuroticism in impaired sleep. However, these models have not been integrated, nor tested longitudinally in naturalistic settings with comprehensive measures of both daily experiences and sleep. \n\nTo address these gaps, the current research investigated the role of neuroticism in the associations between daily experiences and sleep quality using a 14-day daily diary design. The study included the investigation of three aims: 1) examining the role of neuroticism in predicting exposure to daily positive and negative experiences (DPEs and DNEs, respectively); 2) examining the moderating role of neuroticism in the within-person associations between exposure to DPEs and DNEs and daily positive and negative affect (PA and NA, respectively); and 3) examining the mediating role of average daily PA and NA in the association between neuroticism and subjective and objective sleep quality. Participants (N = 60 young adults; Mage = 25.33 \u00b1 3.98 years; 53% female) completed a baseline questionnaire and a 14-day daily diary protocol, during which they completed two surveys per day and wore an actigraphy device for determination of objective sleep quality. \n\nResults revealed that neuroticism was not associated with a higher frequency of DNEs, but it was associated with a lower frequency of DPEs. Compared to those lower in neuroticism, for those higher in neuroticism, days with more DNEs than usual were associated with greater differences in NA, and days with more DPEs than usual were associated with greater differences in PA and NA. Neuroticism was associated with greater average daily NA, lower average daily PA, and worse subjective but not objective sleep quality. Average daily NA, but not PA, mediated the associations between neuroticism and subjective as well as some objective measures of sleep quality. \n\nThese findings underscore the importance of assessing both DPEs and DNEs, as well as the contention that those higher in neuroticism are more labile in their positive and negative affect in daily life. Daily negative affect may be an important intervening pathway between neuroticism and impaired sleep quality. Findings help identify those individuals at greater risk for affective lability and sleep-related disturbance and help better characterize the daily psychological processes by which neuroticism may contribute to impaired health.

A biological time scale of less than\ntwo years and the spatial scale of the streambed substrate in a channel cross-section are\nused to assess recovery for the macroinvertebrate habitat. An historical time scale and a\nwatershed spatial scale are utilized to examine landuse history and its impacts on the\nriparian tree community in the former impoundment. A geomorphologic time scale\ncoupled with a channel and valley cross-section morphology spatial scale provide the\nintermediate link between the coarse watershed scale and the fine macroinvertebrate\nhabitat scale. The temporal evolution of stream morphologic and habitat recovery after\ndam removal is studied by examining the recovery of the former impoundment at an\nhistorically failed dam site as a surrogate for an intentional dam removal situation.\nThis study shows that one habitat, the streambed macroinvertebrate habitat, may\nhave fully recovered at one temporal/spatial scale and another, the riparian tree\ncommunity habitat, may still be significantly impaired at another temporal/spatial scale.\nThe recovery of the one and the continued impairment of the other have both been\ncontrolled by a common watershed landuse history. Clarification of the inter-scale\nconnections and the intra-scale processes inherent in a fluvial landscape is essential to\nmaking effective dam removal or other stream restoration decisions.\nField data collection methods employed are those in common usage by stream\nrestoration technicians and watershed planners. Analysis subjects the data to more\nrigorous methods.

Although carbohydrate partitioning is critical for the proper growth and development of plants, little is known about the genes that regulate carbon flux.  The main goals of this thesis were to identify and characterize these genetic factors and to determine their function within the context of whole-plant carbohydrate partitioning. \nThe first two chapters of this thesis provide a comprehensive review of the previously identified mechanisms and molecular components that function in carbohydrate transport in plants.  Much of the research presented in this thesis focuses on the structure and function of the phloem, a vascular tissue that transports sugars and other compounds throughout the plant.  Chapter 1 summarizes the three main mechanisms of phloem loading of sugars and discuses our current state of knowledge of how they are regulated.  Chapter 2 reviews the functions of sucrose transporters, proteins that are responsible for moving sugars across membranes in cells.  This chapter mainly summarizes the roles of sucrose transporters in monocot species of plants, which includes maize (Zea mays), the model system used in all of the research presented in this thesis.  The maize genome encodes seven putative sucrose transporters (SUTs).  When my research began, it was unclear which of these genes functioned in phloem loading in maize.  Previous research suggested that the SUT1 protein would be the most likely candidate, although the orthologous proteins in rice and sugarcane, two closely related monocot species, do not appear to function in phloem loading.  Chapter 3 details my characterization of the sut1 mutant which shows that the SUT1 protein has an essential function in phloem loading in maize.  \nTo identify additional components involved in carbohydrate partitioning, a forward genetic approach was taken to identify mutants defective in carbohydrate export from leaves.  tie-dyed1 (tdy1) was the first of these mutants to be identified and characterized.  Tdy1 was previously cloned and found to encode a novel grass-specific phloem expressed protein.  Chapter 4 details my efforts to elucidate the function of TDY1 using molecular studies.  I found is a phloem-specific transmembrane protein that localized to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum.  In chapter 5, I used a genetic analysis to demonstrate that TDY1 does not participate in starch synthesis or breakdown, providing support for our hypothesis that TDY1 functions in carbon export from maize leaves.  Chapter 7 describes my efforts to further understand the function of the Tdy pathway by cloning the Tdy2 locus.  Tdy2 encodes a callose synthase1 catalytic subunit that is expressed in the cells that will give rise to the vasculature.  Based on the predicted function of TDY2 and phenotypic analysis of the tdy2 mutant, I proposed a new hypothesis that the Tdy pathway functions in plasmodesmata development in the cell wall interface between the companion cells and sieve elements, the cells that principally comprise the phloem tissue.  Forward genetic screening also led to the identification of another mutant with a similar carbohydrate export defective phenotype to that of both tdy1 and tdy2, named psychedelic.  In chapter 6, genetic analyses reveal that the psychedelic mutant displays duplicate factor inheritance and functions independently of the known pathways controlling carbohydrate partitioning.  \nCollectively, the research conducted in this thesis has led to the identification and functional characterization of multiple genes and genetic pathways that regulate carbohydrate partitioning in maize. These studies establish the foundation for future experiments to determine the genetic pathways controlling carbohydrate partitioning in plants. Chapter 8 discusses the broader impacts of these findings and future directions for carbohydrate partitioning research. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6220], "author_name_tesi": "Slewinski, Thomas Louis", "last_name_ssi": "Slewinski", "middle_name_ssi": "Louis", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Braun", "David M Braun", "Paula M Mc Steen", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "Richard Cyr", "Mark Guiltinan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Braun, Dissertation Advisor", "David M Braun, Committee Chair", "Paula M Mc Steen, Committee Member", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Member", "Richard Cyr, Committee Member", "Mark Guiltinan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Carbohydrate partitioning", "Maize", "Sucrose Transporter", "Genetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Product Family Optimization Approach Using Multidimensional Data Visualization\n", "id": "10755", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3714", "abstract_tesi": "Product families have become an effective way for companies to provide the variety of products customers desire while keeping manufacturing costs relatively low.  One of the most difficult tasks in designing a product family is deciding which components to make common and which to leave unique.  There have been several approaches to this problem \u2013 some more formal than others \u2013 including the use of expert knowledge as the basis for commonality decision-making and the use of optimization algorithms.  This thesis introduces an approach utilizing multidimensional data visualization to aid product family designers and create a new hybrid approach for commonality decisions.  Sometimes designers struggle to recognize trade-offs because they cannot \u201csee\u201d inside the \u201cblack-box\u201d models and optimization methods.  Understandably, designers are often wary of solutions they cannot visualize.  Using data visualization tools, designers can view the output from an optimization algorithm while also using their knowledge to \u201csteer\u201d the optimization in a desirable direction.  The purpose of the proposed approach is to discover appropriate levels of commonality for a product family using multidimensional data visualization techniques in conjunction with optimization algorithms.  The proposed approach involves five steps: (1) problem formulation, (2) optimization of all common and all unique solutions, (3) visualization of unique optimization designs with parallel coordinates, (4) optimization based on visualization results, and (5) plot of design envelope to visualize results.  Multidimensional data visualization is used with \u201con-the-fly\u201d design generation to enable designers to see and interact with the product family optimization process.  The approach also allows designers to identify subsets of commonality rather than limit decisions to either commonality across all product variants or none at all.  The end result of the approach provides designers with a plot of several platform options where trade-offs can be seen easily in the design space.  Two examples are used to demonstrate this approach: (1) a family of three General Aviation Aircraft (GAA) and (2) a family of three robots.  In both cases, a Pareto frontier of several platforms with varying levels of commonality is created, and although the approach is inherently subjective, it is shown to be effective and flexible; however, there are areas that can be improved.  Currently, the approach has more difficulty with discrete variables compared to continuous variables due to limits of the visualization tools.  Additionally, both examples used in this thesis are families of products containing three product variants.  Testing should be performed on the proposed approach on families with more variants to see how well the approach scales to larger families and more design variables.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3695], "author_name_tesi": "Slingerland, Laura A.", "last_name_ssi": "Slingerland", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson", "Timothy William Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy William Simpson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["multiobjective optimization", "product platform", "product family", "commonality", "visualization"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Exploring adolescents' productions of affect through beadwork", "id": "19677", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9403", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Elizabeth Ellsworth asked, \u201cHow does the fact of human embodiment affect activities of teaching and learning?\u201d (2005, p. 2).

Through this study, I seek to understand how relationships with the local contexts inform various Ojibwe art practices and processes. The central concerns of my study are to expand and shift art education disciplinary framings and value sets that behold American Indian cultural art forms as artifacts.\nI investigate situated meaning making processes (e.g. cultural influences) embedded in Ojibwe cultural arts practices as a means to expand upon arts-focused ontology, that I define as an embodied and emplaced way of being within a particular ecology, while generating particular art forms. Ojibwe artists\u2019 processes of cultural production are of extreme importance, which includes the harvesting, collecting, and cleaning of intended cultural art materials within northern Minnesota woodland ecology. My interests to investigate Ojibwe artists who produce works within local Ojibwe contexts are a means to move beyond static representations of American Indian art as cultural artifacts relegated to the past. Rather, I aim to rupture this static understanding in order to attend to the lived complexity of ecological thinking, learning and communicating relationships within particular place-based contexts. Shifting focus in arts production-processes to an interconnected exploration of lived experience within interwoven ecologies constitutes differing requirements contingent upon a slower and expansive inquiry that attends to the complexity of lived experience. \nI draw from multi-sited ethnography methodology as a means to broach the complexity of Ojibwe lived experience, meaning making processes, and arts practices. Multi-sited ethnography affords a dynamic and flexible approach to investigate the ensembles of relationships that intertwine and influence Ojibwe artist-participants arts ontology. Multi-sited ethnography also views Ojibwe artist-participants as co-constructors, or para-ethnographers of the research, which decenters my role of the researcher in addition the focus of the study. Decentering my role as researcher influenced my postionality among Ojibwe artist-participants; shifting among positions of laborer, house sitter, animal care-taker, learning-artist, and friend among others. In addition to phenomenological data accrued from my decentered positionalities, I utilized field notation, photographic and video documentation, as well as informal conversations as an open concept of interview as methods of amassing data The multi-positionalities generated research ethics of care (Noddings, 1988, 2002; Slote, 2007). Ethics of care corresponded with formulating trusting relationships with Ojibwe artist-participants over a span of three-months time. I posit ethics of care and respectful representation in research writing broaches critical proximity of lived experience through descriptive narratives that are comprised of participants\u2019 arts processes, personal histories, and voices. \nThroughout my research I aim to draw comparisons and relationships among Indigenous knowledge frameworks expressed by Ojibwe artist-participants, academics (Barnhardt & Kawagley 2005; Cajete, 2000, 2005; Vizenor, 2008), and Western conceptual theories of emplacement (Foucault, 1986; Pink, 2011) and relational-materialism (Anderson & Harrison, 2008). In doing so I aim to demonstrate positive differences and correspondences while also examining the shortcomings of Western conceptual theories when discussing Indigenous worldviews, creative processes and products. I believe that the Western education paradigm has much to learn from American Indian ways of thinking, being, teaching and learning in general and from the Ojibwe specifically.\nI explore how Ojibwe participants\u2019 processes and works, which are formulated upon interspecies relationships within localized ecological contexts, and expand upon Foucault\u2019s conception of emplacements. I posit that reframing artworks, as places comprised of body, mind and ecological relationships, otherwise noted as emplacements, foregrounds artists relationships that are integral and interdependent within the web of relational-experience. \nFurthermore, my exploration of relational materialism does not fully explain Ojibwe participants\u2019 relationships within particular contexts nor do I intend it to do so through a singular perspective. Rather, I set forth to broach connections between Ojibwe artist-participants\u2019 explanations and non-Native theoretical considerations as a means to generate relationships between and among peoples rather than attempt to derive a reductive representation of Ojibwe artist-participants\u2019 meaning making processes and relationships within localized communities and interconnected ecologies. \nMy intention and hope is that Ojibwe artists\u2019 creative works may serve as access points for readers and future students within art education settings to Indigenous knowledge and life-ways, which can enhance, expand, and generate opportunities to learn from and with/in local ecologies to inform an ontology of interspecies interdependence; a way of living, being, and thinking through reciprocal relationships.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9170], "author_name_tesi": "Slivka, Kevin Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Slivka", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Marie Amburgy", "Kimberly Anne Powell", "Booker Stephen Carpenter Ii", "Gail Louise Boldt", "Bruce Duane Martin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Marie Amburgy, Dissertation Advisor", "Kimberly Anne Powell, Committee Chair", "Booker Stephen Carpenter Ii, Committee Member", "Gail Louise Boldt, Committee Member", "Bruce Duane Martin, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["American Indian", "Ojibwe", "Indigenous knowledge", "emplacement", "multi-sited ethnography", "relationships"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ELUCIDATING DIFFERENCES IN PHENOLIC PROFILE BETWEEN TEF (ERAGROSTIS TEF) VARIETIES USING MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES", "id": "14208aqs6096", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14208", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tef (Eragrostis tef) is a cereal grain endemic to Ethiopia. Due to its small size it is milled whole and, therefore, tef flour retains the phenolic compounds that are present mostly in the bran layer of the grain. These phenolic compounds are found in three forms: free, conjugated (bound to soluble fiber/sugars), and bound (bound to insoluble fiber). In cereals, bound phenolic compounds make up the largest portion of total phenolics and can be released by hydrolyzing the ester bonds with strong alkali or acid.  It is thought that the distribution of phenolic compounds between these fractions and interaction with fiber within a certain food can have unique influence on metabolism and physiology in the body of those who consume it. However, many factors including variety can affect phenolic content. Eight tef varieties, six grown in the same season (2012) and location (Bishoftu, a.k.a. Debrezeit, Ethiopia) and two grown in Idaho, USA (purchased from TeffCo in 2016) were extracted to characterize their free, conjugated, and bound phenolic profiles. Extracts were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), and phenolic acids were identified and quantified by matching peak elution times to external standards and standard calibration curves, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) and multifactor analysis (MFA) were run to compare chromatograms of the different fractions and varieties. These analyses were able to differentiate between brown and white varieties in the free and bound phenolic fractions with separation in the first principal component being dominated by large hydrophobic compounds eluting in the flavonoid portion of the chromatogram. Ferulic acid was found to be the most abundant phenolic compound in the bound fraction with the DZ-Cr-384 (Kuncho) variety having the highest ferulic acid content (280.73 \u03bcg/g defatted tef flour).

The first is expressing the Belinkskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL) conjecture in a manner suitable for loop quantization. The BKL conjecture says that on approach to space-like singularities in general relativity, \u2018time derivatives dominate over spatial  derivatives\u2019 so that the dynamics at any spatial point is well captured by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. A large body of numerical and analytical evidence has accumulated in favor of these ideas, mostly using a framework adapted to the partial differential equations that result from analyzing Einstein's equations. By contrast we begin with a Hamiltonian framework so that we can  provide a formulation of this conjecture in terms of variables that are tailored to non-perturbative quantization. We explore this system in some detail, establishing the role of `Mixmaster' dynamics and the nature of the resulting singularity. Our formulation serves as a first step in the analysis of the fate of generic space-like singularities in loop quantum gravity.\n\nThe second issue is that of the role of inflation in LQC. In LQC the big bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce which is followed by a robust phase of super-inflation. We establish the behavior of effective equations for LQC in a generic setting then investigate in detail the particular case of early universe inflation caused by the slow roll of a scalar field down its potential. A natural measure is formed on the space of solutions to the equations of motion and it is established that in this scenario the a priori probability of seeing the required 68 efolds of inflation is in fact very high which stands in stark contrast to the results that have been presented in the classical case. In doing so we show that inflation in LQC suffers from no `fine tuning' issue and is in fact a generic feature.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1429], "author_name_tesi": "Sloan, David ", "last_name_ssi": "Sloan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Abhay Vasant Ashtekar", "Abhay Vasant Ashtekar", "Martin Bojowald", "Tyce De Young", "Nigel David Higson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Abhay Vasant Ashtekar, Dissertation Advisor", "Abhay Vasant Ashtekar, Committee Chair", "Martin Bojowald, Committee Member", "Tyce De Young, Committee Member", "Nigel David Higson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Loop Quantum Cosmology", "Loop Quantum Gravity", "Inflation", "Measures of Probability"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EXAMINATION OF TAIL TENDON BREAK TIME: STATUS AS A BIOMARKER OF AGING & GENETIC INFLUENCES\n\n\n\n", "id": "8403", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3725", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tail tendon break time (TTBT) has been considered a biomarker of aging to examine collagen crosslinking changes between strains and species, and also to measure genetic differences with age.  Investigation of changes in TTBT with age and genetic influences were examined in two different projects: the Biomarkers of Aging in Mice (BAM) and QTL Analysis of Age-Related Phenotypes (QAARP).  The BAM project examined biomarkers of aging (behavioral, physiological and immunological) longitudinally in two generations of a heterogeneous stock (HS) of mice, with measurement occasions at 45, 90, 360, 630, and 900 days of age.  Aspects of TTBT that were assessed included correlations across the ages, the relationship with longevity and other biomarkers, and heritability estimates across time determining the genetic influence on TTBT during the lifespan.  The QAARP project utilized B6D2F2 animals from a C57BL/6J and DBA/2J cross, and 23 BxD recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from the same progenitor strains, evaluating a wide array of phenotypes.  In this study, examination of TTBT included calculation of heritability estimates for the B6D2F2 and BxD RI animals, a QTL analysis in the same two groups of mice, and further examination of two strains: BxD 8 and BxD 22 with unusual TTBT values.  The calculated heritability estimates were extremely low for the HS mice throughout the lifespan, whereas the B6D2F2 and BxD RI animals revealed high estimates of heritability in early life that decreased with age.  Furthermore, the correlations of TTBT demonstrated instability across age, which implies TTBT at one time point does not predict subsequent values later in life.  The relationships of TTBT with other biomarkers were inconsistent during the lifespan, differing between ages and sexes, indicating changes in developmental processes across time.  Data from both studies show that TTBT does not reliably predict longevity.  The QTL analysis nominated eight QTLs, two associated with potential candidate genes, and six that may be informative for other genetic factors affecting the extracellular matrix.  The BxD 22 RI strain displays TTBT values much greater than the other BxD RI strains, apparently influenced by a single locus.  The other outlying BxD RI strain (BxD 8) exhibits a large significant sex difference of increased TTBT occurring between early adulthood and middle-age, suggesting a potential hormonal difference between this strain and the other BxD RI strains.

This work describes the formation of thin anodic films on tantalum when anodization is performed in dilute phosphoric acid.  It has long been known that such materials exhibit a bi-layer structure, but studies on the formation and characteristics of the individual layers are lacking. \n\nA quantitative description for the formation of the two individual layers is achieved by determining the kinetic rate constants and thermodynamic transfer coefficients of point defect reactions.  The Faradaic impedance due to the formation of oxygen vacancies and tantalum interstitials is determined; the experimental impedance is described using an equivalent electrical analog, and the model is optimized to experimental electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS).  Empirical investigations of the growth rates of the individual oxide layers were made using FT-IR reflectance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE.)  The empirical investigations of oxide growth rates provide verification for the parameters of the reported point defect model (PDM).  The optical properties of the individual layers formed under a variety of formation conditions are determined using SE.  It is demonstrated that the dielectric functions of the inner layer of pure oxide are significantly different than the dielectric functions of the outer layer, which contains incorporated phosphate.

Due to increasing data sizes and complexities, it is important to develop efficient and scalable approaches for the algorithms, tools, and techniques used to study such data. Efficient utilization of the increasing heterogeneity and complexity of modern high performance computing systems is another major consideration for these efforts. \n\nThe primary contributions of this thesis are as follows: First, parallel and scalable solutions to several basic graph analytics are presented. An implementation of the color-coding algorithm for subgraph isomorphism is introduced as FASCIA (Fast Approximate Subgraph Counting and Enumeration). Using several optimizations for work avoidance, memory usage reduction, and cache/data movement efficiency, FASCIA demonstrates up to a five orders-of-magnitude per-core speedup relative to prior art. FASCIA is able to calculate the counts of subgraphs up to 10 vertices on multi-billion edge graphs in minutes on a modest 16 node cluster and use these counts for a variety of analytics. Using FASCIA's baseline approach, FastPath is also introduced to find minimum weight paths in weighted networks. The Multistep method is next introduced as an approach for graph connectivity, weak connectivity, and strong connectivity, with a generalization of Multistep also presented for graph biconnectivity. The Multistep approaches are shown to demonstrate a 2-7x mean speedup relative to the prior state-of-the-art. A graph partitioner called PuLP (Partitioning using Label Propagation) is also introduced along with a general distributed graph layout strategy, DGL. PuLP was specifically designed to partition small-world graphs having skewed degree distributions, such as social interaction networks and web graphs. PuLP is able to partition such graphs an order of magnitude faster and with a fraction of the memory of other comparable partitioners (ParMETIS, PT-Scotch) while giving comparable partitions in terms of cut quality and balance. Additionally, this thesis presents how using techniques derived from these efforts, a suite of distributed graph analytics could be implemented and applied to the largest publicly-available web crawl of 3.5 billion pages and 130 billion links. End-to-end execution of analysis using these implementations completing in 20 minutes on only 256 nodes of the Blue Waters supercomputing system. \n\nThroughout this thesis, analyses of the algorithms and subroutines that comprise the Multistep, FASCIA/FastPath, and PuLP/DGL implementations is undertaken. Common optimizations are then identified (e.g., multiple levels of queues to match the memory hierarchy, techniques for non-blocking and asynchronous updates to shared data, efficient distributed communication patterns, among others) and their effects on performance are quantified. It is demonstrated how the optimization techniques can be utilized when processing under the higher degree of parallelism available in modern manycores (GPUs, Intel Xeon Phis) as well as how the techniques can be extended for more general-purpose graph processing in both the shared- and distributed-memory spaces. Also under consideration is the state of current hardware trends, with the goal of identifying how to modify and extend these general optimizations for forthcoming high performance computing architectures. Additionally, new optimizations and potential further research areas are introduced which might also be applicable for accelerating graph processing on these future systems.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11682], "author_name_tesi": "Slota, George Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Slota", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "George", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kamesh Madduri", "Kamesh Madduri", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Wang Chien Lee", "Soundar Kumara", "Sivasankaran Rajamanickam"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kamesh Madduri, Dissertation Advisor", "Kamesh Madduri, Committee Chair", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Member", "Wang Chien Lee, Committee Member", "Soundar Kumara, Committee Member", "Sivasankaran Rajamanickam, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["graph mining", "high performance computing", "graph partitioning", "subgraph isomorphism"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Halo Orbit Design In The Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem Using Differential Evolution", "id": "14758jus558", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14758", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of halo orbit design is to find the initial conditions that lead to a periodic orbit with the desired characteristics.  Conventionally, this is done by applying an analytical solution to get an approximation and refining that solution using differential correction to obtain a periodic orbit.  Although this method has been used successfully in practice, it is highly dependent on the accuracy of the analytical solution and can lead to significant errors between the desired and achieved orbits.  To improve this process, Nath and Ramanan developed a differential evolution scheme to compute halo orbits with a specified Z-amplitude.  Differential evolution was shown to be more accurate than the conventional design method and does not require a good initial guess.  In this work differential evolution is used to compute halo orbits in the Jupiter-Europa system.  In addition to targeting orbits by Z-amplitude, a novel approach is presented to target orbits by X-amplitude and orbital period.  It is found, in agreement with Nath et al., that differential evolution can target halo orbits by Z-amplitude more accurately than traditional methods. It is also shown that differential evolution can target halo orbits by X-amplitude and orbital period, but without additional constraints only planar orbits are computed.  Finally, it is found that the use of a stochastic mutation factor in differential evolution reduces the chance of convergence to a non-optimal solution.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15758], "author_name_tesi": "Small, Jeffrey ", "last_name_ssi": "Small", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Graham Melton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Graham Melton, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Halo Orbits", "CR3BP", "Differential Evolution"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS AND QUANTUM MECHANICAL/MOLECULAR MECHANICAL METHODS FOR PROTON AND HYDRIDE TRANSFER IN THE ENZYME  DIHYDROOROTATE DEHYDROGENASE                                                                                                                \n\n", "id": "6795", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6720", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Inhibiting the enzyme Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase (DHOD) has the effect of interrupting the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway responsible for the generation of precursors for DNA and RNA synthesis.

The defining characteristic of any infectious disease is its ability to transmit; investigation into how host and bacterial factors contribute to facilitate transmission is necessary and will contribute to novel strategies that reduce infectious disease burden. This work utilizes a recently developed model system to measure the transmission of Bordetella bronchiseptica from infected mice to na\u00efve susceptible mice. In particular, this dissertation investigates how vaccine-induced immunity and bacterial factors affect transmission of the Bordetella.\nFirst, we examined the role of an evolutionarily-conserved virulence factor utilized by many bacterial pathogens, the Type III Secretion System (T3SS). Investigation of a mutant lacking an active T3SS failed to transmit to na\u00efve susceptible mice. Following examination of multiple parameters of transmission, initial colonization was identified to be deficient. In the course of natural colonization, a host\u2019s first line of defense against a pathogen is its microbiota. Our analysis revealed that during infection, the T3SS is required for B. bronchiseptica to compete with microbiota in vivo and that displacement of the host microbiota by wild-type B. bronchiseptica occurs during transmission in our model system. Furthermore, prior depletion of microbiota in susceptible mouse by enrofloxacin restored the mutant\u2019s ability to transmit. Another important virulence factor utilized by the Bordetella is filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA). A B. bronchiseptica mutant lacking fhaB was also unable to transmit in this system. Mice inoculated with the mutant failed to shed any bacteria during the time-course. As an important factor in the transmission process, failure to shed dramatically decreases the chances to pass disease to new hosts. FHA is capable of modulating the immune system, and in its absence, B. bronchiseptica failed to recruit neutrophils to the site of infection, a key component previously linked to the shedding of B. bronchiseptica.\nFinally, we have examined how current vaccine strategies can affect transmission rates, identifying discrepancies between whole-cell and acellular vaccines\u2019 ability to control transmission. Examination of mice previously vaccinated revealed that only whole-cell vaccination was able to reduce shedding from infected individuals. In particular, components of the immune system that are recruited to the site of infection play an important role in determining the amount of shedding. Increased recruitment of B cells and decreased recruitment of neutrophils to the nasal cavity of vaccinated mice correlated to the amount of shedding observed from individual mice.\nCombined, the data here suggest roles for both the T3SS and FHA in the transmission of Bordetella, and that current vaccines, while effective at limiting severe disease, fail to affect transmission of the Bordetella. These data are of particular interest, as the causative agent of whooping cough in humans, Bordetella pertussis, has seen resurgence in recent times. The documented rise in cases has raised particular questions concerning current vaccine strategies. Finally, this thesis will discuss the value of this model system in identifying novel mechanisms involved in transmission, as well as therapeutics to control the spread of disease.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9525], "author_name_tesi": "Smallridge, William Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Smallridge", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill", "Eric Thomas Harvill", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Mary J Kennett", "David Peter Hughes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Chair", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Mary J Kennett, Committee Member", "David Peter Hughes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bordetella; Transmission; Vaccination"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Development and Maturation of Brass Music in Renaissance Italy, ca. 1400-1600", "id": "14102", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7369", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "All areas of the arts flourished during the Renaissance, yet none underwent quite as dramatic a change as secular instrumental music. The music of brass instruments in particular grew in utility, demand, and complexity over a trajectory spanning 200 years. Vocal music dominated both the sacred and secular arenas from antiquity through the medieval period, but by the late 1300s instrumental music began to gradually gain in importance. This paper investigates the steady growth that brass music underwent from ca. 1400 to 1600, specifically within the realm of Italian secular music, and culminating with the printed instrumentation of brass instruments found in later sacred music.\nThe civic instrumental ensembles of Florence were the first such bands in Italy, and had the greatest effect on brass music of the Renaissance. The trombadori, trombetti, and pifferi originated as simple bands of civic musicians, whose musical output contained little to no artistic emphasis. Over time the pifferi, a shawm and trombone ensemble, grew into one of the most progressive and influential ensembles of the Renaissance. While the trombadori and trombetti, both all-trumpet ensembles, remained largely static in form and function during this period, the pifferi underwent numerous changes in size, instrumentation, repertoire, salary, exposure, and demand. The Florentine pifferi likely inspired the creation of pifferi ensembles in city-states across Italy. \n\tFactors that influenced the development of the pifferi include the civic bands of Renaissance Germany, and the sophistication of the trombone as a musical instrument. Many German towns had established shawm and trombone ensembles prior to the formation of the Florentine pifferi. The Florentine ensemble\u2019s creation was likely a response to these contemporary German ensembles. The Florentine pifferi, however, reached a level of artistic sophistication that no German ensemble of the day could match.\nThe trombone emerged as an instrument due to the limitations of the slide trumpet, which in turn was a response to the restrictions of the natural trumpet. Around 1350, instrument makers, likely in Germany, added a telescopic slide to the natural trumpet, creating a way for performers to alter the length of the instrument during performance. During the next 100 years, this slide evolved into the double \u201cU\u201d shaped slide characteristic of the modern trombone. As instrument making grew more refined, trombones appeared more frequently in pifferi ensembles, until by 1524 the trombone was the dominant instrument in the pifferi.\nThe pifferi\u2019s repertory consisted largely of dance music and instrumental arrangements of vocal works. The sacred motet served as the primary resource from which these vocal works were drawn. However, many crossovers between sacred and secular music took place in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, involving not just the music of the pifferi ensemble, but the instruments and musicians as well. All of these factors contributed, either directly or indirectly, to the publication of Giovanni Gabrieli\u2019s Sacrae Symphoniae in Venice in 1597: the first piece in history to specify an ensemble instrumentation of brass instruments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7332], "author_name_tesi": "Smarcz, Nicholas Henry", "last_name_ssi": "Smarcz", "middle_name_ssi": "Henry", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Music Theory and History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marica Susan Tacconi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marica Susan Tacconi, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["brass music", "Renaissance", "Italy", "trombone", "sackbut", "Giovanni Gabrieli", "brass", "cornett", "alta cappella", "alta band", "civic wind band", "Florence", "Neuschel", "Bassano"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Principals' Perceptions of Values and Value Conflicts in Decision-making Processes", "id": "28834", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12475", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The literature addressing values and value conflict in the principalship examines (1) the espoused or demonstrated values of administrators and their impact on decision making, (2) the process of discovering personal values and ethical codes and their application to decision making and (3) how administrators work through value conflict and ethical dilemmas that arise in their daily work.

The chemical structure of the polymer has drastic effects on the transport properties of the membrane due to the morphological structure of the polymer and how water is interacting with the functional groups on the polymer backbone. Therefore studying the dynamics of water adsorbed into a membrane will give insight into how water-polymer interactions influence transport properties of the film. With a better understanding of how to design materials to have specific properties, we can accelerate development of smarter materials for both energy and water treatment applications to increase efficiency and create high-flux materials and processes. The goal of this dissertation is to investigate the water-polymer interactions in proton exchange and uncharged membranes and make correlations to their charge densities and transport properties. \n\tA linear Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic method for measuring the hydrogen bonding distribution of water sorbed in proton exchange membranes is described in this thesis.  The information on the distribution of the microenvironments of water in an ionic polymer is critical to understanding the effects of different acidic groups on the proton conductivity of proton exchange membranes at low relative humidity.  The OD stretch of dilute HOD in H2O is a single, well-defined vibrational band.  When HOD in dilute H2O is sorbed into a proton exchange membrane, the OD stretch peak shifts based on the microenvironment that water encounters within the nanophase separated structure of the material.  This peak shift is a signature of different hydrogen bonding populations within the membrane, which can be deconvoluted rigorously for dilute HOD in H2O compared to only qualitative observations that can be made with pure D2O or H2O.  The theory and experimental practice of determining the hydrogen bonding distribution of water in a range of proton exchange membranes bearing aromatic sulfonate and perfluorosulfonate groups using this OD stretch technique is discussed. \nThe OD stretch of dilute HOD in H2O absorbed in a series of sulfonated syndiotactic poly(styrene) and sulfonated poly(sulfone) membranes was studied using FTIR spectroscopy to measure how the character of the sulfonate headgroup and the backbone polarity influenced the water-membrane interactions. Using a three-state model, the OD stretch yielded information about the populations of absorbed water participating in hydrogen bonds with polymer-tethered sulfonate groups, water in an intermediate state, or water hydrogen bonding with other water molecules. The perflouroalkyl sulfonate moiety, which behaves as a superacid, consistently displayed the largest fraction of headgroup-associated water due to its strong acidic character. Measurements of the OD stretch gave insight to the strength of the hydrogen bonds formed between water and the sulfonate groups. Water associated with the superacid displayed an OD stretch peak position that was blueshifted by 39 cm-1 compared to the aryl sulfonate associated water with an OD stretching frequency that was centered at 2547 cm-1. The polarity of the polymer backbone also affected the OD stretch peak position. As hydration increased, the OD peak stretching frequency in poly(styrene)-based membranes displayed a redshift from 2566 cm-1 to 2553 cm-1, whereas there was no OD peak maxima shift in poly(sulfone)-based membranes due to the greater amount of intermediate water in the more polar poly(sulfone) backbone system.\nTo further understand how the acidity of the sulfonate can be altered and how the acidity affects the hydrogen bonding network of water in a polymer membrane, various polymers with small chemical differences in the perfluorosulfonate sidechain were studied. In addition to the vibrational spectroscopy measurements using HOD as a probe, the partial charges of the sulfonate groups were calculating using DMol3 DFT calculations. The calculations and the experimentally determined peak position of the OD stretch both correlated to give a ranking of acidity for the various sidechains. It was found that having a thioether linkage instead of an ether linkage (typical linkage for perflurosulfonates) increased the acidity of the sulfonate group due to the capability of sulfur to expand its octet and more readily accept additional electron density.  Through DFT geometry optimization, it was discovered that the thioether linkage prefers a kinked configuration while the ether linkage gives a more linear sidechain structure. This structural configuration correlated to experimental findings allowing more water to interact with the sulfonate group containing the ether linkage than the thioether linkage due to the sulfonate group being more easily accessible, even though the thioether sidechain is more acidic.\nThree sulfonated poly(arylene sulfone) based polymers were studied using FTIR and DFT calculations to better understand how the acidity of the sulfonate groups were affected by the placement on the backbone. By increasing the number of sulfone groups, which have electron withdrawing properties, flanking the sulfonated aromatic ring, the acidity was increased. The charge density of a sulfonate group flanked by two sulfone groups was -1.626 (in units of fundamental charge), while the charge density of a sulfonate group flanked by one sulfone group increased to -1.703. Additionally, if the subsequent ring was unsulfonated, the charge density further increased to  1.737, indicating that some stability is gained by both available rings being sulfonated. The differences in charge density are reflected in the water uptake and conductivity measurements, where the samples with the lowest charge density had the highest water uptake and conductivity. The deconvoluted OD peak revealed that the sample with two sulfone groups flanking the sulfonated aromatic ring contains the highest amount of bulk-like water, which led to the increased conductivity. \nThe polyamide active layer of commercially available reverse osmosis membranes was studied at various relative humilities to better understand how the structure of the active layer changes when hydrated. The fingerprint region was used to analyze changes in the vibrational signature of specific functional groups and to understand how different chemical moieties interact with water. Using the difference spectrum, the water-polymer interactions could be quantified and correlated to transport properties of the membrane. Increasing the amount of free carboxylic acid groups on the backbone will lead to an active layer that is less crosslinked and contains a greater number of larger pores, which results in a higher flux. Active layers that contained a smaller concentration of free carboxylic acids were more highly crosslinked and had a higher amount of smaller pores, resulting in a lower flux. \nIn summary, by studying the water hydrogen bonding network in various proton exchange membranes and neutral polyamide membranes, a new understanding of structure-property relationships has been developed. This will lead to a greater understanding of transport properties and conductivity in various polymer membranes. Expanding this fundamental knowledge will lead to the development of smarter materials for energy and reverse osmosis applications, and the ideas developed here can be extended to new types of materials used for various needs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11256], "author_name_tesi": "Smedley, Sarah Black", "last_name_ssi": "Smedley", "middle_name_ssi": "Black", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner", "John B Asbury", "Mark Maroncelli", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Dissertation Advisor", "John B Asbury, Committee Chair", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogen bonding", "proton exchange membrane", "FTIR", "vibrational spectroscopy", "superacid", "water treatment membrane"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS OF ATOMIC AND CLUSTER BOMBARDED SURFACES", "id": "7366", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1791", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The mechanism of enhanced desorption initiated by 15 keV C60 cluster ion \nbombardment of a Ag single crystal surface is examined using molecular dynamics \ncomputer simulations.

Arrays of spherical particles have already found uses in electronic inks, sensing arrays, and many other commercial applications; but, it is a challenge to create specific arrays of morphologically and/or compositionally anisotropic particles. The following chapters illuminate the interactions that drive the assembly of anisotropic particles in high density solutions in the absence of applied fields or solution drying. Special emphasis is placed on the structures that are formed.\nThe properties of micro- and nanoparticles and their assembly are introduced in Chapter 1. We began our studies by examining the assembly of single component nanowires. Chapter 2 describes this work, in which solid Au nanowires measuring 2-7 \u00b5m in length and 290 nm in diameter self-assembled into smectic rows. To increase the particle and array complexity, two-component, metallic nanowire assembly was explored in Chapter 3. n an attempt to obtain better ordering within rows, silica coated nanowires with partial Au cores were made. The synthesis involved silica-coating the nanowires and selectively etching a Ag segment. These particles have extremely different VDWs attractions between their segments, as the Au cores are much more attractive than the solvent-filled etched ends. The assembly of these partially etched nanowires (PENs) is detailed in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. The semi-automated counting of PENs in images by software is used heavily in Chapters 4 and 5.

We have also begun to explore directing assembly through lithographic microwells. Further work needs to explore the integration of arrays into devices and the use of functional materials.

However, the lower performance of organic materials relative to silicon, germanium, and other inorganic components has prevented widespread implementation.  Correspondingly, the overarching goals of the work outlined in this dissertation focus on exploring the fundamental properties and intermolecular interactions of conjugated polymers and utilizing the findings to develop routes for improving thin-film transistor performance.  Charge transport in organic active layers depends largely on the intrinsic carrier mobility of the semiconductor, the morphology achieved during processing and fabrication, as well as the effectiveness of the post-processing techniques.  In this work, we investigate the influence of each and will show how appropriately tuning polymorphism, copolymerization between strong and weakly crystallizing moieties, and fluorine substitution on delocalized cores significantly enhance transistor characteristics.  \n\nCrystalline organic molecules often exhibit the ability to assemble into multiple crystal structures depending on the processing conditions.  Exploiting this polymorphism to optimize molecular orbital overlap between adjacent molecules in the unit lattice is a viable method for improving charge transport within the material.  We have employed grazing-incident X-ray diffraction to demonstrate the formation of tighter stacking poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) polymorphs in films spin coated from ferrocene-containing solutions.  As a result, the addition of ferrocene to casting solutions yields thin-film transistors which exhibit approximately three times higher source-drain currents and charge mobilities than neat polymer devices.  Nevertheless, thorough analysis of the active layer reveals that all ferrocene is removed during the spin coating process, which may be an essential factor to achieve good mobilities.  Such insights gleaned from ferrocene/poly(3-hexylthiophene) mixtures can serve as a template for selection and optimization of other small molecule/polymer systems with greater baseline charge mobilities.  \n\nBlock copolymerization provides yet another avenue for altering the crystal packing behavior and morphology of polymer semiconductors.  Our work reveals that covalently coupling a weakly crystalline acceptor polymer with excellent electron mobility to a strongly crystallizing donor unit can induce ordering in the less crystalline block.  Grazing-incidence X-ray scattering results confirm that shorter interchain spacing distances are obtained in poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(fluorene-dithiophene-benzothiadiazole) copolymers compared with neat poly(fluorene-dithiophene-benzothiadiazole) films.  An enhancement in the ordering of the acceptor moiety was also observed both in neat homopolymer and copolymer samples after thermal annealing at 195 \u00b0C.  Consequently, the electron mobility of the block copolymer, measured in thin-film transistors with aluminum contacts, surpassed that of either homopolymer and peaked at annealing temperatures between 195 \u2013 210 \u00b0C.  \n\nSeveral recent reports have surfaced in the literature in which fluorinated analogues of various donor/acceptor copolymers consistently surpass their non-fluorinated counterparts in terms of performance.  Prior studies have speculated as to the origin of this \u201cfluorine effect,\u201d but concrete evidence has not been forthcoming.  Using a benzodithiophene and benzotriazole copolymer series consisting of fluorinated, partially-fluorinated, and non-fluorinated analogues, we confirm that the addition of fluorine substituents beneficially impacts charge transport in polymer semiconductors.  Transistor measurements demonstrated a 5x rise in carrier mobilities with the degree of fluorination of the backbone.  Furthermore, X-ray diffraction data indicates progressively closer packing between the conjugated cores and an overall greater amount of crystallinity in the fluorinated materials.  It is likely that attractive interactions between the electron-rich donor and fluorinated electron-deficient acceptor units induce very tightly stacking crystallites, which reduce the energetic barrier for charge hopping.  In addition, a change in crystallite orientation was observed from primarily edge-on without fluorine substituents to mostly face-on with dual fluorine groups.  \n\nWe also introduce a promising post-processing technique adapted from existing zone purification and recrystallization methods.  Zone annealing and zone refining are proposed for imparting directionality to the crystallization process, thereby increasing the size of crystallites and uninterrupted conjugation lengths within polymer films.  A custom nichrome wire-based zone heating apparatus developed for zone refining thin films is described, and preliminary results with poly(3-hexylthiophene) are presented.  A comparison with the UV-Vis absorbance of films annealed statically on a hot plate suggests that similar conjugation lengths can be achieved in approximately a sixth of the time with zone refining.  Further optimization and investigatory studies are required before the procedure can be successfully extended to transistor samples, but zone crystallization appears to be a highly compatible post-processing approach for large scale manufacturing.  \n\nThe final portion of this work was dedicated to the development of potential integration venues for organic devices.  Applications which take full advantage of the unique properties of polymer semiconductors will be needed as organic electronics begin the arduous transition into the commercial sphere.  As such, neutron and X-ray detection systems represent two categories where very large area and flexibility would be invaluable.  We therefore explore the feasibility of sensitizing conjugated materials towards either neutrons or X-rays through the incorporation of elements possessing excellent neutron capture or X-ray absorption properties.  The projected mechanisms and challenges associated with direct radiation detection are discussed, and the results obtained from numerous screening experiments, conducted to determine which compounds maintain acceptable performance in transistors, are included.  Based on these trials, boron nitride, 10B-enriched boric acid, and ruthenocene blended with poly(3-hexylthiophene) at extraordinarily high loadings were identified for further scrutiny and eventual response testing with an X-ray or neutron source.  \n\nIn summary, the objectives set forth for this work have been successfully realized.  We examined the impact of several parameters governing charge transport in organic semiconductors, and based on our conclusions, we have identified three approaches for substantially augmenting the performance of polymer field-effect transistors.  We have also considered a useful post-process treatment for large scale device fabrication and illustrated the benefits and potential for adapting conjugated materials for novel detection applications.  The contributions of the research efforts expounded within this dissertation have far reaching implications yet represent only a small part of the general advance of the organic semiconductor field.  Significant progress is being made on many critical fronts, and provided the allure of light weight, completely conformable electronics remains strong, we expect to continue witnessing the steady emergence of ever more numerous devices and gadgets based on organic transistors and diodes.

The lack of efficient radiative cooling in primordial gas meant that the collapse of the first star-forming cloud-cores proceeded very slowly and without fragmenting into multiple objects.  This resulted in the first stars being very massive (30 M<sub>sun</sub> &#8804; M &#8804; 300 M<sub>sun</sub>), \nisolated objects.  When these stars died, in violent supernovae, they produced the very first heavy elements, or metals, and dispersed them into the surrounding gas.  The addition of these metals changed forever the way stars formed by allowing the gas to cool much more efficiently as it collapsed.  It is thought that when the chemical abundance in the next generation star-forming environments reached a critical level, the process of star-formation began producing stars that resemble those observed in the local universe, with characteristic masses of ~1 M<sub>sun</sub>, instead of the behemoths of the early universe.\n\nSimulating this transition in star-formation mode requires the inclusion of the complex chemistry and radiative cooling of heavy elements, which has \ntraditionally been too computationally expensive to be done properly in three-dimensional simulations.  In this dissertation, I introduce a new method for treating the radiative cooling from metals in large-scale, three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that is fast, accurate, and complete in its coverage of the first 30 elements.  I use this cooling method to examine the ability of metals to induce fragmentation in collapsing gas-clouds through lowering of the cooling time-scales and the creation of thermal instabilities.  Comparing the cooling and dynamical time-scales within collapsing gas, I calculate that the critical metallicity, Z<sub>cr</sub>, required for fragmentation into multiple, low-mass objects is ~10<sup>-4.2</sup> Z<sub>sun</sub>, where Z<sub>sun</sub> denotes the metallicity of the sun.  Thermal instabilities are also present in gas-clouds with metallicities, Z &#8805; 10<sup>-4</sup> Z<sub>sun</sub>.\n\nI use the methodology introduced here to perform a series of adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulations of pre-enriched primordial star-formation with varying metallicities.  For metallicities below Z<sub>cr</sub>, only massive, \nsingular objects form, nearly identical to the metal-free case.  For metallicities well above Z<sub>cr</sub>, efficient cooling rapidly lowers the gas temperature to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which is significantly higher in the distant past.  The gas is physically unable to radiatively cool below the CMB temperature, and thus, becomes very thermally stable.  For moderately high metallicities, Z &#8805; 10<sup>-3.5</sup> Z<sub>sun</sub>, this occurs early in the evolution of the gas-cloud, when the \ncentral density is still relatively low.  The resulting cloud-cores show little or no fragmentation, and have mass-scales of a few hundred M<sub>sun</sub>.  On the other hand, if the metallicity is only slightly above Z<sub>cr</sub>, the cloud slowly cools without ever reaching the CMB temperature.  In this case, the minimum cloud temperature is achieved at much higher densities than in the high-metallicity case, resulting in mass-scales of just a few M<sub>sun</sub>.  This implies that not 2, but 3 star-formation modes were present in the early universe: primordial (high-mass), metallicity-regulated (low-mass), and CMB-regulated (moderate-mass).  As the universe evolves to the current epoch, the CMB-regulated mode will slowly transition into the metallicity-regulated mode, as the CMB temperature gradually decreases.  This suggests that the \nmetallicity-regulated mode, which is fully dominant today, may not become so until the CMB temperature drops below the observed temperatures of molecular clouds, ~10 K, which does not occur until redshift, z ~ 2.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [655], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Britton Devon", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "Devon", "first_name_ssi": "Britton", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steinn Sigurdsson", "Niel Brandt", "Jane Camilla Charlton", "Deirdre Shoemaker", "Richard Alan Wade"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steinn Sigurdsson, Committee Chair", "Niel Brandt, Committee Member", "Jane Camilla Charlton, Committee Member", "Deirdre Shoemaker, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Wade, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["numerical simulation", "cosmology", "star formation"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Placing Religion: The Spiritual Geography of Twentieth-Century American Women Writers\n", "id": "7738", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "962", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nMy project, Placing Religion: The Spiritual Geography of Twentieth-Century American Women Writers, explores the ways in which American women writers use narrative (both fictional and nonfictional) to construct a relationship between Christianity, family history, and place. More specifically, the writers I discuss portray a similar pattern: the protagonist returns to a geographical place associated with her mother and with maternal spirituality, and thus she is finally able to find her own \u201cplace\u201d within an ostensibly patriarchal religion. This emphasis on particular places is by no means limited to writers dealing with Christian tradition; however, I narrow my focus to Christian writers because Christianity\u2019s emphasis on the Incarnation of Christ\u2014the entrance of the divine into a particular time and place\u2014often affects the portrayal of spiritual geography in specific ways.  \n\nIn addressing twentieth- and twenty-first-century women\u2019s writing about spirituality and place, then, I draw from a wide range of disciplines: ecocriticism, feminist geography, feminist theology, the theology of place, and literary theories about narrative. Using these tools, I suggest that, throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, women writers have found space and place fruitful in negotiating their position within Christian religious traditions. \n\nThe texts I explore cover a broad range of time (from 1943 to 2003) and genres (conversion narrative, memoir, novel, and short story) but they are linked by a similar narrative arc. Many of these writers portray a paradoxical return \u201chome,\u201d through tracing maternal roots, to a place within religion\u2014a particular place, but not a static, fixed place\u2014rather, a particular place always in flux. This narrative thread gains momentum when read in conjunction with feminist mobility theory, for it offers new possibilities to feminists who find problematic the theoretical trends encouraging them to construct themselves as \u201cnomads.\u201d In these works of spiritual geography, the protagonists manage to find a located, communally responsible, \u201cmobile home\u201d through writing and performing religion. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [955], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Carissa Dawn Turner", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "Dawn Turner", "first_name_ssi": "Carissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah L Clarke", "Christine Lee Gorby", "Iyunolu Folayan Osagie", "Robin G Schulze"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah L Clarke, Committee Chair", "Christine Lee Gorby, Committee Member", "Iyunolu Folayan Osagie, Committee Member", "Robin G Schulze, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["religion", "feminism", "spiritual geography", "literature", "place"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Hearing Voices in Shostakovich:  Uncovering Hidden Meanings in the Film \"Odna\"\n", "id": "10690", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "952", "abstract_tesi": "While the concert works of Dmitri Shostakovich have been subject to much research and analysis by scholars, his works for film remain largely unknown and unappreciated.

Divesting the global energy landscape from these ancient forms of stored solar energy will help alleviate their accompanying problems. Specifically of interest is the utilization of current, not ancient, sunlight. The energy that reaches Earth from the Sun far surpasses humankind\u2019s current consumption. The total world energy consumption in one year was 148,000 Terawatt-hours (or, to use a clever and possibly more comprehensible unit, the energy contained in ~9.7 cubic miles of oil) as of 2008 [1], [2], which is anywhere from 0.003% to 0.01% of the energy supplied to the Earth\u2019s surface by incident sunlight in one year (*). Clearly, collecting only a small fraction of the sun\u2019s electromagnetic radiation has the potential to offset the global dependence on fossil fuels. Solar energy technologies currently account for only 0.2% of the electrical energy generation in the U.S.A. The installation rate is increasing but needs assistance from low-cost solar cell technology [3]. Higher performing solar cells that cost less on a dollar per watt basis than contemporary cells are needed. Particularly, modules that reach a $0.50/W metric are the goal of the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s SunShot Initiative [4]. The desire of this thesis is to identify solar cell architectures that may be manufactured to achieve this. The word photovoltaic, derived from the Greek \u03c6\u03c9\u03c2 (pronounced: ph\u00f4s) meaning \u201clight\u201d [5] and the surname of Alessandro Volta the Italian scientist credited with the creation of the first modern battery [6], is synonymous with the term solar cell. To use a simple definition: a solar cell is a combination of materials that directly produces electricity when placed in sunlight. More precisely, the energy contained in the sunlight\u2019s photons\u2014the quantum of electromagnetic radiation\u2014is captured by the solar cell\u2019s absorber layer and converted into charge carriers (electrons and holes) via the photovoltaic effect. Thus, creating a solar cell that absorbs as many incident photons as possible is one goal of all solar cell designs.\n     This thesis focuses on better comprehending and optimizing a new solar cell architecture called the light and carrier collection management (LCCM) system. Rather than the conventional stack of planar materials, the LCCM design includes a material layer with nano-scale features which creates undulations in the subsequent layers. Computer simulation was used to investigate both the absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the new architecture and the effect of altering the many geometric variables to further increase this absorption. Throughout the design optimization, a dramatic increase in light absorption was witnessed in the LCCM cells relative to that of planar cells. Short-circuit current densities as high as 35.5 milliamperes per square centimeter (mA/cm^2) were attained from simulation results of LCCM solar cells that utilized an ultra-thin nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) absorber layer. This enhanced performance will yield cost benefits when manufacturing a solar cell. If an ultra-thin device (<1000nm) is capable of absorbing wavelengths normally absorbed by a very thick cell (~100,000nm), the consumer will profit from the reduction in required material. Optimized LCCM solar cells attaining 30.2 to 35.5mA/cm^2 were calculated to cost ~$0.02 for one watt of power output; whereas, planar cells capable of reaching the same short-circuit current densities were calculated to cost $0.20 to $0.60 per one watt of power. This thesis will cover the many design variables investigated and show that the LCCM architecture holds the possibility of greatly reducing the cost of modern solar cells.\n\n(*)The power in watts supplied by sunlight for one year can be approximately calculated by using the following assumptions: either the AM1.5G daily power flux of 1000 W/m^2 or the more conservative daily average irradiance of 250 W/m^2, the total surface of the Earth (5.1\u00d710^14 m^2), the number of hours in a day, and the number of days in a year.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8528], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Charles Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Charles", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Fonash", "Wook Jun Nam", "S Ashok"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Fonash, Thesis Advisor", "Wook Jun Nam, Thesis Advisor", "S Ashok, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanoscale device", "numerical simulation", "photovoltaic cell", "silicon", "thin films", "light management", "LCCM"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "UNDERSTANDING CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE CURRICULUM FOR URBAN MINORITY YOUTH THROUGH THE VOICE OF 4H YOUTH & EDUCATORS", "id": "15036ccs5256", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15036", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "4-H has a long history of educating youth through experiential learning, historically in rural areas, focusing on the topics of agriculture and home economics. Today, 4-H exists in rural, suburban, and urban areas, and includes a variety of topics to foster youth development. Even with the expansion of 4-H into urban communities, the percentage of minority participants is comparatively lower than majority participants. The most recent National 4-H strategic plan focuses on cultural responsiveness and diversity inclusion to begin addressing this issue. This research examines the perspectives of 4-H educators and youth to understand the impact of culturally responsive curricula on minority youth motivation and engagement in 4-H programs. Furthermore, this thesis examines 4-H educator teaching practices also. Using a qualitative approach, youth and program staff from a Mid-Atlantic state were selected for in-depth focus groups and interviews. The results reveal the understanding of what and how cultural responsiveness should be included in curricula based on the perspectives of those involved in the programs. \n\tThe findings indicate that 4-H educators operate under two definitions of culture that affect how curriculum cultural responsiveness is perceived. 4-H educators affirm that for a curriculum to be culturally responsive to urban minority youth it must be responsive to the surroundings and the cultures within the urban setting. Educators must understand the needs of urban communities and have the capacity to modify 4-H curricula to meet the needs of those communities. 4-H youth want a curriculum that shows minority youth and represents them. Additionally, 4-H youth want to be welcomed to participate in 4-H programs because, often, urban minority youth do not see how 4-H curriculum programs relate to them and their interests. In most cases, the waning of interest is due to a lack of awareness about 4-H and the historical images of 4-H. Youth communicated how important it is to them that they can relate to the curricula they participate in and apply within their communities. Above all, based on educator and youth statements, if a curriculum can be shown to benefit and serve the needs of urban minority youth, then they will more likely be motivated to engage in 4-H programs. However, cultural responsiveness to meet those needs through curricula is necessary.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16494], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Che'nira Chadon", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "Chadon", "first_name_ssi": "Che'nira", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Nicole Webster", "Dr. Ashley Patterson ", "Dr. Patreese Ingram "], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Nicole Webster, Thesis Advisor", "Dr. Ashley Patterson , Committee Member", "Dr. Patreese Ingram , Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Curriculum", "Cultural Responsiveness", "Urban 4H", "Minority Youth"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Expression of MicroRNAs in the Bovine Corpus Luteum their Impact on Luteal Cell Function\n", "id": "11215", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1059", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The corpus luteum is a temporary endocrine structure that produces progesterone for the maintenance of pregnancy and has many regulatory processes that are involved in its development, function, and regression. MicroRNAs are noncoding RNAs that are 17-25nt in length and function in translational repression by binding to the 3\u2019 untranslated region of its target mRNA.  Because of this repression, microRNAs are able to regulate the expression of many different genes. Drosha, an RNase III enzyme needed for processing the primary microRNA transcript into the precursor microRNA form, is considered one of the most important components in microRNA biogenesis. Little is known about microRNA expression and regulation pertaining in the corpus luteum. Even less is known about miRNA expression in livestock species. \nThe studies presented here are the first studies focusing on microRNA expression in the bovine corpus luteum and miRNA regulatory abilities in bovine luteal cells. To investigate the expression of different miRNAs in luteal tissue, corpora lutea were removed from cyclic Holstein cows on days 4, 10, and 18 of the estrous cycle, and on day 18 of pregnancy. Total RNA enriched with small RNAs were isolated from each treatment and were hybridized to Affymetrix microRNA microarrays. Quantitative PCR was used to confirm microarray results. To assess the importance of microRNAs to luteal cell function, luteal cells were collected after the dissociation of midcycle (day 10-11) luteal tissues and luteal cells were transfected with siRNAs against Drosha to inhibit microRNA biogenesis. Transfected cells were treated with or without LH or TNF-\u00e1 and IFN-\u00e3 to assess the effect of decreased microRNA expression on progesterone production and apoptosis, respectively. \nBovine and nonbovine specific microRNAs were found to be differentially expressed among luteal tissue collected on day 4, 10, and 18 of the estrous cycle and on day 18 of pregnancy. Three microRNAs, miR-10a, miR-103, and miR-99a were confirmed to have increased expression in luteal tissue on day 18 of pregnancy. Overall, thirteen nonbovine miRNAs not previously reported as present in bovine tissues were detected only in luteal tissue on day 18 compared to three miRNAs expressed only in luteal tissue on day 18 of pregnancy. Nonbovine microRNAs were also identified in bovine luteal tissue on day 10 and day 4, with 42 miRNAs expressed only on day 10 and thirteen miRNAs expressed only on day 4. The knockdown of Drosha mRNA expression in luteal cells cultured with LH resulted in a significant decrease (P &#706; 0.05) in progesterone production compared to luteal cells transfected with Drosha siRNAs cultured with no LH. Also, the percentage of apoptosis for cells transfected with Drosha siRNAs and treated with or without TNF-\u00e1 and IFN-\u00e3 significantly increased (P &#706; 0.05) compared to the controls. Overall, these data confirm the presence and differential expression of miRNAs in luteal tissue during the luteal phase and suggest that microRNAs have a role in luteal cell function and survival. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1049], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Courtney Lynne", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynne", "first_name_ssi": "Courtney", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joy Lee Pate", "Joy Lee Pate"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joy Lee Pate, Thesis Advisor", "Joy Lee Pate, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["bovine", "CL", "corpus luteum", "miRNA", "MicroRNAs", "cow"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "READERS THEATRE: ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN IMPROVING READING FLUENCY, STUDENT MOTIVATION, AND ATTITUDES TOWARD READING AMONG SECOND-GRADE STUDENTS\n", "id": "12019", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1507", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examined Readers Theatre as an instructional and motivational tool in comparison to repeated reading.

Early attempts at antislavery activity met with fierce resistance, and so the area\u2019s abolitionists adopted a less confrontational approach, to which the fugitive slave issue was well suited.   South central Pennsylvania (Adams, Franklin, and Cumberland counties) had hundreds of fugitives traveling through during the antebellum decades, aided by an organized underground railroad.  The issue appealed to humanitarianism, and the individual fugitive was less threatening than the potential results of mass emancipation.  Area abolitionists helped lead an unusually effective petition campaign that changed state law, and they crafted a legal strategy prosecuting kidnappers who seized innocent African Americans as fugitives.  Their success brought about a response from the south, and several prominent figures were tried for aiding fugitive slaves.  Through Thaddeus Stevens, the border perspective on the issue even surfaced in Congress during the debates on the 1850 Compromise.  In the border state of Pennsylvania, however, the fugitive slave issue alone could not drive a revolution in politics; the Christiana riot helped unseat an antislavery governor and by the end of the decade of the 1850s, it was the opponents of helping fugitives that were agitating this issue more than the proponents.\n\tThe drawbacks to emphasizing this issue over militant, immediate abolitionism with an emphasis on equal rights became apparent during the Civil War and its aftermath.  The fugitive slave issue was writ large during the war, as hundreds of \u201ccontrabands\u201d from Maryland and Virginia swarmed into the area, and scores were recaptured by the Confederate army during its invasions.  After the war, a variety of social and demographic changes worked against African Americans achieving lasting improvements in status or opportunities.  Although many works of popular memory remembered this area as a vanguard of the Underground Railroad, by the 1920s, south central Pennsylvania had become in many ways as segregated as most parts of the Jim Crow South.  Ironically, the fugitive slave issue, by reinforcing images of dependency, may have actually worked against achievement of lasting social change.  \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1390], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, David Grant", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "Grant", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Alan Blair", "Anne Carver Rose", "Lori D Ginzberg", "Stephen Howard Browne", "Richard J M Blackett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Alan Blair, Committee Chair", "Anne Carver Rose, Committee Member", "Lori D Ginzberg, Committee Member", "Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Member", "Richard J M Blackett, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["border", "petition", "fugitive slaves", "abolitionism", "anti-slavery", "antislavery", "Pennsylvania", "Thaddeus Stevens", "contrabands", "African Americans", "Gettysburg", "Robert E.

A newly-erupted, relatively unworn M3 exhibits drastically different characters than that tooth would after a lifetime of wear. On a highly-worn molar, the lophs that comprise the occlusal surface are more broadly spaced and the enamel ridges thicken in comparison to these respective characters on an unworn molar. Since Mammuthus taxonomy depends on the lamellar frequency (# of lophs/decimeter of occlusal surface) and enamel thickness of the third molar, given the effects of wear it becomes apparent that these taxonomic characters are variable throughout the tooth\u2019s life. Therefore, employing static taxonomic identifications that are based on dynamic attributes is a fundamentally flawed practice.\nTo help resolve the relationship between M. columbi and M. primigenius, I quantified the proportions of the characters that comprise the occlusal surface of Mammuthus third molars. Using computed tomography (CT), I digitized a sample of teeth from both species, creating models of continual wear via the removal of slices from the occlusal surface to the base of the crown. At each time slice, I calculated the occlusal enamel percentage, enamel thickness, and lamellar frequency of the exposed surface of the tooth. I then examined the relationship between relative wear percentage and dental characters to determine if there was a separation between the two species of mammoth with wear. My results demonstrate a prevalence of intraspecific variation, making a consistent separation of species difficult. In the absence of accompanying cranial morphologies or molecular data, delineation of the North American mammoth species based solely on molar morphology remains challenging, if not impossible. Additionally, the scatter in enamel values in M. columbi molars is indicative of a less phenotypically stable organism, suggesting that M. primigenius was the mammoth with a more highly conserved niche. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11085], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Gregory James", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Russell W Graham", "Eric S Post", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY", "Timothy Michael Ryan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Russell W Graham, Thesis Advisor", "Eric S Post, Thesis Advisor", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy Michael Ryan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mammoth", "taxonomy", "ecology", "teeth", "molar", "morphology", "computed tomography", "CT", "paleontology", "geology", "quaternary", "pleistocene"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Designing Processing in Memory Architectures via Static Analysis of Real Programs", "id": "15231hfs5022", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15231", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Processing in Memory (PIM) architectures have displayed a number of benefits over traditional processor architectures. By inserting compute elements nearer to---or inside---memory, data movement can be drastically reduced. This in turn reduces the time spent and the energy expended moving data, in addition to reducing memory contention and freeing processor cycles for more computation.\n\nHowever, Processing in Memory architectures will not see popular adoption if there are not applications which can utilize them. Many PIM architectures present a high barrier to entry for software: to effectively utilize processing in memory, entire programs may need to be rewritten. Without promise of increased performance and decreased energy consumption for their application, software designers may not be willing to put in the effort to redesign their software.\n\nIn this thesis, we conduct a Processing in Memory design exploration entirely from the software perspective. With the above issues in mind, we focus on developing a PIM architecture which accelerates computation patterns found in real programs. \n\nWe first form a hypothesis about simple computation patterns which could be offloaded to memory, and define a basic PIM architecture to accelerate those patterns. Using static analysis tools, we then dig deep into applications and benchmarks to evaluate just how common these patterns are. Based on our results, we improve on our original architecture, finally proposing a new PIM architecture whose design is backed by computation patterns found in real programs.\n\nThe primary contribution of this thesis is to present and advocate for a new approach to Processing in Memory exploration.

Second, as the correlate of that question, is zero the opposition of any one of those meanings expressed by overtly coded forms? To tackle these questions, I submitted all forms, including zero, to quantitative analysis. This analysis confirmed form-function asymmetry for all forms. The a morpheme was found to express a range of meanings along the perfective grammaticalization path, namely, in addition to perfective, perfect and past-before-past (the latter two meanings being overwhelmingly marked by a), ta was found to be approaching obligatory status in the progressive domain, (in that it expressed this meaning almost categorically and progressive meaning was overwhelmingly expressed by ta over other morphemes), and as\u00e9 and sab\u00e9 played different roles in the domain of habitual, the former being favored in habitual contexts and with non-stative verbs with past temporal reference, while the latter was slightly disfavored in habitual contexts, when assessed with respect to as\u00e9, but was favored with stative verbs. Zero was robust with states, but it also expressed open meaning in other domains, often being the only other variant besides the one other overt morpheme. It was also found here that \u2013ba is an expression of imperfective, not a morpheme indicating past-before-past. I conclude that the overt morphemes are markers insofar as there is an overwhelming association between a form and the function it expresses, and conversely, between a function and a certain form relative to other forms that may express it. In the end, in order to make an assessment on whether a particular tense-aspect form qualifies as a grammatical marker, several factors must to be simultaneously taken into consideration: the principle of accountable reporting, the combined effect of frequency and probability of occurrence, as well as how tense-aspect morphemes are skewed across past and present temporal reference. \n\nThe second dimension of the study was to address whether the formal expression of tense and aspect conformed to typological markedness patterns and to what is known about developing tense-aspect morphemes. To discern this, I compared the structural coding and the distributional patterns in present and past temporal reference in light of well-known asymmetries in these domains. Progressive was equally marked (by ta) in past and present, while habitual was more marked in the past than in the present (mostly with as\u00e9 rather than sab\u00e9). It was also found that a was unmarked with respect to all of the other morphemes with past temporal reference (it was the most frequently occurring morpheme, had less structural coding compared to all other forms and was the morpheme that was most closely associated with the default meaning of past (which is perfective)), and that it played different roles in past versus present. Taken together, these results conform to predictions made by typological markedness and grammaticalization theory, and therefore demonstrate that the variationist method in combination with a diachronically-informed cross-linguistic approach may be a fruitful way to investigate questions of tense and aspect in creoles. \n\nIn employing systematic quantitative analysis of linguistic data from members of a well-defined speech community, the major contributions of this dissertation are the creation of an exhaustively transcribed corpus of Palenquero speech, bringing variation theory to bear on issues in creole grammars, and implementing a diachronic approach to provide explanations for the distribution patterns found in the Palenquero tense-aspect system. \n\n\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10022], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Hiram L", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Hiram", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rena Torres Cacoullos", "Rena Torres Cacoullos", "John Lipski", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "Karen Lynn Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rena Torres Cacoullos, Dissertation Advisor", "Rena Torres Cacoullos, Committee Chair", "John Lipski, Committee Member", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member", "Karen Lynn Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["creole languages", "grammaticalization", "Palenquero", "San Basilio de Palenque", "Spanish-based creoles", "tense and aspect marking"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Meanings of Teaching from the Perspective of Exemplary and Experienced Teachers\n\n\n", "id": "11693", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2669", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A qualitative narrative inquiry that explores the meaning of teaching and the development of that meaning throughout the career of exemplary and experienced teachers in kindergarten-through-twelfth-grade (K-12) public schools was conducted.

The research questions that guided this narrative inquiry are: Which, if any, of Kegan\u2019s (1982, 1994) developmental plateaus can be identified as current or prior meaning-making systems for these exemplary and experienced teachers?  What are the current meanings of teaching for these exemplary and experienced teachers?

The theoretical framework for this dissertation is Kegan\u2019s (1982, 1994) constructive-developmental model.  To contrast the recent application of constructive-developmental theory in K-12 teacher professional development to prior perspectives, five traditional and alternative lenses in the literature are reviewed: skill-acquisition, cognitive-developmental, life cycle, caring, and life history.  The literature on exemplary teachers is explored, and the review finds a gap in the literature for a study that goes beneath the descriptions and behaviors of exemplary teachers and into the meanings of teaching and the ways of knowing of the teacher.\nNarrative inquiry within a qualitative research paradigm was the method of choice for this study.  Narratives were compiled from the data collected (two interviews and application documents) from 21 participants.  Each participant was one of the 12 Pennsylvania Teacher of the Year finalists each year from the years 1999 through 2009.  The individual narratives (not the reflections) were shared with the participants as a check on the validity of the narrative.  A rubric was created and used in assessing each of the teacher participant\u2019s meaning-making according to Kegan\u2019s (1982, 1994) theory.  Five meanings of teaching for the teacher participants were found: making a difference, learning within a community, learning for a lifetime, finding challenges in constraints, and receiving from teaching. \n This narrative inquiry with a retrospective look at prior events was not able to answer the question of the process of change in the five meanings of teaching or change in the meaning-making structure.  The contextual influences on meaning-making viewed the professional context of the teacher in the day-to-day classroom environment and also from the perspective of the expectations of the local school and the state of Pennsylvania.  Context was examined both from its characteristics and from its match or mismatch with the teacher\u2019s developmental plateau.

Primary and secondary sensory cortical areas, as well as multi-modal associative regions, are well-delineated in both rodents and primates, but the functional subdivisions of motor cortex are not as well understood in non-primate mammals. In rodents, motor cortex consists of three cytoarchitectonic regions: the agranular lateral (AGl), agranular medial (AGm) and cingulate (Cg) cortical areas. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) within these subdivisions indicates a somatotopic organization in which the limbs and body are represented in AGl, the face and whiskers in AGm, and the eyes in Cg. The anatomical and physiological experiments described here demonstrate functional distinctions in the different parts of the whisker motor area. Inputs from the whisker representations in somatosensory cortex terminate in the transition region between AGm and AGl, which consequently shows sensory evoked neuronal responses to whisker deflections. By contrast, multimodal inputs from posterior parietal cortex (PPC) terminate more medially in a narrow part of AGm proper, and was found to elicit whisker movements at much lower thresholds of ICMS compared to the adjacent sensory-input zone in the AGm-AGl transition region. Tracing studies further demonstrate that AGm is the source of projections to the ipsilateral superior colliculus consistent with its role in motor-output. The whisker region in AGm was also found to be involved in a number of interhemispheric projections, including a newly described circuit via the claustrum, that support its role in coordinating activity between the whisker motor cortex in each hemisphere to mediate the bilateral coordination of whisking. Collectively, these findings indicate that rodent motor cortex can be functionally divided into multiple subregions, similar to primate motor cortex.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8642], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Jared Brent", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "Brent", "first_name_ssi": "Jared", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin Douglas Alloway", "Kevin Douglas Alloway", "Ralph Norgren", "Patrick James Drew", "Uhnoh Kim", "Bruce Gluckman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin Douglas Alloway, Dissertation Advisor", "Kevin Douglas Alloway, Committee Chair", "Ralph Norgren, Committee Member", "Patrick James Drew, Committee Member", "Uhnoh Kim, Special Member", "Bruce Gluckman, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["motor cortex", "claustrum", "sensorimotor", "whisker", "neuroanatomical tracing", "neurophysiology"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Investigating the Inadvertent Transfer of Vitis Labrusca Associated Odors to Vitis Vinifera Wines", "id": "23501", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10673", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Methyl anthranilate (MA) and 2-aminoacetophenone (2AAP) are volatile compounds present in certain Vitis labrusca grapes, such as Concord and Niagara. Reportedly, MA is responsible for the distinct grapey odor of Concord wines and 2AAP is responsible for the \u201cfoxy\u201d character of Niagara wines. For the vast majority of Vitis vinifera wines, these odors are not expected to be present at any detectable level; however, in recent years, there have been anecdotal reports in northeastern U.S. wine regions of these odors appearing in wines prepared solely from V. vinifera varieties. MA and 2AAP also have low sensory detection thresholds    (300 \u00b5g/L and 0.5-2 \u00b5g/L, respectively) therefore even trace levels of these compounds in V. vinifera wines are perceptible by human assessors. The sources and modes of carryover of foxy/native odors into V. vinifera wines is currently unknown, and we hypothesizes that the major mechanism by which V. vinifera wines accumulate V. labrusca-associated character is through scalping by winery equipment during juice and wine processing. \nAs it is common for V. labrusca and V. vinifera varieties to be processed in the same facilities in the northeastern U.S., certain materials used during winemaking may be capable of transferring these volatile compounds between wines and juices. In order to test this, I developed procedures to access the ability of various polymeric materials widely used during wine production to scalp MA and 2AAP from spiked model solutions (100mg/L). Following scalping, I subjected those resins to un-spiked model solutions, measuring the desorption of the odorants over a 144h period. I then tested the polymers that transferred MA and 2AAP in model solutions in real wine and juice, using spiked (5mg/L) Concord wine and juice in the scalping study, and V. vinifera wine (Chablis) and juice (Muscat) to investigate desorption.\nI found MA and 2AAP were scalped from both model and real systems at various rates by polymeric materials relevant to winemaking. I also found that scalped MA and 2AAP desorbed from polymers upon introduction to new solutions. I found that the levels of scalping and desorption was largely dependent on the structural characteristics of the polymers. PVC and rubber allowed for significantly (p<0.05) larger amounts of MA and 2AAP to be transferred between solutions in comparison to HDPE, LDPE and polysulfone. This likely results from the higher amorphous content of PVC and rubber which allows for greater sorption and desorption of the odorants. I also found that polymers containing a higher degree of crystallinity, like LDPE and HDPE, led to transfer of the odorants to a lesser extent, while polysulfone failed to transfer any MA or 2AAP between solutions. \nI observed no definitive trends based on the solution (wine or juice) MA and 2AAP were being scalped from or desorbed into. This is likely due to the wines weakly ethanolic (12%) content which does not drastically affecting the polarity of the solutions and varying effects of components of the systems acting as either copermeants or competitors during sorption and desorption of 2AAP. Copermeants are molecules that increase the levels of sorption of other molecules, while competitors do the exact opposite as their presence minimizes the amount of sorption of the analyte of interest. I observed the same trends for all of the tested polymers between model and real systems. These results suggests that the model study was a relatively successful means for screening the majority of the polymers in terms of their ability to transfer MA and 2AAP between real wines and juices. In addition, polymeric materials may act as a vehicle for the inadvertent introduction of native odorants into wines produced solely from        V. vinifera varieties. Further investigation should be carried out to confirm the validity of these findings in an actual wine production environment. \nI also tested the ability for various cleaning solutions affiliated with commercial wine production to remove MA and 2AAP from polymers as potential means to prevent this inadvertent transfer in wineries that use the same equipment for V. labrusca and V. vinifera processing. As I expected, increasing both ethanol content and temperature of the cleaning solutions lead to greater desorption of MA and 2AAP from the polymers. Even at the highest ethanol content (80%) and higher temperature (75\u00b0C) treatment only up to 40% of the odors were desorbed after 60 minutes of exposure to the cleaning solution. This suggests that while these odorants can be desorbed, the exact protocol for removing the compounds needs to be optimized in order to ensure that they are removed at levels which render the polymer suitable for processing V. vinifera varietals. \nLastly, I performed human sensory evaluation in order to determine the rejection threshold for 2AAP in wines. I found that even at the highest concentration tested, which was almost 50 times above its detection threshold (.5 \u00b5g/L), the spiked 2AAP wines were not significantly (p>0.05) preferred over the un-spiked control. This suggests that 2AAP may not be offensive to certain common V. vinifera wine consumers in certain regions of the country. However, other factors need to also be considered when interpreting this result as the presence of 2AAP in V. vinifera wines may affect preference in other populations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10305], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Jared C", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Jared", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias", "John E Hayes", "Gregory Ray Ziegler", "Denise Michelle Gardner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias, Thesis Advisor", "John E Hayes, Thesis Advisor", "Gregory Ray Ziegler, Thesis Advisor", "Denise Michelle Gardner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aroma Scalping", "Odorant Scalping", "Polymers", "Wine", "Methyl Anthranilate", "2-Aaminoacetophenone"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Neighborhood and School Context on Extracurricular Participation and Educational Outcomes", "id": "7031", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2893", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Participation in the extracurriculum is fairly well established as having positive effects on educational outcomes, including grades, high school graduation, and postsecondary attainment.

They are also gaining recognition for playing keystone roles in ecosystem composition and functioning. Despite their significance in agriculture and nature, many aspects of their basic ecology are not well characterized, including two topics addressed in this dissertation: host-finding and subsequent three-way host-parasite-herbivore interactions.\n\nTo address these topics we worked with obligately parasitic vines in the genus Cuscuta (Convolvulaceae), also referred to as dodder. Dodder seedlings are extremely limited in their foraging range and will therefore perish if they do not locate a nearby suitable host plant. Prior work revealed that Cuscuta campestris seedlings orient toward hosts by responding to at least two classes of cues\u2014host volatiles and host light-spectral cues. It is not known whether Cuscuta species that are more host-specific than the cosmopolitan C. campestris incorporate these classes of host cues in their foraging behaviors. In a series of biological preference assays with seedlings of Cuscuta epilinum, a putative specialist of flax plants, we found no evidence that these parasites use volatile cues to select their preferred host plants (flax). Rather, C. epilinum seedlings manifested positive growth responses to light cues common to all chlorophyllous plants, and they were surprisingly more attracted to tomato plants, which are inferior hosts, than to flax plants. In subsequent choice tests we found that seedlings prefer objects (whether plants or model plants) characterized by low red to far-red wavelengths (R:FR) over objects characterized by higher R:FR. R:FR varies as a function of host architecture and of host location. We conclude that seedling responses to R:FR cues represent a strategic foraging strategy to locate the nearest host plants of suitable quality.\n\nOur second line of research examined three-way chemical interactions that occur between host plants, parasitic plants and insect herbivores. Many records in the scientific literature document the fact that secondary metabolites from host plants can translocate into parasitic plants, but little is known concerning the ecological implications of this phenomenon, despite well characterized roles for many secondary metabolites in plant defense. We present the novel finding that glucosinolates, secondary metabolites found in Brassicas and their relatives, transfer readily into dodder parasites. To examine the importance of this transfer in vivo, we grew multiple genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 that vary in their ability to produce aliphatic and indole glucosinolates and infested them with the parasite Cuscuta gronovii. Here we report our findings that host-derived glucosinolates or related metabolites can protect dodder against Acrythosiphon pisum aphids (Hemiptera: Homoptera: Aphidae), which refuse to settle on dodder that contains host glucosinolates. In contrast, Myzus persicae aphids are not at all deterred by the presence of glucosinolates in dodder vines, which indicates that protective benefits of glucosinolate uptake are contingent upon the susceptibility of the herbivore species. We similarly investigated the importance of glucosinolate transfer for deterring oviposition by Lygus rubrosignatus plant bugs (Hemiptera: Miridae) and find tentative evidence for a deterrent effect of these compounds.\n\nDuring the course of these studies we observed that dodder growth is negatively correlated with the presence of indole glucosinolates, camalexin and auxin in Arabidopsis, which presents the intriguing possibility that well-characterized anti-insect and anti-microbial defense compounds in Arabidopsis might also contribute to defense against plant parasites.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10101], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Jason Daniel", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "Daniel", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Consuelo M De Moraes", "Mark C Mescher", "Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Gary Felton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Consuelo M De Moraes, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark C Mescher, Dissertation Advisor", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Member", "Gary Felton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chemical ecology", "parasitic plant", "plant defense", "Cuscuta", "aphid", "glucosinolate", "Myzus persicae", "epilinum", "gronovii", "Arabidopsis"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Intergenerational Offending: An Analysis of Families in Jail", "id": "13756", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7113", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The financial and social costs of incarceration are issues of concern, especially when multiple family members are processed through the system.

This inertia asymmetry has been suggested to contribute to the asymmetrical walking patterns often exhibited by unilateral amputees. Unilateral, transtibial amputees also typically expend 20% to 30% more metabolic energy than non-amputees walking at the same speeds. Reasons for these higher costs are not fully understood. This dissertation consists of four studies designed to better understand the influence of prosthetic leg inertia on the mechanics and energetics of amputee locomotion. Studies 1 and 2 investigated the process by which individuals adjust their gait patterns to accommodate an inertia manipulation of the lower extremity over a short term (over the first hour) and a longer term (eight days). In both unilateral, transtibial amputees and non-amputees, temporal and joint kinetic descriptors of gait changed within five minutes of exposure to an additional mass added distally to one leg. Over the course of the next eight days, these measures showed no further changes. The return to baseline values was equally rapid upon removal of the mass on the eighth day. Adjustment to the inertia change was nearly immediate, rather than a slow and gradual adjustment process. In study 3, the effects of multiple prosthetic leg inertia configurations on metabolic costs, kinematic symmetry, and temporal symmetry were investigated. In general, metabolic costs, kinematic asymmetries, and temporal asymmetries increased systematically with increasing prosthetic inertia. The lowest metabolic cost and most symmetrical walking patterns were observed when amputees walked without mass added to their prosthetic leg, (i.e., walked with their normal prosthesis). Thus, the use of a lightweight prosthesis appeared to minimize gait asymmetries and metabolic costs during walking. Study 4 addressed the effects of multiple prosthetic leg inertia configurations on intersegmental dynamics and lower extremity muscle excitations during walking. With respect to the prosthetic leg, absolute angular impulses of the muscle, interaction, and gravitational moments of the hip and knee increased systematically during swing. During stance of the prosthetic leg, absolute angular impulses of the interaction and gravitational moments at the hip and knee also increased systematically with increasing inertia, whereas the muscle moments were unaffected. Intersegmental dynamics of the intact leg during the entire gait cycle were minimally affected by increases in prosthetic leg inertia. In general, these results suggested increases in prosthesis inertia increased demands on the musculature during the swing phase of the prosthetic leg. EMG data did not support our finding of increased muscle demand on the prosthetic leg during swing. Results of studies 3 and 4 provide no indication that the current practice of using of lightweight prostheses is contraindicated or can be improved upon substantially. Unilateral, transtibial amputees appear to gain the most benefit by using a below-knee prosthesis whose inertia properties are far less than those of the limb it replaces.

Western literary criticism has long assumed that dramatic genre stems solely from the text, but attending a play is a patently different experience than reading its script. While a dramatic script is obviously an important element to performance, that script is invisible to the spectator; determining a work\u2019s genre from its script is akin to looking at a skeleton and deeming it a person. To the audience, the genre of a play is instead realized by an assemblage of performative components such as actors, sets, costumes, lights, and props. My dissertation utilizes concepts from object-oriented ontology to argue that theatrical genres are functions not of the page alone, but of all the various elements that come together in performance. Renaissance Play Things examines the cultural history and the theatrical presence of significant props in a range of plays by Shakespeare, Marlowe, Middleton, Dekker, and Jonson. In doing so, the dissertation illustrates the fundamental problem with treating dramatic genre as a function of text alone and demonstrates how object-oriented concepts may be appropriated in order to more fully conceptualize theatrical genres.\n\tThe dissertation\u2019s introduction establishes the tendency to elide textual with performative genre, using A Warning for Faire Women to illustrate how theatrical genre was conceptualized in terms of props on the Renaissance stage. The first chapter scrutinizes the interplay of tragedy and comedy in Romeo and Juliet through the lens of the ring that Juliet sends to Romeo. In recalling both a wedding ring and memento mori token, this ring evokes comedy and tragedy\u2014as well as distinct temporalities associated with each genre. The second chapter examines history plays by Shakespeare and Marlowe in the context of kingship. After the Reformation, the role of the crown in the English coronation rite was drastically modified from a source of power to a confirmer of innate majesty. Marlowe and Shakespeare blend these theories, simultaneously exposing the theatrical nature of the monarchy and undergirding its claims to divine right through the depiction of kingship as a relationship between the king\u2019s body and the crown.\nThis relationship is taken up more explicitly in the third chapter, which focuses on skulls in Hamlet, The Patient Man and the Honest Whore, and The Revenger\u2019s Tragedy. While in the danse macabre, memento mori, and ars moriendi traditions the skull is commonly associated with the anonymity of death, in onstage tragedy it serves as the locus for examining relations between subject and object, identity and anonymity. As such, the onstage skull has not only come to mark tragedy; it helps to create the genre through its evocation of the individual\u2019s role in the face of annihilation. The last chapter argues that the role of the philosopher\u2019s stone in The Alchemist is the vehicle through which Jonson expresses his own ambivalence towards comedy and theatrical performance. In folklore, scientific tradition, and the play, though the stone is a catalyst capable of perfecting matter and benefitting mankind, it is always intended for more corrupt purposes. The stone\u2019s absence from the stage neatly parallels Jonson\u2019s explicit belief that his scripts, though capable of perfecting their reader, are inevitably corrupted through performance. The dissertation thus brings together New Historicism and elements of object-oriented ontology to argue that props are at once both representations of literary genres and active elements of tragedy, comedy, and history on the Renaissance stage.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10178], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Joshua Sanford", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "Sanford", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Garrett Sullivan Jr.", "Patrick G Cheney", "Marcy Lynne North", "Laura Lunger Knoppers", "Dan Beaver"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Garrett Sullivan Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick G Cheney, Committee Member", "Marcy Lynne North, Committee Member", "Laura Lunger Knoppers, Committee Member", "Dan Beaver, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Renaissance", "early modern", "drama", "theater", "theatre", "object", "thing", "prop", "property", "stage"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "VOICES, VALUES, VIEWS: A NARRATIVE ETHNOGRAPHY OF A VOLUNTEER LITERACY PROGRAM STUDENT INVOLVEMENT GROUP ", "id": "7419", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2550", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Employing a narrative ethnography methodology from a theoretically critical perspective, I studied a student involvement group at a federally-funded volunteer-based literacy program in Central Pennsylvania.\n  \nBy eliciting narratives from participants and taking part in a range of group activities over a nine month period in 2004-2005 and then returning to the field for follow up interviews in early 2006, I am able to juxtapose the benefits, challenges, and contradictions that arise as literacy students, English as a Second Language (ESL) learners, and the volunteer coordinator work together to create and sustain this group. \n\nSpecifically, I found that individual members benefited from participating in the group in several ways: individual members felt emotionally supported, were provided opportunities to enhance and expand their literacy practices, exercise varying levels of power within the program, and become more aware of and to become involved in macro-political issues via discussions of the 2004 Presidential elections and involvement with the adult learner national organization, Voice for Adult Literacy United for Education (VALUE).

In high power applications such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), monitoring algorithms use current and voltage measurements to estimate battery state of charge (SOC) and available power. Despite increased cost, these systems commonly employ conservative, oversized batteries due to poor prediction of current/voltage dynamics and imprecise real-time estimation. This dissertation introduces a general, electrochemical model-based approach for safe and efficient integration of Li-ion batteries into transient, pulse power-type systems.\n\nA transient solid-state diffusion model is incorporated into a previously developed 1D electrochemical model. The nonlinear model, solving 4 coupled partial differential equations by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique, is validated against low rate constant current, pulse power, and transient driving cycle data sets from a 6 Ah Li-ion HEV battery. Solid-state Li transport (diffusion) significantly limits high rate performance, and end of discharge at the 2.7 V minimum limit is caused by depleted/saturated active material surface concentrations in the negative/positive electrodes for pulses lasting longer than around 10 seconds. The 3.9 V maximum limit, meant to protect the negative electrode from side reactions such as lithium plating, is overly conservative for pulse charging.\n\nIncreased power capability may be realized by using a real-time electrochemical model to estimate internal states and control the battery within appropriate limits. Development of a fast, stable, and accurate model is difficult however, given the infinite-dimensional, distributed nonlinear processes governing battery dynamics. Here, an impedance model is derived from the electrochemical kinetic, species and charge transport equations and, using a model order reduction technique developed herein, the high order transfer functions/matrices are numerically reduced to an observable/controllable state variable model in modal form. Open circuit potential and electrode surface concentration nonlinearities are explicitly approximated in the model output equation on a local and electrode-averaged basis, respectively. Validated against the 313th order CFD model, a 12th order state variable model with 0-10 Hz bandwidth predicts terminal voltage to within 25 mV (<1%) for pulse and constant current profiles at rates up to 50C. The modeling methodology is valid for all types of porous electrode Li-ion batteries not operating under severe electrolyte transport limitations.\n\nA linear Kalman filter is designed for real-time estimation of internal potentials, concentration gradients, and SOC. A reference current governor predicts operating margin with respect to electrode side reactions and surface depletion/saturation conditions responsible for damage and sudden loss of power. Estimates are compared with the nonlinear CFD model. The linear filter gives to within ~2% performance in the 30-70% SOC range except in the case of severe current pulses that drive electrode surface concentrations near saturation and depletion, although the estimates recover as concentration gradients relax. With 4 to 7 states, the filter has low order comparable to equivalent circuit methods presently employed for battery management but, unlike those empirical methods, enables pulse charging/discharging beyond conservative voltage limits. For the 6 Ah HEV battery, the method increases power density by 22% and streamlines the systems integration process for families of battery/vehicle designs.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3331], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Kandler A.", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Kandler", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Christopher Rahn", "Qian Wang", "Joseph Paul Cusumano", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Chair", "Qian Wang, Committee Member", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lithium ion", "battery", "hybrid electric vehicle", "model order reduction", "diffusion systems", "state of charge estimation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Exogenous and Endogenous Sources of Organic Compounds\non the Early Earth: Investigating Carbonaceous Meteorites\nand Plausibly Prebiotic Complex Mixtures\nby Liquid Chromatography-mass Spectrometry", "id": "20032", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9571", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "   The early Earth atmosphere was thought to have been composed mostly of nitrogen and carbon dioxide with low concentrations of reduced gases (H2, CH4, etc.). Laboratory experiments simulating endogenous chemistry of early Earth (i.e. spark discharge with neutral gas mixtures) produce low abundances of biologically relevant molecules, which may have been a problem for the origin(s) of life. Thus, an exogenous source (e.g., meteorites, comets, and interplanetary dust particles) that delivered organic molecules may have been important in facilitating prebiotic reactions on the early Earth.\n   In Chapter 2, we investigated cyanide in a variety of meteorites by developing an analytical protocol that consisted of extracting a meteorite via acid-digestion and distillation using a gas-permeable membrane apparatus followed by chemical derivatization and analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to fluorescence detection and time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

For resource management agencies, understanding the temporal and spatial movement patterns and habitat requirements of any species is essential for conserving existing populations and restoring habitats that once supported self-sustaining populations.  I employed radio biotelemetry to quantify movement and habitat use of Brook Trout and Brown Trout from September 2012 through February 2013.  I equipped 55 Brook Trout and 45 Brown Trout, distributed among five interconnected streams in North Central Pennsylvania, with radio-transmitters.  To identify potential relationships between movement and covariates, I used generalized additive mixed models.  Thalweg profiles of the streams were also surveyed to quantify available residual pool habitat and I used discrete choice models with random effects to evaluate Brook and Brown Trout habitat use.  To corroborate observations in Brook Trout movement made through radio-tracking, Brook Trout fin clips were taken for microsatellite analysis.\nAverage total movement was greater for Brown Trout (2,924 \u00b1 4,187 m) than for Brook Trout (1,769 \u00b1 2,194 m).  Maximum net movement was 10,317 m and 11,273 m completed by a Brook Trout and Brown Trout, respectively.  Results indicated a large amount of among-fish variability in movement of both species with the majority of movement coinciding with the on-set of the spawning season and increases in stream flow.  Microsatellite analysis revealed consistent findings to those in radio-tracking, indicating a moderate to high degree gene flow among study populations.  There was an overall preference for pool versus non-pool habitats; however, habitat use of pools was non-linear over time.  Brook Trout displayed a greater preference for deep (0.33-1.5 m deep) pool habitats over shallow (0.1-0.32 m deep) pool and non-pool habitats.  Conversely, Brown Trout selected for all pool habitat categories similarly.  Habitat use of both species was found to be scale dependent.  At smaller spatial scales (50 m), habitat use was primarily related to time of year and fish size.  However, at larger spatial scales (250 m and 450 m) habitat use varied over time according to the study stream a fish was located.

EF has become increasingly popular in the context of clinical evaluation, and, more recently, in the school setting.  If children are inadequate at performing basic classroom functions, such as inhibiting responses, regulating behavior, or predicting outcomes, their academic success is likely to be compromised (Bull & Scerif, 2001; Palfrey et al., 1985).  The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF; Gioia et al., 2000) is a behavior-rating scale designed to assess the behavioral characteristics related to executive-function deficits of youth in school and home environments.  However, there continues to be debate regarding the current two-factor, eight-scale factor structure of the BRIEF-Parent form when applied in a mixed clinical (or school) sample of school-age youth.  This study examined the factor structure of scores from the BRIEF-Parent form.  Ratings were provided by 371 parents or guardians of children living in Western Pennsylvania whose children had been referred for psychoeducational evaluation.  The original model (i.e., 2-factor, 8-scale) currently employed in the instrument was examined and compared to six alternative models.  Results were analyzed through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).  Findings indicated that in a mixed clinical sample of youth four of the seven models showed a good fit to the data (e.g., 2-factor, 8-scale - CFI = .933, SRMR = .049; 3-factor, 9-scale - CFI = .956, SRMR = .041).  Although there only were small differences between the models, RMSEA was still above the recommended cutoff (i.e., > .08), indicating some potential misfit in all models.  Comparisons of the models indicated that the 3-factor, 9-scale model fit the scores slightly better.  These findings provide support for the use of the two-factor, eight-scale version, which is the basis for the current BRIEF-Parent form, but competing models fit the data just as well if not better.  Thus, the findings also raise questions about the use of the BRIEF-Parent in its present format in the school setting.

Little information exists regarding the effectiveness and perceptions of agricultural-related programs among urban youth.  Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the perception of ethnic identity development, community involvement, and experiences among African American high school males (ages 13-18) in urban areas in Pennsylvania and how these factors influence their participation in agricultural-related youth programs.  \nTwo public urban high schools and one urban charter school with agricultural- related programs were selected to participate in this study.  A sample of 300 African American high school age (13-18) male participants was selected for the survey, and a random sample of approximately 20 participants was selected for the focus groups.  The goals of the mixed method study were to (a) determine how young Black males who participate in agricultural-related youth programs and non-involved Black males\u2019 self-identify was measured; (b) identify how young Black males involved in agricultural-related programs and non-involved Black males perceive community involvement; and (c) explore the experiences of involved young agricultural-related Black males differ from non-involved Black males within similar urban communities.  Data were collected using the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM-R) revised instrument, questions through a community involvement questionnaire, and focus groups. \n The findings indicated that African American young males find agricultural- related youth programs beneficial, but not tailored for minority audiences.  Volunteer and adult mentoring played a major role in youth participation in programs offered.  Based on these results, the researcher concluded that these males felt gaining access to agricultural- related youth programs were a barrier to participation due to other internal and sometimes external problematic issues that contribute to a lack of involvement in agricultural-related youth programs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15794], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Maurice Devoe", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "Devoe", "first_name_ssi": "Maurice", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nicole Sheree Webster", "Nicole Sheree Webster", "Mark A Brennan Jr.", "Connie Devine Baggett", "Jonte Charez Taylor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nicole Sheree Webster, Dissertation Advisor", "Nicole Sheree Webster, Committee Chair", "Mark A Brennan Jr., Committee Member", "Connie Devine Baggett, Committee Member", "Jonte Charez Taylor, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Agricultural-related", "4-H Youth Development", "perceptions", "ethnic identity", "community involvement"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "AWARENESS OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING DEFICITS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: SELF VERSUS INFORMANT RATINGS OF IMPAIRMENT IN PATIENTS VERSUS CONTROLS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH OBJECTIVE COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE\n", "id": "7689", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4287", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Informant ratings of cognitive dysfunction have been demonstrated to be more accurate than self ratings in many neurological populations.

For the MS participants, objective performance on executive tasks was more highly correlated with self DEX ratings than with informant DEX ratings. Groups were created to examine factors related to discrepancies between self DEX ratings and objective performance on executive tasks, informant DEX ratings and objective performance on executive tasks, and between self DEX and informant DEX ratings. Results indicated that discrepancies between self DEX ratings and objective performance on executive tasks were not related to executive functioning or depression for either the MS or the control groups.

Through their participation in 19th-century utopian experiments, my subjects were exposed to unconventional ideas about space, gender, labor, and community. Like many other participants in such communities, my subjects also formed rhetorical alliances with larger American communities concerned with business, politics, and social norms. The project follows these rhetorical trajectories from utopian space to the public sphere, guided by my overarching question: how does space affect the rhetorical alliances of 19th-century women?\n\nFollowing the theoretical and methodological orientation in Chapter Two, I go on to examine three female rhetors, drawing from their published writings and speeches and archival sources within their communities or pertaining to the women themselves. Chapter Three explores the infamous Frances Wright. Wright\u2019s initial utopian reading of America prompted an aggressive campaign for abolition via an interracial communal experiment in Tennessee. After the community\u2019s failure, Wright went on to become a leader in the freethought movement, employing spatial strategies such as relocating to New York and repurposing a church into a \u201cHall of Science\u201d to promote the movement. Chapter Four, in contrast, examines my most obscure subject: Gertrude Rapp. Rapp lived her entire life within the German pietist Harmony Society. Rapp\u2019s letters, circulated among a network of silk-growers, facilitated her participation in the burgeoning silk industry of mid 19th-century America. By situating the Harmony Society at the forefront of the \u201csilk cause,\u201d Rapp positioned her non-normative community as an integral part of America. Chapter Five explores the rhetoric of Abby Morton Diaz, who spent several years in the Transcendental Brook Farm. The community\u2019s theories of space and labor were applied unevenly to the men and women of Brook Farm, belying gender hypocrisies that Diaz would expose in her writings about domestic space. Later in life, Diaz worked within a Boston women\u2019s club to create urban space for cross-class relationships among women. In my final chapter, I consider some \u201cLessons from Intentional Communities,\u201d lessons central to the study of rhetoric as a spatial practice.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4008], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Michelle C", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Michelle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheryl Jean Glenn", "Cheryl Jean Glenn", "John L Selzer", "Hester Maureen Blum", "Melissa Wright"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheryl Jean Glenn, Dissertation Advisor", "Cheryl Jean Glenn, Committee Chair", "John L Selzer, Committee Member", "Hester Maureen Blum, Committee Member", "Melissa Wright, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["intentional communities", "gender", "space", "rhetoric", "public"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Novel Approaches to the Surface Modification of Glass by Thermo-electric Poling\n", "id": "12025", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4668", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many new and emerging applications of glass rely critically on surface properties, and have led to an ever-increasing demand for methods to controllably modify glass surfaces as a pathway to enhanced properties.  The genesis of this thesis arose from such pursuits, wherein the thermo-electric poling of glass\u2014encompassing treatment with high voltage and blocking electrodes at moderate temperatures\u2014was found to provide a fertile research area.  Versatile in its application to a variety of glasses, as well as the diversity of phenomena it produces, several novel approaches to the thermo-electric treatments of multicomponent glass are carried out in this work.  This included (1) poling to produce normally-forbidden, second-order nonlinearity in high breakdown strength glasses as a potential avenue to greater nonlinear coefficients; (2) capitalizing on poling-induced modifications toward the novel end of manipulating the observed breakdown strength of glass; and (3) venturing outside the \u201ctypical\u201d parameter space of poling treatments in order to realize even greater modifications to surface composition and structure by electrolyzing the glass network.  The primary outcome for the first study indicates that, contrary to the usual assumption, the stored internal field from poling is limited to a substantial fraction of the intrinsic breakdown strength, and seemingly in a broad range of glass systems.  This is most likely due to nonlinear conduction effects at the high poling temperatures.  Meanwhile, the results of the second study indicate that the observed breakdown strength of glass is minimally influenced by the presence of a stored space charge field, and is likely attributable to the presence of the modified surface layer concentrating the applied voltage.  The results of the last study provide the most intriguing possibilities for extensive and stable surface modification.  Applied to a model alkali-free glass, a nanoscale layer is formed adjacent to the anodic surface composed of essentially only network-forming elements, and whose formation is attributed to the electrolytic migration of both cationic and anionic species within the glass network.  This technique has significant potential for creating novel surface structures and compositions, anticipated applicability to a wide variety of glass compositions, and extensively modified transport and corrosion-resistance properties.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4634], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Nicholas J", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carlo G Pantano", "Carlo G Pantano", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Michael T Lanagan", "Seong H Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carlo G Pantano, Dissertation Advisor", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Chair", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Seong H Kim, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermal poling", "surface", "glass"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "INEQUALITY AND INFANT HEALTH: A MULTILEVEL APPROACH TO DISENTANGLING CORRELATES OF METROPOLITAN/NONMETROPOLITAN DISPARITIES IN LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS", "id": "7037", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4905", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-04-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To date, research has not adequately addressed geographic variation in birth weight due to individual- and structural-level characteristics in the US.  If the health care needs of infants and children in nonmetropolitan areas are to be understood, an analytic approach capturing how both individual- and contextual-level inequalities operate is needed.  This research utilizes multiple levels of rurality as one component of structural-level characteristics, along with individual-level characteristics, to examine variation in birth weights.  Specifically, theoretical and empirical evidence is given for associations between biological, social, and behavioral characteristics and birth weight at the individual level, and residential, socioeconomic, social capital, social environmental, and health services characteristics and birth weight at the structural-level.  With variation in birth weights across groups and places in the United States, it is important to understand which children are at risk of poor health outcomes and to identify how local conditions contribute to these outcomes. The ECLS-B merged with county-level data is used to examine this problem.\nResults from this research indicate that most of the variation in birth weight is attributable to individual-level characteristics, such as gestation, plurality status, and maternal smoking behavior during pregnancy.  However structural-level characteristics help to explain some of the variation.  Various measures of rurality indicate that rural residents tend to have higher birth weights.  Other structural-level measures, such as the percentage of residents in the county that are black, the number of Olsen-Type establishments in the county, and the number of health care personnel all have associations with average birth weights and the mean likelihood of low birth weight.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4882], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Patrice Johnelle", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "Johnelle", "first_name_ssi": "Patrice", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Diane K Mc Laughlin", "C Shannon Stokes", "Leif Jensen", "Kathryn Jo Brasier", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Diane K Mc Laughlin, Committee Chair", "C Shannon Stokes, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "Kathryn Jo Brasier, Committee Member", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["birth weight", "rural", "multilevel modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "PRECISE NANO-SCALE ASSEMBLIES: GOLD CLUSTERS AND SELF-ASSEMBLED MONOLAYERS\n", "id": "6838", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5231", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-09-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Self-assembly has emerged to reach towards future device scales of several or tens of nanometers, and will directly compete with or will complement existing `top down' fabrication schemes.  Self-assembly techniques have created new materials from the `bottom up,' connecting the length scales of synthetic chemistry and microfabrication.  Extensive knowledge of the chemical, physical, and electronic properties of the constituents of `bottom up' architectures is required to develop new materials rapidly.  This thesis describes the development of precise, nanometer-scale assemblies derived from <i>n</i>-alkanethiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs): the phase behavior of multi-component SAMs containing internally subsituted <i>n</i>-alkanethiolates, the electronic spectra of atomically precise gold clusters and larger nanoparticles immobilized atop <i>n</i>-alkanethiolate SAMs via &#945;,&omega;-alkanedithiolate\ntethers, and the structure and order of single- and multi-component SAMs containing &#945;,&omega;-alkanedithiols.\n\n\nReplacement of methylene units of the <i>n</i>-alkanethiolate backbone with an amide bond buried near the sulfur headgroup begins to\ntune intermolecular interactions with precision in order to control the spatial distributions of the adsorbates on the surface.  Solvent-solute interactions heavily contribute to determining film structure.  The tunability of these interactions may be used to advantage when\npatterning molecules on surfaces; the strengths and types of these intermolecular interactions have a profound effect on the structure and quality of the structure of the nano-scale assembly.\n\n\nThe electronic properties of undecagold clusters and larger gold nanoparticles were investigated using STM, using <i>n</i>-alkanethiolate SAMs as supports that electrically isolated the\nparticles from the substrate.  The particles were\nimmobilized using &#945;,&omega;-alkanedithiolate tethers; significant spectral diffusion was observed across single and multiple particles and was closely coupled to the particle's chemical\nand physical environment.  \n\n\nSAMs were created containing &#945;,&omega;-alkanedithiolates, both single-component SAMs as well as dithiols inserted into host <i>n</i>-alkanethiolate SAMs (supports for the gold particles, <i>vide supra</i>).  The intramolecular competition for the thiol to the surface as well as the propensity for aggregation due to short-range van der Waals forces led to SAMs with a distribution of complex structures and reactivities.

As the power density in thermoacoustic refrigerators has\nincreased, the stresses such bellows must endure have increased, leading to costly\nmaterials and few practical avenues toward performance improvement. In this study, an\nalternative bellows structure to mediate this power transfer is proposed: a laminated\nhollow cylinder comprised of alternating layers of rubber and metal. Axial compliance,\nneeded to produce significant gas compression required of such a structure is conveyed\nby the rubber material properties, rather than structurally, as in a metal bellows.\n\nTwo important considerations drive the proposed design: the capacity of the\nrubber to endure high cycle fatigue, and the desire to minimize viscoelastic power\ndissipation in the bellows; strain energy density plays a role in both. Assuming a\nrectangular cross-section in the rubber portions of the proposed bellows, equations are\ndeveloped to estimate the bellows\u2019 axial stiffness, peak local strain and section strain\nenergy, in response to the combination of axial strain and oscillatory pressure. Optimal\naspect ratios in the rubber section are also discussed.\n\nConsideration given to elastomeric material selection is presented, in terms of\nfatigue and loss characteristics, leading to the choice of unfilled natural rubber for\nprototypes that were constructed for this study. Comparisons of tearing energies\nestimated from known load cases and those obtained by finite element analysis for\ncandidate dimensions are presented. It is observed that the phase speed of extensional\nwaves in such a bellows is sufficiently low, that for the frequencies of interest, wave\neffects must be considered as these modify both the stresses and the power dissipation in\nthe material.\n\nThe metal layers, which experience negligible stress as a consequence of bellows\naxial strain, provide reinforcement to the elastomeric layers against pressure and are\nsubject to out-of-plane buckling when the bellows is subject to external pressure loading.\nA bucking failure of this sort was observed in a prototype bellows and is described. The\nproposed structure also exhibits column instability when subject to internal pressure, as\niv\ndo metal bellows; for pressurized bellows and cylindrical sections, Haringx showed that\ninternal pressures act in a manner analogous to axial compression of a beam. In the\nproposed bellows however, shear deflection cannot be ignored and this leads to column\ninstability for both internal and external pressures, the latter being analogous to the case\nof tension buckling of a beam. Static column buckling with shear for internal and\nexternal pressure conditions is empirically demonstrated.\n\nIn prototype bellows that were tested, transverse modes of vibration are believed\nto have been excited parametrically as a consequence of the oscillatory pressure the\nbellows are intended to produce. Unfortunately, the operating frequencies of interest in\nthis study lie above the cut-on frequency at which Timoshenko beam theory (TBT)\npredicts multiple phase speeds. It is shown that TBT fails to accurately predict both\nmode shapes and resonance frequencies in this regime. TBT is also shown to predict\nmultiple phase speeds in the presence of axial tension, or external pressures, at\nmagnitudes of interest in this study, over the entire frequency spectrum.\n\nIf one selects a mode which lies below cut-on in the absence of pressure or axial\nload, and is thus accurately represented by TBT, such modes are shown to converge to\nthe static buckling results as the bellows is subjected internal or external pressure. TBT\nthus predicts decreasing resonance frequencies not only with axial compression, but\nalso, at sufficient loads, in axial tension as well, and converges on solutions known to be\nvalid.

Smoking, alcoholism, chronic pancreatitis, and metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis are associated risk factors for pancreatic cancer development. The proto-oncogene Kras is mutated in 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cases, resulting in constitutive activation. The complexity of Kras makes it a difficult therapeutic target with dysregulation affecting several downstream signaling pathways. Candidates for early prognosis detection and therapeutic targeting need to be elucidated.\nPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated nuclear receptors involved in terminal differentiation, glucose and lipid metabolism. Pparb is ubiquitously expressed with highest levels in the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skeletal muscle. PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 associates with the transcriptional repressor BCL6, and may be a potential target for metabolic disorders due to its ability to modulate insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 also plays a role in protecting against oxidative stress, a contributing factor towards chronic inflammation and cancer. PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4\u2019s role in cancer is controversial.\nThis dissertation sought to substantiate the role of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 in inflammation and metastasis and to investigate its potential as a therapeutic target and prognosis marker for pancreatic cancer. In a human pancreatic cancer cell line, Mia PaCa-2, over-expression of Pparb inhibited basal and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1)-induced nuclear factor kappa b1 (Nfkb) activity. A specific agonist of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, GW501516, suppressed TNF\u03b1-induced Nfkb reporter activity. RNAi knockdown of Pparb attenuated the GW501516 effect on Nfkb luciferase activity, while knockdown of Bcl6 enhanced TNF\u03b1-induced Nfkb activity. PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 activation induced expression of several anti-inflammatory genes in a dose-dependent manner, and GW501516 inhibited monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (Mcp1) promoter-driven luciferase in a BCL6-dependent manner. Pro-inflammatory genes were suppressed in a BCL6-dependent manner. GW501516-treated pancreatic cancer cell conditioned media suppressed pro-inflammatory expression in THP-1 macrophages as well as reduced invasiveness across a basement membrane. Similarly, GW501516 reduced TNF\u03b1-induced expression of several genes involved in metastasis, including Mmp9 mRNA and protein and Pparb knockdowns resulted in lower Mmp9 mRNA and protein expression. The ability of Mia PaCa-2 cells to invade an artificial basement membrane was reduced by GW501516 in a PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4- and BCL6-dependent manner. Thus, the PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4-BCL6 signaling pathway has an anti-inflammatory and -metastasis role in Mia PaCa-2 cells that is enhanced upon treatment with GW501516.\nThe expression of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, BCL6 and several of their target genes were examined in human PDAC, relative to matched normal pancreas tissue, and in a mouse model that mimics the human progression of disease (Pdx1-cre/LSL-KrasG12D). Pparb mRNA was over-expressed in human tumor tissue compared to normal tissue, while Bcl6 remained unaltered. Inflammatory genes that are controlled by the PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4-BCL6 pathway were increased in the tumor tissue, including the important BCL6 target genes and pancreatic cancer prognostic indicators Mcp1 and Mmp9. Similar observations were made in the KrasG12D mice where pancreas of mice carrying this constitutively active oncogene had higher expression of Pparb mRNA, unaltered Bcl6 expression and increased Mcp1 and Mmp9 mRNA. These in vivo associations were further examined in the Mia PaCa-2 cell line. Over-expression of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 increased proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells, an effect that was ameliorated by GW501516. Over-expression of Pparb also increased basal and TNF\u03b1-induced Mcp1 reporter activity, which was diminished by transfection of BCL6 or treatment with GW501516. Taken together, these data strongly support a sequestering of BCL6 by PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 that occurs during the progression of PDAC when dysregulation results in over-expression of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4.\nThe data presented herein supports a dichotomous role for the PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4-BCL6 in the pancreatic cancer. Over-expression of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, through sequestering of the transcription repressor BCL6, enhances the expression of genes known to be involved in PDAC progression such as Mcp1 and Mmp9. However, upon treatment with the PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 ligand GW501516, these same genes are repressed by the dual action of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 and BCL6. Taken together, this has important implications for pancreatic cancer therapy as well as diagnosis. Treatment with a specific PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 ligand, such as GW501516, decreases inflammatory signaling and reduces macrophage recruitment, thereby limiting tumor progression. Also, via release of BCL6, the expression of metastatic proteins such as Vcam1 and Mmp9 is reduced, thereby decreasing metastatic potential. From a prognostic standpoint, it would be expected that a patient with higher expression of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, and hence a repression of BCL6 signaling, in tumor tissue would benefit more significantly from GW501516 treatment. Combined with drugs that inhibit pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, GW501516 has the potential to be an effective tool in the fight against pancreatic cancer.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11463], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Russell William", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Russell", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Toxicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Curtis John Omiecinski", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Andrew David Patterson", "Karam E El Bayoumy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Dissertation Advisor", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Committee Chair", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Andrew David Patterson, Committee Member", "Karam E El Bayoumy, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pancreatic cancer", "Inflammation", "Metastasis", "PPARbeta", "BCL6", "GW501516", "GW0742"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Wasp in the Beehive: Non-Mormon Presence in 1880s Utah\n\n", "id": "8769", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5506", "abstract_tesi": "Recent studies have reconsidered the Mormon Culture Region in light of its 1880--1920 transition to American political and economic norms.

The aforementioned functionality is achieved via the noise component of the waveform. Moreover, as a result of the embedded tone in the waveform and certain signal processing approaches, we find that this radar is also capable of human activity classification based on the micro-Doppler induced signals from moving human targets.

The areas of expertise were (a) Delivering Training, (b) Designing Learning, (c) Improving Human Performance, and (d) Measuring and Evaluating. The research had a dual focus. The first focus was to ascertain the characteristics and behaviors differentiating the typical performer from the exemplary performer. The second focus was to contribute to the development of a rubric used for the core work product submission for the first national ASTD certification exam. Hunter, Schmidt, and Judiesch (1990) suggested that an exemplary performer could have productivity differences 12 times greater than performers at the bottom of the performance scale and 85% greater than an average performer. An understanding of these differences could help an organization to recruit and select top-performing applicants. The researcher utilized a modified competency model and compared and contrasted critical incidents from behavioral event interviews (BEI) of 23 exemplary performers and 9 typical WLP performers. The interviews were coded and classified into three foundational clusters. An analysis of the findings suggested that an exemplary performer had at least three key behaviors: taking calculated risks, entrepreneurial and visionary planning, and documented business performance support to influence change.

As such, an understanding of the molecular signaling involved in sebaceous gland lipid production is needed to identify therapeutic targets to improve acne.  The sterol response element binding proteins (SREBPs) are a class of transcription factors known to regulate lipid production, particularly in response to insulin in the liver.  We hypothesize that the SREBPs are important in sebaceous gland lipid metabolism, and thus represent a potential drug target for the treatment of acne.  \n     The correlation between severity of acne and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels in women led us to investigate the effects of IGF-1 on sebaceous lipid production and SREBP-1 levels.  The work described in this thesis demonstrates that IGF-1 increases both lipogenesis and SREBP protein levels in SEB-1 sebocytes.  \n     Furthermore, a variety of growth factors have been shown to increase SREBP mRNA and protein in many different model systems.  However, the signaling pathway(s) that are important to transducing the growth factor signal seems to vary by cell type. We have found that IGF-1 stimulation activates both the PI3-K and the MAPK/ERK pathways in SEB-1 cells.  As both of these pathways have been found to be responsible for growth factor stimulated increases of SREBP, we sought to determine if one or both pathways were important for the IGF-1 induced lipogenesis and increase in SREBP that we have observed in the SEB-1 cells.  We report that treatment with the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 completely blocks IGF-1 induced lipogenesis and SREBP transcription, translation, and processing in SEB-1 cells whereas the MAPK/ERK pathway inhibitor PD98059 has no effect on lipogenesis or SREBP protein induction.  These data indicate the PI3-K is the primary signaling pathway involved in lipogenesis in SEB-1 sebocytes. \n\tIn summary, this work provides evidence that SREBP-1 is a potential drug target for the reduction of lipid production in the treatment of acne.  Furthermore, these data provide a rationale for the investigation of specific inhibitors to the individual members of the PI3-K family for treatment of acne.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6248], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, Terry Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Terry", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Alan Clawson", "Diane M Thiboutot", "Melvin Lee Billingsley", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Alan Clawson, Committee Chair", "Diane M Thiboutot, Committee Chair", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Member", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sterol response element binding protein", "SREBP", "lipogenesis", "acne", "sebaceous gland", "IGF-1", "insulin-like growth factor"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The global expansion of the testing culture: National testing policies and the reconstruction of education.", "id": "23308", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10648", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To ensure equal access to high quality education, the global expansion of universal basic education has included accountability measures in the form of academic tests. As the global community adjusts from educational access to educational quality, educators (teachers and principals) are increasingly held accountable for student test scores. Testing for accountability attempts to modify educator behavior by connecting formal or informal, positive or negative consequences to school aggregate test scores. This study examines the association of this international phenomenon with school structures and student outcomes. The investigation begins by exploring the global transformation toward testing for accountability in light of the emerging global culture, identified by World Culture theorists. As testing for accountability emerges as a legitimate global practice questions arise as to how it will shape education and impact students. To address these questions this study maps participants from the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment into four National Testing Policy (NTP) categories: Formative, Summative, Evaluative, and Formal Sanction/Reward. Using a three level random coefficient Hierarchical Linear Model to capture the nested nature of the data three research questions are addressed: (1) How is national testing policy related to the degree schools incorporate testing into their practices and policies? (2) Does the incorporation of testing into a school structure vary by the school\u2019s economic and/or academic composition? And (3) how does the national testing policy and corresponding policy coupling influence student outcomes? \nResults suggest that schools in testing for accountability systems are more likely to use student test scores for school accountability purposes. Additionally, within policy differences speak to important equity concerns as less advantaged schools in accountability systems where formal sanctions and/or rewards are applied to schools or educators are more likely to transfer out low achieving students. Furthermore, initial differences in student achievement across NTP categories are an artifact of schools using their admission and transfer policies to shape their student body. This lack of relationship between NTP and student achievement calls into question whether the substantial costs associated with testing for accountability policies are an efficient use of resources.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10282], "author_name_tesi": "Smith, William Clem", "last_name_ssi": "Smith", "middle_name_ssi": "Clem", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David P Baker", "David P Baker", "Katerina Bodovski", "Soo Yong Byun", "Molly Martin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David P Baker, Dissertation Advisor", "David P Baker, Committee Chair", "Katerina Bodovski, Committee Member", "Soo Yong Byun, Committee Member", "Molly Martin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Testing", "Accountability", "World Culture", "Hierarchical Linear Modeling", "PISA"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "MOTHERS\u2019 SCHOOLING AND CHILD MORTALITY: \nEXAMINING PATHWAYS IN NIGERIA \n\n\n", "id": "10928", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1769", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This paper examines pathways from maternal schooling to child mortality in Nigeria.

Study 2 also tested the hypothesis that the relationship social comparison (RSC) process has ironic consequences in that people seek comparisons to reduce uncertainty; however exposure to variable comparisons increases uncertainty. \nParticipants were either exposed to (Exp 1) or allowed to seek (Exp 2) variable or non-variable RSCs and then completed measures of relationship uncertainty and evaluation. Across the two studies, contrary to predictions, manipulated direction and variability of RSCs did not predict relationship evaluation. Self-reported direction and variability of RSCs did partially support predictions. Consistent with predictions, as participants rated the RSCs as more upward (better than their relationship) versus downward (worse than their relationship), or more variable, relationship evaluation became more negative. Consistent with variability predictions, but inconsistent with direction predictions, relationship uncertainty mediated the effect of direction and variability on relationship evaluation. Finally, Study 2 illustrated that rather than alleviating uncertainty, increased variable comparison seeking lead to increases in uncertainty.  \nThese results have important implications for social comparison theory. As the first studies to expose participants to multiple comparisons in various directions results indicate that variability is an important factor in the RSC process. Thus, implicating that future research must include exposure to multiple comparisons in various directions to understand the comparison process. Second, relationship uncertainty mediated the effect of direction of RSCs on relationship evaluation, indicating that uncertainty does more than moderate the effect of comparison direction on evaluation. Finally, Study 2 highlights the ironic consequences of the RSC process, in that those who receive variable comparison information report increases rather than decreases in uncertainty. These results suggest the need for future longitudinal studies allowing the comparison process to play out over time. This step would allow researchers to examine both predictors of comparison seeking and the outcomes that result from receiving comparison information.     \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3881], "author_name_tesi": "Smith LeBeau, Lavonia ", "last_name_ssi": "Smith LeBeau", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lavonia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Gasper", "Elizabeth C Pinel", "Michelle Gayle Newman", "John Walter Graham"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Gasper, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth C Pinel, Committee Member", "Michelle Gayle Newman, Committee Member", "John Walter Graham, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["relationship evaluation", "social comparison"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Barriers to Enrollment in Colleges of Agriculture: Perspectives of Currently Enrolled Students at 1862 Land-Grant Institutions\n\n", "id": "9389", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1074", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of the study was to identify and describe perceived barriers to enrollment by currently enrolled students in colleges of agriculture at 1862 land grant institutions. A secondary purpose of this study was to identify knowledge of agriculture and careers related to agriculture prior to a student\u2019s enrollment in the college of agriculture. This study also identified and described demographic characteristics of students enrolled in colleges of agriculture at select 1862 land grant institutions.\n\nThe population of the study included currently enrolled undergraduate and graduate students at 1862 land grant institutions in the southern Cooperative Extension System region. A five-part survey instrument was developed to collect data. The survey collected data regarding awareness of agriculture careers and related programs, barriers to enrollment, and influencers on one\u2019s decision to enroll in a college of agriculture or choose a career related to agriculture. Usable responses yielded a return rate of 76.2% or 1,168 respondents. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data.\n\nThe majority of respondents were White/Caucasian females who grew up in suburban areas. Both males and females indicated that personal influences such as a parent, close relative, or friends had low influence on their decision to enroll in a college of agriculture.  School related influences such as a high school counselor or agriculture science teacher also had no or very low influence on their decision to enroll in a college of agriculture. Respondents who indicated having a family member involved in an agriculture career or lifestyle were most likely to be influenced by those closest to them when choosing to enroll in a college of agriculture.  When asked who influenced their decision to choose a career related to agriculture, responses almost mirrored the responses to who influenced their decision to enroll in a college of agriculture.\n\nPerceived barriers to enrollment indicated by currently enrolled students were \u201clack of discussion from high school guidance counselor, lack of contact with recruiters in agriculture, and lack of promotional materials about agriculture.\u201d While none of these barriers were reported as very much a barrier to their enrollment in a college of agriculture, they ranked in the top three, respectively. Barriers were felt more by non-white respondents when compared to white respondents.\n\nAwareness of programs/organizations and careers related to agriculture produced similar results.  Whites by far were more aware of programs in agriculture than non-whites, while whites and non-whites seemed quite similar in their awareness of career opportunities related to agriculture. Both groups seemed to be more aware of traditional agriculture related careers when compared to those careers that are not traditionally thought of as agriculture related.\n\nGiven the findings from this study, it is recommended that administrators in colleges of agriculture focus on educating students, parents and high school personnel about the vast career opportunities available in agriculture and related fields. In addition to educating about the opportunities in agriculture, it is further recommended that a best practice detailing appropriate strategies for the recruitment and retention of students in colleges of agriculture be developed at 1862 land grant institutions to not only increase enrollment but to also eliminate perceived barriers to enrollment in a college of agriculture. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1064], "author_name_tesi": "Smith-Hollins, CherRhonda M", "last_name_ssi": "Smith-Hollins", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "CherRhonda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Connie Devine Baggett", "Connie Devine Baggett", "Patreese Donette Ingram", "Rama B Radhakrishna", "Cynthia Pellock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Connie Devine Baggett, Dissertation Advisor", "Connie Devine Baggett, Committee Chair", "Patreese Donette Ingram, Committee Chair", "Rama B Radhakrishna, Committee Member", "Cynthia Pellock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Barriers to Enrollment", "Enrollment barriers", "1862 land grant institutions", "College of Agriculture", "Higher Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Coparenting Across Early Childhood: Influences on the Development of Internalizing Symptoms", "id": "7859", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3408", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study investigated the associations between a specific pattern of coparenting occurring during early childhood and preschool-aged children\u2019s internalizing symptoms.

The results show that on both site and national scales, SSURGO does not accurately represent streambank soil properties.  Additionally, the results show that existing empirical equations are not accurate predictors of critical shear stress. The barrier of soil parameterization still exists for large-scale modeling.

The coefficient of the power law relationship accounts for site-specific conditions and may include factors such as climate, land use, and vegetation.

While an impressive amount of work has been done in general educational contexts, fewer studies have investigated the role of gesture in the language classroom. Moreover, the vast majority of these studies focus either on the ways learners mediate their thinking with gesture or the manner in which teachers employ gesture in instructional interaction. There is also lack of longitudinal studies of gesture in the language classroom, which would allow for tracking the impact of teacher-student gesturing on learning. The present study 1) investigates the instructional/learning functions of teacher and student gesturing coordinated with speech in the process of classroom L2 learning; 2) provides evidence of student learning as a consequence of gesture-based mediation; and 3) documents how teacher and student use of gesture in the ESL classroom changes over time. \n     The primary data for the study are comprised of 32 hours of video recordings of classroom interactions collected over six weeks at a U.S. university Intensive English Communication Program. The data also include the teacher\u2019s PowerPoint slides and the textbook employed during classroom activities as well as responses from an instructor questionnaire, student questionnaire, and an instructor follow-up interview. Framed within Vygotskian sociocultural theory (Lantolf & Thorne, 2006), the study also adopts theoretical frameworks and methodologies of gesture analysis developed by McNeill (1992, 2005) and Kendon (2004).        \n     The findings indicate that teacher and student gestures employed in their classroom interactions served important instructional and learning functions in the process of mastering different aspects of language. Thus, the teacher\u2019s gesture 1) facilitated student learning of vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar; 2) enhanced teacher/student affective alignment and encouraged student participation; 3) externalized teacher cognition, which became accessible to students and had important social/instructional consequences. Similarly, student gesturing fulfilled important learning functions, as it allowed them to: 1) express their understandings of L2 concepts through gesture before they were able to verbalize the concepts; 2) appropriate the teacher\u2019s gesture and employ it as a learning tool; 3) mediate their own thinking in L2 through private gesture; 4) use gesture in peer interactions to facilitate their fellow students\u2019 understandings of L2 meanings. \n     In most of the research literature that has examined gesture in the L2 classroom focus has been either on the teacher\u2019s or on the students\u2019 use of gesture. The present study demonstrates the value of considering the use of gesture in the pedagogical interactions between the teacher and students and among students. It considers teacher and student gesturing as a dialogical co-constructed process unfolding in real-time interaction. Such an approach combined with the longitudinal perspective allowed for tracking of student responsivity to the teacher\u2019s gestural strategies and identifying which of these were more conducive to learning. The study also points to significant instructional functions of teacher and student catchments as manifestations of dialogicity in classroom L2 learning. The study has important implications for SLA pedagogy, indicating that language teachers need to become aware of the pedagogical benefits of gesture in developing their student understandings and verbalizations in L2. Teachers also need to be sensitized to their student gestures as an important source of information about their current levels of language development. The study offers recommendations to teacher education programs on ways of incorporating instructional gesture into teacher preparation. Finally, it makes a contribution to the methodology of gesture research by elaborating the notions of catchment, growth point, beat, and gestural hold. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10079], "author_name_tesi": "Smotrova, Tetyana ", "last_name_ssi": "Smotrova", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tetyana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Lantolf", "James Lantolf", "Celeste S Kinginger", "Dr Suresh Canagarajah", "Mari Haneda"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Lantolf, Dissertation Advisor", "James Lantolf, Committee Chair", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Member", "Dr Suresh Canagarajah, Committee Member", "Mari Haneda, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gesture", "teaching", "classroom", "second language"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "By Design: Exchange Algorithms to Construct Exact Model-Robust and Multiresponse Experimental Designs\n", "id": "10939", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "704", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Optimal experimental design procedures, utilizing criteria such as $mathcal{D}$-optimality, are often used under nonstandard experimental conditions such as constrained design spaces, and produce designs with desirable variance properties. However, to implement these methods the form of the regression function must be known emph{a priori}, an often unrealistic assumption.  Model-robust designs are those which, from our perspective, are robust for a set of specified possible models.  In this dissertation, we present new model-robust exchange algorithms for exact experimental designs which improve upon current, practical model-robust methodology.  We also extend these ideas to experiments with multiple responses and split-plot structures, settings for which few or no flexible, practicable model-robust procedures exist.\n\nWe first develop a model-robust technique which, when the possible models are nested, is $mathcal{D}$-optimal with respect to an associated multiresponse model.  In addition to providing a justification for the procedure, this motivates a generalization of the modified Fedorov exchange algorithm which is used to construct exact model-robust designs. We give several examples and compare our designs with two model-robust procedures in the literature.\n\nFor a given set of models, the aforementioned algorithm tends to produce designs which have higher $mathcal{D}$-efficiencies for some models and lower $mathcal{D}$-efficiencies for others.  To mitigate this unbalancedness, we develop a model-robust maximin exchange algorithm which maximizes the lowest efficiency over the set of models and consequently produces designs for which there is worst-case protection.  Furthermore, we present a generalization of this technique which allows the user to express varying levels of interest in each model, often resulting in a design suggestive of these differences.  Some asymptotic properties of this criterion are explored, including a condition which guarantees complete balance in terms of (generalized) efficiencies.  We also show that even if this condition is not satisfied, this balance will be achieved in some subset of at least two models for nontrivial cases.  We give several examples illustrating the procedure.\n\nSince many, if not most, experiments have multiple responses, we extend our methodology to such designs.  In addition to the problem of unknown model forms, which in this case is exacerbated by the fact that there are multiple such forms to specify, the response covariance matrix is generally unknown at the design stage as well.  We present an exchange algorithm for multiresponse $mathcal{D}$-optimal designs, using generalizations of matrix-updating formulae to serve as its computational engine.  However, this procedure requires knowledge of the model forms, so we develop an expanded multiresponse model which allows each response to accommodate a set of possible models.  The optimal design with respect to this larger model constitutes a design robust to these sets.  We find, as has been noted before, that the covariance matrix is generally of little import, and it is much less consequential than the unknown model forms.  We use several examples to compare the model-robust designs to designs optimal for the largest assumed model (i.e. usual practice).\n\nFinally, we consider model-robust split-plot designs using the maximin approach.  Split-plot experiments are appropriate when some factors are difficult or expensive to change relative to other factors.  They require two levels of randomization which induces an error structure that renders ordinary least squares analysis incorrect in general. The design of such experiments has garnered much attention over the last twenty years, and has spawned work in split-plot $mathcal{D}$-optimal designs.  However, as in the case of completely randomized experiments, these procedures rely on the assumption that the form of the model relating the factors to the response is correctly specified.  We relax that assumption, again by allowing the experimenter to specify a set of model forms, and use the maximin criterion to produce designs that have high $mathcal{D}$-efficiencies for each of the models in the set.  Furthermore, a generalization allows the experimenter to exert some control over the efficiencies by specifying a level of interest in each model.  We demonstrate the procedure with two examples.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [698], "author_name_tesi": "Smucker, Byran Jay", "last_name_ssi": "Smucker", "middle_name_ssi": "Jay", "first_name_ssi": "Byran", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Enrique Del Castillo And James Rosenberger", "Enrique Del Castillo", "James Landis Rosenberger", "Rana Arnold", "Bing Li", "Susan H Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Enrique Del Castillo And James Rosenberger, Dissertation Advisor", "Enrique Del Castillo, Committee Chair", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Chair", "Rana Arnold, Committee Member", "Bing Li, Committee Member", "Susan H Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["split-plot design", "optimal design", "maximin"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Academic Entitlement, Adults in Graduate Education, and Popular Culture: A Mixed-Methods Study", "id": "15067drs224", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15067", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was two-fold: a) to investigate the nature of academic entitlement in adult graduate students, and b) to determine if popular culture viewed from a public pedagogical lens influenced adult graduate students in respect to academic entitlement.

While strategies aimed at causation of the nursing shortage must be addressed, to support nursing until resolution occurs, it is essential to focus on strategies aimed at retaining nurses within this challenging health care environment. Using qualitative research, narrative inquiry and personal narratives, this study documents the stories of six exemplary hospital nurses who not only have stayed and survived in this hostile and challenging environment of hospital nursing, but continue to grow professionally and provide exceptional nursing care; their story is a story of career satisfaction and career success. Using narrative analysis, these stories were co-constructed with the researcher and the exceptional hospital nurses from data obtained through two interactive narrative sessions. An in depth three dimensional analysis of both the individual and collective narratives was completed. \nThe findings of this study revealed numerous exceptional nurse characteristics and traits which not only appear within, but transcend the individual nurse narratives. First and foremost, this study indicated that the concept of caring permeated all aspects of their personal and professional being. They not only cared for their patients but these exceptional nurses cared deeply for and respected their peers, their families, their profession and themselves.  Life-long learning took precedence in their nursing career, and though they believed in formal education, few pursued advanced credentials. They unanimously believed the greatest educational emphasis in nursing should be on experiential learning.  Along with exemplary and positive attitudes, the exceptional nurses in this study were extremely pragmatic, value-driven individuals and employed a solutions-focused approach to problem solving.  Nursing was viewed by these nurses as a profession of rewards and they celebrated these rewards continually. When compared to the extant literature on the concept of resiliency, the exceptional hospital nurses in this study displayed many of the traits of resilient individuals. \nImplications for adult and narrative learning are explored within this research study and, based on the findings of this study, implications for nursing education, nursing practice and future nursing research are presented.

Today, this credential has evolved into a second chance certificate for many high school dropouts. The southwestern Pennsylvania students, who were part of this research, demonstrated the persistence, tenacity, and determination they needed to achieve the goal of passing the battery of five GED Tests. The theoretical framework of functionalism explored how these students fit into a society that values educational credentials. The educational opportunities offered through the adult education programs these students attended, enabled them to discover their strengths, abilities, and capabilities. Some researchers believed these were qualities they possessed all along and in the case of these adult learners, they believed it was the support they received especially from their teachers that assisted them in learning more about transitioning to work, post-secondary opportunities or training. They grew not only academically, but personally as well. They were grateful for the patience, flexibility, and respect shown to them by their adult education teachers, something they felt was lacking in their former educational settings. Their families and classmates also supported their efforts. Many of the students experienced extraordinary changes in their lives that helped them fulfill their goal of receiving their GED credential. Those who were parents wanted to continue to be role models for their children and reinforce the importance of a good education to them. The methodology of qualitative interviewing helped convey the experiences as the adult learners explained their individual processes of entering an adult education program and preparing not only for the GED Tests, but also for their future. Their experiences tell us that while some students were down, they were never out. They would not let their circumstances dictate their future. Their stories demonstrated that they had learned from their life lessons to be persistent and diligent in order to achieve their goal of receiving their GED credential. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5786], "author_name_tesi": "Snider, Susan Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Snider", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Susan", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Kuhne", "Gary Kuhne", "Esther Susana Prins", "Melody M Thompson", "David P Baker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Kuhne, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary Kuhne, Committee Chair", "Esther Susana Prins, Committee Member", "Melody M Thompson, Committee Member", "David P Baker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["General Educational Development", "high school equivalency diploma"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Mesopause Airglow Modulation by Ducted Short-Period Gravity Waves", "id": "8074", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2574", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, we examine the excitation and propagation of ducted short-period gravity waves at mesopause altitudes, and the associated wave-induced modulation of nighttime airglow emissions.  A new, fully-nonlinear, two-dimensional, numerical model is developed for the simulation of atmospheric gravity waves in a realistic atmosphere, and coupled with photochemical models to allow calculations of wave-induced modulation of mesopause OH NIR and OI (atomic oxygen) 557.7 nm airglow emissions.  Models include transport of relevant minor and major species, and time-dependent chemical kinetics of ozone and hydrogen, which exhibit chemical lifetimes on the order of gravity wave periods at airglow altitudes.  The role of dynamics and chemical time dependence on airglow response to realistic short period gravity wave perturbations is then studied.  The models allow direct calculation of integrated emission intensities, facilitating detailed comparisons with ground-based airglow imager data.  \n\nWe first validate our model while exploring three case studies for the excitation of thermally-ducted wave modes, by linear tunneling, and by breaking or nonlinear-propagation of other short period gravity waves.  The modeled ducted wave modes are determined by Doppler shift and varying thermal structure.  Consistent with past studies, numerically modeled ducted wave properties are found to agree with analytical models for fully-ducted modes in weak, constant and stable wind flow conditions.  \n\nTwo model case studies of short-period gravity wave events, clearly resembling events observed in experimental airglow data, are presented:\n\nFirst, we examine a front-like ducted wave event, observed during the ALOHA-93 campaign in Hawaii.  The hypothetical nonlinear excitation of this ducted wave is modeled, and model airglow intensity modulation is calculated.  Agreement, and potential disagreement, between model results and observed image data are found.  When vertical transport of ozone is relatively weak, OH and OI emissions are found to emit in anti-phase for equal-phase wave temperature and vertical velocity perturbations.  This effect results from the chemical time dynamics associated with the OH excitation reaction, which place dependence principally on hydrogen and ozone.  When steep gradients of ozone lead to strong density perturbations, the OH emission may exhibit opposite response above and below the peak of ozone, consistent with the sign of the gradient.  The region of the layer exhibiting stronger perturbation will dominate the integrated emission intensity, thereby determining the phase of the intensity measured by a ground-based imager.  This reveals strong dependence on the shape of the minor species profiles of atomic oxygen and ozone, and also on the local wave perturbation magnitude and packet spatial configuration.  Caution is thus needed in the interpretation and modeling of short-period wave signatures in airglow, due to significant variability of minor species profiles and atmospheric structure.\n\nSecond, we investigate a wave event observed at Bear Lake Observatory, UT, which also clearly exhibits antiphase perturbations of OH and OI intensity.  Simultaneous radar wind data reveals the strong presence of a semidiurnal tidal motion; due to a tidal wind peak ~50 m/s, the wave is fully-ducted by Doppler shift.  Using idealized models of ducted wave forcing, several hypothetical waves are examined, which agree with the observed event.  Modeled airglow intensities again suggest that the opposite-phase responses of OH and OI layers may be due to opposite photochemical responses, rather than to opposite wave dynamics at characteristic layer altitudes.  Results are again highly sensitive to the actual profiles of minor species, and suggest that the phase of the integrated OH emission is determined by the structure of the wave perturbation with respect to the local density ozone gradients. \n\nFinally, we investigate the effects of dynamic background flow on the propagation of ducted waves.  Under idealized static conditions, ducted gravity waves are dissipated principally by viscosity, however dynamic duct structure may lead to transport and deposition of ducted wave energy and momentum during the course of propagation.  For waves ducted in a wave-like wind field exhibiting upward or downward phase progression, trapped energy may be transported upward or downward, respectively.  Ducted wave energy may leak through boundaries into neighboring ducts within the spatially-periodic wind field.  Three idealized case studies are presented, with wave-like horizontal winds exhibiting static, downward, and upward phase progression.  Result suggest that the dominant case of downward phase progression, consistent with large scale upward-propagating waves and tides, may lead to strong airglow signatures as ducted packets are transported through the airglow layers.  Nonlinear implications of dynamic duct structure are discussed, and relevant future studies are proposed.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2554], "author_name_tesi": "Snively, Jonathan Brian", "last_name_ssi": "Snively", "middle_name_ssi": "Brian", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko", "John David Mathews", "C Russell Philbrick", "Sukyoung Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko, Committee Chair", "John David Mathews, Committee Member", "C Russell Philbrick, Committee Member", "Sukyoung Lee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Atmospheric waves", "mesosphere", "airglow", "numerical simulation", "aeronomy"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "An Investigation of Synergistic Effect During Co-pyrolysis Of Coal and Pine Sawdust at Moderate Temperatures\n", "id": "14535", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5169", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An increasing population growth and the improvements made to the lifestyles of developing countries are leading to an ever increasing need for energy of all kinds.  This increase in energy demand will also lead to an increase in the emissions generated by the current energy production methods.

It is important to utilize a locally available biomass sample.  Silver maple is a common woody biomass readily available in the northeastern United States.  This study investigates the effects of co-utilization on the gaseous products of the pyrolysis process.  Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of organic matter in an oxygen-free environment. \nThe objective of this study is to investigate the potential synergistic effect of adding biomass to coal during pyrolysis on the gaseous products.  The objective was met by carrying out lab scale pyrolysis experiments in an electrical tube furnace.  The feedstock consisted of 0%, 5%, 10%, 20% and 100% biomass.  All feedstock blending combinations were heated to 700\u02da C and 900\u02da C in order to observe any effects of temperature on the synergistic effect of blending. \nIt was observed that higher biomass concentration increase the quantity of syngas produced.  The addition of this biomass species to this coal did not have a synergistic effect on the gaseous production of this process.  While promoting hydrogen producing reactions such as methane reforming all effects observed were linear.

Its most infamous aspect is the excavation of a geological formation \u2013 the Bald Eagle Sandstone \u2013 that was found to contain acidic rock material, which, upon exposure to water, leached sulfuric acid to several surface water bodies and private groundwater wells.  This matter managed to suspend construction of the project for several years.  Numerous parties, representing academia, government (particularly the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT)), private industry (consultants), environmental organizations and advocacy groups, and the citizenry, have been involved in the development of a resolution to the I-99 acidic rock problem.  The interactions among these parties are interdisciplinary by nature, given the sectors of society that they represent.  Consideration of how these parties interacted with each other while evaluating the options for addressing the environmental dilemma posed by the I-99 project provides opportunities for academic research.  The discipline of Science Education is viable for studying the I-99 case, with accompaniment by 2 other disciplines, which have direct relevance to this case: Geology/Earth Science (per the underlying cause of the I-99 acidic rock problem) and Environmental Policy (per the regulations and policies that had to be followed while developing a solution to the environmental dilemma).  Pairing Science Education with the other two aforementioned disciplines can create additional niches for the former discipline, and enhance academic research both within itself, and, across other disciplines, as relevant.

Because iron can influence neuronal cell death and dopamine function, the body tightly controls the supply of iron needed for tasks such as a cofactor for enzymes but also has mechanisms in place to sequester iron to limit oxidative stress. The major protein that accomplishes this latter task is ferritin, with the ferroxidase properties belonging to the H subunit. In this thesis, mice genetically altered to be heterozygous for a mutation in the H-ferritin gene were utilized to examine the impact of H-ferritin-deficiency on the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system. The distribution of mitochondrial ferritin, a protein structurally and functionally similar to H-ferritin, was also explored in mouse and human brain.\n\nRegion-specific analysis of brain neurochemicals and dopamine transporter expression indicated that neurons of the H-ferritin-deficient mouse are iron-deficient. Stereolgical analysis of dopaminergic cells in the nigra indicated no loss due to age or genotype. Challenge with the selective neurotoxins paraquat (1, 1\u2019-dimethyl-4,4\u2019-bipyridinium) and maneb (manganese ethylenebisdithiocarbamate) caused significant cell loss in the 12 month-old H-ferritin-deficient mice, suggesting this as a model of Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n\nA surprising finding was that H-ferritin was not detectable in the substantia nigra pars compacta regardless of age, genotype or toxin exposure. Therefore, mitochondrial ferritin (FtMt) was examined. Mice deficient in H-ferritin do not differ in FtMt staining pattern or intensity as compared to C57/BL6 mice, and FtMt was not detected in the mouse substantia nigra.\n\nMitochondrial ferritin in human autopsy samples from the substantia nigra revealed that the restless legs syndrome (RLS) nigra had significantly more FtMt than controls; neuromelanin-containing neurons were the predominant cell-type expressing FtMt. Increased FtMt could contribute to the insufficient cytosolic iron levels in RLS neurons and the symptoms of this disorder. \n\nOverall, the data presented in this thesis underscore the importance in ferritins in the nigrostriatal system. The H-ferritin-deficient mice are a model in which the study of iron mismanagement can be used to study neurological disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and may be a model for RLS.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [268], "author_name_tesi": "Snyder, Amanda Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Snyder", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "James Robert Connor", "Robert J Milner", "Byron C Jones", "Ralph Lauren Keil", "Stephanie Miller Patton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Dissertation Advisor", "James Robert Connor, Committee Chair", "Robert J Milner, Committee Member", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member", "Stephanie Miller Patton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["H-ferritin", "mitochondrial ferritin", "iron"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THE IMPACT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ON CONTRACEPTIVE USE AND COSTS AMONG PRIVATELY INSURED WOMEN", "id": "13788ahs5000", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13788", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Objectives: The contraceptive coverage mandate in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires private health insurance plans to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods without cost-sharing.

The particle lithography process is extended to functionalize a colloid at two sites. The sites are ninety degrees relative to the center of the colloid.

Also demonstrated is the ability to assemble particles composed of differing materials. Modeling aided in understanding how a lithographed and complementary particle\nmight interact. Phase diagrams were constructed to show the critical coagulation concentration of salt needed for a lithographed particle to bind to its complement. This salt concentration is a function of patch size and potential, and particle size and potential. An effective patch size is defined and found to vary little as a function of system parameters. Defining a critical coagulation concentration suggests the ability to store lithographed precursor particles. This ability to create storable particles with controlled reactive sites provides a new tool for bottom up assembly processes. Usefulness is derived from even the most basic of asymmetry in particle assemblies.
