When the dimensionality of a population is high, traditional Hotelling's $T^2$ test becomes practically infeasible due to the singularity of sample covariance matrix. In this dissertation, we propose a projection-based testing method for the high-dimensional  one-sample and two-sample mean problems. Our method projects the original sample to a lower-dimensional space and conducts tests on the projected sample. Different from existing projection-based tests, our approach is based  on data-driven estimation of the optimal direction. Meanwhile, our test keeps the equivalence of null hypotheses between the original sample and the projected sample, which is often ignored by previous researches. We show that the test based on projected sample is an exact $t$-test under the normality assumption and an asymptotic $\\chi^2$-test with one degree of freedom without the normality assumption. \n\nIn the one-sample problem, we are interested in  testing $H_0:\\bmu=\\bmu_0$ against $H_1:\\bmu \\neq \\bmu_0$ for a random sample of size $N$ from a $p$-dimensional population $X$ with finite mean vector $\\bmu$ and finite positive definite covariance matrix $\\Sigma$.  We derive the theoretical optimal direction with which the test possesses the most power under the alternative. We show that projection to a one-dimensional space with direction $\\Sigma^{-1}(\\bmu-\\bmu_0)$ leads to the optimal power, regardless of the distribution assumption. The null hypothesis with the projected sample is $ (\\bmu-\\bmu_0)^T\\Sigma^{-1}(\\bmu-\\bmu_0)=0$, which holds  if and only if $\\bmu=\\bmu_0$ for a full rank $\\Sigma$. A computationally efficient algorithm is developed to implement the new test.  Local asymptotic property is studied and we show that under mild conditions the proposed test outperforms the major existing methods. Our numerical comparison shows that the new test retains Type I error rate well and can be more powerful than the existing tests for the high-dimensional data. \n\nIn the two-sample problem, we are interested in  testing $H_0:\\bmu_1=\\bmu_2$ against $H_0:\\bmu_1 \\neq \\bmu_2$ for two independent random samples of size $N_i$ from populations with finite mean vector $\\bmu_i$ and finite positive definite covariance matrix $\\Sigma_i$, $i=1,2$ respectively. When $\\Sigma_1=\\Sigma_2=\\Sigma$, we prove that the optimal direction is $\\Sigma^{-1} (\\bmu_1-\\bmu_2)$, regardless of the distribution assumption.   When the covariance matrices are unequal,  we show that the optimal projection direction is  $\\left( \\Sigma_1 + \\frac{N_1}{N_2} \\Sigma_2 \\right)^{-1} (\\bmu_1-\\bmu_2)$ for normal population by first taking  Bennett's transformation to obtain an one-sample sequence of size $N_1$ that is distributed from $N( \\bmu_1 - \\bmu_2, \\Sigma_1 + \\frac{N_1}{N_2} \\Sigma_2)$, assuming $N_1 <N_2$.  Both theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed test can be much more powerful than the existing ones.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10959], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Yuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Runze Li", "Runze Li", "David Russell Hunter", "Naomi S Altman", "Lan Kong", "Aleksandra B Slavkovic"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Runze Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Runze Li, Committee Chair", "David Russell Hunter, Committee Member", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member", "Lan Kong, Committee Member", "Aleksandra B Slavkovic, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["High-dimensional data", "Hotelling's T2 test", "Projection test", "One-sample problem", "Two-sample problem"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Nonlocal Models with Convection Effects", "id": "27473", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11974", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation focuses on proposing and studying nonlocal models in the form of partial-integral-differential equations, as a generalization of local models, in the form of classical differential equations.\n\nIt consists of two parts: the first part works on the volume-constraint problems associated with nonlocal convection-diffusion equations, the local counterpart part of which is the boundary-value problems associated with  classical convection-diffusion differential equations. The second part deals with the initial-value problems of scalar nonlocal hyperbolic conservation laws. \n \nIn both parts, we show that the nonlocal models we propose are reasonable extensions of their local counterparts, by demonstrating the consistency of their most important properties. In particular, both nonlocal problems enjoy maximum principle, just as their local counterparts do. Additionally, in the first part,  we identify the underlying stochastic jump processes for the nonlocal convection-diffusion problems with Dirichlet volume-constraint,  Robin volume-constraint, or on the whole space.  The local counterpart of these jump processes  are the Brownian motions with reflective or censored behavior near the domain boundary, or Brownian motions in the free space. Both Monte Carlo simulations and Finite Difference Methods are performed  to observe the nonlocal solutions. In the second part, for nonlocal hyperbolic conservation laws,  we prove the uniqueness and existence of the nonlocal entropy solution, and establish a condition on the kernel function, under which the nonlocal solution develop no shocks from smooth initial condition. Numerically, we propose a monotone scheme, the solution of which, as the horizon parameter is fixed and grid-size goes to zero,  converges to  the entropy solution of the nonlocal conservation law, while as horizon parameter and grid-size both vanish, converges to  the entropy solution of the local conservation law.

It is well known that hydrogen storage is the bottleneck problem of a grand hydrogen economy, but its notorious low volumetric density creates an overwhelming challenge in storage. Materials-based storage might make it possible to store large quantities of hydrogen in small volume at practical temperature and pressure. However, the actual experiments are hard to perform and even to explain the results, which gives computer simulations a big chance to investigate the storage. In this thesis, I use the Density Functional Theory based software to explore the new materials. A brief introduction of DFT theoretical background is given in the first chapter.\n\n\nIn Chapter 2, we study how to prevent the metal atoms from aggregating. In nature, low-coordinated metal atoms can provide new opportunities for gas storage and catalysis when they are exposed to their environment. But unfortunately, they are generally unstable against aggregation. We demonstrate that electron deficiency in an sp$^2$ carbon layer, induced by heavy (but realistic) boron doping, can stabilize sparse metal layers (Be, Mg, Sc and Ti) against aggregation thermodynamically. If the atomically dispersed metals are not thermodynamically favored, take Pd as an example, local inhomogeneities in boron density will create large\nkinetic barriers against aggregation, so Pd layer can be kinetically stable.\n\n\nIn Chapter 3, we first introduce the two new classes of materials. The compelling Ammonia Boron based materials used for chemical storage attract interests because of their high hydrogen content, but the overly stable products seriously eliminate any possibility of reversible storage. On the other hand, the organic frameworks exhibit strong structural stability and accessibility. Almost all of the atoms are on the surface. These\namazing properties look like exclusively being tailored for the hydrogen release in one of the products, PAB polymer. We combine the advantages of the polymer and framework, then design four series of frameworks. They are proven stable through molecular dynamics simulations.\n\nChapter 4 is focused on the essential issue of hydrogen applications: the release kinetics. We present a novel idea to tune the activation barrier by coupling the polymer with an external framework spring, and then apply it to the simple PAB -- PAB/H$_2$ transformation. Our results for planar polymer transformations show that this\ncoupling indeed change both the hydrogen binding energy E$_B$ and its release barrier $Delta E_K$, although the lowest barrier by this tuning is still too large. When the polymer is compressed, the E$_B$ and $Delta E_K$ are lowered; when the polymer is stretched, the E$_B$ and $Delta E_K$ are raised. Finally, we test a non-planar transformation and achieve a great improvement in $Delta E_K$, so the non-planar\npolymer transformation might be an much more effective way in hydrogen release.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6969], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, ZhaoHui ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "ZhaoHui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Nitin Samarth", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi, Dissertation Advisor", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Chair", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogen release kinetics", "chemical hydrogen storage", "metal aggregation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Essays in Financial Economics", "id": "8524", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6973", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous studies show mixed results about the out-of-sample performance of various asset-pricing anomalies.  To reduce data-snooping bias, this paper simulates a real-time trader who chooses among all asset-pricing anomalies published prior to that time using only non-forward-looking filters.  I find that a trader can outperform the market by recursively picking the best past performer among published anomalies.  The excess return tends to be highest when the trader looks at past performances between two years and five years and when the trader considers more anomalies. For published anomalies, their excess returns over benchmark as well as relative ranks among contemporaneous anomalies do not decrease over time, indicating a relatively stable performance once being published.  Relying only on the then-available anomaly literature and historical data, the overall result shows a possible way to beat the market in real time.\n\nIn the second essay, I study the managerial decision and its impact on mutual fund performance.  ``Meet or beat\" describes manager's manipulation of the accounting earnings to meet analyst forecasts, which causes the final earnings distribution to be negatively-skewed with a dent to the left.  I investigate if mutual fund managers also demonstrate such a risk-seeking behavior and the potential impact on mutual fund performance.  I develop a two-period decision model in which a manager makes a decision to take or not to take a risky project when she faces a target level of performance in time 1. The manager's payoff depends on a linear function of the time 2 (final) value of the firm, and on a step function on whether the firm meets the target or not. As a result, those managers with firm values slightly lower than expected tend to take the risky project, and if the firm value is already higher or far below the expectation, the manager does not take the project. The terminal value of a firm conforms with the empirical evidence of meeting or beating analyst forecasts.  I empirically test the model on actively managed mutual funds. I find funds in the 3rd and 4th worst performance deciles take higher risks and on average outperform the median decile in the following year, indicating a risk seeking behavior for slightly under-performing managers. I also compare the excess return distributions for growth funds and index funds, but do not find negative skewness supporting the model.\n\nThe third essay is an experimental study about people's time-inconsistent risk preferences.  There is a substantial literature which studies time-inconsistent temporal preferences.  We conducted an experiment to explore time-inconsistency in the other dimension of investment preferences, i.e., risk preferences.  We had subjects play a multi-period betting game where they planned their betting decisions in advance and then played the game dynamically later to see if these decisions matched their plan.  We found that subjects took more risk than planned in their initial bet and after a loss where this increase in risk-taking is associated with an increase in breakeven mental accounting.  Our findings shed light on the conditions under which emotions exacerbate mental accounting and other behavioral biases.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6970], "author_name_tesi": "Huang, Zhijian ", "last_name_ssi": "Huang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhijian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jingzhi Huang", "Jeremy Ko", "Jean Helwege", "Runze Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jingzhi Huang, Committee Chair", "Jeremy Ko, Committee Chair", "Jean Helwege, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Asset pricing", "data snooping", "market efficiency", "out-of-sample test", "behavioral finance"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Contributing Factors to Chronic Ankle Instability", "id": "6636", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6187", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The development of repetitive ankle sprains and persistent symptoms after initial ankle sprain has been termed chronic ankle instability (CAI).  Two contributing factors to CAI are functional ankle instability and mechanical ankle instability.  Although the two may occur in isolation, it may be a combination of the two that causes CAI.  There have been relatively few studies that have examined the two in combination.  Additionally, the relationship of the specific insufficiencies to each other, or how they individually contribute to ankle instability, has not been examined.  There is not a clear indication of what measures are most important in discriminating between individuals with and without CAI. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to 1) examine group comparisons of the involved ankle of the CAI group and the matched ankle of the control group for ankle laxity and hypomobility, static and dynamic balance, ankle and hip strength, selected lower extremity malalignments, and ITB flexibility in subjects with unilateral CAI, 2) examine group comparisons of the symmetry indices of side-to-side differences for the same variables, and 3) examine the bivariate correlations between the variables in chronically unstable ankles. Thirty subjects with unilateral CAI and thirty healthy controls were tested.  Each control subject was assigned an \u201cinvolved\u201d ankle so that there were an equal proportion of right and left involved ankles between the CAI and control groups.  Measures of ankle laxity and hypomobility, static and dynamic balance, ankle and hip strength, selected lower extremity malalignments, and ITB flexibility were taken on both limbs of all subjects. \nFor the group comparisons of the involved ankles, separate 2 x 2 mixed model ANOVAs were calculated for each dependent variable with the between factor being group (CAI, control) and the within factor with repeated measures being side (involved, uninvolved).  Thirteen variables were identified as being significantly different between groups and were entered into a discriminant analysis.  These variables explained 55.4% of CAI group membership. The measures significantly predictive of CAI group membership were increased inversion rotation, increased anterior displacement, more missed balance trials, and lower plantar flexion to dorsiflexion peak torque ratio. These four variables correctly predicted group membership in 86.7% of subjects. \nTo look at differences within the ankles of the CAI and control groups symmetry indices comparing the involved and uninvolved sides of each subject were calculated for each dependent variable and compared between groups using independent t-tests.  Eight variables were identified as being significantly different between groups and were entered into a discriminant analysis.  These factors explained 46.5% of CAI group membership.  The measures significantly predictive of CAI group membership were decreased anterior reach, diminished plantar flexion peak torque, decreased posterior medial reach, and more inversion rotation.  These four variables correctly predicted group membership in 80.0% of CAI subjects and 73.3% of healthy subjects. \nFor the CAI involved ankles, bivariate correlations using Pearson Product Moment correlations were made between all dependent variables.  Several significant bivariate correlations were identified.    \nThe results of this study elucidate the specific measures that best discriminate between subjects with and without CAI.

The AHR was first identified as the primary mediator of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) toxicity and regulator of xenobiotic metabolism. Further investigation revealed AHR possesses a promiscuous ligand binding domain (LBD) that is able to bind to an array of exogenous compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs). Following ligand-binding, the AHR forms a functional heterodimeric transcription factor with AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) and regulates expression of target genes via binding of dioxin response elements (DREs) within their promoters.\nThe physiological activity of the AHR has expanded to include pivotal roles within immune regulation, mucosal barrier function, cell cycle progression, organogenesis, circadian rhythm, and cellular differentiation pathways. However, these functions often require the ligand activated form of the receptor and are known to occur in the absence of exogenous ligand. This finding led to the premise and eventual characterization of endogenous AHR ligands. The catabolism of the amino acid tryptophan by commensal microorganisms, endogenous enzymes, and radical oxidation is a known source of numerous AHR ligands.\nThe studies presented in here build upon previously published data establishing microbial metabolism as a reservoir of endogenous ligand production. In our research we have identified the microbial tryptophan metabolite indole as a human AHR selective agonist through SAR studies and in silico modeling of AHR-ligand molecular docking. In silico molecular docking models support observations of differential indole responsiveness between species through a unique bi-molecular (2:1) binding stoichiometry that is sterically permissive within the human AHR, but not its mouse homolog.  The capacity for host cells to sense microbial indole through the AHR may be paramount to the establishment of an inter-kingdom signaling pathway that affects maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.\nMolecular functionalities of the AHR, such as heterodimerization with ARNT and binding of DREs, are conserved among vertebrate and invertebrate species. However, ligand specificity of the AHR can vary between species. Comparative studies have shown that the human AHR displays reduced binding capacity with regard to prototypical PAH agonists when compared to rodent homologs. Such differences suggest that divergence of the AHR ligand binding domain (LBD) structure during the course of mammalian evolution facilitated interspecies variation in ligand selectivity. \nHere we present evidence supporting the hypothesis that selective desensitization of the human AHR to PAHs arose during speciation of Homo sapiens. Interspecies AHR analyses, through utilization of ligand binding assay, DNA binding assay, and AHR-dependent gene expression identified a single amino acid substitution (A381V) as the determinant in reduced PAH affinity exhibited by H. sapiens relative to their Homo neanderthalensis (Neanderthal) and primate counterparts. Notably, H. sapiens AHR responsiveness to endogenous ligands derived from tryptophan and indole metabolism remains unperturbed. These findings reveal that a functionally significant mutation in the AHR occurred uniquely in humans that would attenuate the response to many environmental pollutants, including chemicals present in smoke.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13885], "author_name_tesi": "Hubbard, Troy David", "last_name_ssi": "Hubbard", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Troy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Gary Perdew", "Dr. Andrew Patterson", "Dr. Jeffrey Peters", "Dr. Ming Tien", "Dr. Edward Dudley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Gary Perdew, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. Andrew Patterson, Committee Chair", "Dr. Jeffrey Peters, Committee Member", "Dr. Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Dr. Edward Dudley, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aryl hydrocarbon receptor", "AHR", "Evolution", "Ligand selectivity", "PAHs", "Toxicity"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Communicating Social Support behind Bars: Experiences with the Pennsylvania Lifers' Association\n\n", "id": "6779", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1967", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The imprisonment rate in America has been steadily increasing.

Building from this research, the author interviewed members of the Pennsylvania Lifers\u2019 Association, an activist and social support group, to investigate how members talk about their experiences. Observations of group meetings revealed how social support was communicated by group members. Furthermore, survey research was conducted in an effort to explore whether the conceptual structure of social support, as reported by those with natural life sentences, was similar to that in previous related research.  \nThe data suggested that Yalom\u2019s theoretical model of social support is incomplete when applied to the experiences of SCI-Huntingdon\u2019s board members of the Pennsylvania Lifers\u2019 Association.

Both intrinsic and extrinsic stresses impact the development and progression of neoplasms, down to the level of individual proteins and genes.  Stresses like nutrient deficiency, hypoxia, and the immune response are present during normal tumor growth and throughout treatment.  Tumor cells that survive these stresses are more adept at surviving hostile conditions and are more resistant to current therapies.  Stress, therefore, shapes the tumor cell population.  Gene expression alterations are the driving feature behind the adaptive ability of cancer cells to these stresses, and therefore, careful examination of these gene expression changes must be undertaken in order to develop effective therapies. \n\nIn the present investigations, we first explore the global alterations of gene expression in tamoxifen resistance.  Resistance to tamoxifen (Tam), a widely used antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER), occurs in one third of patients treated with Tam within 5 years of therapy.  A better understanding of gene expression alterations associated with Tam resistance will facilitate circumventing this problem.  Using a next generation sequencing approach and a new bioinformatics model, we compared the transcriptomes of Tam-sensitive and Tam-resistant breast cancer cells for identification of genes involved in the development of Tam resistance.  We identified differential expression of 1215 mRNA and 513 small RNA transcripts clustered into ER\u03b1 functions, cell cycle regulation, gen expression, and mitochondrial modification.  The extent of alterations found at multiple levels of gene regulation highlights the ability of the Tam-resistant cells to modulate global gene expression.  Alterations of small nucleolar RNA, oxidative phosphorylation, and a protein called SIRT3 in Tam-resistant cells present areas for diagnostic and therapeutic tool development for combating resistance to this anti-estrogen agent.  \n\nAfter such a global exploration of cancer cell responses to stress, we next investigated a mechanism of cancer cell survival by exploring the alterations in protein synthesis inhibitor eEF-2K.  Studies show that eEF-2K plays a role in cell survival through this inhibition of protein synthesis and that its protein levels are increased in cancer.  Post-translational modification of translation machinery is important for its regulation and could be critical for survival of cancer cells encountering stress. Thus, the purpose of our study is to examine the regulation of eEF-2K during stress with a focus on the phosphorylation status and stability of EF-2K protein in cancer cells.  Using two human glioma cell lines (T98G and LN229), under stress conditions, we found a paradoxical increase in eEF-2K protein expression with a decrease in eEF-2K protein stability. Phosphorylation may play a role in this altered protein stability as EF-2K has multiple phosphorylation sites that are phosphorylated by the mTOR/S6 kinase (S78 and S366) and AMP kinase (S398), pathways which would be affected by stress.  Through phosphorylation-defective mutants, we discovered that S398 was pivotal to protein stability. Our data indicate that eEF-2K is regulated at multiple levels with phosphorylation playing an important role in protein turnover.  \n\nTogether, our results represent the global impact that stress can have on cancer cells. Our NGS study exemplifies the complexity of alterations caused by exogenous stresses on cancer cells.  The focused eEF-2K study indicates how tightly and complexly this protein synthesis regulator is controlled, which has broad implications for global and specific translation of the numerous gene transcript alterations caused by stress. Understanding how gene expression and proteins are altered in cancer cells by different intrinsic and extrinsic stresses will help current and future researchers to develop novel and more effective methods of overcoming cancer cell survival and resistance to current treatments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7642], "author_name_tesi": "Huber-keener, Kathryn Joyce", "last_name_ssi": "Huber-keener", "middle_name_ssi": "Joyce", "first_name_ssi": "Kathryn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jin Ming Yang", "Robert G Levenson", "Rongling Wu", "Willard Freeman", "Andrea Manni"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jin Ming Yang, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member", "Rongling Wu, Committee Member", "Willard Freeman, Committee Member", "Andrea Manni, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["eEF-2K", "tamoxifen", "glioma", "breast cancer", "protein synthesis", "next generation-sequencing", "protein stability"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Insight from Inside the Volcano: Genesis and eruption of Thr\u00edhn\u00fakag\u00edgur volcanics, Reykjanes Peninsula, Iceland", "id": "27929", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12016", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Thr\u00edhn\u00fakag\u00edgur is the main cone of a small 3500 ka fissure eruption in the Brennisteinsfj\u00f6ll fissure swarm on the Reykjanes Peninsula.

Direct observations in the cave in addition to major element, trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope analyses allow a fissure eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula to be investigated from melt generation in the mantle to eruption. Field relationships between the main dike that fed the eruption and the unconsolidated buried tephra suggest that the tephra was entrained by the erupting magma. Assuming the cave represents the volume of tephra entrained and removed from the system, estimates of the erupted volume of lava produce maximum estimates of ~29% tephra content in the lavas. Furthermore, the location of the buried tephra directly beneath the main cone of Thr\u00edhn\u00fakag\u00edgur suggest that the buried tephra acted as a local asperity in the crust forming a preferential pathway for the magma to ascend to the surface. The main vents were developed here because flow was focused by the buried tephra. However, the vertical sheet-like structure of the dike indicates that the far field stresses dictate the orientation of fissure despite the contrast in competency between the buried tephra and overlying basaltic lava flow.\nThe Sr-Nd-Pb isotope systematics illustrate that Thr\u00edhn\u00fakag\u00edgur lavas are consistent with other relatively enriched compositions observed on the Reykjanes Peninsula, with radiogenic Pb and Sr, and relatively unradiogenic Nd. These isotopes suggest that Thr\u00edhn\u00fakag\u00edgur magmas are derived from two main components \u2013 an enriched plume source and a depleted mantle source \u2013 with possible minor contributions from an EM1-like mantle source. Anomalously high ratios of Nb/U at Thr\u00edhn\u00fakag\u00edgur suggest that despite isotopic similarities between the Reykjanes Peninsula and the Eastern Volcanic Zone (EVZ), the enriched plume source at the Reykjanes is unique from the EVZ in its enriched Nb. Decoupling of the Sr isotopes from Pb and Nd isotopes suggests that the source of radiogenic Sr at Thr\u00edhn\u00fakag\u00edgur may be assimilation of basaltic crust that has been hydrothermally altered by seawater. The tephra entrainment hypothesis is tested with immobile trace element mixing models. Models of La/Yb vs. Nb/Zr yield maximum estimate 28-35% of the tephra component in the lavas, consistent with results from the geophysical analysis. However, large uncertainty in the initial magma composition limits the precision of this model and some samples may not contain any entrained tephra. Finally, the variability in the major and trace element geochemistry and the Sr isotopes, particularly in the uppermost magmatic plumbing system, suggest that the small volume of erupted magma was not homogenized prior to eruption. In the absence of a central volcano at Brennisteinsfj\u00f6ll, we invoke a network of dikes and sills that are quasi-isolated until the eruption, allowing for variable geochemical evolution. This model both preserves magma heterogeneity from the mantle and facilitates the evolution of magmas with variable compositions, consistent with the variation in geochemistry observed at multiple levels in this single eruption.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11448], "author_name_tesi": "Hudak, Michael Ryan", "last_name_ssi": "Hudak", "middle_name_ssi": "Ryan", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maureen Feineman", "Peter Christopher Lafemina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maureen Feineman, Thesis Advisor", "Peter Christopher Lafemina, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["fissure; eruption; basalt; mantle sources; assimilation; magma s"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Partial randomness and Kolmogorov complexity", "id": "17456", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8447", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Algorithmic randomness and Kolmogorov complexity provide a computational framework for the study of probability theory and information theory.  In this dissertation we prove the following theorems about partial randomness and complexity.\n\nFourteen notions of partial randomness are considered: three using generalized Martin-Lof tests, six using generalized Solovay tests, one in terms of martingales, and four using either a priori (KA) or prefix-free (KP) complexity.  \nUnder suitable hypotheses, every test or martingale variant of partial randomness can be characterized using either KA or KP, via generalizations of celebrated theorems of Schnorr and Levin.  New partial randomness notions are introduced, based on the first Borel-Cantelli lemma;  these notions are equivalent to other notions under suitable conditions on f.  It is also shown that while effectivizations of the first Borel-Cantelli lemma can be used to  characterize Martin-Lof randomness, effectivizations of the second Borel-Cantelli lemma instead characterize Kurtz randomness.\n\nUsing complexity arguments we weakly separate notions of partial randomness.  Under suitable hypotheses on the function f, there exists an X such that KP(X_n)>f(n)+O(1) for all n but KP(X_n)<f(n)+O(1) infinitely often.  A similar result holds with KP replaced by KA.\nHere X is an infinite sequence of 0's and 1's and X_n is the length n initial segment of X.\n\nA major new theorem is that under suitable hypotheses on f, there is an X such that KP(X_n)>f(n) for all n, but no Y recursive in X satisfies KP(Y_n)>f(n)+2log_2f(n)+O(1) for all n (also the analogous result for KA).  This theorem, which will be published in The Journal of Symbolic Logic, generalizes the theorem of Miller that there exists a Turing degree of effective Hausdorff dimension 1/2.  The new theorem also implies that there exists an X of effective Hausdorff dimension 1 which does not compute a Martin-Lof random, a result originally due to Greenberg and Miller.\n\nX is K-trivial if its initial segment complexity is always minimal, that is KP(X_n)=KP(n)+O(1) for all n.  We give a new and simpler proof that no K-trivial can be random relative to a continuous measure.  We also show that if X is K-trivial and Y is computable from the halting problem then there is no measure mu such that X and Y are mutually relatively mu-random and mu({X,Y})=0.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8355], "author_name_tesi": "Hudelson, William ", "last_name_ssi": "Hudelson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen George Simpson", "Jan Severin Reimann", "Manfred Heinz Denker", "Martin Furer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen George Simpson, Dissertation Advisor", "Jan Severin Reimann, Committee Member", "Manfred Heinz Denker, Committee Member", "Martin Furer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["randomness", "algorithmic randomness", "complexity", "Kolmogorov complexity", "computability", "recursion theory", "mathematical logic"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE APPLICATION OF FEEDBACK CONTROL TO THE FORCE FREQUENCY SHIFTING TECHNIQUE\n\n", "id": "10273", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1006", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Large civil engineering structures present a difficult set of test requirements in order to determine the dynamic characteristics.  These structures are characterized by large mass, high damping, and low natural frequencies, which result in the need for large dynamic forces in that low frequency region.  Conventional excitation systems used for dynamic analysis of civil structures are typically large hydraulic or rotating imbalance shakers.  A novel excitation technique has been developed through the exploitation of the nonlinear dynamic response of a mechanical system with active damping.  This work examines the characteristics of the nonlinear dynamic response and the resulting sub and super harmonic content that arises.  The desired result is to amplify the sub harmonic response in a prototype excitation system for the purpose of low frequency structural excitation.  Mechanical production of the sub harmonic excitation, known as force frequency shifting (FFS), has evolved from the application of an oscillatory force in a spatially varying fashion to designs with active components.  Previous FFS applications used active damping components with an open loop or predetermined control signal.  This work explores the use of feedback control of the active FFS component.  Evaluation is performed by a combination of analytical analysis, simulation and experiments.  Magnetorheological (MR) damping, a mature active technology, is used to generate the force frequency shifting response.  Bang-bang and PID feedback controllers are analyzed and implemented with the objective of increasing the low frequency transmitted force and reducing harmonic distortion.  The controllers were implemented on a fully instrumented laboratory scale prototype.  The experimental test results showed that regardless of the feedback controller used, improvements in the sub harmonic transmitted force magnitude were not realized compared to open loop operation.  However, nominal reductions of     2-4% in the harmonic distortion were demonstrated.  The use of a purely dissipative actuator with a limited time response and limited variation in dissipative properties proved to be the factor preventing the desired performance objectives from being achieved.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [996], "author_name_tesi": "Hudson, Christopher James", "last_name_ssi": "Hudson", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Martin Wesley Trethewey", "Martin Wesley Trethewey", "Christopher Rahn", "John Stephen Lamancusa", "Joseph Paul Cusumano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Martin Wesley Trethewey, Dissertation Advisor", "Martin Wesley Trethewey, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "John Stephen Lamancusa, Committee Member", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MR damper", "transmitted force", "feedback control", "force frequency shifting", "structural excitation", "force tracking"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of oospore production, metalaxyl sensitivity and forecast-based fungicide applications for the management of Phytophthora infestans on tomato in Pennsylvania", "id": "22685", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10304", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Late blight (LB) caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, remains one of the most important plant diseases worldwide due to its rapid progression and potential for complete crop devastation. These characteristics in part, make P. infestans challenging to manage. Management is most successful when preventative strategies like the use of disease forecasting to time fungicide applications are combined with knowledge about the characteristics of the predominant clonal lineage(s). Therefore, our research focused on: 1) determining the in vitro sensitivity of select Pennsylvania US-23 isolates to the fungicide active ingredient mefenoxam; 2) evaluating the efficacy of the web-based Cornell Decision Support System (DSS) for managing LB on tomato in the field; and 3) evaluating in vitro and in planta oospore formation by select P. infestans genotypes from Pennsylvania. \n\nAn in vitro mefenoxam sensitivity screening was conducted with a total of 23 isolates collected in 2009, 2011, and 2012 from Pennsylvania. Isolates were inoculated on pea agar plates containing 0, 5, and 100 \u03bcg/ml (ppm) of the active ingredient mefenoxam. The percent growth on the amended plates (5 and 100 ppm) was calculated by comparing them to the non-amended control plates (0 ppm). Colonies that grew less than 40% compared to the control on both mefenoxam concentrations were rated as sensitive. Intermediate resistant (IR) isolates grew more than 40% at 5 ppm, but less than 40% in the 100 ppm treatment. Resistant isolates should grow more than 40% compared to the control at both concentrations. Results indicated that the majority of the US-23 isolates screened were still sensitive to mefenoxam. However, there was a range of sensitivity among isolates, with several (n=4) approaching IR and one categorized as IR category, which may impact mefenoxam use in the future.\n\nTomato field trials were established during 2012 and 2013 at one and two locations each year, respectively. Cultivar, fungicide, and timing of fungicide applications were evaluated as influential factors on LB foliar incidence and severity, as well as fruit incidence. US-23 was the clonal lineage causing disease in both years. The best management practices for reducing LB resulted from the use of a resistant (\u2018Plum Regal\u2019) versus a susceptible (\u2018Mountain Spring\u2019 or \u2018Mountain Fresh Plus\u2019) cultivar, alone or in combination with application timings based of the disease forecasting models. Fungicide also had a significant effect when used alone or in combination with the susceptible cultivar. A greater reduction in disease was observed for chlorothalonil versus copper applications in both cases. The field study results from 2013 showed that the use of the forecasting models, Blitecast and the Cornell DSS, to time fungicide applications reduced the number of applications up to 16% and 50%, respectively, in comparison to a 7-day program, while significantly reducing foliar and fruit disease severity compared to the non-fungicide treated control. \n\nOospore formation was evaluated in vitro and in planta using six A1/A2 crosses from five different clonal lineages: US-23 (A1), New Type \u201cB\u201d (A1), US-8 (A2), US-13 (A2), and US-22 (A2). In vitro inoculations were done on Rye B nutrient media. Oospores were quantified per ml and percent germination for each cross assessed. All crosses were able to form oospores, but some formed significantly more oospores than others. Two crosses (New Type \u201cB\u201dxUS-8, and New Type \u201cB\u201dxUS-22) consistently produced higher numbers of oospores than the other four crosses (>2000 oospores/ml). One cross (US-23xUS-13) consistently produced the fewest number of oospores (<500 oospores/ml). The other three (US-23xUS-22, US-23xUS-8, and New Type \u201cB\u201dxUS-13) had variable yet moderate oospore production between the previous ranges. Of the oospores formed in experiment I, germination was less than 50% in three crosses (New Type \u201cB\u201dxUS-8, US-23xUS-8, and US-23xUS-22) and over 80% for the other three (New Type \u201cB\u201dxUS-22, New Type \u201cB\u201dxUS-13, and US-23xUS-13). In planta evaluation was conducted by inoculating detached tomato leaflets of cultivars containing different resistance genes: \u2018H-3402\u2019 (susceptible), \u2018Plum Regal\u2019 (heterozygous Ph-3), and \u2018Mt. Merit\u2019 (Ph-2 + Ph-3). Only one cross (New Type \u201cB\u201dxUS-13) produced oospores on all three cultivars. Fewer oospores were formed on leaflets from the resistant compared to the susceptible cultivar. It was observed that plant age also affected oospore formation, since a greater number of oospores were recovered from leaflets excised from younger than from older plants.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9983], "author_name_tesi": "Huerta Arredondo, Ilse Alejandra", "last_name_ssi": "Huerta Arredondo", "middle_name_ssi": "Alejandra", "first_name_ssi": "Ilse", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Beth Krueger Gugino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Beth Krueger Gugino, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["late blight", "mefenoxam", "US-23 genotype", "forecast models", "resistant cultivars", "fungicide", "in planta oospore production"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Le livre d\u00e9cadent : \u00e9diter, illustrer, lire.", "id": "25003", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "11010", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Was Decadence a self-conscious artistic movement, or was it a publishing phenomenon \u2013 a movement created by publishers and critics for primarily promotional purposes? This is the question my dissertation seeks to answer. Decadence has typically been understood and studied as a movement of late nineteenth-century French literary and visual artists who found their artistic inspiration in notions of social and political decay. My dissertation, on the other hand, argues that several agents, such as the critics, played a major role in creating what is now thought of as Decadence. This is a major departure from earlier studies of the movement, anchored in literary scholarship, which have focused almost exclusively on writers and their texts, often in isolation from the networks of publishers, critics, and readers who produced, interpreted, and consumed the writers\u2019 work. As a result, these studies have understated the role of cultural and economic factors \u2013 the need to effectively market books, for example, or the demands of a critical readership in shaping the movement. My own work approaches the subject from a novel interdisciplinary perspective. I use a methodology pioneered by scholars working in the fields of book history/print culture studies: a humanities and social sciences-wide project that imagines the book as a physical object, and considers how and why it was produced and circulated. \n\nLooking behind the text, we find a very different picture of Decadence than the one that emerges in the pages of books by decadent authors. Whereas literary scholars have emphasized the elitist pretensions of the authors\u2019 work, a history of the book methodology suggests that Decadence may not have been a coherent intellectual and aesthetic \u2018movement\u2019 at all. The beginning of my work finds four French Decadent writers  \u0336  Joris-Karl Huysmans, Jean Lorrain, Marcel Schwob, and Rachilde  \u0336  complaining to their publishers about inadequate book sales. Decadent writers were in fact very much concerned with earning money and selling a lot of books. This was in contradiction with their elitist pretentions and their desire to write books \u2018for art\u2019s sake\u2019, and in contradiction with what the movement was thought to be about.\n\nIn the next section, I consider how critics shaped the Decadent movement by analyzing how the four writers were discussed in articles and book reviews. The way in which journalists and fellow writers talked about these authors and their books, I argue, was what made them Decadent. If Schwob, Rachilde, Lorrain, and Huysmans did not feel like they belonged to a specific literary movement, the reviews of their books nevertheless referred to their work and sometimes, to their personalities, as \u201cdecadent.\u201d \n\nPublishers and critics, however, were not the only parties contributing to the creation of Decadence. The third part of my dissertation analyzes the role that illustrations in the authors\u2019 books and therefore their creators played in shaping our understanding of Decadence. They did so, I contend, by rendering visually the Decadent themes described in the books. The artists creatively interpreted the texts, allowing readers to escape to a Decadent world of nightmares and dreams, femmes fatales, decay, and death. This world was complimentary, but by no means identical, to the textual world of Decadence: writers and illustrators interpreted and rendered differently what Decadence meant to them. They also used the illustrations to decorate the pages, linking intrinsically image and text, to the point that they become \u201cun tout,\u201d where one cannot read the text without reading the images. This connection enables us to better understand how the decadent aesthetic was diffused.\n\nFinally, my dissertation concludes with an analysis of Decadent reading and its relation to larger transformations in publishing. Like ourselves, people living in fin-de-si\u00e8cle France were experiencing dramatic changes in the availability, price, and format of textual materials. Inexpensive, mass-produced editions of literature severed historical links between beautiful books and beautiful writing. Many elite French readers feared that books would no longer be cherished items and that the act of reading would be cheapened and changed for the worse. In response, Decadent writers developed a decadent way of reading, and their texts explain which books to read or how to read them, in opposition to a vulgarization of reading by the \u2018masses.\u2019 \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10590], "author_name_tesi": "Huet, Helene Irene", "last_name_ssi": "Huet", "middle_name_ssi": "Irene", "first_name_ssi": "Helene", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Willa Zahava Silverman", "Kathryn Marie Grossman", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat", "James L W West Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Willa Zahava Silverman, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathryn Marie Grossman, Committee Member", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Committee Member", "James L W West Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Decadence", "Joris-Karl Huysmans", "Jean Lorrain", "Rachilde", "Marcel Schwob", "Book History"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Understanding tectonic stress and rock strength in the Nankai Trough accretionary prism, offshore SW Japan ", "id": "27392", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12004", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the orientation and magnitude of tectonic stress in active tectonic margins like subduction zones is important for understanding fault mechanics. In the Nankai Trough subduction zone, faults in the accretionary prism are thought to have historically slipped during or immediately following deep plate boundary earthquakes, often generating devastating tsunamis. I focus on quantifying stress at two locations of interest in the Nankai Trough accretionary prism, offshore Southwest Japan. I employ a method to constrain stress magnitude that combines observations of compressional borehole failure from logging-while-drilling resistivity-at-the-bit generated images (RAB) with estimates of rock strength and the relationship between tectonic stress and stress at the wall of a borehole. This approach is commonly applied in boreholes, and has recently been applied to boreholes in the Nankai Trough. Although other methods of estimating tress magnitude exist (such as leak off tests, anelastic strain recovery, and focal mechanism or fault slip inversion), using compressional borehole breakouts allows for a characterization of stress with depth using commonly measured data.  I use the method to constrain stress at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 808 and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site C0002. Site 808 penetrat\u00aces the frontal thrust offshore Cape Muroto in the toe of the prism in the rupture zone of the 1944 Nankaido earthquake, and Site C0002 penetrates the inner most, deformed portion of the accretionary prism ~30m from the trench above the megasplay fault that slipped coseismically in the 1946 Tonankai Earthquake (both magnitude 8.1+ with large, devastating tsunamis). At Site 808, I consider a range of parameters (assumed rock strength, friction coefficient, breakout width, and fluid pressure) in the method to constrain stress to explore uncertainty in stress magnitudes and discuss stress results in terms of the seismic cycle. I find a combination of increased fluid pressure and decreased friction along the frontal thrust or other weak faults could produce thrust-style failure, without the entire prism being at critical state failure, as other kinematic models of accretionary prism behavior during earthquakes imply. \n \tRock strength is typically inferred using a failure criterion and unconfined compressive strength from empirical relations with P-wave velocity. I minimize uncertainty in rock strength by measuring rock strength in triaxial tests on Nankai core. I find strength of Nankai core is significantly less than empirical relations predict. I create a new empirical fit to our experiments and explore implications of this on stress magnitude estimates. I find using the new empirical fit can decrease stress predicted in the method by as much as 4 MPa at Site C0002. I constrain stress at Site C0002 using geophysical logging data from two adjacent boreholes drilled into the same sedimentary sequence with different drilling conditions in a forward model that predicts breakout width over a range of horizontal stresses (where SHmax is constrained by the ratio of stresses that would produce active faulting and Shmin is constrained from leak-off-tests) and rock strength. I then compare predicted breakout widths to observations of breakout widths from RAB images to determine the combination of stresses in the model that best match real world observations. This is the first published method to constrain both stress and strength simultaneously. I find that stress is in the normal regime and approaches the strike slip regime with depth and rock strength, in lower P-wave rock, is comparable to existing empirical relations of P-wave velocity and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and laboratory strength experiments on Nankai core; However, in high P-wave velocity rock, our strength constraints are lower than indicated by empirical relations of P-wave and UCS, suggesting there should be more thought given to employing these relations in high P-wave sediments in the Nankai trough.  I find that stress change needed to produce active thrust faulting at Site C0002 is on the order of 12 MPa. \n\tFinally, I explore uncertainty in rock behavior during compressional breakout formation using a finite element model (FEM) that predicts Biot poroelastic changes in fluid pressure in rock adjacent to the borehole upon its excavation and explore the effect this has on rock failure. I test a range of permeability and rock stiffness. I find that when rock stiffness and permeability are in the range of what exists at Nankai, pore fluid pressure increase +/- 45\u00b0 from Shmin and can lead to weakening of wall rock and a wider compressional failure zone than what would exist at equilibrium conditions. In a case example at, we find this can lead to an overestimate of tectonic stress using compressional failures of ~2 MPa in the area of the borehole where fluid pressure increases. In areas around the borehole where pore fluid decreases (+/- 45\u00b0 from SHmax), the wall rock can strengthen which suppresses tensile failure. \n\tThe implications of this research is that there are many potential pitfalls in the method to constrain stress using borehole breakouts in Nankai Trough mudstone, mostly due to uncertainty in parameters such as strength and underlying assumptions regarding constitutive rock behavior. More laboratory measurement and/or models of rock properties and rock constitutive behavior is needed to ensure the method is accurately providing constraints on stress magnitude.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11438], "author_name_tesi": "Huffman, Katelyn Allison", "last_name_ssi": "Huffman", "middle_name_ssi": "Allison", "first_name_ssi": "Katelyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Demian Saffer", "Chris Marone", "Donald Myron Fisher", "Derek Elsworth", "Maureen Feineman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Demian Saffer, Dissertation Advisor", "Chris Marone, Committee Member", "Donald Myron Fisher, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Maureen Feineman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nankai Trough", "in situ stress", "unconfined compressive strength", "borehole breakout", "IODP", "poroelastic FEM"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Understanding Student Problem Solving in Organic Chemistry", "id": "14477mkh201", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14477", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to better inform the Chemical Education community regarding the struggles that students face when problem solving in organic chemistry.

With an increased focus on climate change education in the United States, more research on the teaching and learning of this problem in science classrooms is occurring (e.g. Arslan, Cigdemoglu, & Moseley, 2012; Svihla & Linn, 2012). However, even though people experience a range of emotions about global problems like climate change (Hicks & Holden, 2007; Ojala, 2012; Rickinson, 2001), little attention is given to their emotions about the problem in science classrooms. Because emotions are evaluative (Boler, 1999; Keltner & Gross, 1999), they provided a lens for understanding how students engage personally with climate change. In this study, I drew from sociolinguistics, social psychology, and the sociology of emotions to examine a) the social interactions that allowed for emotional expressions to be constructed and b) the ways in which pre-service elementary teachers constructed emotional expressions about climate change in a science course. Three overall findings emerged: 1) emotions provided a means of understanding how students\u2019 conceptualized climate to be relevant to their lives, 2) emotional expressions and the aboutness of these expressions indicated that the students conceptualized climate change as distanced, both temporally and spatially, and 3) although most emotional constructions were distanced, there were multiple instances of emotional expressions in which students took climate change personally. Following a discussion of the findings, implications, limitations, and directions for future research are also described.

Specifically, this study considers how members of the network negotiated their experiences in community through social media, and what this means for art education in the twenty-first century. \n\t\nAs Internet technologies are being used more frequently, in more ways, by more people every day, teaching professionals need a more comprehensive understanding of how and why social media are being used and what this means for teaching and learning. This understanding is especially important for art education as a field that encompasses the study of material and visual cultures, particularly since these cultures have become increasingly digital and virtual. \n\t\nThis study was informed by activity theory, cyber-ethnography, and information visualization, as well as by research on social media and pedagogy. For the purpose of excavating characteristics of the social network as both a previously unexplored landscape and cultural group, I collected data for the study on a daily basis over the course of five months through questionnaire responses from members of the social network, observations of the publicly visible activity happening in the social network, and analytics reports of the publicly invisible activity happening in the social network. \n\t\nI then processed these data into visual and conceptual models of community activity over time using iterative, layered, descriptive, inferential, qualitative analyses. The findings from this study characterize the members of the network and their interactions in the network. They include information about changes in the size and demographic properties of the social network over time, as well as trends on when, how, and why members utilized the social network.\n\t\nMy discussion of these findings culminates in the definition of cybernetic cultural experience, cybernetic cultural systems, and pedagogies of convenience, relevance, engagement, and possibility, which together outline the novel idea of cybernetic cultural art education. This idea reflects the relationships perceived within the framework of contemporary techno-cultural spaces beyond the contexts of formal schooling, and provides a new model for understanding them.  \n\t\nThe importance of this study is that it maps a previously unmapped space for networking around art to represent the socially mediated activity through which members of an affinity group participated in opportunities for learning about art. By doing that, this study helps us understand current and potential educational experiences mediated by social technologies beyond school, and opens up opportunities for further exploration of cybernetic cultural art education.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8374], "author_name_tesi": "Hughes, Heather Bette", "last_name_ssi": "Hughes", "middle_name_ssi": "Bette", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine M Thompson", "Christine M Thompson", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius", "Keith D Bailey", "Scott P Mcdonald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christine M Thompson, Dissertation Advisor", "Christine M Thompson, Committee Chair", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius, Committee Member", "Keith D Bailey, Committee Member", "Scott P Mcdonald, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Activity Theory", "Art Education", "Cyber-Ethnography", "Information Visualization", "Social Media"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Spontaneous Overflow: Internalization and Excess in British Romanticism", "id": "23252", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10701", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Spontaneous Overflow fixates on comic corporeality in the literature of British Romanticism: the bodily movements and moments that make the Romantic Movement move.

A typical experiment generates hundreds or thousands of images of motor assays, and each assay can contain many tens of fluorescent particles that must be localized so that individual motors can be tracked from one image to the next. Previous approaches to processing these images were more algorithmic than statistical, and those approaches typically require human intervention. We address these problems by developing science-informed stochastic models for two types of images: those that use green fluorescent proteins (GFP), and those that use quantum dots. The resulting models permit fully likelihood-based inference for particle count and location. Both procedures are computationally efficient. The procedure for GFP images is fully automatic, while the procedure for quantum dot images requires only a training run on a suitable image.\n\nA kinesin can be furnished with extended neck linkers, i.e., longer ``legs.\" This modification alters the behavior of the motor, most notably by permitting variable-length steps. We develop renewal-reward type models to describe the stepping of kinesins with extended neck linkers, and present corresponding matrix computational frameworks for conducting computer experiments. This matrix computational approach is much faster than previous Monte Carlo approaches and does not introduce sampling variability. We were able to use the approach to explain important experimental data and to lend support to one of several competing physical models for the neck linker.\n\nPart II: Non-Gaussian Areal Data\n\t\nNon-Gaussian spatial data are common in many disciplines. When fitting spatial regressions for such data, one needs to account for dependence to ensure reliable inference for the regression coefficients. Two models commonly used for spatial regression on a lattice are the Markov random field model, or automodel, and the spatial generalized linear mixed model (SGLMM), which embeds a Gaussian Markov random field within a hierarchical model. Although these models have long histories and are very widely used, they pose serious theoretical and computational difficulties: (1) for both classes of models, the regression estimates are uninterpretable due to spatial confounding; (2) for automodels, the intractable normalizing function makes maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference very challenging; and (3) for the SGLMM, the highly correlated and high-dimensional spatial random effects make computation very challenging. For a reparameterized version of the autologistic model, we develop maximum likelihood and Bayesian inferential approaches based on Monte Carlo maximum likelihood (MCML) and an auxiliary-variable MCMC algorithm, both of which employ perfect sampling. This approach addresses computational difficulties while simultaneously resolving interpretability issues. For the SGLMM, we introduce a novel reparameterization based on the underlying graph and demonstrate via extensive simulation studies that our approach alleviates spatial confounding and speeds computation by greatly reducing the dimension of the spatial random effects.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12798], "author_name_tesi": "Hughes, John ", "last_name_ssi": "Hughes", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Fricks", "Murali Haran", "William O.

Environmental enrichment (EE) has been introduced at increasing levels into laboratory animal programs in recent years and is being applied to species (e.g. rodents) other than non-human primates, for which it is currently required by law.  EE is defined as any modification in the environment of captive animals that seeks to enhance their physical and psychological well-being by providing stimuli that meet their species-specific needs. \n\tThe initial research use of EE was to understand how spatial learning molds the brain, but has since changed to its current purpose which is to improve the                        welfare of laboratory animals.  Environmental conditions such as housing and husbandry have a major impact on laboratory animals throughout their life and could thereby influence the outcome of animal-based experiments.  Exactly what type of impact has yet to be determined because only a few objective studies have been conducted to determine the effects of EE on the overall well-being of an animal.  The rationale for this thesis is based on the fact that EE is being increasingly introduced into animal housing without sufficient objective data regarding its impact on a variety of psychological and physiological parameters.\n\tThis study objectively evaluated the effect of EE on the immune response to and pathogenicity of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in both group- and singly-housed mice.  The long-term goal of this project is to expand our knowledge of the relationship between EE and physiological parameters associated with the bi-directional communication that exists among the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems.  \nOur hypothesis was that environmental enrichment (EE) decreases stress and enhances the murine immune response to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, which together, in turn, decreases the HSV-associated pathogenesis in both the periphery and the central nervous system.\n\tThe overall objective of this study was to determine how EE modulates both immune function and susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in mice subjected to either group- or singly-housed conditions.  This study utilized 8-12-week old C57BL/6 male mice intranasally infected with HSV-1.  Measures of serum corticosterone were determined in EE and non-enriched (NE) mice both group- and singly-housed as well as both pre- and post-HSV-1 infection.  Measures of HSV-specific immune function were evaluated at 7 days post-infection, the time of the peak of the immune response in this model of HSV infection.      \n\tWe concluded that although enrichment alone does not have any significant effect on corticosterone (CORT) levels either pre- or post-infection, the HSV-1 infection itself reduces serum CORT levels.  This reduction in CORT may possibly be due to the infection itself down-regulating corticosterone levels in order to allow for a stronger  overall immune response.  Also, since none of the CORT levels were outside of the normal baseline range for non-stressed mice, we confirmed that EE can be added to the mouse\u2019s cage without causing stress.  A common trend was noted in the immune responses of both the group-housed mice and singly-housed mice.  In the group-housed mice, there was a decreased immune response in the superficial cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) of EE mice as compared to the NE singly-housed mice.  In the singly-housed mice, there was trend seen indicating an increased immune response in the CLNs and MLNs of EE mice as compared to NE mice.  These observations support the overall conclusion that EE does not cause stress nor significantly alters certain immune parameters except for in the MLNs in the group-housed mice where there was a significant decrease in CD8+ gB498-505+ cells.\nInformation regarding usefulness, advantages, disadvantages, and current literature should be collected about a specific enrichment device before it is added to a cage as it may be deemed an extra variable in an experimental study.  However, its use should not be excluded from normal husbandry because it may have many benefits and provide an excellent means by which to mimic species-specific behavior.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3751], "author_name_tesi": "Hughes, LaTesa J", "last_name_ssi": "Hughes", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "LaTesa", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Laboratory Animal Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Harold Bonneau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Harold Bonneau, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Environmental Enrichment", "HSV", "immune response", "pathogenesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Individual and Contextual Socioeconomic Status and Community Satisfaction", "id": "15733", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8033", "abstract_tesi": "This study utilizes the Pew Research Center\u2019s 2008 survey on Social and Demographic Trends to examine both individual and contextual socioeconomic status in relation to community satisfaction.  My focus on socioeconomic diversity, a measure of contextual socioeconomic status, allows for the examination of two components of satisfaction: preferences and experiences.  Specifically, I ask: Who wants socioeconomic diversity?  Who has socioeconomic diversity?  And who is satisfied?  \nI find that higher socioeconomic status, in the form of education, is associated with having a preference for socioeconomic diversity.  In addition, U.S. born respondents and those who report higher levels of religiosity and liberalism are more likely to prefer diversity.  Having a preference for diversity, however, is not significantly related to living in a more socioeconomically diverse community.  Having more education and income increases the likelihood of living in a diverse community when socioeconomic diversity is operationalized as educational or income diversity.   Control variables such as racial/ethnic minority status, political liberalism, and religiosity are also strong predictors of socioeconomic diversity.  The relationships between individual characteristics and socioeconomic diversity change drastically when occupational diversity is considered, suggesting that there is a substantive difference between educational or income diversity and occupational diversity.  Finally, the study reveals that both individual (education and income) and contextual (percent unemployment) socioeconomic measures are associated with community satisfaction.

Accumulations of gene mutations in melanocytes initiate cells to gain the ability to grow abnormally to develop into malignant melanomas.  However, these genetic changes in the cell do not only alter the properties of tumor cells itself but also interact with extracellular surrounding of the tumor cell-called the tumor microenvironment.  The microenvironment includes extracellular matrix, stromal fibroblasts, infiltrating immune cells, the blood and lymphatic networks.  Dynamic bidirectional interaction between the cancer cell and tumor microenvironment can produce a variety of growth factors, cytokines and matrix-degrading enzymes that enhance melanoma development.  Therefore, research understanding the complex networks between melanoma cells and the surrounding microenvironment will lead to discovery of novel therapeutics for cancer prevention and treatment. \n\nThe focus of this dissertation is to identify alterations in melanomas that influence the tumor microenvironment to promote melanoma progression.  Under normal conditions, type &#921; collagen, which constitutes ~90% of the dermal extracellular matrix maintains tissue integrity and homeostasis.  However, for tumorigenesis to occur, cells need to uncouple this regulation in order to proliferate and survive under condition in which cells would not normally thrive. In the first part of the dissertation, I have studied how the loss of KLF6 gene located, on chromosome 10, uncouples the cancer cell\u2019s communication with collagen I thereby enabling proliferation.  The angiogenesis process is another key process that involves cross-talks between melanoma cells and the surrounding microenvironment.  Angiogenesis creates new blood vessels from existing vasculature to provide tumor oxygen and nutrient supply and removal of waste products to grow beyond a certain size.  In the second part of this dissertation, I have investigated the role of MIC-1, which is secreted by melanomas, in angiogenesis its involvement in promoting tumor growth and metastasis.  In the third part, I have identified that IL-8 secretion by melanoma cells functions to increase neutrophils-melanoma interaction, which aids melanoma cell adherence to the endothelium thereby promoting metastasis.  The major findings are summarized in the following:\n\n1.  Loss of Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 6 uncouples signaling from the collagen I rich extracellular environment of the skin to promote early melanoma development. \n\nEarly stage melanoma cells need to overcome inhibitory signals present in skin in order to invade into the deeper dermal layers, ultimately culminating in metastasis.  To identify genes regulating this process, fragments of 10p15, a chromosomal region frequently lost in early melanoma, were transferred into melanoma cells.  Significantly smaller tumors formed by these cells having fewer proliferating cells and alterations in extracellular matrix organization resulting in a phenotype resembling more benign-like tumors with looping collagen I surrounding nests of tumor cells.  To identify the gene on 10p15, an in vitro collagen I gel model that mimicked the skin microenvironment was established by plating cells onto type I collagen in culture dishes.  As observed in animals, type I collagen inhibited proliferation of melanoma cells containing the 10p15 region but not those lacking it.  In contrast, growth on plastic or anchorage independent growth did not differ.  KLF6 (Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 6), which is functionally inactivated in several human cancers was present on the transferred 10p15 fragment suggesting it may be the putative candidate suppressor gene.  Introduction of ectopically expressed KLF6 into melanoma cells reduced growth on type I collagen mediated by decreasing levels of pErk and cyclin D1.  Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of KLF6 in cells containing the transferred 10p15 enhanced proliferation on collagen I.  Finally, high KLF6 staining by immunohistochemistry was observed in nevi surrounded by the type I collagen-rich dermis.  In more advanced melanocytic lesions, KLF6 expression was only present at the periphery of tumor nodules but not in the center and was largely absent in metastatic melanomas.  In protein lysates, KLF6 protein expression was found to be lacking in 100% of advanced stage patient tumors further supporting a role in melanoma development.  These data suggest that KLF6 communicates directly with type I collagen of the dermis to inhibit cellular proliferation mediated by decreased MAP kinase-signaling.  Advanced melanomas lacked KLF6 expression, functioning to uncouple the cancer cell\u2019s communication with the collagen I rich environment of the skin thereby enabling proliferation by promoting increased MAP kinase signaling.  Restoration of functional KLF6 in early melanocytic may be a useful strategy to prevent or treat melanoma.\n\n2.  Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 regulated the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of melanoma.  \n\nMelanoma cells secrete various growth factors and cytokines that can deregulate surrounding cells, which are important for promoting proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis.  Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), a transforming growth factor-&#946;  superfamily cytokine, is elevated in blood serum as well as in cells of cancers patients, but its function in melanoma development remains unknown.  This study unravels the role played by MIC-1 in melanoma development.  Melanoma patient tumors and serum were examined for MIC-1 levels by western blot analysis and ELISA.  MIC-1 protein expression was significantly elevated in 67% of melanoma tumors compared to normal melanocytes.  Furthermore, melanoma patients had high MIC-1 concentrations in blood serum ranging from 500 pg/mL to 3000 pg/mL whereas control blood donors had low MIC-1 concentrations ranging from 100-400 pg/mL.  MIC-1 was found to be regulated by the most mutated gene in melanomas called V600EB-Raf.  Knockdown of mutant V600EB-Raf using siRNA decreased expression and secretion of MIC-1 from melanoma cells by 3-4 fold.  However, decreased MIC-1 protein expression did not significantly alter melanoma growth in vitro, but dramatically inhibited tumor development by ~3-fold.  To identify the mechanism action of MIC-1 for promoting tumor development, rates of tumor angiogenesis, cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed in time and size matched melanoma tumors following siRNA-mediated inhibition of MIC-1.  Increased tumor angiogenesis was identified as the key event leading to tumor development by MIC-1.  Furthermore, role of MIC-1 on tumor angiogenesis was validated by treating chick chorioallantoic membrane of developing embryos and Matrigel plug in vivo assay with recombinant MIC-1.  MIC-1 significantly induced angiogenesis by ~2-4-fold.  In conclusion, mutant V600EB-Raf signaling increases MIC-1 expression and secretion to enhance angiogenesis and thereby promote melanoma development.  Thus, MIC-1 may be a useful prognostic marker as well as an important therapeutic target for melanoma treatment.\n\n3. Reducing Interleukin-8 secretion from melanoma cells disrupts interaction with neutrophils thereby decreasing metastasis development.\n\n\tCirculating tumor cells are frequently trapped in lung capillaries but only a minority form metastases.  To unravel involvement of immune cells in lung metastasis development, human melanoma cells were intravenously injected into the lateral tail vein of nude mice leading to entrapment of many cancer cells in the lungs.  However, 24 hours later very few remained in the lungs.  In contrast, injection of human neutrophils an hour after tumor cell injection, increased cancer cell retention by ~2-fold.  Entrapped metastatic melanoma cells were found to produce and secrete high levels of a cytokine called IL-8, attracting neutrophils to transiently held melanoma cells and increasing &#946;2 integrin expression on neutrophils by 75-100%.  ICAM-1 on melanoma cells and &#946;2 integrin on neutrophils interacted to promote tethering of melanoma cells to the vascular endothelium via the neutrophil.  Decreasing IL-8 secretion from melanoma cells lowered extracellular levels by 20-50%, decreased &#946;2 integrin on neutrophils by ~50% and reduced neutrophil-mediated extravasation by 25-60%, resulting in ~50% fewer melanoma cells being tethered to endothelium and retained in the lung.  As a result, transendothelial migration and lung metastasis development decreased by ~50%.  Thus, therapeutically targeting IL-8 in melanoma cells has the potential to decrease metastasis development by disrupting interaction with neutrophils.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5950], "author_name_tesi": "Huh, Sung Jin ", "last_name_ssi": "Huh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sung Jin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gavin Peter Robertson", "Gavin Peter Robertson", "Henry Joseph Donahue", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\""], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gavin Peter Robertson, Dissertation Advisor", "Gavin Peter Robertson, Committee Chair", "Henry Joseph Donahue, Committee Member", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Member", "\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\", Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["KLF6", "tumor microenvironment", "melanoma", "IL-8", "MIC-1"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Binary-Level Type Inference using Datalog", "id": "15197abh7", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15197", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Doop framework is evidence that the Datalog programming language can be used to implement entire non-trivial program analyses while maintaining high precision and scalability.

For addicted individuals and their families, the behavioral manifestations and long-term health consequences associated with opioid dependence are both baffling and disconcerting. As in all addictions, treatment of prescription opioid dependence is extremely challenging due to high relapse rates. Identifying sensitive and specific markers of relapse risk is critical in (1) characterizing risk factors that should be targets of treatment, and (2) categorizing high risk individuals that may require further treatment for opioid dependence. Self-report measures have not been reliable in predicting treatment outcome, and the entire field lacks a gold standard in regard to assessment of relapse risk in treatment seeking individuals. \n\tIdentifying biological markers of relapse risk is critical in recognizing high risk individuals that may require extended residential treatment for opioid dependence. To address this issue, we conducted a study at the Caron Treatment Center in Wernersville, PA which sought to establish a predictive model for relapse risk using prefrontal cortical activity. Furthermore, our study sought to delineate the course of reregulation of biological and psychological factors relevant to prescription opioid dependence. The study sample consisted of 76 patients and 40 age/gender matched healthy controls. Participants in the study provided self-report data about their affective state and personality traits, gave salivary cortisol samples, and also performed a risky decision-making and drug cue paradigm adapted for functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We collected repeated measures on a subset of 22 patients that stayed in residential treatment beyond 28 days. We also collected information regarding relapse for 90 days post-discharge from residential treatment.  \n\tOpioid dependent patients exhibited dysregulation of a triad of relapse risk factors when compared to controls. These factors include increased risky decision-making, anhedonia, and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We found that patients that relapse to opioids display differential neural activity in the prefrontal cortex compared to patients that remain abstinent. More specifically, neuroimaging results showed that, during a risky decision-making task, neural activity in the ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices are reliable biomarkers of relapse risk. As such, we were able to accurately predict relapse to opioids in the first 90 days post-residential treatment. \n\tThe results from this study improve our understanding of biological indicators of relapse risk in opioid dependent patients. Importantly, our model identifies prefrontal cortex measurements that predict treatment outcome in the first three months post-discharge from residential treatment. Moreover, these data characterize symptomatology during the post-withdrawal state in a way that is both relevant and beneficial to the clinical and scientific communities. Identifying those individuals at heightened relapse risk is extremely important, both in guiding clinicians in determining next level of care, and convincing patients that additional care is warranted. Continued focus on clinically translatable research should seek to develop biotechnologies aimed at improving treatment outcome. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11966], "author_name_tesi": "Huhn, Andrew Stephen", "last_name_ssi": "Huhn", "middle_name_ssi": "Stephen", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott C Bunce"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott C Bunce, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Opioid dependence", "prefrontal cortex", "functional near-infrared spectroscopy", "risky decision making"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Cognitive Framing in Action: The Upper Effect in Bimanual Object Manipulation", "id": "24848", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11190", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cognitive framing effects have been widely reported in high-level decision-making. Here I report how the framing of instructions impacted a physical task. In the experiments to be described here, participants demonstrated a new perceptual-motor phenomenon during a bimanual rotation task. Participants moved a long PVC pipe from one height to another, always turning the pipe 180 degrees. The participants were given instructions verbally in some experiments and non-verbally (only visually) in others.  In Experiment 1, I discovered the upper effect. The term refers to the fact that in the bimanual rotation task that I used, participants rotated the pipe to target positions in such a way that the end of the pipe end to which attention was drawn\u2014what I call the \u201cbusiness\u201d end\u2014was moved through the upper workspace. A priori, it was possible for all the tasks I studied for participants to rely on a default strategy of always turning the pipe clockwise or always turning the pipe counter-clockwise. That is not what they did, however. In Experiment 2, I tested the hypothesis that the upper effect arose because participants sought to exploit gravity. I replicated the upper effect in a new apparatus. In Experiment 3, I tested to see the importance of explicit specifications found in the instructions on the upper effect. I was able to knock out the upper effect when no business end was mentioned. In Experiment 4, I addressed the question of whether the upper effect still held in the absence of verbal instructions. Participants showed the upper effect even more strongly. In Experiment 5, I checked whether the upper effect resulted from participants\u2019 wanting to avoid visual occlusion of the business end by their own arms. Again, participants performed the upper effect.

It binds to the promoter region of eukaryotic genes and facilitates assembly of the transcription initiation machinery, including RNA Polymerase II.  Many proteins interact with TBP to both positively and negatively regulate gene expression.  My thesis utilized genome-wide expression profiling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to define the target genes of, and relationships between, the factors that regulate transcription via TBP.  I found the SAGA and TFIID co-activator complexes, both of which can deliver TBP to promoters, make overlapping contributions to the expression of nearly all yeast genes.  The SAGA complex functions predominantly at ~10% of the genome, targeting genes that contain TATA boxes and are up regulated upon an environmental stress response.  TFIID functions primarily at TATA-less genes, including genes down-regulated upon stress, while playing a predominant role in activation at the remaining 90% of the genome.  The SAGA-dominated genes tend to be coordinately down regulated by a variety of additional transcriptional regulators.  They include Mot1 and the NC2 complex both of which down-regulate transcription primarily at TATA-containing genes, in a manner that often counteracts the positive role of SAGA.  Additionally, Mot1 and NC2 target many of the same genes, whose down-regulation generally requires the combined action of both factors.  Mutations that disrupt repression of transcription via TBP dimerization increase expression of very lowly expressed genes, generally located in subtelomeric regions that are also repressed by chromatin-associated mechanisms.  TBP interactions with DNA are most critical at highly transcribed genes, and the TAF1 N-terminal domain plays a minimal role by itself in gene regulation but is partially redundant with other regulatory factors.

There are many dangerous pathogens and microorganisms that threaten the human cell at all times and without the innate immune response\u2019s recognition of patterns from these pathogens life would not be the same, and perhaps not even possible for humans. In 2011, the Nobel Prize in medicine was awarded to Drs. Bruce Beutler and Jules Hoffmann for their discoveries on the activation of the innate immune system. \nThe protein kinase PKR is an essential protein in the innate immune response that upon recognition of pathogenic patterns is activated and eventually leads to apoptosis of this infected cell. PKR recognizes molecular patterns through unique pathogenic RNA patterns, and classically by long stretches of double-stranded RNA that a virus or other pathogen could release upon infection. It is important that innate immune sensors detect broad non-specific patterns among these pathogens, and in recent years understanding of the mechanism of PKR\u2019s regulation in the cell has grown tremendously. Although classical activation is by long double-stranded RNA, PKR recently has been shown to be more permissive, binding other functional, biological and non-conventional RNAs, as well as some proteins. \nRNA molecules can adopt an array of structures and perform many different functions in the cell. It is important to understand both sides of the interaction between PKR and RNA because they are both functional molecules. Some pathogens are not recognizable by the innate immune response, and it seems as though they have developed a way of disguising themselves from the innate immune sensors. The objective of this thesis is to provide a better understanding on how PKR recognizes a broad spectrum of RNAs and more importantly how it recognizes the difference between self and non-self RNA. \n\tMuch is already known about how PKR recognizes pathogenic RNA from viruses, but recently PKR has been shown to be activated in cells infected with RNA from bacteria.  There are many levels of RNA structure found in the bacterial transcriptome where much of these RNAs regulate genes and functions. It was our hypothesis that PKR activation by bacterial RNA was through these highly structured functional RNAs including riboswitches and ribozymes. Through this idea, I published the first study that a discrete functional bacterial RNA, the trp 5\u2019UTR, which binds a protein (TRAP) and regulates L-tryptophan levels in Bacillus subtilis, potently activates PKR in both ligand (TRAP/L-trp) \u2013free and \u2013bound states. I found that many structural features of this RNA, which are common to functional bacterial RNAs, activated PKR in manners that are typical to PKR activation and that this activity was maintained when lowering Mg2+ concentrations to human physiological conditions, which are known to affect RNA structure. \nI also expanded this into a detailed mechanistic study that different types of functional bacterial RNAs with extensive tertiary structure activate PKR including a riboswitch, a riboswitch-ribozyme, and a ribozyme. I showed that these bacterial RNAs maintain tertiary structure upon binding to PKR and activate PKR as strongly as classical viral dsRNA. A structural investigation by ribonuclease mapping and protein footprinting revealed that PKR is able to dimerize onto the native structures of these bacterial RNAs. Overall, these studies show how PKR acts as a signaling protein for bacteria and suggests the apparent absence for such type of naked RNAs in the human genome in that they would activate innate immunity. \n\tTaking a step back and investigating PKR\u2019s interaction with RNA at the primary and secondary levels of RNA structure led to some findings that helped us understand how PKR can detect a broad range of RNA structure. At the primary level, our lab earlier showed that PKR activation by small single-stranded RNAs that required a 5\u2019-triphosphate. In my work, we hypothesized that PKR had an exclusive method of recognizing such RNAs, but instead our studies revealed that the binding site for 5-triphosphorylated ssRNA overlapped with that of double-stranded RNA but was mutually exclusive from the ATP binding site of PKR. And lastly, some recent discoveries in how PKR interacts with viral RNAs with long extended base-pairing regions and helical deformations, yet still led to PKR activation was further investigated by mechanistically looking at how much helical deformation PKR can handle. \nIn recent years, much has been learned regarding how PKR interacts with many different types of RNA structure and even proteins; however, it is still not well understood how PKR functions in vivo. For this reason, I attempted crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) to gain a library of total RNAs that PKR interacts with in healthy and infected cells, as well as to look at PKR activity in human cells infected with bacteria. Both of these results led to a foundation for how to develop methods to work with PKR in such in vivo systems that can be pursued by future studies in the lab. We made a shift to look at how PKR interacts with RNA in more \u201cin-vivo-like\u201d systems by adding in a molecular crowder or total RNA extracted from E. coli. I found that total E. coli RNA activates PKR potently and this activation surprisingly increases after degrading this RNA down into smaller fragments. \nMy dissertation work has made advancements in the molecular understanding of how PKR and the innate immune system identify the difference between self- and non-self. The classical model of activation of PKR by long-dsRNA has been greatly expanded, and the mechanisms of activation by all levels of RNA in the hierarchy have been investigated.  I have established novel ways in which bacterial RNA is recognized by PKR under in vitro and in vivo-like conditions, which lays the foundation for in vivo studies of these interactions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11661], "author_name_tesi": "Hull, Chelsea Michelle", "last_name_ssi": "Hull", "middle_name_ssi": "Michelle", "first_name_ssi": "Chelsea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

Passengers make up 15 percent of all alcohol-related vehicle fatalities, indicating a significant gap in prevention research. This gap may be due to the paucity of research examining determinants of RWDD.  This dissertation is composed of three empirical papers that examined different predictors of RWDD.  Paper 1 used a dual process behavioral decision-making approach to examine RWDD. Paper 1 results suggest that examining decision-making processes related to both RWDD and viable safe alternatives of RWDD may predict RWDD more comprehensively. Further, all psychosocial variables related to RWDD and alternatives were found to be significantly correlated with all decision-making constructs, indicating they all may be useful targets for change in intervention efforts, especially those with the highest correlations: attitudes, peer injunctive norms, image prototypes, and self-efficacy to use alternatives.  Results from Paper 2 support the hypotheses that parent-student communication of RWDD risks are associated with both decreased risky orientations and increased protective orientations. This supports that Parent Based Interventions (PBIs) may be useful for reducing RWDD behavior.  However, parent-student communication must occur in a manner that students remember and are responsive. Results from Paper 2 also suggest that parents may be most likely to communicate about the risks of RWDD if they think their spouse and other parents like them have similar conversations with their student.  PBIs may be most effective if delivered to both parents or in groups of parents. Paper 3 examined the association between substance use and riding with an alcohol and/or drug impaired driver (RADID) using an event-level design. Results for Paper 3 indicate that probability of RADID increases for students who, on average, engage in polysubstance use.  Probability of RADID also increased as the number of substances used in one occasion increased.  Further, students with average substance use, were more likely to RADID on nights when 3 or more substances were used.  Lastly, results from Paper 3 suggest that using marijuana alone or using alcohol combined with other substances (e.g., tobacco, ADHD medications) increases the likelihood of RADID compared to alcohol use alone.  Future work should test efficacy of PBIs, ecological momentary interventions, and efforts combining different intervention delivery methods to reduce RWDD and RADID.

A grounded theory emerged in alignment with Levin & Nolan\u0081es (2010) notions about classroom management beliefs and practices of education students. Participants emerged from the experience with their initial ideas about classroom management further entrenched in their beliefs and practices, despite receiving detailed written supervisor comments which occasionally conflicted with some of those beliefs. Classroom management \u0081skills. acquired were largely empirical in nature and lacked the kind of generalizability to new situations required to lower the cognitive and affective load of the education students in novel situations. According to sociocultural theory, this indicates a need for a different kind of mediation of students, or at the very least, a more conceptual, scientific presentation of classroom management theory to the WLED students. This raises the question of what kind(s) of instructional interventions could mediate the WLED students to develop more abstract and generalizable notions of classroom management so as to substantially increase the feelings of success of WLED students in their role as teacher and provide more effective instruction, resulting in more effective development of L2 skills on the part of their students.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [25], "author_name_tesi": "Hults, Alaska Black", "last_name_ssi": "Hults", "middle_name_ssi": "Black", "first_name_ssi": "Alaska", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Edward Poehner", "Matthew Edward Poehner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Edward Poehner, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew Edward Poehner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sociocultural theory", "classroom management", "teacher education"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Dialogic Cconstruction of Bilingual Literacies, Disability, and Inclusion by Content-area Teachers", "id": "26251", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11406", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This design research study explores the evolution of four rural Pennsylvanian education professionals\u2019 discourse about their Emergent Bilingual (EB) students over the duration of an eight-week professional development (PD) course.

Thus, the reversal of thermodynamic phase stability for particles with large surface area to volume ratios can be attributed to increased surface energies at the nanoscale. Quantum energy calculations on model anatase and rutile nanoparticles and surfaces revealed that the energy of under-bonded atoms on various crystallographic surfaces, and especially defects at the edges and corners of nanocrystals, were responsible for the stability reversal rather than surface-induced perturbations to the crystal structure.\n\nKinetic modeling of mineral abundance data from the XRD experiments, using a self-authored kinetic fitting program, demonstrated that minerals precipitate from and re-dissolve into solution without undergoing solid state phase transitions. Time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (TR-SAXS) revealed that nanoparticles nucleate and grow rapidly into broad, Gaussian-type particle size distributions, and also showed evidence of oriented aggregation. An analysis of the in situ pH data and XRD data for the co-existing particles revealed the counterintuitive conclusion that precipitation is slower at high Ti4+ concentrations. A crystallization model is proposed based on classical nucleation theory, in which different interfacial energies between the mineral surface and the fluid cause each polymorph to have different activation energies of precipitation. These activation energies scale positively with the saturation state of the fluid.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1531], "author_name_tesi": "Hummer, Daniel Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Hummer", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney", "Peter J Heaney", "James David Kubicki", "Lee Kump", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter J Heaney, Committee Chair", "James David Kubicki, Committee Member", "Lee Kump, Committee Member", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["anatase", "rutile", "titanium oxide", "titanium dioxide", "crystallization", "precipitation", "time-resolved X-ray diffraction", "time-resolved small angle X-ray scattering", "nanoparticles", "phase stability reversal", "surface energy", "nucleation", "crystal growth", "hydrolysis", "global optimization", "kinetic fitting", "kinetic modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Modified Base Stock Policies for Capacitated Systems with Multiple Suppliers\n", "id": "8226", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2970", "abstract_tesi": "In this research, effective inventory models are developed to manage single-product supply chain systems in which there are two capacitated suppliers with certain attributes.

In Case 1, the suppliers are distinguished by one supplier having a lower setup cost, a higher unit price, and a higher capacity. In Case 2, the suppliers are distinguished by one supplier having a lower setup cost, a lower unit price, and a lower capacity. For each policy, we develop a set of three order point levels to guide the manufacturer on how to order. The manufacturer can either order from the first supplier, the second supplier, both, or neither. For each case, we develop a Markov chain model to determine the inventory shortfall distribution, which represents the number of units in inventory below a target inventory level. The shortfall distribution is independent of the target inventory level and is used to derive the optimal ordering policy for the inventory system. This work provides an efficient way to solve for the parameters in the problem.\nThe objective of this research is to develop inventory models that minimize total expected cost per period to the manufacturer. The costs include holding cost, backorder cost, and ordering cost. A method to approximate the cost function with a quadratic least squares fitting is shown, which can be extended upon for future research. We provide numerical examples for each case in which we compare the results to a single-level reorder policy.

The four colleges exemplify the effects of the war on student enrollment and the financial condition of liberal arts colleges. The extension of admissions opportunities, the adoption of war-time curricula, and the militarization of campus illustrate a few of the adaptive policies implemented at the institutions during World War II. The experiences of the four colleges also typify the role of institutional identity and the implications of institutional leadership, culture, and mission for decision-making during periods of crisis like World War II and its aftermath. Institutional adaptation during and after the war and the effects of World War II on institutional identity reveals the influence of the war on the transition from pre-war to post-war private, liberal arts college.

Its findings suggest that Internet development in Taiwan is following similar patterns and exhibiting many characteristics found at the global level, including the role of the state and corporation sector in commercializing the Internet. The commercialization of the Internet has inspired a trend toward concentration of ownership in Internet-related industries which include media, telecommunications and information technology. This study also finds disparities in Internet use a reflection of existing social inequality in terms of income, education and location. The divide is further strengthened by information policy that tends to favor the interests of big corporations and ignore the needs of the poor. \nFurthermore, this study utilizes critical theories of the capitalist state to analyze information and industrial policies in Taiwan. It finds the role of the Taiwanese state has been transformed from a developmental state which led the nation\u00a1\u00a6s progress, to a capitalist state tending to yield to the interests of the capitalist class. This transformation signifies the decline of the state\u00a1\u00a6s autonomy, constrained by both internal and external political-economic factors.

Although studies so far provide a fundamental understanding of individual-level hazard preparedness, most of them overlook that, in many cases, hazard preparedness is a household-level decision-making activity involving interactions between household members (or intra-household dynamics), especially members with different gender. \nThis dissertation thus aims at uncovering how intra-household dynamics and gender dynamics affect household natural hazard preparedness. It applies a mixed-method approach with dyadic design, using household hurricane preparedness as a case study and targeting married, heterosexual couples of Sarasota County, FL. This study quantitatively probes how intra-household variables and other dyadic variables influence household hurricane preparedness, investigates how the preparedness intentions between couples possibly affects household hurricane preparedness, and attempts to understand if the head of household or person with more financial resources between the dyad makes decisions on household hurricane preparedness. It also qualitatively explores the process of decision-making regarding household hurricane preparedness and how divisions of household labor may affect preparedness. An online survey, in which both husbands and wives responded together and independently, is first conducted, followed by semi-structured interviews with couples. Results suggest that intra-household and gender dynamics influence decision-making on household hurricane preparedness. Most couples indicate that household hurricane preparedness is a joint decision-making process. Approaches to searching for and evaluating hurricane information and levels of preparedness vary with intra-household traits, such as gender role and conflict-resolution strategies. In addition, differences in preparedness intentions between husbands and wives suggest that wives are more likely to take more passive roles in preparing for hurricanes than their husbands do, and gendered division of labor affects how important the couples think preparedness activities are.

This study examines the applicability and validity of a reliable questionnaire of household labor division and support (Who Does What?; Cowan & Cowan, 1988) in a predominantly low-income sample of urban-dwelling African American mothers with preterm infants.  It was hypothesized that when the division of labor in household and child care tasks was satisfactory (according to mothers), relationship quality and parenting self-efficacy would be high or increase over time and parental stress levels would be low or decrease over time.\nParticipants were African American mothers of premature infants recruited into a larger study (Preterm Infant Development Study), recruited from four hospitals in the Baltimore/Washington, DC area.  Of 173 mothers recruited, 79 who were married or living with partner served as subjects, and assessments occurred at 32-36, 40-44, 54-58, and 94-98 weeks post-conceptual age for these analyses. Scales used included the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (Spanier, 1976), Parenting Stress Index \u2013 Short Form (PSI-SF, Abidin, 1995), Maternal Self-Efficacy Scale (Teti & Gelfand, 1991), and Who Does What? scale (WDW; Cowan et al., 1978).  The WDW yields discrepancy scores between what the mother wishes to have and what she actually experiences, in terms of division of labor.  The greater the discrepancy, the less satisfied she is with the support she receives. \nAlphas were calculated for the WDW from their respective time points; reliabilities ranged from .70 to .90. WDW labor division discrepancy scores and two of the maternal functioning variables showed strong associations at both contemporaneous and distal time points in predicted directions.

CTC reduction was investigated in Escherichia coli and shown to correlate with growth rate, suggesting it may provide more insight into a cell\u00a1\u00afs metabolic state. E. coli cells were cultured at different temperatures to induce different growth rates. Cells at these different growth rates were sampled at identical optical densities, incubated for varying lengths of time with CTC, and then either analyzed in a spectrofluorometric plate reader or counterstained with DAPI and visualized with epifluorescent microscopy. By assessing the change in the fraction of CTC(+) cells in the total cell population over incubation time, as well as the change in intensity of fluorescence of those cells, rates of CTC reduction were determined.

Moreover, CTC reduction rate increased relative to an increase in growth rate, most noticeably when determined from averages of single-cell intensities.\nThe second study centered on the variance of electron acceptor reduction with respect to\ntemperature in Geobacter sulfurreducens, a species that has received much attention due its\nability to transfer electrons to electrodes.

The temperature dependence of G. sulfurreducens when reducing\ndifferent electron acceptors was investigated. Experiments were carried out in both suspended\ncultures and MEC anode biofilms. In suspended-culture tests, G. sulfurreducens was grown with acetate as the electron donor and either fumarate or ferric citrate as electron acceptor at different temperatures (4C, 20C, 30C, and 37C). Fumarate reduction and ferric iron reduction were monitored. Cells from fumarate cultures were incubated with CTC and visualized with epifluorescent microscopy to further assess activity. In MECs, G. sulfurreducens was fed MEC\nmedium containing acetate as an electron donor; a carbon paper anode served as the insoluble\nelectron acceptor. Reactors were operated at 20C, 30C, and 37C, with voltage monitored\nacross an external resistor (10 ohms). Voltage was applied (0.6 V) to promote hydrogen evolution at the cathode. Results from suspended-culture tests showed increasing fumarate reduction with increasing temperature, while ferric iron reduction and CTC reduction were greater at 30C compared to 20C and 37C. MEC operation at 37C resulted in the highest peak current (70 A/m3), hydrogen production (93.5 mL), hydrogen recovery (rH2 of 91%) and Coulombic efficiency (90%) when compared to reactors operated at 20C and 30C. These results suggest that 1) the temperature dependence of electron acceptor reduction by G. sulfurreducens depends on which electron acceptor is present, and 2) care must be taken when basing reactor operating conditions on results obtained from suspended-culture optimization.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2189], "author_name_tesi": "Hunt, Heather ", "last_name_ssi": "Hunt", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Regan", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Regan, Thesis Advisor", "John Michael Regan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Geobacter", "microbial electrolysis cell", "CTC"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Visual Arts and Older Adult Learners in Retirement", "id": "16013", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7952", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the role of visual arts and its impact on successful aging and older adult learners in retirement.   Retirement is one of the most important economic, psychological, and social transitions in most people\u2019s lives. Longevity has increased in the last sixty years such that in 2010, the average person can expect to spend anywhere from 15 to 30 plus years in retirement. There are 78 million baby boomers, ranging in age currently from 48 - 65, who have recently started retiring and will continue leaving the workforce over the next decade.  They will likely live more of their lives in retirement than the previous generation.  In the current struggling economy, the new face of retirement for many may likely be part-time labor and full- time engagement in other activities.  So what does retirement mean to older adult learners? Retirement is generally understood as a multidimensional construct that is shaped by biological, educational, social and cultural factors; and, thus, can be defined in many ways.  Retirees in this study are creating pieces of visual art - be it sculpture, sewing, knitting, paintings, photographs - they are creating tangible products.  \nThe study was guided by the following research questions: What do older, retired adults perceive as the purpose of engaging in the visual arts? How does evidence of the role of creativity in successful aging inform educators in supporting life-long learning for retirees? And what is the relationship between engagement in the visual arts, generativity and successful aging?\nThree theoretical frameworks were utilized:  successful aging, generativity and art as a way of knowing.  Together, these concepts provide a robust and holistic lens for which to view the experiences of these older adult learners. The first conceptual framework is successful aging (Rowe & Kahn, 1998), which attempts to explain why some people age better than others.  The second theory which is framed by human development and is seen as a positive aspect of healthy psychosocial development and aging is defined by the theory of generativity. This study also drew on the concept of art as a way of knowing which focuses on the ways in which adults learned through viewing and creating art.   A legitimate need is further investigation into art as a way of knowing for adult populations.  In the adult education literature, multiple ways of knowing have been reviewed and discussed. Creating artwork is a way of nonintellectual knowing, through emotion and body.  \nThis study utilized narrative inquiry, an interpretive methodology which was appropriate for this study because it involved the collection of people\u2019s stories to explore their thoughts, feelings and experiences in relation to the research questions. I conducted in-depth face to face semi-structured interviews with 10 older adult learners in the Spring of 2012.  I utilized a guided approach and audio recorded and transcribed all interviews.\nThese retired participants shared how engagement in art helped them both physically and emotionally. Reasons why these older adults are engaged in art is because creativity can help people find joy, camaraderie and meaning and purpose as they move toward and through retirement.   Other findings include that the participants felt that art was both a solitary and social activity; the participants were uncertain of their identities as artists based on how they produced their art; that art created a space for new learning and that there are degrees of generativity.  The findings have implications for incorporating art in adult development, adult education, and retirement.\n\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7905], "author_name_tesi": "Hunt, Irma L", "last_name_ssi": "Hunt", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Irma", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Ed Taylor", "Dr Ed Taylor", "Carolyn June Grasse Bachman", "Dr Thomas Bettinger", "Felicia Lynne Brown Haywood", "Esther Susana Prins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Ed Taylor, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Ed Taylor, Committee Chair", "Carolyn June Grasse Bachman, Committee Member", "Dr Thomas Bettinger, Committee Member", "Felicia Lynne Brown Haywood, Committee Member", "Esther Susana Prins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["older adults", "generativity", "art as a way of knowing", "visual arts", "retirement", "older learners", "adult education"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Effect of Weather Variables on Decomposition and Time of Death Estimation in Two Habitats in Central Pennsylvania\n\n", "id": "11271", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4919", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this thesis was to look at the application of forensic entomology in Central Pennsylvania by looking at the meteorological factors involved in post-mortem interval estimation (PMI) during both the summer and winter months.

Soil and maggot mass temperature are also important factors in obtaining greater accuracy in PMI estimations as well as wintertime survival of larvae.

Adult women, who constitute the majority of distance learners, may\nexperience an irony as they undertake studies away from the traditional classroom setting.\nAttracted by the greater convenience of online courses that can be completed at home or work,\nthey must wrestle more directly than their traditional counterparts with the competing demands of school, work, and family. In the rush to recruit these students, without implementing systematic student support, employing appropriate instructional design, and providing relevant faculty development, institutions risk sacrificing program quality and incurring the significant hidden cost of higher attrition. While no definitive national statistics exist on what percentage of distance learners complete their courses, some believe it is 10 to 20 percentage points lower than for traditional courses.\n\nResearchers studying persistence have traditionally focused on campus-based students.\nTheorists have investigated how students integrate themselves into academic environments, yet seldom how adults studying at a distance integrate academics into their personal and professional lives. To address that gap, this study explored how seven adult women pursuing an online degree in healthcare sought to integrate their new learner role into their lives during their first course of study. The main research question was, \u201cWhat is the process by which adult women learners add the online learner role to their lives?\u201d In addition, \u201cWhich factors contribute to the ways in which these women negotiate the strain and conflict of adding the online learner role?\u201d was posed as a sub-question.

All seven participants reported using Type III coping (reactive role behavior) while juggling the demands of\ndaily life before enrolling in their courses. After adding the learner role to their lives, however, the women demonstrated that Type III coping was a necessary but insufficient strategy for meeting demands across their expanded role sets. Women who used additional coping strategies; that is, Type I coping (structural role redefinition) and Type II coping (personal role redefinition), completed their courses by the study\u2019s conclusion or were making satisfactory academic progress.

Parietal cortex, especially within the forelimb and hindlimb representations, showed significant increases of blood flow and volume, supporting neurovascular coupling. But frontal cortex showed little or no hemodynamic response, suggesting a neurovascular decoupling mechanism within the region. To quantify the spatial and temporal characters of cerebral hemodynamics, we developed a novel empirical model that is based on microscopic dynamics of artery and vein dilations. This model reliably fits the cerebral hemodynamics in the parietal cortex and quantitatively separated out arterial and venous blood volume. Using this model, we showed that the cerebral hemodynamics in regions presenting neurovascular coupling are highly predictable in space and time. Further, by pharmacologically manipulating the heart rate, we separately tested the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on the cerebral hemodynamics. We found that the cerebral arterial response and blood flow are highly robust to cardiovascular perturbations; but venous blood volume changes were largely compromised by adrenergic blockade. We concluded that neurovascular coupling during voluntary locomotion is a region-specific, rather than a global phenomenon.

Although extensive experimental studies and many numerical simulations have been performed on propellant mixing and combustion in the context of liquid rocket engines, the current understanding of the flow and combustion dynamics under supercritical conditions is not sufficient to support the engine design and optimization.  The present study focuses on the modeling and simulation of injection, mixing, and combustion of real fluids at supercritical conditions.  The objectives of the study are: (1) to establish a unified theoretical framework that can be used to study the turbulent combustion of real fluids; (2) to implement the theoretical framework and conduct numerical studies with the aim of improving the understanding of the flow and combustion dynamics at conditions representative of contemporary liquid-propellant rocket engine operation; (3) to identify the key design parameters and the flow variables which dictate the dynamics characteristics of swirl- and shear- coaxial injectors.\n   The resulting theoretical and numerical framework accommodates the full conservation laws and includes real-fluid thermodynamics and transport phenomena over the entire temperature and pressure regimes of concern.  Thermodynamic properties, such as enthalpy, internal energy, and heat capacity, are directly calculated from fundamental thermodynamics theories and a modified Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equation of state.  The transport properties, such as viscosity and thermal conductivity, are estimated using Chung\u2019s method.  Mass diffusivity is obtained using the Takahashi method, which is calibrated for high-pressure conditions.  Turbulence closure is achieved using a Large-Eddy-Simulation (LES) technique, in which the large-scale structures are resolved and the effects of unresolved small-scale motions are modeled.  The static and dynamic Smagorinsky models are incorporated to model the effect of the sub-grid scale motions.  The steady flamelet and the extended flamelet/progress-variable models are used to handle turbulence/chemistry interactions.  The resulting set of equations is solved numerically using a preconditioned, density-based finite volume method along with a dual-time stepping technique.  Rigorous effort is made to ensure mass conservation and higher-order numerical accuracy.  The robustness and the effectiveness of the resulting framework has also been validated.  The framework utilizes a parallel computation scheme that involves the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) library and multi-block treatment.\n   The theoretical and numerical framework is validated by simulating the Sandia Flame D.  The calculated axial and radial profiles of velocity, temperature, and mass fractions of major species are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental measurements.  The conditionally averaged mass fraction profiles agree very well with the experimental results at different axial locations. \n   The validated model is first employed to examine the flow dynamics of liquid oxygen in a pressure swirl injector at supercritical conditions.  Emphasis is placed on analyzing the effects of external excitations on the dynamic response of the injector.  The high-frequency fluctuations do not significantly affect the flow field as they are dissipated shortly after being introduced into the flow.  However, the lower-frequency fluctuations are amplified by the flow.  As a result, the film thickness and the spreading angle at the nozzle exit fluctuate strongly for low-frequency external excitations.\nThe combustion of gaseous oxygen/gaseous hydrogen in a high-pressure combustion chamber for a shear coaxial injector is simulated to assess the accuracy and the credibility of the computer program when applied to a sub-scale model of a combustor.  The predicted heat flux profile is compared with the experimental and numerical studies.  The predicted heat flux profile agrees very well with the experimental data.  \n   The steady flamelet model and the flamelet/progress-variable have been used to study the LOX/methane flame stabilized by a splitter plate.  Results show that the flame is always anchored in the recirculation zone that is immediately after the splitter plate.  Turbulence is not strong enough to extinguish the non-premixed flame.  The flame stabilization is found to be achieved through the recirculation zone and the vortex shedding processes in the near field of the splitter plate.  The flamelet-progress-variable case further confirms that the artificially quenched flame can be re-established as long as the quenching distance is within the mean recirculation zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2254], "author_name_tesi": "Huo, Hongfa ", "last_name_ssi": "Huo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hongfa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vigor Yang", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Vigor Yang", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Robert John Santoro", "Richard A Yetter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vigor Yang, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Chair", "Vigor Yang, Committee Chair", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Turbulent combustion", "Supercritical combustion", "swirl coaxial injector", "LOX/Methane combustion", "Supercritical mixing", "shear coaxial injector"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Neoproterozoic Sulfur Isotopes, Snowball Earth Events and the Evolution of Microbial Sulfur Species", "id": "6154", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4385", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study uses the sulfur isotopic composition of trace sulfate extracted from Neoproterozoic (1000 \u2013 543 Ma) carbonates collected in Namibia, South Australia and Death Valley, California to:  (1) document secular variations in the sulfur isotopic composition and concentration of seawater sulfate and assess variations in the sulfur cycle that may have accompanied the hypothesized snowball Earth events; and (2) more definitively document changes in ?34Ssulfate-pyrite in order to evaluate hypotheses concerning the evolution of non-photosynthetic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria linked with the oxidative part of the sulfur cycle and Earth\u2019s evolving redox chemistry.\n\n\nTrace sulfate concentrations of the carbonates collected in Namibia, South Australia and Death Valley range from 0 to 295 ppm with ?34Ssulfate values spanning 10 to 51 \u2030.

One such reservoir type is shale gas. The introduction of hydraulic fracturing has helped make production from shale gas reservoirs economical. But there are a number of difficulties in accounting the reserves for a shale gas reservoir. The low permeability of shale increases the time taken for the pressure transient to hit the external boundary. Thus an understanding of the decline trend during the early transient period would help improve the forecast. Newer analytical tools available for decline curve analysis help improve forecast by obtaining a better match for decline trends observed during early transient period. The forecast made using production data of a reservoir producing under early transient period leads to an over estimated value of reserves. The first step in this work is directed towards understanding the trend exhibited by decline rate (D) and decline exponent (b) during early transient period and it was observed that these values were not constant during this period. Production data was generated analytically by solving respective flow equations in Laplace space. Then the inversion from Laplace space to real space is done by Stefhest algorithm.

The gas rich magma pulses lead to pressure build up in the lava dome that result in structural failure of the over steepened canyon-like walls which may lead to rockfall or pyroclastic flow. This indicates that dome collapse at Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat is intimately related to magma extrusion rate. Variation in magma extrusion rate for open-system magma chambers is observed to follow alternating periods of high and low activity. Periodic behavior of magma exhibits a rich diversity in the nature of its eruptive history due to variation in magma chamber size, total crystal content, linear crystal growth rate and magma replenishment rate. Distinguished patterns of growth were observed at different magma flow rates ranging from endogenous to exogenous dome growth for magma with varying strengths.\nDetermining the key parameters that control the transition in flow pattern of the magma during its lava dome building eruption is the main focus of this work. This dissertation examines the mechanical effects on the morphology of the evolving lava dome on the extrusion of magma from a central vent using a 2D particle dynamics model. The particle dynamics model is coupled with a conduit flow model that incorporates the kinetics of crystallization and rheological stiffening to investigate important mechanisms during lava dome building eruptions.\nChapter I of this dissertation explores lava dome growth and failure mechanics using a two-dimensional particle-dynamics model. The model follows the evolution of fractured lava, with solidification driven by degassing induced crystallization of magma. The particle-dynamics model emulates the natural development of dome growth and rearrangement of the lava dome which is  difficult in mesh-based analyses  due to mesh entanglement effects. The deformable talus evolves naturally as a frictional carapace that caps a ductile magma core. Extrusion rate and magma rheology together with crystallization temperature and volatile content govern the distribution of strength in the composite structure. This new model is calibrated against existing observational models of lava dome growth. Results show that the shape and extent of the ductile core and the overall structure of the lava dome are strongly controlled by the infusion rate. The effects of extrusion rate on magma rheology are sensitive to material stiffness, which in turn is a function of volatile content and crystallinity. Material stiffness and material strength are key model parameters which govern magma rheology and subsequently the morphological character of the lava dome and in turn stability. Degassing induced crystallization causes material stiffening and enhances material strength reflected in non-Newtonian magma behavior. The increase in stiffness and strength of the injected magma causes a transition in the style of dome growth, from endogenous expansion of a ductile core, to stiffer and stronger intruding material capable of punching through the overlying material and resulting in the development of a spine or possibly inducing dome collapse. Simulation results mimic development of a megaspine upon the influx of fresh magma which leads to the re-direction of magma flow, creating a new shear zone and the switching of dome growth from one side to the other. Our model shows similar dome growth dynamics as observed at Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat,   indicating a strong correlation between extrusion rate and its subsequent effect on mechanical properties and variations in magma rheology.\nChapter II of this dissertation explores the effects of a spectrum of different rheological regimes, on eruptive style and morphologic evolution of lava domes, using a two-dimensional (2D) particle-dynamics model for a spreading viscoplastic (Bingham) fluid. We assume that the ductile magma core of a 2-D synthetic lava dome develops finite yield strength, and that deformable frictional talus evolves from a carapace that caps the magma core. Our new model is calibrated against an existing analytical model for a spreading viscoplastic lava dome and is further compared against observational data of lava dome growth. Results indicate that a degassing-induced increase in strength of the injected magma causes a transition in the lava dome morphology from a low-relief lava dome evolving endogenously (with bulk yield strength - 104 < \u03c4o < 106 Pa), to a Pelean lava dome with spines (\u03c4o > 105 - 106 Pa) extruded through the dome carapace. The virtual lava dome with \u03c4o = 0.6 MPa shows good agreement with the observed dome heights observed at the Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat during a period of endogenous growth. The calculated apparent flow viscosity (1.36 x 1011 Pa.s for \u03c4o = 0.6 MPa) is in the range of bulk viscosity (109 to 1012 Pa.s) measured for crystal-rich lavas. Our model results indicate a strong correlation between apparent yield strength and dome morphology, as controlled by degassing-induced crystallization and extrusion rate.\nChapter III of this dissertation explores different lava-dome styles by developing a two-dimensional particle-dynamics model. These growth patterns range from endogenous lava dome growth comprising expansion of a ductile dome core to the exogenous extrusion of a degassed lava plug resulting in generation of a lava spine. We couple conduit flow dynamics with surface growth of the evolving lava dome, fueled by an open-system magma chamber undergoing continuous replenishment. The conduit flow model accounts for the variation in rheology of ascending magma that results from degassing-induced crystallization. A period of reduced effusive flow rates promote enhanced degassing-induced crystallization. A degassed lava plug extrudes exogenously for magmas with crystal contents (\u03d5) of 78%, yield strength >1.62 MPa, and at flow rates of <0.5 m3/s, while endogenous dome growth is predicted at higher flow rates (Qout > 3 m3/s) for magma with lower relative yield strengths (<1 MPa). At moderately high flow rates (Qout = 4 m3/s), the extrusion of magma with lower crystal content (62%) and low interparticulate yield strength (0.6 MPa) results in the development of endogenous shear lobes. Our simulations model the periodic extrusion history at Mount St. Helens (1980 \u2013 1983). Endogenous growth initiates in the simulated lava dome with the extrusion of low yield strength magma (\u03d5 = 0.63 and \u03c4 = 0.76 MPa) after the crystallized viscous plug (\u03d5 = 0.87 and \u03c4 = 3 MPa) at the conduit exit is forced out by the high discharge rate pulse (2 < Qout < 12 m3/s). The size of the endogenous viscous plug and the occurrence of exogenous growth depend on magma yield strength and the magma chamber volume, which control the periodicity of the effusion.\nChapter IV of this dissertation explores the Variation in the extruding lava flow patterns range from endogenous dome growth with a ductile core to the exogenous extrusion of a degassed lava plug that results in the generation of a spine. The variations are a manifestation of the changes in the magma rheology which is governed by magma composition and rate of decompression of the ascending magma. We simulate using a two-dimensional particle-dynamics model, the cyclic behavior of lava dome growth with endogenous growth at high discharge rates followed by exogenous extrusion of rheologically stiffened lava due to degassing induced crystallization at low discharge rates. We couple conduit flow dynamics with surface growth of the evolving lava dome which is fueled by an overpressured reservoir undergoing constant replenishment. The periodic behavior between magma chamber pressure and discharge rate is reproduced as a result of the temporal and spatial change in magma viscosity controlled by crystallization kinetics. Dimensionless numbers are used to map the flow behaviors with the changing extrusion regime. A dimensionless plot identifying the flow transition region during the growth cycle of an evolving lava dome in its lava dome eruptive period is presented. The plot provides a the threshold value of a dimensionless strength parameter (\u03c02 < 3.31 x 10-4) below which the transition in flow pattern occurs from endogenously evolving lava dome with a ductile core to the development of a shear lobe for short or long lived periodic episode of the extrusion of magma.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10525], "author_name_tesi": "Husain, Taha Murtuza", "last_name_ssi": "Husain", "middle_name_ssi": "Murtuza", "first_name_ssi": "Taha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth", "Derek Elsworth", "Barry Voight", "Tong Qiu", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "Jamal Rostami", "Glen Mattioli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth, Dissertation Advisor", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Chair", "Barry Voight, Committee Member", "Tong Qiu, Committee Member", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Member", "Jamal Rostami, Committee Member", "Glen Mattioli, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["computational modeling", "lava domes"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Experimental Study of Transient Dynamics of PEM Fuel Cells\n", "id": "10493", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2448", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-01-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes an experimental study of the dynamics of water distribution and transport in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. The study is divided into four parts: cathode channel flooding and its impact on cell performance, role of membrane water transients, measurement of two phase air-water relative permeabilities of fuel cell diffusion media and development of a dynamic water management technique based on intermittent humidification. \n\nIn the chapter on cathode channel flooding, an in-situ visualization study of flooding in cathode channels of an operating fuel cell is presented with the objective of identifying two-phase flow patterns and documenting the impact of flooding on fuel cell performance. Humidification levels, current densities and flow stoichiometries representing typical automotive fuel cell operation are used in this study. Observed flow patterns are presented in the form of a flow map. The impact of flooding is also presented in terms of measurable parameters like two-phase pressure drop coefficient and voltage loss. A new parameter called wetted area ratio is introduced to characterize channel flooding and liquid water coverage on a gas diffusion layer, and its repeatability with multiple tests is demonstrated.\n\nTransient response of fuel cell presents a challenging area of research in PEM fuel cells and little experimental data is available in fuel cell literature. The problem of transient response is complicated by the occurrence of several complex dynamic phenomena with time scales varying over several orders of magnitude. In this part of the study, response of PEM fuel cells to a step-change in load is investigated experimentally. Voltage undershoot, a characteristic feature of transient response following a step-increase in load, is shown to be due to transients of water distribution in the membrane and ionomers occurring at sub-second time scales. Use of humidified reactants as a means to control magnitude of voltage undershoot has been demonstrated. Further, response under step-decrease in current density has been explored to determine existence of hysteresis. Under sufficiently humidified conditions, response under forward and reverse step changes are found to be symmetric, but under low RH conditions, voltage undershoot is found to be twice as large as the overshoot.\n\nAir-water relative permeabilities of gas diffusion material play a pivotal role in water management. Modeling of liquid water transport through the GDL relies on knowledge of relative permeability functions in the in-plane and through-plane directions. However, experimental measurements of carbon based paper and cloth materials are not available in literature. In this part of the study, air and water relative permeabilities are experimentally determined as functions of saturation for typical GDL materials such as Toray-060, -090, -120 carbon paper and E-Tek carbon cloth materials in their plain, untreated forms. Saturation is measured using an ex-situ gravimetric method. Absolute and relative permeability functions in the two directions of interest are presented. \n\nBased on experimental observations of fuel cell response following change in gas RH, a novel method of water management of PEM fuel cells using intermittent humidification is developed. The goal of this method is to maintain the membrane close to full humidification, while eliminating any channel flooding. The method is tested on experimental test cells using both plain and hydrophobic GDL materials and an improvement in performance as compared to steady humidification is demonstrated.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2431], "author_name_tesi": "Hussaini, Irfan Saif", "last_name_ssi": "Hussaini", "middle_name_ssi": "Saif", "first_name_ssi": "Irfan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof C Y Wang", "Chao Yang Wang", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Stefan Thynell", "Jun Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof C Y Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Stefan Thynell, Committee Member", "Jun Huang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["relative permeability of diffusion media", "water management", "transient dynamics", "visualization"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Nanoparticles as Tools for Directing and Observing Protein Motors\n\n", "id": "7263", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "736", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "temporary abstract\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [729], "author_name_tesi": "Hutchins, Benjamin Mitchell", "last_name_ssi": "Hutchins", "middle_name_ssi": "Mitchell", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth J Williams", "Professor Christine D Keating", "Andrew Ewing", "William O Hancock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth J Williams, Committee Chair", "Professor Christine D Keating, Committee Member", "Andrew Ewing, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chemical education", "nanotechnology", "magnetic nanoparticles", "protein motors", "quantum dots"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EFFECT OF CARBON FIBER BRUSH ANODE SURFACE AREA \nON SINGLE CHAMBER MFC START UP TIME AND INTERNAL RESISTANCE\n\n\n", "id": "11839", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "160", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The use of carbon brush anodes in single chamber air cathode microbial fuel cells (MFCs) has significantly increased power generation. It has been shown that the additional surface area and porous structure of these anodes are the characteristics that increase power generation. Here it was shown that this large amount of anode surface area is much more beneficial for MFC operation at startup than it is once MFCs have been operated for extended time periods. The startup time for MFCs using full brush anodes and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) concentrations of 50 mM, 25 mM, and 8 mM was 8 \u00b1 1 days. Startup time increased when 75% of the brush anode was removed to 13 days in MFCs using 50 mM PBS, 14 days using 25 mM PBS, and 21 days using 8 mM PBS. Once MFC operation and the microbial community has been established, up to 75% of the anode brush material can be removed without observing a significant decrease in power generation. MFCs using a full brush anode produced a maximum power density of 1050 \u00b1 140 mW/m2, and when 75% of the anode was removed the power density decreased to 770 \u00b1 70 mW/m2.\nPower density, total internal resistance, and distribution of total internal resistance were examined as functions of solution conductivity, electrode spacing, and amount of brush anode material. Acetate-fed MFCs with 50 mM substrate buffer solution, a spacing of 0.4 cm between the front of brush anode and the cathode, and a full brush anode, produced the largest power density of 1280 mW/m2. MFCs with 8 mM PBS, 1.4 cm electrode spacing, and 75% of brush anode removed produced the lowest power density of 387 mW/m2. Each time power density was determined internal resistance was also determined using two different methods: the slope of the polarization curve; and summation of the component resistances from EIS results. Power density was plotted versus one over internal resistance to examine if there was systematic variation in measured resistances. A plot of all data showed that there was no bias in either method determining internal resistance related to the power density produced. Given a certain internal resistance the power density can be estimated with 95% confidence using the linear relationship. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), conducted with the MFC under an external load, was used to identify the specific contributions of solution, charge transfer, and diffusion resistances to overall internal resistance. The results show that charge transfer resistance was the same at both electrodes within a standard deviation for MFCs with different solution conductivity, electrode spacing, and amount of anode material. Anode charge transfer resistance (ARCT) was 21 \u00b1 5 &#8486; for MFCs that produced the highest power densities (50 mM PBS, 0.4 cm electrode spacing, 0% brush anode removed), and 26 \u00b1 5 &#8486; for MFCs that produced the lowest power density (8 mM PBS, 1.4 cm electrode spacing, and 75% of the brush anode removed). Similarly these variations did not affect the cathode charge transfer resistance (CRCT), as evidenced by CRCT values of 19 \u00b1 5 &#8486; for MFCs that produced highest power densities and 21 \u00b1 5 &#8486; for the MFCs that produced the lowest power densities. The primary sources of internal resistance were solution (RS) and diffusion (RD), which together increased by 100 &#8486; from highest to lowest power density conditions.  Internal resistance values determined by EIS were in agreement with values determined by the method of using the stable region of the polarization slope. The agreement of the summed EIS and polarization slope values suggests that EIS is useful for identifying distinct sources of internal resistance, and that it does not miss any critical components of internal resistance.  \nTaken together, these results show that carbon fiber brushes with less material than current models could be used to achieve high power densities and the primary obstacles to decreasing internal resistance are in the solution conductivity which impacts solution and diffusion resistances. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [159], "author_name_tesi": "Hutchinson, Adam Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Hutchinson", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["carbon fiber brush anodes", "electrochemical impedance spectroscopy", "Microbial Fuel Cell", "internal resistance", "surface area"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Influences of Demographic and Parenting Variables on Early Adolescent Moral Decisions\n\n\n\n", "id": "7421", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "916", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the relations among parental support and parental control and parenting style (parental support and parental control), and moral decisions after controlling for sex, race-ethnicity, and school context.

Dams interrupt the natural connectivity of lotic systems by severing the flow of water, sediment, nutrients, energy, and biota between the upstream and downstream segments of streams and rivers.  Removing dams and restoring streams to a more natural, free-flowing state is assumed to benefit aquatic organisms inhabiting the system.  Despite the large number of dams being removed across the United States, few of these projects have focused on the effects of dam removal on biotic assemblages. \n\nThe Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission has developed an active dam removal program as part of their efforts to restore fish habitat and migration of American shad in the Susquehanna River basin.  This program provided the unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of removing small, run-of-the-river dams on biotic assemblages.  Three small dams in the Susquehanna River basin, two on the Conestoga River in Lancaster County, PA (Hellberg\u2019s and Hinkletown Dams), and one on Middle Creek (Franklin Mills Dam) in Snyder County, PA, were monitored.  The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission removed Hellberg\u2019s dam in December 1999 and Franklin Mills dam in April 2000; Hinkletown dam was removed by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in March 2000 as part of a bridge repair project.  The overall goal of this study was to determine if the fish and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages found in areas that were previously impounded were different from or became similar to the assemblages of free-flowing reaches that were not affected by the impoundment in the years following dam removal.  \n\nFish assemblages were sampled at Hellberg\u2019s, Hinkletown, and Franklin Mills impoundments in October 1999 by making a single pass around the shoreline of each impoundment at night using boat electrofishing.  At each study site, fishes were also collected from three 200 m, free-flowing sampling reaches that were unaffected by the dam and impoundment in upstream and downstream sections using a towboat electrofishing unit in 1999. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled in the impoundments by sweeping a 30 cm D-frame net with a 500 \u00b5m mesh for 1 m along the bottom and in the water column for 1 minute in wadeable regions of the impoundment in 1999.  In the free-flowing reaches upstream and downstream of the dam, benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled from riffles or runs using the same D-frame kick net.  Five samples were collected at each sampling reach.  The kick net was held against the bottom substrate while an area approximately one meter long and the width of the net wide was disturbed upstream (~0.33 m2), allowing detritus and organisms to drift downstream into the net.  After the dams were removed, two additional 200 m free-flowing reaches were established within the area that was previously impounded at the Hellberg\u2019s and Franklin Mills study sites and one additional reach was established at Hinkletown (due to the short extent of the former impoundment).  Following dam removal (in years 2000, 2001, 2005, and 2006), all free-flowing reaches, including those in the formerly impounded sections, were sampled in the same manner as free-flowing reaches sampled in 1999. \n\nDue to differences in sampling gear and methodology used to sample the impoundments versus the free-flowing reaches, I could not make direct comparisons between the samples collected in the impoundment and those collected from free-flowing reaches; however, results from this study contribute to the growing body of dam removal research by demonstrating that fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages in formerly impounded stream reaches become nearly indistinguishable from those in permanently free-flowing reaches following dam removal.  Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination did not identify groupings associated with location relative to the former dam site (i.e., upstream, former impoundment, downstream) for any of the assemblages evaluated in free-flowing reaches.  Samples from the formerly impounded reaches (FIMP1 and FIMP2) were randomly interspersed among the upstream and downstream samples on the NMDS plots.  Global R statistics generated by analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) were not significant when comparing assemblages by location, except in the case of the Hinkletown macroinvertebrate assemblage (Global R = 0.50).  In other words, the fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages at upstream, former impoundment, and downstream reaches of the Franklin Mills and Hellberg\u2019s sites, and the fish assemblages at upstream and former impoundments reaches at the Hinkletown site, were very similar in terms of taxonomic composition.   \n\nAlthough fish and macroinvertebrate assemblage similarity did not appear to differ according to location relative to the dam site, NMDS ordination and ANOSIM results indicated differences related to year at all three study sites for both fish and macroinvertebrates.  Samples from 2000 and 2001 grouped together in the NMDS ordination, as did samples from 2005 and 2006.  The 1999 samples usually formed their own group or appeared closer to the 2000 and 2001 samples according to NMDS ordination, and pairwise comparisons between 1999 and other years generally yielded high ( > 0.75) R values.  Differences in assemblage similarity among years may have resulted because of environmental factors such as precipitation and timing of sampling events, or differences in individual efforts between years.  \n\tAs indicated above, my results were confounded by differences in sampling gears used and I was unable to make direct comparisons between the impoundments and upstream, formerly impounded, and downstream free-flowing reaches.  Future dam removal studies should develop sampling methodology that allows for direct comparison between the very different types of habitat found in small dam impoundments versus free-flowing reaches.  Expanding monitoring efforts to include quarterly or at least biannual collections, as well as habitat and water quality monitoring, will greatly enhance understanding of the ways in which small dams and their removal affect stream ecosystems.  With over 100 dam removals scheduled to take place in Pennsylvania over the next several years and an ever-increasing number of small dams reaching the end of their useful lifespan, dam removal is certain to remain in the scientific and public spotlight for many years to come.  Data from improved monitoring efforts will help to ensure that the money spent on dam removal projects is invested in such a way as to enhance available water resources for the benefit of both wildlife and human users.      \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [848], "author_name_tesi": "Hutchison, Brianna ", "last_name_ssi": "Hutchison", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Brianna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Paola Ferreri", "C Paola Ferreri", "Jay Richard Stauffer Jr.", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Paola Ferreri, Thesis Advisor", "C Paola Ferreri, Thesis Advisor", "Jay Richard Stauffer Jr., Thesis Advisor", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["dam removal", "biomonitoring", "assemblage structure", "freshwater fishes", "benthic macroinvertebrates", "impoundment", "river restoration"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Spectral Top-n:a Computationally Efficient Top-n Algorithm for Big Data Analytics", "id": "26346", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11689", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recommendation systems and their algorithms have been a rich research area of research since the first appearance of collaborative filtering as a data categorization tool.\n The wealth of available information is growing, and also the research striving to relate this ether of information to the individual. Today, this ether of information has taken on the visage of Big Data; where the individual plays the part of the consumer to make recommendation a seductive research area. Classically, recommendation systems have focused on analyzing relationships between user pairs or user product pairs, which makes a sensible first-cut at many Big Data problems. For instance, given a mass of historical user or purchase data, Top-N can be used to isolate common attributes among groups of users or the groups themselves given $N$ items, which provides a sane default for additional analyst intervention.  \n\nRecommender analysis is not without its caveats. Foremost, without implementation of the recommender system, one must resort to models which rely on probabilistic or economic theory [and corresponding assumptions] to compare competing methodologies. In addition, by conventional wisdom,the type of recommendation system chosen will also dictate the type of data analyzed and vice versa. That is to say, in a very diverse ecology of items such as Amazon.com, a recommendation algorithm which is computationally inefficient likely will not thrive. In this train of thought, one of the more robust algorithms developed for recommendation systems has been the Top-N algorithm, in that both user and item similarity can be assessed.\n\nThe Top-N criteria, though powerful, suffers from an exponential component which can make calculation untenable when item sets are large.  Specifically, the calculation of similarity in a user-item system is $O(users^2*items)$ since we have to perform $users(users-1)$ calculations of a possible $items$ length. In this thesis, we combine ad-hoc calculation of the Top-N criteria with cluster computing and the relics of signal processing to produce a computationally amenable algorithm for real-time recommendation generation.  [Recommender systems by design make assumptions to extrapolate user preference across a dataset of items, and the theory used to measure them also rely heavily on this assumption]\n\nIn this thesis, we propose an alternative similarity metric based on spectral analysis and benchmark its computational efficacy by comparing it to traditional or ``vanilla'' Top-N Algorithms using the Dotproduct, Cosine, and Hamming measures. The method itself stems from a paradigm shift into the frequency domain: where we leverage the computational efficiency of the Fast Fourier transform in order to obtain a similarity metric suited for Big-Data or real-time analysis. We benchmark the Spectral similarity metric by: comparison to traditional algorithms, through full-factorial experimentation, Big-Data case-studies, and extensions to other areas of data mining which struggle with combinatorial complexity; in this case: the Apriori Algorithm.\n\nOur method allows for a small loss in accuracy, but significant benefits in terms of computational speed and random access memory consumption when dealing with the large binary matrices found in Top-N problems. We gain this advantage by using spectral analysis to compress and summarize the data, which decreases the computational effort and space required to compute the item or customer distance matrix.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11178], "author_name_tesi": "Hutchison, Kenneth M", "last_name_ssi": "Hutchison", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Kumara", "Guodong Pang", "Paul Griffin", "Kamesh Madduri", "Daniel Antion Finke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Kumara, Dissertation Advisor", "Guodong Pang, Committee Member", "Paul Griffin, Committee Member", "Kamesh Madduri, Committee Member", "Daniel Antion Finke, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Big Data", "Statistics", "Computer Science", "Top-N", "Recommender Systems", "Spectral Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DYADIC SYNCHRONY AND INFANT REGULATION OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT WITH MOTHERS AND FATHERS\n", "id": "8996", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5241", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-01-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigated the relation between mother-infant and father-infant dyadic synchrony and infant emotion regulation in sample of 6-month-old infants (N = 137).

Mothers reported on their depressive symptoms and leisure time exercise, and wore a pedometer prior to the visit. Findings indicated that increasing positive expressive behavior as contextual demands shifted was associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms. Moreover, mothers who reported higher levels of physical activity displayed higher levels of positive expressive behavior during a conflict discussion with their partners.

Following Moore\u2019s law, the number of transistors is approximately one billion in a chip at the 22 nm technology node. However, the power consumption, which is the sum of dynamic and static power dissipation, becomes a critical issue to the further advance of silicon transistors for the high-speed, low-power logic applications. While maintaining the device performance at ON and OFF state, the novel device design and materials are inevitably required, facilitating the supply voltage scaling. In this regard, III-V semiconductors such as InAs, InSb and InxGa1-xAs (x\u22650.53) with superior channel transport have attracted a great interest.\n Recently, planar and non-planar FETs (Field Effect Transistors) with III-V compound semiconductors are under intense research and they have exhibited comparable device performance to silicon technology with lower supply voltage. The expected enhancement in device performance is originated from the excellent electron transport property at both low and high electric fields arising from low \u0393-valley electron mass. On the other hand, the several challenges facing the III-V compound semiconductor community are (1) the scalability of III-V FETs in terms of gate-length and gate-pitch, (2) the improvement of the interface between high-k dielectric and III-V compound semiconductors, (3) the integration of III-V materials on silicon and (4) the development of suitable p-type MOSFET for the CMOS configuration.\n This dissertation presents first the understating of the carrier transport in III-V FETs. Based on this, we investigate the scalability of III-V FETs in terms of gate-length and gate-pitch by 2-dimensional drift-diffusion simulation. Furthermore, since the announcement of non-planar, tri-gate silicon transistors at the 22 nm technology node, the scalability of gate-pitch in non-planar III-V transistors with suitable contact architecture is also of great importance and is investigated by 3-dimensional drift-diffusion simulation. Experimentally, the interface quality at high-k dielectric/III-V material with different surface treatment is demonstrated. Furthermore, the introduction of solid phase regrowth (SPR) process on heavily-doped and lightly-doped In0.53Ga0.47As samples is explained in order to achieve the low contact resistance. This is followed by the experimental demonstration of non-planar, tri-gate In0.53Ga0.47As transistors with two different contact architectures; planar contact scheme and non-planar (surrounding) contact scheme.

These manual types of hand tools, such as cutting tools, weeders, and cultivators require considerable muscle forces, stressful working postures and repetitive movements. The musculoskeletal load on a person performing manual work with hand-powered hand tools often may result in muscle fatigue and reduced capacity for work in the short-term. In the long-term, the consequences can be cumulative and result in musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and chronic muscle pain. The effects can be more severe, if the work is performed by workers who have smaller body size and lesser muscle strength. This trend can be more pronounced in women than in men. Also, it may make men and women take different tool operating strategies although they perform same tasks. \nThis study investigates the biomechanical and physiological loads when working with shovels in Case Study 1 and with pruning shears of varying design in Case Study 2.

For the study of pruning shear design, the effects of handle shape, gender, hand size, and relationships between hand anthropometric measures and grip force are studied while pruning. \nThe results of Case Study 1 show that \n(1)\tthe redesigned shovel with key ergonomic design parameters (the combination of 36\u00b0 lift angle, use of second handle, and elongated D handle) enables the user to perform the shoveling task with less energy as well as a more upright posture while shoveling and lifting soil.\n(2)\tthe design process, considering user preference in handle height selection that improves accommodation of women users, compared with the design based on solely on anthropometry.   \n(3)\tincluding a women user preference on the handle height (1145 mm), is capable of accommodating a larger women population than traditional anthropometric methods, for the prototype shovel.\n(4)\tknee flexion with a flat back is an operating strategy for women to overcome their biomechanical disadvantages during shoveling work.\nThe results of Case Study 2 indicate that\n(1)\tthe most critical hand anthropometric measures are hand length and palm width and they have significant effects on grip span, contact force, and subjective discomfort and satisfaction rating.\n(2)\tthe redesigned pruning shears with rubber-padded grip and thumb grip minimize pressures on the critical hand regions and significantly improve muscle activities, grip force distribution, and wrist deviations.\n(3)\ta large degree of wrist extension, greater use of the extensor digitorum (ED) muscle, and excessive squeezing force are women\u2019s operating strategies to overcome their biomechanical disadvantages during pruning work.\nThese results suggest that knowledge of the stress-strain analysis and manual hand tool evaluation for different genders and body sizes will make a significant contribution towards reducing the risk of cumulative trauma disorders (CTD) in the upper extremities of hand tool users.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3259], "author_name_tesi": "Hwang, Jesun ", "last_name_ssi": "Hwang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jesun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds", "Andris Freivalds", "Dennis J Murphy", "Matthew B Parkinson", "Gul Kremer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds, Dissertation Advisor", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Chair", "Dennis J Murphy, Committee Member", "Matthew B Parkinson, Committee Member", "Gul Kremer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ergonomics of Pruning Shears and Shovels", "User Preference", "Hand Tool Design"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "ADVANCING AND TESTING A CONCEPTUAL MODEL THAT MEASURES STUDENT SUCCESS AT FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES\n", "id": "25049", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10840", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While for-profit colleges and universities (FPCUs) are touted for their ability to broaden college education opportunities for low-income and underrepresented students who would not otherwise be served in traditional, not-for-profit higher education institutions, their potential success with students is poorly understood. Further, there has been limited discussion or evidence on what contributes to FPCU college students\u2019 success. This study was developed to fill the gap by identifying and describing multiple ways to consider credential completion at the FPCU level as an indicator of student success. It also explored credential completion conditional on type of credential sought and program/field of study enrollment.\n\nHigher education theories are rarely applied to FPCU students\u2014thus, this study also proposed a conceptual model of credential completion for for-profit college students that built upon Tinto\u2019s model of institutional departure (1993), Pascarella\u2019s general model for assessing changes (1985), and Bean and Metzner\u2019s nontraditional college student attrition model (1985). The framework was used to examine the factors associated with credential completion and how the same conceptual model and same measures resulted in different findings across the for-profit, community college, and broad access four-year not-for-profit college sectors. \n\nThe following research questions guided this work.\n \n1)\tHow does using alternative measures to define credential completion in FPCUs influence who is counted as a completer? \na.\tMeasure 1: Who completes when credential completion is defined as whether one attained any type of credential at the institution of initial entry?\nb.\tMeasure 2: Who completes when credential completion is defined as whether one attained a credential that matched their initial credential goal at the institution of initial entry?\nc.\tMeasure 3: Who completes when credential completion is defined as whether one attained a credential after leaving the FPCU of initial entry? \n2)\tUsing the conceptual framework as a guide, how are institutional structures, student services, student background characteristics, and student experiences associated with completion of any credential type by FPCU students?\na.\tHow do the factors (stated above) differ among certificate- versus degree-seeking students at FPCUs?\nb.\tHow do the factors (stated above) differ among students enrolled in vocational/technical programs versus academic programs at FPCUs?\nc.\tHow do the factors (stated above) differ between for-profit and not-for-profit college attendees?\n\nUsing the Beginning Postsecondary Students 2004\u20132009 data and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, a series of descriptive and multilevel logistic regression analyses were conducted on the completion measures. In-depth analyses were conducted on completion measure 1, which was understood to be the most inclusive definition of credential completion at the institution of initial entry over a six-year time period. Key findings were as follows: \n\n\u2022\tCredential completion rates varied substantially depending on method of measurement. Forty-eight percent of FPCU students attained a credential at a FPCU within six years. When exact match of initial credential goal and attainment was defined as completion, 55% of certificate seekers, 26% of associate\u2019s degree seekers, and only 22% of bachelor\u2019s degree seekers attained credentials as they had planned within a six-year period. From the longitudinal, multi-institutional perspective, only a handful of students completed a credential after leaving the FPCU of initial entry.\n\u2022\tControlling for the variables in the model, attending four-year FPCUs decreased the odds of certificate completion by 84% relative to attending a less than two-year FPCU. No difference was found between attending four-year FPCUs or less than two-year FPCUs and degree completion (associate\u2019s or bachelor\u2019s degree). Compared to less than two-year FPCUs, attending two-year FPCUs did not differentiate on the likelihood of attaining a degree or certificate completion. \n\u2022\tThis study found clear differences across for-profit and not-for-profit institutions in the role of three agents of socialization\u2014adviser, faculty, and peers. While interactions with adviser, faculty, and peers were all found to be significant in predicting not-for-profit four-year college students\u2019 completion, interaction with adviser was the only significant variable for FPCU students\u2019 completion, and peer interaction was the only significant variable in community college students\u2019 degree completion.\n\u2022\tThere was little evidence that FPCUs better serve marginalized students than those students in the not-for-profit sector. For-profit college students were negatively influenced by their nontraditional student status in a similar manner to students in broad access four-year not-for-profit colleges; nontraditional student status did not have a negative influence on credential completion in community colleges.\n\nThis study\u2019s findings contribute to theory, research, and policy. They suggest that modifications to traditional higher education theories can increase understanding of for-profit college students. In particular, this study offered new ways of operationalizing academic and social integration that more appropriately reflect the institutional norms of FPCUs.

During the post-World War II, the Point Four program and modernization theory served to construct and propagate the Western-oriented and modernistic discourse of technology and development, characterized as the sharp dichotomy between \u00a1\u00b0Traditional-Bad\u00a1\u00b1 and \u00a1\u00b0Modern-Good.\u00a1\u00b1 In the age of neo-liberal globalization, the establishment of the Global Information Infrastructure and the WTO Agreement on Basic Telecommunications Services were the double-headed apparatus that have created a new ground in which to reproduce and maintain the dominant capitalist powers led mainly by the U.S. in response to the decline of their economic and political supremacy since the 1970s.\n\tDiscursively, this study analyzed a major policy report on the global digital divide co-authored by ITU and ORBICOM (2005) to address how the discourse of the global digital divide construct the discourse of technology and development?

It has four structural proteins and six non-structural proteins with untranslated regions at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 termini.  Functions for all proteins in HCV have been reported except for p7 and non-structural protein (NS5A).  NS5A is a phosphoprotein that has two phosphorylated forms (p56 and p58).  Although the roles of NS5A are not completely understood, properties have been reported in numerous papers.  NS5A has two roles; genomic replication and host cellular protein interactions.  And these functions are switched by the level of phosphorylation on NS5A.  The hyperphosphorylated form (p58) is suggested to interfere with cellular signaling and the un- or hypophosphorylated form (p56) is involved in genomic replication.\nIn this study, we mapped the minimal domain of NS5A for RNA binding.  The N-terminus of NS5A is required for RNA binding.  The interface of the dimer has positive electrostatic potential that is sufficient to accommodate an RNA helix.  NS5A-RNA binding is dependent on electrostatic interactions and ionic strength.  NS5A binds RNA at neutral and low pH, but not at high pH or high salt concentration (300 mM).  NS5A is able to form oligomer.  Structural feature of dimerized NS5A has enough space for RNA binding and, interestingly, positive charged amino acids in the bottom and negative charged in the side of groove, suggesting that this space can be a putative groove for RNA binding.  In addition, glutaraldehyde and UV crosslinking studies reveal that monomeric and dimeric NS5A bind RNA.\nNS5A is phosphorylated by cellular kinases including cAMP-dependent kinase A (PKA).  We identified a PKA phosphorylation site on NS5A and examined the effects of PKA phosphorylation on HCV genomic replication.  PKA phosphorylation enhances the accumulation of subgenomic replication during cell divisions and modulates cleaved NS5A subcellular localization.  \nIn order to prevent viral spread and expansion, an infected cell recognizes foreign agents through various mechanisms.  One of the systems is the PKR pathway, which turns off cellular and viral translation by sensing and binding double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).  Herein, we show that single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) is also able to activate PKR and this activation requires a 5\u2019-triphosphate on the RNA.  PKR cannot be activated by 7-methyl guanine capped or hydroxylated RNA, suggesting that PKR differentiates between cellular RNA and foreign RNA.  HCV NS5A has the ability to prevent PKR autophosphorylation induced by dsRNA and ssRNA.\nDeciphering the NS5A functions in genomic replication and PKR responses to foreign RNA will provide significant practical applications as well as insight into replication and innate immune response mechanism.

Previous research (Hollins & Hudnell, 1980; Klink, Brascamp, Blake, & Van Wezel, 2010) has proposed that inducing adult plasticity is possible through visual adaptation to dichoptically incongruent spatial gratings, so that each eye sees an independent image.  This type of viewing produces a perceptual phenomenon called binocular rivalry.  The visual system\u2019s incapability of focusing on both images simultaneously subjects the viewer to constant perceptual switching, so that only one image dominates perceptual awareness at a time (Alias & Blake, 2005).  Prolonged binocular rivalry may thus impose experience-driven plasticity on the binocular integration system.  Persistent viewing of incongruent images weakens an interocular inhibition mechanism that normally suppresses the binocular integration of opposing stimuli, and remains weakened until exposed to normal, congruent binocular vision once more (Hollins & Hudnell, 1980; Klink et al., 2010).  Perceptually, the viewer increasingly experiences mixtures of incongruent images or decreasing perceptual exclusivity.  The present study extended this paradigm by randomly assigning participants to one of four interocular orientation difference (IOD) groups (90\u00ba, 45\u00ba, 37.5\u00ba, and 30\u00ba).  It was expected that reducing IOD would also reduce interocular inhibition.  The manipulation permits a direct test of the hypothesis that perceptual adaptation stems from weakened interocular inhibition.  A significant reduction in perceptual exclusivity was found between the 30\u00ba IOD and other IOD conditions, as well as between the 37.5\u00ba and 45\u00ba IOD conditions. However, the study failed to produce decreased perceptual exclusivity with respect to time for any IOD condition, including the 90\u00ba IOD which was intended to replicate experimental conditions utilized in previous research (Hollins & Hudnell, 1980; Klink et al., 2010).  The discrepancy in these findings may stem from a larger (n=60), more diverse, and inexperienced sample of observers.  It is also possible that the small IOD conditions fell within a perceptual threshold that begins to elicit stereopsis (Blakemore, Fiorentini, & Maffei, 1972) in observers, despite the lack of adaptation effects.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7545], "author_name_tesi": "Hwang, Kenneth Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Hwang", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rick Owen Gilmore"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rick Owen Gilmore, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["binocular", "vision", "experience", "plasticity", "adaptation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT FOR ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES ON A TRANSPORTATION NETWORK", "id": "mp48sc763", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13063", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Due to global concerns regarding environmental and economic sustainability in ground logistics, recent research has paid considerable attention to the commercialization of alternative fuel (AF) vehicles that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, logistics companies are reluctant to replace their long-distance trucks with AF trucks because their supply chain routes have an insufficient level of AF infrastructure coverage. Employing AF vehicles in the transportation sector requires an initial AF infrastructure, which would involve constructing refueling stations in optimal locations to cover the maximum traffic flows on a given road network. To achieve the goal, this research proposes rigorous mathematical models and algorithms for optimal positioning of AF refueling stations on directed transportation networks such as highways, toll roads, and expressways. \n\n In the first problem, we propose a new mathematical model that locates AF refueling stations on a directed transportation network that has two types of candidate sites for AF refueling stations: (1) single-access sites which are accessible from only one driving direction, and (2) dual-access sites which are accessible from both driving directions. The existing literature on path-based demand models to locate AF refueling stations does not consider these directional candidate sites on a transportation network. Note that highway systems, which play an important role in the exchange of goods, have directed candidate sites for AF refueling stations. In this respect, we present a 0-1 linear programming model that locates AF refueling stations on a directed transportation network with the objective of maximizing the coverage of traffic flows. Then, we apply the proposed model to the Pennsylvania Turnpike considering the 2011 medium- and heavy-duty truck traffic data with different vehicle driving ranges. Two greedy algorithms are also provided and implemented to find the best sequence to set up the AF refueling stations for the selected sites.\n \n In the second problem, we design a new mathematical model for locating AF refueling stations when vehicles have different driving ranges and fuel remaining in a tank at their origins and destinations (ODs). The existing literature generally assumes that vehicles are capable of traveling the same driving range and have similar fuel tank levels at their ODs. We relax these assumptions and introduce a multi-class vehicle transportation network which is defined as a transportation network with the variations of vehicles\u2019 driving ranges and different fuel tank levels at their ODs. A 0-1 linear programming model is proposed to locate a given number of refueling stations that maximize the total traffic flow covered (in round trips per time unit) by the stations on the network. Through numerical experiments with the 2011 medium- and heavy-duty truck traffic data in the Pennsylvania Turnpike, we identify the optimal sets of refueling stations for AF trucks on a multi-class vehicle transportation network.\n\n In the third problem, we consider that vehicles are able to make detours from pre-planned paths if there are no available AF refueling stations on the paths. This problem is essential to be considered for AF trucks on highway systems when an AF refueling infrastructure is not fully developed yet in their supply chain routes. That is, alternative paths with the AF refueling availability can be considered to include drivers\u2019 routes even though AF truck drivers need to deviate from pre-planned paths. In this respect, we first propose an algorithm to generate alternative paths that drivers are willing to select for their routes between ODs. Then, a 0-1 linear programming model is presented to locate AF refueling stations at candidate sites on a network by maximizing the coverage of traffic flows along multiple paths. We test our model with the algorithm on a classical 25-node network with 25 candidate sites through various scenarios that include different numbers of paths, deviation factors, and limited driving ranges.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12516], "author_name_tesi": "Hwang, Seong wook ", "last_name_ssi": "Hwang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seong wook", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose A.

Moreover, the advent of information era enabled customers to easily search and move to a lower-fare and higher-quality provider,  using internet access.

As sound quality is in demand in almost all product designs and also because of fierce competition between product manufacturers, faster and accurate computational method for shape optimization is always desired. Because the conventional Wave Superposition method relies solely on mesh geometry, it cannot accommodate fast shape changes in the design stage of a consumer product or machinery, where many iterations of shape changes are required. Since the use of a mesh hinders easy shape changes, a new approach for representing geometry is introduced by constructing a uniform lattice in a 3-D digital work space. A voxel (a portmanteau, a new word made from combining the sound and meaning, of the words, volumetric and pixel) is essentially a volume element defined by the uniform lattice, and does not require separate connectivity information as a mesh element does. In the presented method, geometry is represented with voxels that can easily adapt to shape changes, therefore it is more suitable for shape optimization. The new method was validated by computing radiated sound power of structures of simple and complex geometries and complex mode shapes. It was shown that matching volume velocity is a key component to an accurate analysis. A sensitivity study showed that it required at least 6 elements per acoustic wavelength, and a complexity study showed a minimal reduction in computational time. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6752], "author_name_tesi": "Hwang, Yong Sin ", "last_name_ssi": "Hwang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yong Sin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Hugo Koopmann", "Gary Hugo Koopmann", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "Martin Wesley Trethewey", "John Brian Fahnline"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Hugo Koopmann, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary Hugo Koopmann, Committee Chair", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Chair", "Martin Wesley Trethewey, Committee Member", "John Brian Fahnline, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Boundary Element Method", "BEM", "Voxel", "Wave Superposition Method", "Shape Optimization", "Digital acoustic space"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Characterizing hydrologic settings and hydrologic regimes of headwater riparian wetlands in the Ridge and Valley of Pennsylvania", "id": "10985", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3362", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Riverine systems are highly complex and dynamic systems. They have been described as having a four-dimensional nature of fluxes of materials, energy, and biota in a riverine system through: lateral connectivity between the channel and the riparian area or floodplain; longitudinal connectivity between channel segments upstream and downstream; vertical connectivity between the channel or floodplain and the aquifer; and temporal dynamics of the system. Floodplains can be seen as the \u2018beads on a string\u2019 of the riparian corridor where maximum three-dimensional hydrologic exchange allows for the fluxes of energy, materials, and biota within and between heterogeneous habitats. Building on Landscape Ecology and Fluvial Geomorphology a River Ecosystem Synthesis (RES) Framework looks to understand rivers as dynamic shifting mosaics of geomorphic patches or Functional Process Zones. Wetlands are a key part of this shifting mosaic, but have been under characterized and underrepresented in the RES, primarily due to a lack of cross-pollination between wetland and stream ecology. This research intended to help nudge the discussion of wetlands towards the RES Framework and help include wetlands in the integrated approach being pursued by stream ecologists under the RES. Additionally, there is a general need to better understand the hydrologic setting and dynamics of headwater wetlands. \nDrawing upon the opportunities to inform and be informed by the stream ecology literature by looking at wetlands in a 4-dimensional, dynamic, River Ecosystem Synthesis approach, this study sought to:  better understand the hydrologic setting and the seasonal dynamics of the hydrologic regime for headwater wetlands in the Susquehanna River Basin. The objectives were achieved through a synthesis at the basin scale (Chapter 2) and detailed analyses in a single sub-watershed (Chapter 3) and a subset of wetlands with long-term water level records (Chapter 4). In Chapter 2, this work used the framework of the four-dimensional nature of the RES to generate a revised approach to scaling for the study of wetland services in the Susquehanna River Basin. One aspect of the revised scaling hierarchy was the use of a reach-scale. Chapter 3 used the understanding that in river ecosystems wetlands and, in turn high bio-complexity, occurs where there are laterally and longitudinally unconstrained reaches. This research identified what topographic characteristics defined unconstrained reaches in this physiographic setting based on the known occurrence of wetlands in the study area. Chapter 4 explored the vertical and temporal dimensions of wetlands in this physiographic setting by exploring the relationships between water level, wetland type, and seasonal fluctuations across years with a range of drought and deluge conditions using time series analysis.\nChapter 2 is a synthesis of the efforts of the ecological portion of a study of climate change and ecosystem services provided by freshwater wetlands of the Susquehanna River Basin study to characterize and map a hierarchical landscape classification for use in the study. The scaling hierarchy analysis not only identified a gap in spatial scale of data between disciplines, but it identified the reach as a scale to bridge that gap. Building upon several existing classification schemes, a revised hierarchical landscape classification was generated: Basin, Physiographic Province, Sub-watershed, Channel Reach, and Habitat (macro- and micro-). This work not only proposed the use of a reach scale, rare in wetland studies but very common in stream studies, but articulated a process-based macro- and micro-habitat classification.\nChapter 3 improved the spatial prediction of headwater riparian wetlands through identification of reach settings unconstrained latitudinally and longitudinally that allow for this three dimensional exchange of water. Known locations of mapped, non-open water National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) wetlands, field-identified non-NWI wetlands, and non-wetland locations (n=40, 30, and 35, respectively) were used to build a predictive partition tree. Predictive variables were DEM-derived topographic indices for the stream reaches: valley width, mean stream slope, and contributing area. The partition tree resulted in a 5-node tree (overall R2=0.61). These classes ranged from very high likelihood of wetland occurrence to very low likelihood of wetland occurrence or least constrained to most constrained. This classification is a useful approach to characterizing wetland and non-wetland reach settings, especially in screening out the least likely wetland-supporting or most constrained reaches within a watershed.\nChapter 4 used a suite of time series analyses to explore the hydrographs of five headwater wetlands in terms of their dynamics and response to climatic drivers.  Cross correlations between daily differences in water levels and precipitation showed significant correlations for most wetlands under dry and wet conditions on the same day time lag. Of the wetlands evaluated, all experienced a summer drawdown in water level except for the wettest sites in the wettest years. Further, the timing of the beginning of summer drawdown varied greatly for the period of record for the three studied wetlands (slope=61 days; headwater floodplain=58 days; and riparian depression=91 days) with the slope wetland drawing down earlier on average than headwater floodplain or slope wetlands (average  day of the year 132, 156, 152 respectively). The moving averages of the water levels generally followed the trends of the downstream stream baseflow, except for the wettest site in the wettest year. Though the hydrologic data are only available as a highly discontinuous record over a 10-year period, more continuous records when analyzed as case studies with time series analyses can give insight into the dynamics and responses of hydrologic behavior of headwater wetlands to climatic drivers. \nThis work is one step in a process to integrate scientific understanding and management of wetlands, floodplains, and streams as one inter-connected system. The River Ecosystem Synthesis Framework encourages this multi-system approach to understanding the 4-dimiensional nature of river ecosystems through the integration of principles and approaches of fluvial geomorphology and landscape ecology into stream ecology. However, the nature and functioning of wetlands in the river ecosystem needs to be incorporated into and advanced by this framework. The work in this study helps to move this integration forward by exploring the four-dimensional nature of headwater wetlands in the river ecosystem, which can contribute to this critical, but limited literature at the nexus between streams and wetlands.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3350], "author_name_tesi": "Hychka, Kristen  Carol", "last_name_ssi": "Hychka", "middle_name_ssi": "Carol", "first_name_ssi": "Kristen ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Brooks", "Robert P Brooks", "Alan H Taylor", "Douglas Alan Miller", "Christopher J Duffy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Brooks, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert P Brooks, Committee Chair", "Alan H Taylor, Committee Member", "Douglas Alan Miller, Committee Member", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wetlands", "landscape setting", "reach scale", "hydrologic regime", "headwaters"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Experimentally-manipulated achievement goal states regulate self-conscious emotional responses to feedback\n\n", "id": "11498", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "222", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Achievement motivation has direct links to emotions during competence pursuits and may potentially serve as a mechanism for regulating self-conscious emotions.

Physical activity regulation is a dual-process system of controlled (e.g., attitudes, intentions, task beliefs) and automatic (e.g., habits, automatic evaluations) processes. The controlled regulatory processes that are the focus of most conventional physical activity motivation theories, and the target of most interventions, are not translating into large, maintained behavior change. The broad aim of this dissertation is to add breadth to our understanding of physical activity motivation by investigating how the automatic processes of habits (behavioral response tendencies) and automatic evaluations (spontaneous classifications of stimuli as good or bad) regulate physical activity, while accounting for the dynamic nature of physical activity and controlled motivation of physical activity.\nThis dissertation consists of six studies that include measurement of physical activity habits and automatic evaluations, repeated assessments of controlled and automatic regulatory processes and physical activity, and direct- and self-reported assessments of physical activity. Data analyses techniques including hierarchical and multiple linear regression and structural equation modeling are used to investigate the automatic regulation of physical activity from between-person, within-person, and measurement perspectives. The results of the dissertation reveal that (1) habits regulate daily physical activity unless physical activity intentions are stronger than typical, (2) changes in automatic evaluations are linked to changes in physical activity when automatic evaluations become more favorable, (3) the validity of an implicit measure of automatic evaluations of physical activity is improved with a new scoring technique, and (4) automatic evaluations and habits regulate different components of physical activity.\nAs a result of this dissertation, it can be concluded that regular physical activity is the result of a dynamic and interactive dual-process system of controlled and automatic regulatory processes. Automatic processes regulate behavior when self-regulatory resources are depleted from stress, fatigue, or time pressure. People are feeling increasingly more stressed and crunched for time, so it may be that automatic regulatory processes can improve our understanding of what motivates regular physical activity. Future interventions targeting both controlled and automatic regulatory processes are likely to be the most effective for enhancing regular physical activity.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8305], "author_name_tesi": "Hyde, Amanda L.", "last_name_ssi": "Hyde", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David E Conroy", "Steriani Elavsky", "Nilam Ram", "Eric Loken", "Lacy Marie Alexander"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David E Conroy, Dissertation Advisor", "Steriani Elavsky, Committee Member", "Nilam Ram, Committee Member", "Eric Loken, Committee Member", "Lacy Marie Alexander, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["habits", "automatic evaluations", "implicit attitudes", "exercise", "behavior", "motivation"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "DETERMINING ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN NONTRADITIONALLY PREPARED AND TRADITIONALLY PREPARED CAREER AND \nTECHNICAL EDUCATION TEACHERS IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA\n", "id": "7644", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6507", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Our nation needs an educated and skilled workforce, but accomplishing this will require more than just visionary statements.

Often these contaminants are located in regions very difficult to reach by conventional methods.  However, suspensions of specifically tailored zerovalent iron particles transport through packed beds or soil to effectively remediate halogenated hydrocarbon contaminants, such as trichloroethylene (TCE), by chemical reduction to non-toxic products.  In order to study the transport of particles through the subsurface, sand and soil packed columns were designed.  With these columns, it is possible to quantify the amount of iron retained by the column and determine where in the column the iron particles are retained.  Experimental elution results were compared to contemporary transport models based on particle filtration through granular media.  Control experiments showed that unmodified iron particles rapidly agglomerated in water, and were filtered efficiently by the columns.  However, colloidal suspensions formed by combining iron particles with anionic transport agents achieved drastically improved iron particle elution through sand and soil packed columns.  Additional experiments showed that adding specific combinations of anionic hydrocolloids and polyelectrolytes to iron suspensions further enhanced particle transport, mainly by controlling particle aggregation.  Iron particle aggregation and subsequent sedimentation resulted for higher iron particle concentrations.  The incorporation of anionic hydrocolloids was found to affect aggregation, though further studies are underway.

Writings from this turbulent period are rife with the language of conscience.  While recent scholars have recognized the significance of this prevalent language in early modern England, important gaps remain.  After all, little attention has been paid to exactly how and why writers used the language of conscience so profusely in the midst of war and revolution.      \nThis thesis will demonstrate how the civil wars opened up a space in writing for politico-spiritual experimentation in which the language of conscience took on an unprecedented formative role, with conscience itself becoming an instrument for formulating and deploying radically new visions of the English nation.  More specifically, I argue that during this period the use of conscience undergoes a dramatic change:  it transitions from governing individual faith and behavior to political applications in revolutionary times.  This study brings a new dimension to our understanding of the ideological fluidity between the self and the state during the middle of the seventeenth-century.  In this way, focusing on conscience reintegrates the religious, political and social aspects of the English Revolution in a way never before considered, while also providing a new lens for evaluating issues of nationhood and national identity.  \n\tThis project examines the distinctive language of conscience used by five writers or groups of writers: Charles I, Oliver Cromwell, the Quakers, Lucy Hutchinson, and John Milton.  In chapter one, on Eikon Basilike (1649), I discuss how the text\u2019s authors used the King\u2019s conscience as a means to maintain his subjects\u2019 conscientious obedience even after the regicide.  In chapter two, on Cromwell\u2019s writings and speeches, I consider how Cromwell struggled to implement his program of liberty of conscience in England through his constitutional experiments of the 1650s.  In chapter three, on early Quaker writing, I demonstrate how the Quakers attempted to affect national change by appealing directly to Cromwell\u2019s conscience.  In chapter four, on Lucy Hutchinson\u2019s Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson, I argue that Hutchinson revised her husband\u2019s conscience so that he might become a republican hero, keeping alive the hope for a republican England.  In chapter five, I investigate how John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost (1667) employs the idea of conscience during the Restoration to cast the restored nation as ungodly, and thus provoke dissent from his fellow nonconformists.  Finally, in a brief epilogue, I discuss how Thomas Hobbes divests the individual conscience of its authority in favor of a \u201cnational conscience\u201d in Leviathan (1651). \n\tThis dissertation builds upon studies of early modern conscience, religion and nonconformity, writing of the English Revolution, and conceptions of the nation in the sixteenth and seventeenth-centuries.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2001], "author_name_tesi": "Iacono Lobo, Giuseppina Antonietta", "last_name_ssi": "Iacono Lobo", "middle_name_ssi": "Antonietta", "first_name_ssi": "Giuseppina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Laura Lunger Knoppers", "Laura Lunger Knoppers", "Patrick G Cheney", "Linda Woodbridge", "Clement Hawes", "A Gregg Roeber"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Laura Lunger Knoppers, Dissertation Advisor", "Laura Lunger Knoppers, Committee Chair", "Patrick G Cheney, Committee Member", "Linda Woodbridge, Committee Member", "Clement Hawes, Committee Member", "A Gregg Roeber, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["conscientious obedience", "liberty of conscience", "Conscience"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Bridging tourism and migration mobilities: Diaspora tourism as a coping strategy.

A recent emergence of the mobilities paradigm created potential for bridging the two knowledge networks and providing opportunities for crossover and mutual enrichment. Engaging with the intersection of tourism and migration mobilities, this study has a dual purpose. Theoretically it explores diaspora tourism as a promising link between tourism and migration. Practically diaspora tourism is offered as a coping strategy that can be used by immigrants to alleviate stress associated with relocation to a culturally dissimilar society.\n  In this dissertation three aspects of diaspora tourism are explored as they pertain to the fourth wave of Ukrainian immigrants in the United States. The first aspect concerns identity formation and adjustment issues Ukrainian immigrants experience upon arrival to the United States, and how these issues affect their relationship with and desire to visit Ukraine. The second aspect concerns immigrant imaginaries (i.e., images and ideas we hold in our consciousness) and the potential of diaspora tourism promotion through culturally grounded narratives created from accounts of immigrants\u2019 lived experiences. The processes of creating a culturally grounded narrative and its evaluation are presented. Finally, the third aspect concerns the act of corporeal travel of immigrants, and the possible predictors of such travel. Several predictors (e.g., context of migration, media use, self-construal, destination image) are drawn from different bodies of literature and their effects on the likelihood of visiting the homeland are investigated.\nKey findings of the dissertation are presented in three articles. In the first article, results show that the fourth wave of Ukrainian immigrants is unique in its nature as a labor diaspora, preference for assimilation, and transnational character. The second article demonstrates that a culturally grounded narrative can be created from recurring themes in immigrants\u2019 lived experiences. This narrative, which adhered to the effective narrative guidelines, is perceived by immigrants as more credible, informative and as a better persuasive tool for diaspora tourism than a neutral factual text. Regression analyses in the third article showed that age is an important predictor of diaspora tourism, and while not significant, effects of other variables on the likelihood of diaspora tourism are in the expected directions. \nA discussion of the results of this study are presented in the final chapter. The results were used to modify the project model and strengthen the theoretical links between tourism and migration domains, as well as provide insight into diaspora tourism as a coping strategy for immigrants.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9921], "author_name_tesi": "Iarmolenko, Svitlana ", "last_name_ssi": "Iarmolenko", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Svitlana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Garry Chick", "Carter A Hunt", "Fuyuan Shen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Dissertation Advisor", "Garry Chick, Committee Member", "Carter A Hunt, Committee Member", "Fuyuan Shen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tourism", "immigration", "mobilities", "diaspora", "Ukraine", "narratives"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau Superconductivity Model", "id": "15250oui101", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15250", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation we analyze the behavior of vortices in superconductors. The vortices might appear in a superconductor when it is immersed in a magnetic field and lead to the energy dissipation which makes them important to study.\nIn Chapter 1 we discuss the main concepts related to superconductivity and introduce the Ginzburg-Landau model that describes this phenomenon. We explain the nature of superconductivity and the Ginzburg-Landau model in both physical and mathematical aspects. The model itself describes the ground state of the superconductor that is the lowest energy state. Mathematically the ground state can be found via a minimization problem, where an energy functional is being minimized among all possible physical states to achieve the lowest possible value. The main focus of this work are the vortices that appear in superconductor as certain singularities when the applied magnetic field is strong enough. The appearance of vortices leads to the energy dissipation, therefore we introduce a way to suppress it via the pinning effect. Pinning happens when there is a columnar defect (CD) in a superconductor that traps nearby vortices to itself. In this work we consider a superconductor of a cylindrical shape so that it can be modeled by a 2D cross section. The columnar defects are then the cylindrical tunnels of damaged material, material with different conductivity, or an empty holes, that extend through the sample. Superconductivity is weakened in CDs and the energy cost of locating a vortex in this region is reduced.\nIn Chapter 2 (with L. Berlyand, V. Rybalko, and V. Vinokur [1]) we show that a particular configuration of the geometry of a superconducting sample as well as the strength of the magnetic field leads to the pinning effect which presents an unexpected distribution of pinned vortices. The CDs are arranged in a periodic lattice with a small period and mathematically modeled as holes with even smaller radii. We call the vortices in the CDs hole vortices as opposed to bulk vortices that appear outside of them. The degree of the hole vortex is a mathematical concept that essentially counts the number of vortices trapped in a CD. We assume that all vortices are pinned and none of them appear outside of CDs. This is\niii\nmodeled using a constraint |u| = 1, where u is the order parameter, the function that describes two conducting phases in a sample. Essentially this means that there is a perfect superconducting phase outside of CDs. Under this assumption, we find that a superconductor admits a hierarchical nested domain structure where these domains have a different average number of vortices pinned at each CD inside them. The average number of vortices follows the integer sequence starting at 0 in the outer subdomain with the only exception for the most inner subdomain where this number might be fractional. This ground state is completely different from what was observed before both experimentally and analytically.\nChapter 3 (with D. Golovaty, V. Rybalko, and L. Berlyand [2]) justifies the assumption used in Chapter 2. We consider a similar setting to the one used in Chapter 2 with CDs arranged randomly instead of periodically. The number of CDs is fixed and does not increase when their size becomes smaller. We show that this setting leads to the absence of vortices outside of CDs. Moreover, the absence of bulk vortices and the potential term in the Ginzburg-Landau energy suggest that the absolute value of the order parameter u should be close to 1 at the majority of the domain. This is shown by considering a constraint |u| = 1 on the Ginzburg-Landau energy minimization problem. We prove that the energies of both unconstrained and constrained problems are close to each other and their minimizers have the same degrees of the hole vortices at the corresponding CDs. This result allows us to consider a simpler S1-valued problem when we need to find the distribution of the degrees of the vortices that is exactly what was done in order to find the nested structure of subdomains in Chapter 2.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16803], "author_name_tesi": "Iaroshenko, Oleksandr ", "last_name_ssi": "Iaroshenko", "first_name_ssi": "Oleksandr", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonid V Berlyand", "Leonid V Berlyand", "Anna L Mazzucato", "Helge Kristian Jenssen", "Kenneth O'Hara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonid V Berlyand, Dissertation Advisor", "Leonid V Berlyand, Committee Chair", "Anna L Mazzucato, Committee Member", "Helge Kristian Jenssen, Committee Member", "Kenneth O'Hara, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["superconductivity", "Ginzburg-Landau", "variational problems", "vortices", "pinning"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER IN ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION: INPUTS TO WATERSHEDS AND INFLUENCES OF CLIMATE", "id": "13418lui100", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13418", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the atmosphere affects air quality and climate. Unlike inorganic constituents that typically consist of single compounds, DOM is a mixture of multiple organic compounds having varying molecular weights, reactivity and solubility. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is typically used as a measure of the total DOM present in solution. In the atmosphere, DOC originates from emissions of various biogenic and anthropogenic sources, such as vegetation, incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biomass burning, and sea-spray. The ultimate fate of atmospheric DOC is to be oxidized to inorganic forms of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, or to be removed from the atmosphere and transferred to the landscape through deposition.  Deposition can occur as wet deposition via precipitation and as dry deposition via surface settling of particles and gases. The concentration, or quantity, of DOC in precipitation plays an important role in the carbon cycle and in other elemental cycles; while the chemical composition, or quality, of DOC in precipitation largely determines its fate in the environment. Rain and snow deposited to the landscape are a source of nutrient enrichment to ecosystems and water bodies, and are especially important as an input of carbon in coastal regions. Since DOC in precipitation is highly chemically reactive and bioavailable it influences rates of productivity in aquatic ecosystems. Despite the significance of DOC to many ecosystem processes, knowledge about its contributions to landscapes in precipitation remains limited. With anthropogenic influences on the carbon cycle now widely recognized, the need for synthesis of existing datasets on atmospheric deposition of DOC and further determining its rates and drivers is great. My dissertation is focused on wet deposition of DOC and assesses the magnitude and patterns of variation of organic matter in precipitation over space and time.  The dissertation is organized into four manuscripts. \nChapter 1 is a literature review where I provide a new data synthesis from 83 contemporary, peer-reviewed studies where organic carbon (OC) in precipitation was measured at sites around the world.  Data regarding the concentrations of OC in precipitation and rates of atmospheric deposition were compiled in a common set of units and presented along with the summary statistics. These data give insights into the magnitude and regional variability of OC in precipitation. Organic carbon was ubiquitous in precipitation in rural and urban locations; with DOC in precipitation spanning several orders of magnitude between locations. This synthesis brings attention to atmospheric deposition as an under-sampled piece of the global carbon cycle; highlights gaps in data availability and challenges for data inter-comparison; and provides a unique data set  that can be used for toward exploring future changes in the carbon cycle. \nChapter 2 aims to understand how DOC concentration and composition in precipitation change temporally from storm to storm.  Precipitation samples were collected at the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory watershed (Pennsylvania, USA) during 90 storm events.  Observational data revealed temporal variability associated with seasonality and meteorological conditions.  Using a mixed modeling statistical approach, I showed that there are multiple processes that work in synergy to influence the quantity and quality of DOC in precipitation. Factors related to storm properties, emission sources, and to the chemical composition of the atmosphere could explain more than 60% of the storm to storm variability in DOC concentrations.  This study provided observations on changes in DOC that can be useful in modeling of atmospheric chemistry and in considering temporal changes in ecosystem nutrient balances and microbial activity.\nChapter 3 explores how DOC concentration and composition vary throughout the course of storm events.  I measured DOC in sequential samples during 13 storms at the Shale Hills  watershed.  The observational data generated hypotheses about potential factors that influence variability of DOC within storms.  While previous studies have observed that concentrations of other elements in precipitation typically decrease over the course of individual storms, results from this study showed that DOC concentrations are highly variable.  During most storms concentrations decreased towards the end of the event; however increasing concentrations in the later stages of some storms highlight that DOC removal with precipitation is not merely an exponential decay process. The variability of DOC during events is related to the balance between the cloud microphysics, atmospheric chemical transformations, and synoptic scale gradients in the abundance of organic compounds in the boundary layer. This work advances understanding of physicochemical processes occurring during storms that are relevant to studies of atmospheric chemistry, carbon cycling, and ecosystem responses.\nChapter 4 quantifies spatial gradients in wet atmospheric DOC deposition across the state of Pennsylvania (USA).  DOC concentrations were measured in selected precipitation samples collected for six years at a network of atmospheric deposition monitoring sites.  A simple modeling approach was used to estimate the first statewide, annual estimates of wet atmospheric DOC deposition.  Results showed that DOC inputs with wet deposition in Pennsylvania represented about one-third as much as literature reported values for DOC exported by rivers from watersheds in the region.  The rates of DOC wet deposition showed a pronounced seasonality and spatial distribution, with highest deposition rates observed in the summer, especially at the sites located in western Pennsylvania.

In the natural world, such motion is common.  Bacteria, for instance, use flagella, cilia, or other mechanisms to chemotax to nutrient-rich regions of their environments.  However, at the outset of this research, only a few simple examples of artificially powered motions on the microscale had been reported in the literature.\n\tThis dissertation discusses the evolution of artificial catalytic micromotors and micropumps from the initial bimetallic-microrod design, which catalyzed the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), to the current state of the field, in which particle motion can also be powered by hydrazine-derived fuels or by ultraviolet light.  Analyses of these new motors are presented, with particular emphasis given to the motor-motor interactions which occur in solution and which give rise to collective behavior in dense populations of the motors.\n\tThe first artificial autonomous micromotor ever synthesized consisted of a bimetallic microrod with spatially segregated gold and platinum segments.  When placed in aqueous solutions containing H2O2, this microrod decomposed the H2O2 asymmetrically on its two metallic surfaces and powered its own motion through solution via self-electrophoresis.  In this dissertation, it is shown that a similar self-electrophoretic mechanism is at play in a micropump system comprised of spatially segregated, lithographically patterned, palladium and gold features, which operates in solutions of either hydrazine (N2H4) or N,N-dimethylhydrazine [(CH3)2N(NH3)].  While this new electrophoretic system is interesting from a theoretical standpoint, N2H4 is highly toxic, and the decision was made to move on to other more environmentally friendly systems.\n\tThe bulk of this dissertation therefore details experiments performed on silver chloride (AgCl) particles, a newly discovered autonomous micromotor system, discovered by the author, which exhibits collective behaviors that have never before been seen in wholly artificial microscale systems.  When placed in deionized water and illuminated with ultraviolet (UV) light, these colloids decompose into protons, chloride ions, oxygen gas, and silver metal.  The difference in the diffusion constants of the two ions creates an electric field in solution which powers the motion of the particles.  Over time, the ion gradients of nearby particles overlap and collective behavior of the particles is observed.  Modeling of this phenomenon was performed using the programming language NetLogo.\n\tOver time, silver metal plates out onto the particle surface and ultimately poisons the reaction.  For this reason, it was decided to add H2O2 to the system in an attempt to oxidize away the silver metal byproduct and regenerate a fresh AgCl surface.  Surprisingly, the UV-induced decomposition reaction and the peroxide-related oxidation reaction appear to occur via oscillatory kinetics.  As a result, the AgCl colloids are seen to exhibit oscillatory motion: switching between periods where they quickly traverse several body lengths over the course of about a second and times during which they are attached to the underlying glass slide and are therefore immobile.  In high density populations of these oscillators, the oscillating reactions of individual particles synchronize, resulting in waves of particle motion which traverse the system.  Because this system exhibits non-linear oscillatory kinetics, it was possible to begin the oscillations starting with a different set of reactants, namely silver metal, chloride ions, and H2O2.  This allowed for the measurement of the electrical current associated with the reaction, as silver electrodes can be easily prepared.\n\tFinally, this dissertation concludes with a discussion of a somewhat unrelated project: the template synthesis of flexible nanowires, in which the silver sections of bimetallic nanorods are replaced with carbonaceous impurities or poly(allylamine hydrochloride).\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4062, 4063, 4064, 4065], "author_name_tesi": "Ibele, Michael Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Ibele", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen", "Ayusman Sen", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Jeffrey M Catchmark"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen, Dissertation Advisor", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Chair", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Jeffrey M Catchmark, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["colloids", "nanoparticles", "silver chloride", "oscillating reaction", "nanomotors"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "INDUCTION AND METABOLIC ENGINEERING OF FLAVONOID DEFENSE COMPOUNDS IN SORGHUM AND MAIZE\n", "id": "8229", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "1957", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sorghum is closely related to maize but has a better ability to withstand biotic and abiotic stress. To gain insights into the possible reasons underlying such difference, a comparative characterization of genes and traits has been conducted. We have investigated the flavonoid pathway in these two species. This research indicated that sorghum and maize differ substantially in their ability to synthesize flavonoid compounds. For example, sorghum plants respond to anthracnose and leaf blight fungi by synthesis of flavonoid antifungal compounds (phytoalexins). However, maize plants do not produce simillar compounds in response to fungal attack. Therefore, we used sorghum as a model system to understand the biosynthetic routes of the flavonoid phytoalexins and attempted to engineer the production of these compounds in maize. \nSorghum phytoalexins belong to the 3-deoxyanthocyanidin class which includes luteolinidin, apigeninidin and their derivatives. These compounds are produced in response to fungal attack and appear as red-brown pigments at the primary infection sites. Their antifungal activity against many fungi has been demonstrated; however, the lack of well defined phytoalexin deficient mutants has hampered the understanding of the mechanisms underlying their biosynthesis. These compounds have chemical structures similar to that of flavan-4-ols, the precursor of phlobaphene pigments that appear in sorghum floral tissues and mature leaves, suggesting that these two flavonoid classes may be synthesized via a common or an overlapping pathway. The biosynthesis of flavan-4-ols is under the control of an R2R3 myb transcription factor encoded by yellow seed1 (y1). \nTo gain a better understanding of the possible role of y1 in controlling sorghum phytoalexins, we used a transposon-based approach and developed near-isogenic sorghum lines that differ in the functionality of y1. Molecular and phenotypic analyses of one of these lines (y1-ww) revealed the presence of an internal deletion in y1 and such deletion rendered y1 non-functional. The gene expression analysis of the fungal inoculated isogenic lines indicated that the expression of the phytoalexin biosynthetic genes is y1 dependent. Comparison of the phytoalexin biosynthetic ability of these lines demonstrated that y1 mutant is phytoalexin deficient. The y1 activity was also positively correlated with the resistance against anthracnose disease. These results provide direct genetic evidence that y1 is necessary for the biosynthesis of sorghum 3-deoxyanthocyanidins and resistance against anthracnose disease.\n Like sorghum, maize accumulates flavan-4-ols in the floral tissues but not in leaves. The biosynthesis of these compounds in maize is under the control of pericarap color1 (p1).  p1 and y1 are orthologues with a high degree of similarity in their coding sequences but very low similarity in the regulatory regions . These two genes have almost the same pattern of expression except that y1 is significantly expressed in leaf and is induced by fungal infection. Therefore, we developed transgenic maize lines expressing either an Y1::GUS fusion or the intact y1 gene driven by its own promoter. These plants were used to test the hypothesis that the expression of y1 in leaves and its induction by the fungus is a property of the y1 promoter. Analysis of the Y1::GUS plants revealed that y1 promoter has constitutive low expression in maize floral and vegetative tissues and is responsive to fungal infection. Interestingly, y1 induced phlobaphene pigmentation in maize floral tissues and these phenotypes were stably inherited through generations. In addition, y1 successfully drives the flavonoid pathway in maize leaves towards the biosynthesis of flavan-4-ols, and induces the biosynthesis of indigenous as well as novel flavonoid and phenylpropanoid compounds in maize leaves. The accumulation of these defense-related compounds in transgenic maize leaves resulted in an enhanced resistance against corn southern leaf blight. These results suggest that possible evolutionary modifications in y1 and p1 promoters might be responsible for the differential flavonoid profiles of sorghum and maize in response to fungal attack.\nThe biosynthesis of sorghum phytoalexins occurs rapidly after fungal attack and involves activation of y1 and its target genes. The signaling cascades upstream of the biosynthesis of these compounds are unknown. The dissection of the y1 promoter revealed the presence of cis recognition sequences that have been shown to be targets of signaling compounds such as JA, ABA, and WRKY proteins. Simultaneous phytohormonal  analysis during 3-deoxyanthocyanidins biosynthesis indicated that sorghum phytoalexins are associated with early induction of JA and IAA, and either no change or reduction of ABA respectively. A hypothetical model for signal transduction during sorghum phytoalexin biosynthesis is proposed\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1939], "author_name_tesi": "Ibraheem, Farag I.

These targets have impacts on the development of renewable energy in PJM states. Some of the impacts of renewable portfolio standards on the development of wind and solar energy in PJM states are examined in this study.\nThis study makes several significant contributions to existing literature on renewable portfolio standards. Renewable portfolio standards are expected to increase the fraction of electricity generation expected to come from wind and solar resources over the next few years. Wind accounted for over 60% of new generation in PJM in 2010[PJM, 2010].  This study is the first to develop an economic basis for the development of wind energy in PJM states by developing a supply curve for wind energy and projecting the cost of developing wind in PJM states to meet the requirements in 2020. The success of a renewable portfolio standard is dependent on knowing where the most cost-effective renewable sources are [Hurlbut, 2008]. This is the first study to make suggestions on the most cost effective regions to build wind generation in PJM by comparing wind potential in the Midwest states and states outside the Midwest. To achieve this, supply curves are built for each of the states in PJM and for PJM as a whole based on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of wind in PJM. The cost of wind in the year 2020 is evaluated by making projections for the demand of wind energy using the average growth rate of electricity from 2000-2010.\nSome states in PJM impose solar set-asides for the achievement of renewable portfolio standards. These requirements for solar energy are achieved by retiring Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs). As solar requirements increase, SREC markets are expected to grow rapidly [Bird et al, 2011]. Some renewable Portfolio Standards in PJM states have cross-border restrictions on the trade of Solar Renewable Energy Credits. This paper is the first to carry out a study on the short-run effect of cross-border trade policies on the prices of SRECs and on the wealth of State using a cross-border trade model. New Jersey is used as a case study because they have the most dominant SREC market [Bird et al, 2011] in PJM. The producer and consumer surplus as a result of trade in the New Jersey and rest of PJM market is assessed.  A free trade and an import quota at 42% of the demand scenarios are assessed for the short-run impact on the New Jersey economy.  Free trade places no restrictions on the number of SRECs from outside New Jersey.\nIt was discovered that wind development in PJM is cheaper in the Midwestern states because more wind energy can be produced in the Midwestern states at each LCOE. The competitive cost of developing wind energy in the year 2020 in PJM could rise to as much as $5.7 billion if 10% of electricity demand is met by wind. The short- run effects of imports in the New Jersey SRECs market show that there is no increase in wealth in New Jersey from lifting restrictions on the trade of SRECs. Producers of SRECs in the rest of PJM benefit from New Jersey adopting a free market or an import-quota trade policy in the New Jersey market. This means that in the short-run, New Jersey should be indifferent about adopting the free trade policy.  In the long-run, as more SRECs are produced wealth will be created in New Jersey.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7098], "author_name_tesi": "Idrisu, Babatunde ", "last_name_ssi": "Idrisu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Babatunde", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Renewable Portfolio Standard", "PJM", "Wind", "Solar"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Searching for gravitational waves from neutron stars ", "id": "24255", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10896", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation we discuss gravitational waves (GWs) and their neutron star\n(NS) sources. We begin with a general discussion of the motivation for searching\nfor GWs and the indirect experimental evidence of their existence. Then we discuss\nthe various mechanisms through which NS can emit GWs, paying special attention\nthe r-mode oscillations. Finally we end with discussion of GW detection.\n\nIn Chapter 2 we describe research into the frequencies of r-mode oscillations.\nKnowing these frequencies can be useful for guiding and interpreting gravitational\nwave and electromagnetic observations. The frequencies of slowly rotating,\nbarotropic, and non-magnetic Newtonian stars are well known, but subject to\nvarious corrections. After making simple estimates of the relative strengths of these\ncorrections we conclude that relativistic corrections are the most important. For\nthis reason we extend the formalism of K. H. Lockitch, J. L. Friedman, and N.\nAndersson [Phys. Rev. D 68, 124010 (2003)], who consider relativistic polytropes,\nto the case of realistic equations of state. This formulation results in perturbation\nequations which are solved using a spectral method. We find that for realistic\nequations of state the r-mode frequency ranges from 1.39\u20131.57 times the spin\nfrequency of the star when the relativistic compactness parameter (M/R) is varied\nover the astrophysically motivated interval 0.110\u20130.310. Following a successful\nr-mode detection our results can help constrain the high density equation of state.\n\nIn Chapter 3 we present a technical introduction to the data analysis tools used\nin GW searches. Starting from the plane-wave solutions derived in Chapter 1 we\ndevelop the F-statistic used in the matched filtering technique. This technique\nrelies on coherently integrating the GW detector\u2019s data stream with a theoretically\nmodeled wave signal. The statistic is used to test the null hypothesis that the data\ncontains no signal. In this chapter we also discuss how to generate the parameter\nspace of a GW search so as to cover the largest physical range of parameters,\nwhile keeping the search computationally feasible. Finally we discuss the timedomain\nsolar system barycentered resampling algorithm as a way to improve to\nthe computational cost of the analysis.\n\nIn Chapter 4 we discuss a search for GWs from two supernova remnants, G65.7\nand G330.2. The searches were conducted using data from the 6th science run of the\nLIGO detectors. Since the searches were modeled on the Cassiopeia A search paper,\nAbadie et. al. [Astrophys. J. 722,1504\u20131513, 2010], we also used the frequency\nand the first and second derivatives of the frequency as the parameter space of the\nsearch. There are two main differences from the previous search. The first is the use\nof the resampling algorithm, which sped up the calculation of the F-statistic by a\nfactor of 3 and thus allowed for longer stretches of data to be coherently integrated.\nBeing able to integrate more data meant that we could beat the indirect limit on\nGWs expected from these sources. We used a 51 day integration time for G65.7 and\n24 days for G330.2. The second difference is that the analysis pipeline is now more\nautomated. This allows for a more efficient data analysis process. We did not find\na credible source of GWs and so we placed upper limits on the gravitational wave\nstrain, ellipticity, and r-mode amplitude of the sources. The best upper-limit for\nthe strain was 3.0\u00d710^(\u221225), for ellipticity it was 7.0\u00d710^(\u22126) and for r-mode amplitude\nit was 2.2 \u00d7 10^(\u22124).", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10486], "author_name_tesi": "Idrisy, Ashikuzzaman ", "last_name_ssi": "Idrisy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ashikuzzaman", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin Owen", "Benjamin Owen", "Martin Bojowald", "Sarah Elizabeth Shandera", "Michael Eracleous"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin Owen, Dissertation Advisor", "Benjamin Owen, Committee Chair", "Martin Bojowald, Committee Member", "Sarah Elizabeth Shandera, Committee Member", "Michael Eracleous, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["neutron stars", "gravitational waves"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Essays on Matching Models", "id": "14551", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7466", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Chapter 1\nWe provide a stability analysis of the two monetary steady states in a random matching model of money where money is indivisible, the upper bound on individual money holding is two units, and the trading protocol in the match is a buyer take-it-or-leave-it offer.

The non-full-support steady state is unstable. \n\nChapter 2\nThis is extension of the instability result of the non-full-support steady state studied in chapter 1. We study stability of a monetary steady state in a random \nmatching model of money where money is indivisible, the upper bound \non individual money holding is finite, and the trading protocol is buyer take-it-or-leave-it offers. \nThe steady state we study has a nonfull-support money-holding distribution.

Lotteries improve welfare and eliminate the two notable features of the optimum with deterministic trades: over-production and history-dependence.

The need for this new source of communal support arose from the silence and inactions of traditional black institutions as it pertained to crisis.

Based on cell culture experiments, it has been shown that PERK is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and subsequently represses global protein synthesis by phosphorylating its substrate, the alpha subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2 alpha).  Because the general translation repression results in the reduction of newly synthesized protein entering the ER, this function of PERK has been considered as an adaptive response to the accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER (i.e., ER stress).  According to the most widely stated hypothesis, the major function of PERK in vivo is also explained by this response against ER stress.  This model predicts that highly secretory cells, which are assumed to have fluctuating ER stress as part of normal functions, would be unable to control translation in the absence of PERK.  Consequently the Perk-/- cells would be predicted to accumulate ER stress and eventually die through apoptosis (referred as the ER stress-UPR model in this thesis). \n     In this project, however, I have found that the absence of PERK does not result in elevated ER stress or apoptosis in pancreatic acinar cells in vivo.  The Perk-/- exocrine pancreas shows pancreatitis-like phenotypes with massive oncotic cell death starting around postnatal day 19.  Analyses of acinar cell-specific conditional Perk knockout mice have revealed that this phenotype is cell-autonomous to acinar cells with a very high penetrance.  Contrary to what is predicted by the ER stress-UPR model, the mutant acinar cells show normal protein synthesis rates and secretion before the onset of extensive cell death.  Surprisingly, ER stress marker genes are not significantly elevated either before or during the period of the cell death.  Moreover, analyses on the form of cell death indicate that mutant acinar cells die through oncosis rather than apoptosis.  These results suggest that a major in vivo function of PERK in pancreatic acinar cells is different from alleviation of ER stress proposed by the ER stress-UPR model.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3514], "author_name_tesi": "Iida, Kaori ", "last_name_ssi": "Iida", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kaori", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster", "Richard W Ordway", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Pamela J Mitchell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster, Committee Chair", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Pamela J Mitchell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["acinar cells", "oncosis", "pancreatitis", "PERK", "ER stress"]}]
