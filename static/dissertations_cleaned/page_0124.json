Antennas using some of these geometries for various telecommunications applications are already available commercially. The use of fractal geometries has been shown to improve several antenna features to varying extents.  Yet a direct corroboration between antenna characteristics and geometrical properties of underlying fractals has been missing.  This research work is intended as a first step to fill this gap.\nIn terms of antenna performance, fractal shaped geometries are believed to result in multi-band characteristics and reduction of antenna size.  Although the utility of different fractal geometries varies in these aspects, nevertheless they are primary motives for fractal antenna design.  For example, monopole and dipole antennas using fractal Sierpinski gaskets have been widely reported and their multiband characteristics have been associated with the self-similarity of the geometry.  However this qualitative explanation may not always be realized, especially with other fractal geometries.  A quantitative link between multiband characteristics of the antenna and a mathematically expressible feature of the fractal geometry is needed for design optimization.  To explore this, a Koch curve is chosen as a candidate geometry, primarily because its similarity dimension can be varied from 1 to 2 by changing a geometrical parameter (indentation angle).  Extensive numerical simulations presented here indicate that this variation has a direct impact on the primary resonant frequency of the antenna, its input resistance at this frequency, and the ratio of the first two resonant frequencies.  In other words, these antenna features can now be quantitatively linked to the fractal dimension of the geometry.  This finding can lead to increased flexibility in designing antennas using these geometries.  These results have been experimentally validated.\nThe relationship between the fractal dimension and multiband characteristics of fractal shaped antennas has been verified using other fractal geometries as well.  The physical appearance of fractal a binary tree can be varied by either changing the branching angle, or using different scale factors between the lengths of the stem and branches of the tree.  While the change in angle does not affect its fractal dimension, the scale factor does.  A similar trend is observed in the multiband characteristics of monopole antennas using these geometries.  This confirms similar findings based on Koch curves.  It may however be mentioned that this correlation between multiband nature of the antenna and the fractal dimension of the geometry could not yet be linked across different geometries having the same dimension.\nApart from these theoretical findings, this research is also directed towards designing antennas with unconventional features.  The multiband characteristic of the Sierpinski gasket antenna has been experimentally modified, for octave bandwidth using a ferroelectric substrate material along with an absorber layer. It has also been shown that these antennas can be converted to a conformal configuration with relative ease, without loosing much of its bandwidth.  However the presence of absorbers cause some loss in energy, necessitating a compromise between bandwidth and efficiency of the antenna.\nThe space filling nature of Hilbert curves lead to significant reduction in antenna size.  This has been explored numerically and validated experimentally.  One of the advantages of using fractal geometries in small antennas is the order associated with these geometries in contrast to an arbitrary meandering of random line segments (which may also result in small antennas).  However this fact has not been used in antenna design thus far.  In this work, approximate expressions for designing antennas with these geometries have been derived incorporating their fractal nature.  Numerical simulations presented here also indicate that antenna size can be further reduced by superimposing one fractal geometry (Koch curve) along line segments of another (Hilbert curve). \nDue to the presence of a large number of closely placed line segments, antennas using Hilbert curves can be designed for reconfigurable radiation characteristics with the inclusion of few additional line segments and RF switches. Although these switch positions are not optimized for specific performance, they offer immense potential for designing antennas with novel characteristics.\nTo conclude, the research work reported here is a numerical and experimental study in identifying features of fractal shaped antennas that could impart increased flexibility in the design of newer generation wireless systems. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3436], "author_name_tesi": "Vinoy, Kalarickaparambil Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Vinoy", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Kalarickaparambil", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vasundara V Varadan", "Vasundara V Varadan", "Douglas Henry Werner", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Jose K Kollakompil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vasundara V Varadan, Committee Chair", "Vasundara V Varadan, Committee Member", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Member", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Member", "Jose K Kollakompil, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fractals", "Antennas", "multifrequency antennas", "Wire antennas"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Deconstructing the Myth of California:\nGender and Race in Disney's California Adventure\n\n", "id": "10078", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4333", "abstract_tesi": "Disney turns fantasy into reality. \u201cImagineers\u201d are Disney\u2019s team of dream makers responsible for creating the magic.

As the dependence on autonomous decision-making agents increases, it is of importance to understand and quantify the uncertainty associated with the decisions from machine learning frameworks. In order to facilitate the interaction with human agents (e.g., maintenance engineers and medical doctors) as well as to enable robust control for safety (e.g., autonomous navigation and sensor network adaptation), density estimation enables quantification of uncertainty in the output of a learning framework. In statistical learning, density estimation is a core problem, where the objective is to identify the underlying distribution from which the data are being generated. In this work, density estimation is established as a practical tool for data-driven modeling. A new and simple technique for density estimation is developed using concepts from statistical learning and optimization theory. Along with detection, classification, estimation, and tracking, which are crucial in learning and control, these models can also quantify uncertainty in their outputs.\n\n\nThis dissertation uses density estimation for developing new methods to solve practical problems of learning and decision-making. A few restrictive assumptions have been eliminated from these problems, yet tractable and accurate methods have been developed in this research. Specifically, in the sequential classification problem, the naive Bayes' assumption of conditional independence between measurements, given state, is relaxed. A novel technique to learn a unified context from multi-modal sensor data is developed. This knowledge of context is used to achieve tractable and accurate multi-modal sensor fusion, which cannot be achieved using the naive Bayes' assumption. Additionally, the context-aware measurement models are also used for unifying state estimation and dynamic sensor selection problems in a stochastic control framework. In sequential hypothesis testing with streaming data, the assumption that the observation sequence is independent and identically distributed (IID) has been removed by developing sequential tests for Markov models of time-series data. Further, density estimation has been used to create Markov models from multidimensional time-series data by developing a unified formulation for alphabet-size selection and measurement-space partitioning. In sequential tracking, the assumption of additive Gaussian noise has been eliminated by learning nonparametric density estimation-based measurement models, which can capture all the uncertainties in a given set of data. These measurement models have been used for state estimation and tracking with particle filters. In a sequential measurement model learning setting, the labels provided by instructors are allowed to be incorrect as the assumption of the instructor being perfect has not been used. A recursive density estimation algorithm has been developed and analyzed to show that correct models can be obtained even with noisy labels. \n\n\nIn physical systems, the assumptions noted above, usually do not hold due to causal dependencies, physical constraints, operating conditions, various uncertainties, etc., and hence have been selectively relaxed. The theoretical frameworks developed in this research have been validated using simulations and real-world experiments. The practical applications covered in this dissertation include target detection and classification in border surveillance, indoor localization of smart wheelchairs with user-assistance for safety during navigation, and detection of combustion instability using streaming data. These widely differing real-world problems have been used to illustrate the general applicability of the results developed in this thesis. It is envisioned that the formulations and results from this dissertation will be useful in data-driven modeling, real-time decision-making, and robust control of physical systems, making them more intelligent.

For the first time ROM of a geometrically mistuned industrial scale rotor (Transonic rotor) with large size of Finite Element (FE) model is generated using MMDA. Two methods for estimating mass and stiffness mistuning matrices are used a) exact computation from sector FE analysis, b) estimates based on POD mistuning parameters.

In this research, we develop a mathematical model that describes determinant processes of tumor progression at the cellular and tumor levels including signal transduction, proliferation and migration of individual tumor cells, vasculature degeneration and angiogenesis. The model is based in the agent based modeling framework, which is combined with a realistic description of the spatial-temporal distribution of the biochemical cues that affect the behavior of the tumor cells. We deploy the model to investigate different underlying mechanisms of tumor progression. We start by analyzing the effect of the tumor cells response to chemotactic cues on the progression of the tumors. Subsequently, we focus on the role of angiogenesis, which is believed to be essential for the progression of these tumors. Finally, we simulate the effect of different treatment strategies of a chemotherapeutic agent on two tumors mimicking real orthotopic models of glioma. \nSimulation results suggest that the response of the tumor cells to chemotactic cues is a major determinant of tumor invasion. Moreover, the chemotactic response is tightly coupled with the tumor-induced remodeling of the vasculature, especially with the vessel occlusion. The model is able to quantitatively recapitulate experimental data from treatments of orthotopic models of glioma with a chemotherapeutic agent. Simulation results suggest an intricate relationship between tumor growth, vasculature remodeling and the anti-tumor activity of the chemotherapy.

High-resolution information on soil restrictive layers is urgently needed for use in hydrologic modeling and land management planning.  In this dissertation, I investigate the types and distribution of soil restrictive layers and evaluate three different methods for obtaining high-resolution datasets of soil restrictive layers, including i.) the use of soil morphological features: fragic properties or fragipans (Bx horizons) and low chroma (\u2264 2) depletions (LCDs) in soil cores, ii.) ground penetrating radar (GPR), and iii.) electromagnetic induction (EMI).  I relate morphological indications of restriction (i.e. LCDs) to measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) from borehole permeameter measurements and water table levels from shallow wells monitored over 2.5 years.  I use particle size analysis to investigate the presence of a lithologic discontinuity observed during soil morphological observations.  I use logistic regression and correlation to determine significant relationships between restrictive layer presence/absence and depth (determined using the three methods) and LIDAR-derived topographic variables.  Topographic variables investigated include: aspect, slope, planform curvature, profile curvature, total curvature, topographic wetness index, specific contributing area, and topographic position index.  The logistic regression models were evaluated based on known soil information from well-studied watersheds in the Ridge and Valley Province of Pennsylvania, wet boot mapping of saturated regions, cross-validation, a validation dataset of 112 soil cores, and comparisons to SSURGO.  \n\tI found that soils containing LCDs had significantly (p = 0.003) lower Ksat (mean Ksat = 0.018 cm hr-1) than those without LCDs (mean Ksat = 2.8 cm hr-1) and that soils with LCDs had active, shallow water tables during 2.5 years of water table monitoring.  I found that 87% and 27% of soil cores that were described as having fragic properties had a lithologic discontinuity at or above the Bx horizon (for FD-36 and Mattern watersheds, respectively).  Particle size analysis confirmed the presence of a lithologic discontinuity; clay-free silt percent was significantly (p < 0.05) greater above the lithologic discontinuity, and rock fragment volume percent and clay-free sand percent were significantly greater (p < 0.05) below the discontinuity.  Correlations between depth to Bx/LCDs and individual topographic variables (for the FD-36 and Mattern combined dataset) were very low (|r| <0.33; p < 0.05) or insignificant (p > 0.05), which suggests that a simple, linear model predicting depth to a restrictive layer is not possible based on the data collected; this may be due to different amounts and patterns of erosion and deposition between the FD-36 and Mattern watersheds.  \n\tGround penetrating radar and EMI surveys were useful for obtaining high-resolution data on soil depth and continuity of soil restrictive layers; however, these methods had limitations for mapping precise boundaries between soils containing restrictive layers and those without soil restrictive layers. Analysis of GPR radar images showed that there were strong radar reflections for fragipans, horizons with fragic properties, high clay subsoils, and BC and CB transitional horizons; however, due to similar patterns in radar reflections, it was difficult to differentiate between the types of horizons/interfaces without corresponding morphological information.  \n\tElectromagnetic induction was used to predict soil restrictive layers based on the assumption that soil restrictive layers have high apparent conductivity (ECa) because they are wet, have high subsoil clay, and/or have a high bulk density.  Although some variation in ECa was explained by soil moisture and soil particle size and rock fragment content (10.5 < r 2 < 54.8); part of the unexplained variation in ECa is probably due to differences in soil depth, which varies from < 0.5 m on sideslopes to > 1.5 m on footslopes.  Based on soil information and the spatial extent of surface saturated regions mapped using the wet boot technique, I conclude that ECa data is useful for modeling soil restrictive layers in steeply-sloping watersheds (approximately 25\u00b0-45\u00b0) like Mattern because they have shallow, coarse-textured soils located in backslope and shoulder landscape positions (generating low ECa values) and deep, high clay/moisture soils in footslopes positions (generating high ECa values).  Shallower-sloping watersheds (< 25\u00b0) like FD-36, on the other hand, have relatively deep soils (> 1 m) and moderate clay contents (20%-30%) in backslope and shoulder positions, generating relatively high ECa values where restrictive layers do not occur. \n\tThe best tool of those tested for developing landscape models of soil restrictive layers is the use of LCDs.  Validation testing using skill scores showed that the two best models for predicting soil restrictive layers (as mapped using LCDs) were those based on i.) low topographic position index (TPI) and ii.) a combination of low TPI and low slope. Low TPI (low lying areas) is important for describing the distribution of soil restrictive layers because restrictive layers in these watersheds are colluvium-derived.  These two models had proportion correct predictions of 0.71 and 0.74, respectively; had substantially higher hit rates compared to SSURGO (hit rates were 0.63 and 0.51, respectively for the two models; and 0.34 for SSURGO); and were able to pinpoint restrictive layers in regions that were mapped as well-drained by SSURGO. The models also intersect with a majority of the surface-saturated regions (> 92%) documented using the wet boot mapping technique. \n\tThe resulting logistic regression models have applications for nutrient management and hydrologic modeling. Specifically, these models can be used to improve calculations of runoff potential in Pennsylvania\u2019s P-Index or as an input layer in hydrologic models to improve flow routing and predictions of saturated regions.  Although the specific models developed in this dissertation are only applicable for the nonglaciated region of the Ridge and Valley Province of the northeastern USA, the methods developed here may be used as framework to model soil restrictive layers in other geomorphic regions.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16811], "author_name_tesi": "Vitko, Lauren Frances", "last_name_ssi": "Vitko", "middle_name_ssi": "Frances", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick Joseph Drohan", "Patrick Joseph Drohan", "Richard Charles Stehouwer", "Peter Kleinman", "Douglas Alan Miller", "James Hamlett", "Anthony Buda"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick Joseph Drohan, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick Joseph Drohan, Committee Chair", "Richard Charles Stehouwer, Committee Member", "Peter Kleinman, Committee Member", "Douglas Alan Miller, Outside Member", "James Hamlett, Outside Member", "Anthony Buda, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["soil-landscape modeling", "digital soil mapping", "ground penetrating radar", "electromagnetic induction", "soil depletions"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Investigation of a Balanced-Armature Transducer for Vibrational Energy Harvesting\n\n\n", "id": "12164", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4729", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<p style=\"text-indent: 1em;\">There are countless portable devices that rely on batteries to operate. In some applications, replacing or recharging batteries is not feasible or is very costly.

The device under study is the Knowles CI-28409 balanced armature transducer. In addition to being commercially available, the CI-28409 is attractive because it has an overall device volume of just 0.28 cm3. Moreover, the use of balanced armature transducers for energy harvesting has yet to be explored in the literature.\n\n<p style=\"text-indent: 1em;\">A primary contribution of this work is the development of an analog circuit model of the CI-28409, which captures the behavior of the device when subjected to vibration inputs. In addition, electrical input impedance measurements and vibration response measurements of the CI-28409 are made. These measurements are used to verify the validity of the model and to establish the baseline performance of the device as an energy harvester.\n\n<p style=\"text-indent: 1em;\">The model and measurements show that using the CI-28409 as an energy harvesting device without any modifications is impractical. For an input acceleration of 9.8 m/s2 applied to the housing of the CI-28409, measurements showed that the device is only capable of producing a maximum of roughly 80 nW into an 825&#937; resistor at 1.7 kHz. However, the proposed model predicts that, by modifying the design so that the vibrations are applied to the armature while allowing the rest of the device to move freely, the Knowles CI-28409 may be able to produce as much as 57 &#956;W of power for an input acceleration of 8.8 m/s2 at 250 Hz.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4694], "author_name_tesi": "Vitt, Nikolas Troy", "last_name_ssi": "Vitt", "middle_name_ssi": "Troy", "first_name_ssi": "Nikolas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Thompson", "Stephen Thompson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Thompson, Thesis Advisor", "Stephen Thompson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy harvesting", "Balanced-armature", "transducer"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "WHAT IMPACT DOES THE SOFTWARE STUDY ISLAND HAVE ON 4SIGHT, PSSA, AND NOCTI ASSESSMENTS OF PART-TIME CTE STUDENTS?\n\n", "id": "12643", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6128", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\nThe impact of the No Child Left Behind Legislation has left Career and Technical Education searching for methods and strategies to infuse academics into their curriculum to help students, through a rigorous and integrated educational experience, develop competencies required for higher education and ultimately, work.

Research on the effects of these variables may be useful in helping a program determine what contributes to a student\u2019s success on the exam.

A quantitative research method was used for this study.  Participants in the study were students at the Pennsylvania College of Technology, School of Transportation and Natural Resources Technologies majoring in one of the following Associates Degrees: Automotive Technology, Automotive Technology Ford ASSET emphasis, Automotive Technology Honda PACT emphasis; or the Automotive Service Technician Certificate program.  Students who complete all of their automotive major classes during the spring 2017 semester and complete the ASE Student Certification Exams were selected for the study.  Of the 57 students who met the criteria in order to participate, 56 volunteered to participate.  The data were obtained from Pennsylvania College of Technology records, ASE Student Certification Exam results, and an investigator developed questionnaire.  Pearson Product Moment Correlations and a Spearman rank-correlation were calculated to determine the best predictors of success on the ASE Student Certification Exam.  \nAs a result of this study, it has been discovered that there is a direct correlation between performance in both Physics Survey (PHS103) and Technical Algebra and Trigonometry 1 (MTH124) and the ASE Student Certification Exam.  It was also found that students who are required to participate in remedial math and/or remedial reading courses were likely to perform at a lower level than their counterparts on the exam.  While work experience generally did not correlate to performance on the exam, automotive work experience did, suggesting the importance of applying the concepts learned in education out in the workforce.  It was also found that students who participated in a secondary automotive CTE program were no more likely to perform well on the ASE Student Certification Exam.

This dissertation advances the literature on autonomic nervous system (ANS) development in infancy and toddlerhood and ANS-behavior associations by investigating patterns of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity with a latent profile modeling approach, at a single measurement occasion and over time, and the prediction of emotion regulation and early childhood behavior problems by ANS profile.  In addition, predictors of ANS profiles were examined, including features of the early social environment and prenatal cigarette use.  Data was drawn from the Family Life Project, an ongoing longitudinal study of children and families living in low-income, non-urban communities.  Study 1 explored latent profiles of autonomic nervous system functioning indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) in children ages 7-, 15-, and 24-months, and the relationship of ANS profile at each measurement occasion with concurrent emotion regulation behavior (7-month n=325; 15-month n=341; 24-month n=330). A three profile solution of child ANS activity, indicated by baseline RSA, RSA suppression, and baseline sAA, was supported at 7- and 15-months of age.  At 7-months, children in the \u201ccoactivation\u201d profile showed a greater proportion of self-soothing behavior during a fear- and frustration-eliciting task in comparison to children in the \u201cPNS inhibition\u201d and \u201cPNS activation\u201d profiles.  At 15-months, children in the \u201cSNS activation\u201d profile showed a greater proportion of attention regulation behavior during a fear-eliciting task in comparison to children in the \u201cPNS activation\u201d or \u201cAverage\u201d profiles. There was no evidence for multiple ANS profiles at 24-months of age.\n \nStudy 2 investigated longitudinal latent profiles of RSA and sAA across 7-, 15-, and 24-months, the prediction of longitudinal profiles by social advantage, income, geographic isolation, and maternal parenting behavior, and differences in 3-year problem behavior by longitudinal profile (n=309).  Four longitudinal ANS profiles represented the optimal solution to describe patterns of RSA and sAA development from 7- to 24-months of age.  Membership in the longitudinal profiles was predicted by social advantage, and contrary to expectations, not significantly predicted by maternal parenting behavior.  Further, membership in Profile 2, a longitudinal pattern of average increasing RSA and average increasing sAA from 7- to 15-months, but deviated from the overall sample pattern from 15- to 24-months showing minimal increase in sAA predicted 3-year total behavior problems and emotional symptoms in comparison to the other longitudinal profiles. \n\nStudy 3 examined the prediction of latent physiological profiles of RSA, sAA, and L-HPA activity at 7-months by prenatal exposure to cigarette smoking, and sex differences in the probability of smoking in each of the physiological profiles (n=144, 72 children of prenatal smokers). A two profile solution for child RSA, sAA, and L-HPA activity was supported at 7-months of age.  Children exposed to cigarette smoking prenatally had significantly increased odds of being classified in the \u201cANS coinhibition, L-HPA non-reactor profile\u201d in comparison to the \u201cANS coactivation, L-HPA reactor\u201d profile. Further, the probability of being in the prenatal exposure smoking group and classified as a member of the \u201cANS coinhibition, L-HPA non-reactor\u201d profile was higher for males than females; however the odds ratio test was not significant. \n\nIn conclusion, the findings across the three studies from this dissertation highlight the advantage of a latent profile approach for exploring patterns of multi-system physiological response dynamics of the PNS and SNS, and ANS profile-behavior associations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3507], "author_name_tesi": "Voegtline, Kristin M", "last_name_ssi": "Voegtline", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Kristin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia Stifter", "Cynthia Stifter", "Clancy B Blair", "Lisa Michelle Kopp", "Michelle Lynn Frisco"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia Stifter, Dissertation Advisor", "Cynthia Stifter, Committee Chair", "Clancy B Blair, Committee Member", "Lisa Michelle Kopp, Committee Member", "Michelle Lynn Frisco, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["autonomic nervous system", "emotion regulation", "low-income", "infancy"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DISENTANGLING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF NARRATIVES COMPRISING EVIDENCE: OUTCOMES OF OSTEOPOROSIS NARRATIVE EVIDENCE FOR YOUNG WOMEN\n\n", "id": "9883", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2670", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Health communication scholars are charged with seeking ways to convey health information in credible and reliable ways for audiences. In the context of osteoporosis, the challenge becomes how to communicate risk and prevention to young women, as prevention behaviors started early in life can help decrease osteoporosis diagnosis later in life. Evidence has been shown to be one message tool that can increase comprehension of information presented and influence outcomes. Previous research has found that statistical evidence to be associated with systematic processing, or careful attention to messages, whereas narrative evidence evokes heuristic processing, or a reliance on heuristics. Yet, the benefits of narratives, and the sharing and telling of experiences has been shown to aid comprehension and behaviors for a variety of health contexts. Specifically, that the emotions conveyed and aroused after reading a narrative can influence understanding, and message effectiveness. Guided by the Heuristic-Systematic Model (HSM), this study examined outcomes associated with the use of different narrative evidence types and expressions of emotion within narrative evidence for arousal of discrete emotions, comprehension, dominant cognitions, heuristic and systematic processing, perceived evidence quality, perceived message effectiveness, behavioral intentions, and the osteoporosis prevention behaviors of calcium and vitamin D consumption. Formative research led to the creation of narrative evidence and selection of positive and negative emotions expressed. A 4x3 between subjects pretest-post-test with follow-up 24-hour dietary recall was used to test the outcomes of the narrative evidence types. Results indicated that both heuristic and systematic processing of narrative evidence does simultaneously occur for osteoporosis content, and positive relationships between comprehension, judgments of evidence quality and perceptions of message effectiveness predict behavioral intentions towards osteoporosis prevention. Specifically, the emotions of fear and hope serve as heuristics for the processing of osteoporosis narrative evidence. No significant differences emerged for narrative evidence type and the behaviors of calcium and vitamin D, however, results imply that different message strategies are needed for these behaviors. Implications of these findings for osteoporosis health messages are discussed.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2665], "author_name_tesi": "Volkman, Julie Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Volkman", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Julie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roxanne Louise Parrott", "Roxanne Louise Parrott", "Jon F Nussbaum", "Michael L Hecht", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier", "Sharon Nickols Richardson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roxanne Louise Parrott, Dissertation Advisor", "Roxanne Louise Parrott, Committee Chair", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member", "Michael L Hecht, Committee Member", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Member", "Sharon Nickols Richardson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["emotion", "health communication", "narrative evidence", "processing", "osteoporosis"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Statistical Physics and Ecology", "id": "6641", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2463", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work addresses the applications of the methods of statistical\nphysics to problems in population ecology.

Auden describes how the U.S. lecture tour transforms the modern poet into an \u201cair-borne instrument\u201d to be \u201cjet-or-prop-propelled\u201d around the country. Although Auden mostly uses his poem to grumble and complain about such an experience, this dissertation takes seriously the idea that the circuit operated as a means of high-speed literary propulsion. In the pages that follow, I offer an account of the U.S. lecture circuit as an underappreciated vehicle for transatlantic exchange that had the particular consequence of bringing international modernist writers into contact with a variety of American popular cultures and regional audiences. Tracing the routes these authors frequently traveled on their tours across the U.S. social landscape, I show how the practices of lecturing and traveling on the tour served a vital role in shaping the production and reception of transatlantic modernist literature. From the late nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth, the lecture tour imported a series of modern authors from overseas, including Oscar Wilde and W.B. Yeats from Ireland, Rabindranath Tagore from Bengal, Gertrude Stein from France, and W.H. Auden from England. While such a line-up immediately suggests how this circuit fits in with the transnational currents that have become so important to modernist studies in recent years, the lecture tour generally remains a topic that has garnered little scholarly attention. Some critics have gestured at lecturing as a conduit for fame. But the heavily mediated experience of celebrity only speaks to one aspect of the tour, which generated its own distinctive form of literary circulation capable of shuttling authors everywhere from large metropolitan areas and prestigious universities to small country fairs and Western frontier settlements. To provide a better sense of what this process meant to both its authors and audiences, I assemble a wide-ranging archive of materials that allows me to analyze the history of the lecture circuit along with its aesthetic implications. Each chapter here focuses on the lecture tours of one or more of the writers listed above. The first two chapters\u2014covering Wilde, Yeats, and Tagore\u2014center on the experience of the lecture tour itself and the way in which it prompted modernist writers to develop self-reflexive forms of authorship that facilitated their appeals to a variety of American audiences in a culture industry based on both education and entertainment. The next two chapters\u2014on Stein and Auden respectively\u2014shift from issues of circulation to aesthetics in order to take a closer look at how lecturing came to bear upon modernist writing. In all of these chapters, I am invested in revealing the circuit as a transformative process, one that not only reshaped poets into projectiles but also rerouted their careers by infusing their literary practices with newfound concern for such issues as public pedagogy, oral recitation and delivery, and audience. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10552], "author_name_tesi": "Volpicelli, Robert Angelo", "last_name_ssi": "Volpicelli", "middle_name_ssi": "Angelo", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janet Wynne Lyon", "Mark Stewart Morrisson", "Michael Francis Berube", "Jonathan Paul Eburne", "Robin G Schulze"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janet Wynne Lyon, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Stewart Morrisson, Committee Member", "Michael Francis Berube, Committee Member", "Jonathan Paul Eburne, Committee Member", "Robin G Schulze, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["modernism", "lecture tour", "Oscar Wilde", "W.B.

Distress-initiated interventions were identified as parents\u2019 verbal and tactile responses to infants\u2019 distress signals whereas non-distress initiated interventions were identified as parents\u2019 behaviors in response to non-distressed vocalizations or while infants were asleep. Analysis of data from 107 families revealed that infant night wakings decreased over time as expected. The link between early non-distress initiated interventions and rate of change in infant night wakings was significantly moderated by sleep arrangement such that solitary sleeping infants who experienced higher levels of non-distress-initiated interventions showed a less steep decline across time in infant night wakings compared to solitary infants who experienced low levels of non-distress-initiated interventions.  Results also showed that higher levels of distress-initiated interventions at 1 and 3 months were associated with a steeper decrease in infant night wakings over time for both solitary and cosleeping infants.  Importantly, these findings were not replicated when parental interventions as predictors of infant sleep were examined at later points in the first year.  These results inform conceptualizations of parenting competence in infant sleep contexts during the first few months of life in terms of how best to promote infant sleep regulation across the first year.

Of particular importance is the relative dominance of down- and cross-valley hydraulic gradients, which are a primary control on stream-aquifer exchange dynamics and subsurface residence time of stream water.  We investigate hydraulic gradient and water table dynamics over different time scales in the riparian zones of two steep, forested, headwater catchments in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon.  Groundwater level and stream stage data collected at high spatial and temporal resolutions over a period encompassing a 1.25-year storm and subsequent baseflow recession indicate that both riparian zones exhibit strong seasonal down-valley dominance in hydraulic gradients, and responses to rainfall input that do not adhere to simple conceptual models of riparian water table rise.  Four constant-rate tracer injections in each stream showed a seasonal increase in the intrusion of tracer-labeled stream water into riparian aquifers as stream discharge receded.  In one riparian zone this was linked to the seasonal changes observed in hydraulic gradients, which would tend to increase the potential for hyporheic exchange flows.  The similar hydraulic gradient response of the same riparian area to the storm implied the potential for increased stream-groundwater exchange due to the storm, contrary to studies finding increased hyporheic exchange with decreased flows (otherwise supported by seasonal tracer data here).  Despite similarity in size, location, and geology, only one watershed exhibited repeated diurnal fluctuations in stream flow and water table elevation during the dry summer, likely because the other lacked riparian vegetation.  Spatial and temporal patterns in water level fluctuations, showing increased magnitude with greater distance from the stream and increasing magnitudes through the season, support the idea that the stream has a buffering effect on water table dynamics that diminishes with distance.  Time lag between minimum vapor pressure deficit and minimum water level increased in all cases throughout the season, but at a much faster rate in the stream than in the riparian wells.  This points to the possible down-network accumulation of upstream ET signals that could distort the timing of minimum water level in the stream, as has been previously proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6194], "author_name_tesi": "Voltz, Thomas John", "last_name_ssi": "Voltz", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Gooseff & Thorsten Wagener", "Michael N Gooseff", "Thorsten Wagener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Gooseff & Thorsten Wagener, Thesis Advisor", "Michael N Gooseff, Thesis Advisor", "Thorsten Wagener, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Riparian zone", "hyporheic exchange", "diurnal fluctuations", "hydraulic gradients"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Viability of Partially Post-Tensioned Concrete Members in an Aggressive Environment, including Cyclic Loading", "id": "9248", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3025", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Partially prestressed concrete offers several advantages over fully prestressed de-signs including in\u00accreased ductility, increased energy absorption, decreased cost, de-creased camber, and decreased anchor zone congestion.  However, design codes have been slow to adopt pro\u00acvisions for the design of partially prestressed concrete because of concerns over fatigue and corrosion.  The overall objective of this study was to determine the viability of partially post-tensioned concrete members in an aggressive environment, including the impact of cyclic loading. \n\nThis objective was investigated through an experimental program, which included both individual strand testing and full-scale, post-tensioned beam specimens.  The strand testing phase consisted of corroding samples to different amounts of section loss, and then testing them under cyclic loading until failure.  The beam testing phase included 12 full-scale, post-tensioned beam specimens combining long-term static exposure testing with fatigue testing.  One of the most important limitations of the study was that the ex-perimental program followed the specific sequence of exposure (corrosion) followed by fatigue to failure.\n\nWith regard to the individual strand testing, there was a significant drop-off in fa-tigue capacity at relatively small pit depths.  On average, the fatigue capacity was re-duced 50 percent for pitting that measured 0.010 to 0.015 inches in depth.  Furthermore, an empirical relationship based on an exponential decay function was found to be the most reliable method of predicting the response of corroded prestressing strand for the specific sequence of corrosion followed by fatigue to failure.  In particular, average pit depth offered the best correlation between fatigue capacity and the amount of localized corrosion.\n\nWith regard to the full-scale beam testing, there were several conclusions reached as to the behavior of the tendon \u2013 duct, grout, and strand \u2013 under exposure and fatigue testing.  First, a robust plastic duct is required as it serves as the primary protection me-thod for the tendon and also performs very well under cyclic loading.  Furthermore, the plastic duct requires steel or plastic saddles at tendon deviation points to eliminate the potential for puncturing the duct during the strand stressing operation.  Next, without full encapsulation of the strand by the grout, the tendon will act as a conduit for chloride transport, thus spreading the potential for corrosion from a single breach in the duct.  Fur-thermore, even within a well grouted tendon, the grout will contain both longitudinal and circumferential cracking, reducing the ability of the grout to protect the strand.  Finally, grouting defects, such as voids and fine cracks, do not adversely affect fatigue perfor-mance of the strand, but these defects do adversely affect corrosion protection of the strand, allowing chlorides access to the strand.\n\nA set of best practices are also included in the recommendation section for the du-rability of partially post-tensioned concrete members in an aggressive environment, in-cluding cyclic loading.  These best practices focus on tension and compression stress limits for the concrete, detailing issues for the tendon, and areas of concern with regard to the anchorage zones and long-term durability.  With regard to the study\u2019s overall objec-tive, partially post-tensioned concrete is a viable construction method in an aggressive environment, even with cyclic loading, but it relies on a robust plastic duct system as the primary protection method for the tendon.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3016], "author_name_tesi": "Volz, Jeffery ", "last_name_ssi": "Volz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffery", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrea J Schokker", "Jeffrey A Laman", "Daniel G Linzell", "Howard W Pickering", "Peggy Ann Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrea J Schokker, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey A Laman, Committee Member", "Daniel G Linzell, Committee Member", "Howard W Pickering, Committee Member", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["post-tensioned", "prestressed", "durability", "corrosion", "fatigue", "concrete", "chloride exposure", "corrosion-fatigue", "prestressing strand"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN THE CAPACITY TO PROCESS FACE INFORMATION\n\n", "id": "8764", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5219", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ability to recognize a face is an ability that improves with age.

Two popular hypotheses in the developmental face perception literature arrive at competing conclusions with regard to this question. One line of work in the developmental face perception literature suggests faces are encoded in terms of two independent sources information (a) information about the spatial con&#64257;guration of the features (b) information about the individual features. This line of work has consistently reported evidence of developmental changes interpreted as differences in encoding these two independent sources of information (Carey & Diamond, 1977; Carey, 1981; Diamond & Carey, 1986). A second line of work in the developmental face perception literature argues that faces are encoded holistically as unitary, perceptual wholes and not in terms of two independent sources of information. This line of work has consistently reported evidence that children and adults both appear to process face information holistically and reports no evidence of developmental changes in encoding (Carey & Diamond, 1994; Cassia et al., 2009; Mondloch et al., 2007; Pellicano & Rhodes, 2003; Pellicano et al., 2006; Tanaka et al., 1998). The purpose of the present study was to test these two competing hypotheses using the theoretical constructs and measures from general recognition theory (Ashby & Townsend, 1986), a multidimensional generalization of uni-dimensional signal detection analyses. Participants (ages 6-22) completed two within-sub jects face perception tasks: (a) a composite face task (b) an inversion face task. The pattern of results from both experiments suggested children and adults encoded face information in a qualitatively similar manner. More speci&#64257;cally, both adults and children showed evidence of encoding the dimensions of composite, upright and inverted faces independently rather than holistically at the level of an individual stimulus. There was also evidence of age-related quantitative increases in sensitivity (d') and decreases in false alarm rates for participants in both face perception tasks. These results are interpreted with respect to developmental changes in encoding face information and the maturation of more general cognitive abilities such as selective attention and response inhibition.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12824], "author_name_tesi": "Von Der Heide, Rebecca Jane", "last_name_ssi": "Von Der Heide", "middle_name_ssi": "Jane", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Wenger", "Rick Gilmore", "Reginald Adams", "Peter Molenaar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Wenger, Committee Chair", "Rick Gilmore, Committee Chair", "Reginald Adams, Committee Member", "Peter Molenaar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["face perception", "development", "composite face task", "inversion task", "general recognition theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Returning to College:  A Study of a Federally Funded Retraining Program\n\n", "id": "7752", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4783", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nReturning to college: A study of a federally funded retraining program\nBy\nNicholas A.

Glaser and Strauss described the constant comparative method in four stages: \u201ccomparing incidents\napplicable to each category, integrating categories and there properties, delimiting the\ntheory, and writing the theory.\u201d The data will be analyzed by coding each incident of the\ndata into as many categories that may emerge using NVivo 7.0.

My primary goal was to provide insight into the roles that involvement, social support, and participation in other activities play in hunting participation and to link these factors to existing patterns of hunting behavior and socio-demographic characteristics.  \nMy results are presented in three separate chapters.  The first tested a path model of hunting participation.  Involvement level was moderated by social support when predicting hunting participation.  Years at current address, rurality, education, and age did not contribute to explaining hunting participation in the hierarchical regression model.   \nThe second chapter examined the effects of participation in multiple activities.  A mixed-method approach was used to test the relationship between participation in hunting and other activities.   Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that increased hunting participation is predicted by higher levels of hunting involvement and increased participation in consumptive/hunting-related and motorized activities. Qualitative data suggest that hunters participated in a wide variety of activities.  Level of involvement was related to activity choice where avid hunters tended to participate more in consumptive/hunting-related activities.  \nThe third chapter used qualitative data to examine the relationships between involvement, social support, and hunting participation.  Level of involvement was related to participation in hunting and related activities, importance of hunting, and identification with hunting.  However, not all responses displayed the same trends which suggest that level of involvement is related but may interact with other factors when predicting hunting participation.  Direct social support seemed to have a significant positive influence on hunters\u2019 participation behavior.  Indirect social support was primarily perceived as having no influence on hunting participation.  There was some evidence that social support was related to level of involvement but findings were inconsistent.\nAltogether, these findings suggest that involvement and social support are important predictors of hunting participation and help to extend current knowledge.  The development of explicit measures to examine these factors is needed in order to use them in future models.  Findings also suggest that participation in multiple activities is complex and does not necessarily inhibit participation in any one activity.  Future research is needed that examines how multiple activities may overlap and afford participation in other activities.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1129], "author_name_tesi": "Voorhees, Christina Susan", "last_name_ssi": "Voorhees", "middle_name_ssi": "Susan", "first_name_ssi": "Christina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry C Zinn", "Alan R Graefe", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Sanford Sherrick Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry C Zinn, Committee Chair", "Alan R Graefe, Committee Member", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Member", "Sanford Sherrick Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hunting participation", "social support", "hunting involvement", "multiple activity participation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Language Learning in an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game): A Case Study of L2 Learners of German", "id": "24892", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10959", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation reports on the experiences of seven American undergraduate students who played World of Warcraft (WoW) over eight weeks with native German speakers.

Through pharmacological analysis of the reproductive defects I determined that regulation of both substrate (NAM) and product (NA/NAD+) level is key to the biological activity of PNC-1. Interestingly, these metabolites function separately, as exogenous NAM in wild-type animals induces the uv1 cell necrosis and egg-laying defects, but not the gonad timing defect. Gonad timing in pnc-1 mutants is rescued by restoring NAD+ salvage.  \n\nI propose that our C. elegans model is highly relevant to vertebrates. I demonstrate that \nnicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), the equivalent enzyme in nicotinamide recycling to NAD+ in vertebrates, can functionally substitute for PNC-1. Nampt is secreted and I identified a secreted isoform of PNC-1 and confirmed its extracellular localization and function in vivo, suggesting a conserved role for extracellular NAD+ synthesis. The NAM-NAD+ salvage pathway is an important myogenic regulator in vertebrates and I uncovered a similar role in muscle development and function in our C. elegans model. C. elegans pnc-1 males have a spicule muscle defect, which prevents them from successfully mating. In collaboration with my colleague Wenqing Wang, we demonstrate muscle-cell-type specificity to perturbations of NAD \nproduction and/or NAM levels. In male spicule muscles the role of PNC-1 is to promote NAD+ \nbiosynthesis during development, while in vulval muscles PNC-1 prevents accumulation of \nNAM. Therefore I postulate an evolutionarily conserved role for NAM to NAD+ salvage pathway \nmodulation of NAM and NAD+ levels in the developmental regulation of multiple tissues. \n\nTo test our model of metabolite function in development, I quantified the physiological levels of NAM and NAD+ in C. elegans and how these levels respond to genetic and pharmacological perturbations. I found that physiological levels of NAM were elevated in pnc-1 mutants as expected, however NAD+ levels were resistant to perturbation. I hypothesize that organisms maintain NAD+ levels via endocrine or other regulatory mechanisms that modulate NAD+ synthesis and utilization. To provide phylogenetic context to these metabolite levels, I quantified the levels of these metabolites in multiple systems. Organisms that employ nicotinamidases have lower physiological levels of NAM than tissues and cells that salvage NAM via Nampt. To better understand this phenomenon, I investigated the steady state kinetics of C. \nelegans nicotinamidases and found that the Km and kcat are similar to the yeast Pnc1p. As Nampt is reported to have a much lower kcat than nicotinamidases, I propose the differences in NAM levels result from the catalytic rates of these NAD+ salvage enzyme.  \n\nIn summary, this work has established a new metazoan model to investigate the intricacies of NAD+ salvage regulation of metabolites on higher biological processes. I have demonstrated that this system is likely relevant to vertebrates and amenable to a wide variety of biochemical and genetic analysis. This characterization of pnc-1 in development has given surprising insight into how NAD+ metabolism, through modulation of NAM and NAD+, regulates broader physiological processes.

Yet, simultaneously, those forty years have included significant moments of recognition being granted to black female poets by the academy and from major literary awards such as the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, the National Book Award, and the United States Poet Laureateship, as well as the solidification of African American and black studies programs at colleges and universities. Indeed, the contemporary era of African American literature has centered in part on the flourishing work of black women writing poetry, the metaphorical and literary descendants of foremothers Phillis Wheatley and Gwendolyn Brooks.\nThis project advances a two-part argument about contemporary black female poetics. First, it argues for the importance of discussing the aesthetic multiplicities of contemporary black female poetics together, rather than dividing the field into separately discussed binaries of \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201cexperimental.\u201d Second, instead of acquiescing to the dominant assumption that greater presence in universities and the receipt of significant awards represent an unequivocally positive boon for black women writers, this project complicates understandings of the politics of recognition by demonstrating how academic and awards-granting institutions can both enable and constrain the avenues of expression available to these poets. The act of granting this visibility to certain writers over others often becomes a new mode of policing authenticity in black women\u2019s texts, and these high-profile awards can even damage or limit the honored writers\u2019 careers and those of their peers in unexpected ways. \nDividing the literary criticism on these wide-ranging poetics into separate camps only further reinforces the legitimating power of those mechanisms. As such, the project brings together in equal parts analyses of better-known \u201cliterary\u201d poets, such as Rita Dove and Natasha Trethewey, with analyses of those considered aesthetically marginal, such as Sharon Bridgforth and the (recently) much-lauded Claudia Rankine. Ultimately, this broader analysis and juxtaposition demonstrates the need for both close formal and thoroughly contextual analysis of all the forces that shape visibility for black female poets in the contemporary era of American poetry that is still struggling\u2014as it has done since Wheatley\u2014to determine where black women\u2019s voices fit into a national poetic tradition.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13981], "author_name_tesi": "Vrana, Laura Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Vrana", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aldon Lynn Nielsen", "Aldon Lynn Nielsen", "Shirley Moody-Turner", "Linda Ferguson Selzer", "Judith Sierra-Rivera"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aldon Lynn Nielsen, Dissertation Advisor", "Aldon Lynn Nielsen, Committee Chair", "Shirley Moody-Turner, Committee Member", "Linda Ferguson Selzer, Committee Member", "Judith Sierra-Rivera, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["African American literature", "Poetry", "Textual studies", "American literature", "Race", "Critical race theory", "Gender studies"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Dispersal timing, distances, and rates of Pennsylvania black bear", "id": "25670", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10977", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In Pennsylvania, the black bear (Ursus americanus) population has expanded its range since the early 1980s.

I classified bears as dispersed if the measured distance between initial capture and final recovery was \u226513 km, which was the greatest linear distance across the average female bear home range in Pennsylvania. Based on this criterion, I classified <5% of bears as dispersing <16 months of age and dispersal occurred at 16\u201319 months of age. I estimated dispersal rates using logistic regression models, to investigate if dispersal differed by region or decade for males and females. Median distance dispersed was greater for males (47.03 km, n = 98) than females (25.84 km, n = 70). Region of Pennsylvania and decade were not related to the distance bears dispersed. Overall, male dispersal rate was 0.67 (SE = 0.06) and female dispersal rate was 0.28 (SE = 0.06).

This project was inspired by a detector that consisted of reconfigurable dipole chaff elements for the remote passive detection of chemical agents.  It was proposed that a similar detector could be developed to detect neutrons instead of chemicals, by modifying radiosensitive material and adding a neutron converter.  The radiosensitive material that was being considered for the neutron detector design was the diacetylene, PCDA.  The three different converter materials that were considered for the detector design were gadolinium metal, boron nitride, and lithium silicate.\n\nA number of important observations were made from the experiments performed in this study.  The results obtained from the gamma irradiation experiments indicated that the incorporation of gadolinium in the PCDA samples increased the materials\u2019 gamma-ray sensitivity.  This increased sensitivity was not desirable, since a goal for the detector design was for it to be insensitive to background radiation.  The neutron irradiation experiments showed that the radiosensitive material should not be thicker than the range of the ions or charged particles, generated by a neutron-converter interaction.  Additionally, there should be a distinct layer of converter material in the detector design, instead of a distribution of converter nanoparticles in the radiosensitive material.  Because the amount of neutron converter that can be incorporated in the PCDA is limited, utilizing a discrete layer of converter increases the number of converter atoms.  For a given flux, this yields an increased number of neutron absorptions, and therefore increases the energy that can be emitted from the converter into the PCDA.\n\nModels of the converter and the radiosensitive material were utilized to determine the neutron interaction distributions in the converter and the reaction product interaction in the radiosensitive material.  The Monte Carlo methods based computer programs CASINO and SRIM were used to model the produced electrons and heavy charged particles, respectively.  Because the converters were thin, neutron interactions within the converters were modeled assuming simple exponential attenuation.  The modeling indicated that different converter materials should be incorporated into the detector design depending on the design limitations and how the device is to be deployed.  If boron nitride is used as the converter material in the detector design, the PCDA radiosensitive material thickness should be set to 5 microns and the boron nitride thickness should be equal to or greater than 10 microns.  When gadolinium metal foil is used as the converter, the PCDA radiosensitive material should be set to 50 microns and the gadolinium thickness should be equal to or greater than 10 microns.  In the case where lithium silicate is used as the converter material, the radiosensitive material thickness should be set to 50 microns and the converter material thickness should be set to 50 microns or greater.  \n\nFor all scenarios mentioned above, the converter material should be placed behind the radiosensitive material.  This allows the thickness of the converter material to be increased without any penalty to the energy emitted from the converter material, as long as the alignment of the device is maintained.  Enriching the boron and the lithium in their neutron absorbing isotopes is also recommended, since using enriched converters greatly increases the energy emitted from the converter material.  It is important to note that the recommended converter thicknesses above would need to be modified if the radiosensitive material in the final detector design does not have the optimum density of 0.92 g/cm3.\n\nBased on the experimental and modeling results, enriched boron nitride or enriched lithium silicate should be used as the converter materials.   If the detector design does not allow for the recommended thickness mentioned above, then a different converter material should be used based on the design limitations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7756], "author_name_tesi": "Vresko, Brian Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Vresko", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jack Brenizer Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jack Brenizer Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["neutron", "detection", "detector", "antenna", "PCDA", "converter", "gadolinium", "boron", "lithium", "radiosensitive", "radiation"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Seismic performance of base isolated buildings and strategies to mitigate vertical acceleration demands", "id": "15413", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7774", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Elastomeric bearing constructed of rubber layers bonded to intermediate steel shim plates is a seismic isolation device used for protecting a structure against earthquake ground shaking.

The solution structure of the ferric form(hemichrome), revealed a highly \u00e1-helical protein with a fold similar to that of other truncated hemoglobins [Falzone, C. J. et al. (2002) J. Mol. Biol. 324, 1015]. Characterization of the protein in solution showed that it is able to undergo a  posttranslational modification of the heme 2-vinyl group [Scott, N. L. et al. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 6902]. The reaction was facilitated by sodium dithionite reduction of the iron. Optical and NMR data indicated that the heme iron in the product remained low-spin Fe(III). Mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy established that a covalent link was formed between His117 and the \u00e1-position of the 2-vinyl group. Optical methods showed that covalent attachment of the heme group stabilized the protein by >20 \u00b0C with respect to thermal denaturation and 1.1 pH units with respect to acid denaturation. The unique reactivity of His117 was confirmed by mutagenesis. Thus\nHis117Ala Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Hb was incapable of forming the cross-link. Cyanide binding experiments were performed on this mutant to characterize the metcyano form in the absence of the cross-link. It was found that His46 (distal) was displaced from the heme iron. A hydrogen bonding network involving the cyanide ion, Tyr22, Gln43 and Gln47 was detected, likely mimicking that in the related hemoglobins\nfrom Chlamydomonas eugametos and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Kinetic data indicated that the variant bound cyanide more slowly than the wild-type protein and suggested that position 117 had an influence on the properties of the heme pocket. Ligand binding in hemoglobins is known to be modulated by structural interactions at the\nproximal and distal ligand sites. Here, hyperfine chemical shifts were used to probe the\nrelationship between heme electronic structure and axial ligand orientation. The data indicated that the covalent modification perturbed moderately the orientation of the axial ligands and overall heme electronic structure. The heme pocket structure in the ligand dissociated state was probed by incorporation of Zn(II) protoporphyrin IX in place of heme. NMR studies on the pentacoordinate zinc protein revealed that His46 moved away from the porphyrin ring; however, the conformation was neither that observed in the hemichrome, nor that in the metcyano complex.

A number of approaches have been proposed to overcome the control mechanisms inherent in the built environment which inhibit the free use of space. Recently, the concepts of program and agency have been exploited to promote the possibility of socially transformative action through architectural practice. These are best exemplified by the work of Cedric Price, who utilized notions of program as a changeable entity. Price envisioned an architectural product which, aided by computational knowledge and through communication networks, promoted social interaction and enhanced users\u2019 capacity to act independently within the structure of society. Price\u2019s idea of program is based on the model of a living organism that is capable of maintaining its integrity while growing and changing with time.\n\tThe current scholarship on Price has placed his work in its professional, social, and cultural milieus, and established it as a precedent for contemporary diagrammatic and network-based practices. Price\u2019s work has been frequently cited as an example of architecture which, guided by performance and social needs and driven by ethical concerns, critically embraces the context.

These notions of program are: program as an interface (architecture that interacts with users); as a memory device (architecture that learns from experience); and as an evolutionary diagram (architecture that evolves with time).\nFrom the 1960s through the 1980s Price\u2019s work evolved in dialogue with cybernetics, an emerging model of computational knowledge; new computational programming techniques; and communication networks. These strategies advanced from the level of the architectural object to the level of the city.

Currently used techniques to establish relations between indoor environmental parameters and occurrence of health related symptoms among occupants cannot deal with real time concurrent changes of multiple simultaneously monitored parameters, nor provide predictions of real building impacts on occupants' health. The dissertation is advocating usage of innovative data analyses tools for interpretation of building sensor data and occupants' perceptions of indoor environments to predict respiratory health symptom occurrence in buildings. Such data analyses establish relations between indoor air quality perceptions and health.\n\nThe research goal was development of an artificial neural network (NN) based computational methodology for fast prediction of respiratory health related symptoms among office building occupants. For the purpose of NN training, Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Building Assessment Survey and Evaluation (BASE) study provided measurements of indoor building parameters and occupant survey data within 100 office buildings in the U.S.A. Trained networks had an output indicating occupants' health symptoms based on measurements and occupants' perceptions of indoor environments. The method was tested and experimentally validated using on-site measurements and occupants' survey for a LEED certified \"green\" building environment. Additional multivariate statistical regression of the BASE data was used for the purpose of comparing results to presently available data analyses tools.\n\nThe results showed NN methodology can be applied to predict a number of respiratory health symptoms among office building occupants. High significance of occupants' perceptions of indoor environments was confirmed by multivariate statistical analyses. Experimental study in a green building revealed better indoor environmental quality, healthier indoor conditions and higher occupants' satisfaction compared to an average BASE office building.\n\nThe developed methodology could be incorporated in the future design procedures to specify optimal combination of indoor environmental parameters and prevent possible adverse impacts on occupants' respiratory health. Last, but not the least, the results encourage building researchers and scientific community to initiate applications of NNs, as innovative and powerful data interpretation tools for indoor environments.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6470], "author_name_tesi": "Vukovic, Vladimir ", "last_name_ssi": "Vukovic", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vladimir", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric", "Jelena Srebric", "Stanley Allan Mumma", "Bohumil Kasal", "Leonard J Peltier", "Zhengmin Qian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric, Dissertation Advisor", "Jelena Srebric, Committee Chair", "Stanley Allan Mumma, Committee Member", "Bohumil Kasal, Committee Member", "Leonard J Peltier, Committee Member", "Zhengmin Qian, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["artificial neural networks", "perceived environmental quality", "BASE benchmark database", "indoor air quality", "respiratory health symptoms", "sick building syndrome"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A Phylogenetic and Structural Study of Truncated Hemoglobins", "id": "7921", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1331", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The hemoglobin superfamily consists of proteins characterized by an ?-helical fold that binds heme (iron protoporphyrin IX) through histidine coordination to the iron.  The first characterized members of the superfamily, hemoglobin and myoglobin, function in the respiratory systems of higher organisms for oxygen transport and storage.  However, many more members of the superfamily have been discovered in recent years.  These genes are found in all the major branches of life, show high levels of sequence divergence, and have adapted to perform different functions.  The study of highly adaptable genes gives insight into process of molecular evolution unlike that obtained from the study of stable genes.  In addition, the different adaptations of globins may provide insight into the history of oxygen utilization or organisms\u2019 adaptation to increasing oxygen levels.  \n\tThis thesis examines the evolutionary history and biophysical properties of the truncated globins.  Because these proteins represent an ancient lineage, their study provides unique insight into how the family originated and what the effects billions of years of evolution are on such an adaptable protein.  In addition, the most important capabilities of these globins (ligation, hydrogen bond networks, and ligand stabilization) are defined by a small number of amino acids in the heme pocket.  This allows for profound statements to be made through analysis of their variability within different genomes, and the structural repercussions of that variability.  \n\tTruncated globins (trHbs) constitute one of the three hemoglobin lineages.  TrHbs are found in bacteria, plants, and unicellular eukaryotes.  They are distantly related to vertebrate hemoglobins and their globin domains are typically shorter than these by 20 to 40 residues.  The multiple amino acid deletions, insertions, and replacements result in distinctive alterations of the canonical globin fold and a range of chemical properties.  An early phylogenetic analysis categorized trHbs in three groups, I (trHbN), II (trHbO), and III (trHbP).  This analysis has been revisited with 111 trHb sequences.  It is found that trHbs are orthologous within each group and paralogous across the groups.  Group I globins form the most disparate set and separate into two divergent classes.  Group II is comparatively homogeneous, whereas Group III displays the highest level of overall conservation.  In Group I and Group II globins, an improved description of probable protein-ligand interactions is achieved.  Other conservation trends are either confirmed (essential glycines in loops), refined (lining of ligand access tunnel), or newly identified (helix start signal).  The Group III globins exhibit recognizable heme cavity residues while lacking some of the residues thought to be important to the trHb fold.  An analysis of the phylogenetic trees of each group provides a plausible scenario for the emergence of trHbs, by which the Group II globin gene was the original gene, and the Group I and Group III  globin genes were obtained via duplication and transfer events.\n\tThe Group I trHb from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (S6803 Hb) exhibits structural features uncommon to trHbs in that it is endogenously hexacoordinate in the resting state and can covalently modify the heme cofactor.  The phylogenetic analysis shows that the positions responsible for these features (HisE7 as the second axial ligand to the iron and HisH16 as the residue forming a covalent bond with the heme 2-vinyl) are both conserved in only one other sequence, the Group I 2/2 globin from the cyanobacterium Synechoccocus sp. PCC 7002 (S7002 Hb).  In order to understand better the occurrence of hexacoordination and crosslinking in these globins, S7002 Hb was characterized.  Both features were found to be present in S7002 Hb, and comparisons of the biophysical data show they are manifested in similar ways.  However, the characteristics of ligand binding were found to differ between the two proteins.  \n\tRecombinant S7002 Hb (rHb) can be readily prepared as an apoglobin (apo-rHb), a noncross-linked hemichrome (ferric iron and two histidine axial ligands, rHb-R), and a cross-linked hemichrome (rHb-A).  To determine the effects of heme binding and subsequent cross-linking, apo-rHb, rHb-R, and rHb-A were subjected to thermal denaturation and 1H/2H exchange experiments.  Interpretation of the latter data was based on NMR assignments obtained with uniformly 15N- and 13C,15N-labeled protein.  Apo-rHb was found to contain a cooperative structural core, which was extended and stabilized by heme binding.  Crosslinking resulted in further stabilization attributed mainly to an unfolded state effect.  Protection factors, i.e., the degree of hydrogen exchange retardation due to organized structure, were higher at the cross-link site and near His70 in rHb-A than rHb-R.  In contrast, other regions became less resistant to exchange in rHb-A.  These included portions of the B helix and the E helix, which undergo large conformational changes upon exogenous ligand binding to the iron.  Thus, the crosslink readjusted the dynamic properties of the heme pocket.  1H/2H exchange data also revealed that the B, G, and H helices formed a robust core regardless of the presence of the heme or the crosslink.  This motif likely encompasses the early folding nucleus of trHbs.\n\tThe solution structure of S7002 rHb-A was solved and compared to other trHbs, myoglobin, and the apo and noncrosslinked S7002 rHb.  It was found that S7002 and S6803 rHb-As have similar secondary and tertiary structure, including a kink in the H helix.  This kink places the C terminal end of the H helix near the heme, a position facilitating the formation of the crosslink.  The helix kink is observed in the structures of all other Group I trHbs, regardless of the ability of residue H16 to react with the heme.  Comparisons of these structures identified a conserved heme-valine contact not present in vertebrate globins.  S7002 and S6803 rHb-A differed in the EF loop structure, a detail that may be responsible for the distinct rates of S7002 and S6803 rHb cyanide binding.  Finally, chemical shift data were used to compare the secondary structure of S7002 rHb-R and apo-rHb to that of rHb-A.  It was found that all three forms of the protein share similar helical regions.  These data were used with the S7002 apo-rHb chemical denaturation data to assess the extent of refolding induced by association with the heme group.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1320], "author_name_tesi": "Vuletich, David Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Vuletich", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Juliette Lecomte", "Philip C.

It is increasingly clear that over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by immune cells, resulting in oxidative stress, plays a prominent role in several disease states, including cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, and AIDS.  Of particular importance is the oxidative stress induced over-expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 that is characteristic of inadequate selenium (Se) nutrition. Clinical trials and epidemiological studies have strongly suggested the beneficial effects of Se supplementation in prevention and/or treatment of some of these diseases. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory property of Se, the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line or bone marrow macrophages (BMDM) isolated from mice on Se-deficient or Se-supplemented diets were cultured in media deficient or supplemented with Se. In vitro kinase assays revealed that Se-supplementation decreased the activity of IkappaB kinase (IKK) \u0192\u00d2 in bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated macrophages. Stimulation by LPS of Se-supplemented macrophages resulted in a time-dependent increase in 15-deoxy- \u0192\u00b412, 14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) formation, an endogenous inhibitor of IKK\u0192\u00d2 activity. Further analysis revealed that inhibition of IKK\u0192\u00d2 activity in Se-supplemented cells correlated with the Michael addition product of 15d-PGJ2 with Cys-179 of IKK\u0192\u00d2, while the formation of such an adduct was significantly decreased in the Se-deficient macrophages. In addition, anti-inflammatory activities of Se were also mediated by the 15d-PGJ2-dependent activation of the PPAR\u0192\u00d7 in macrophages. Experiments using specific COX inhibitors and genetic knockdown approaches indicated that the COX-1, and not the COX-2 pathway, was responsible for the increased synthesis of 15d-PGJ2 in Se-supplemented macrophages. Se-supplementation also led to the decrease of the expression of mPGES-1 and TXS; while the expression of H-PGDS was significantly increased. The results presented here argue that incorporation of Se into selenoproteins causes the shunting of arachidonic acid towards 15d-PGJ2 production, which further acts in a positive feedback loop via the activation of PPAR\u0192\u00d7-dependent transcription of H-PGDS to cause a significant shift in the metabolism of the arachidonic acid by the COX pathway towards 15d-PGJ2 rather than the pro-inflammatory PGE2.\nIn conclusion, these results suggest that Se-supplementation protects macrophages against oxidative stress-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression via shunting arachidonic acid metabolism towards 15d-PGJ2, while COX-1 is an important enzyme in the production of 15d-PGJ2. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2206], "author_name_tesi": "Vunta, Hema Latha", "last_name_ssi": "Vunta", "middle_name_ssi": "Latha", "first_name_ssi": "Hema", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Madhu Reddy", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Avery August", "Shantu G Amin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Chair", "Madhu Reddy, Committee Member", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Shantu G Amin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["selenium", "Cyclooxygenase", "Prostaglandin", "IKKbeta", "PG synthases", "Oxidative stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Development of Second Language Pragmatic Competence: the Data-Driven Teaching of German Modal Particles Based on a Learner Corpus", "id": "7624", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4747", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Interlanguage pragmatics is the study of how learners behave as social actors using their second language knowledge to accomplish specific communicative goals.

I suggest a data-driven approach to teaching an important pragmatic feature of German, modal particles, and track the development of the comprehension and use of this feature by the learners over time. \nThis pedagogical intervention was administered during a tutored course where learners participated in electronically mediated email and chat exchanges with native speaker peers.

The use of the methodology of microgenetic analysis facilitated tracking the development of learners over time as well as the analysis of quantitative and qualitative data in its entirety and interconnection.\nThe results showed a significant increase in frequency, range, and accuracy of modal particle use by learners in approximation to the native speaker baseline as well as a significant improvement in pragmatic awareness.

The Variable Speed Rotors were defined as a particular type of the rotor whose rotating speed was changeable over a certain range. Using the Variable Speed Rotor technology has positive effects, such as increasing the efficiency of fuel consumption, reducing the noise and extending the engine life. One of the shortcomings of using Variable Speed Rotors is associated with natural frequency of the blade in-plane motion (lag motion). When the rotor speed was tuned to shift over a certain range, the natural frequency of the blade lag motion hit integer harmonics of the rotor speed, such as 1 per revolution and 2 per revolution. This resulted in the rotor system crossing through a severe resonance environment. The resonance crossing led to a sharp increase in the lag moment. In order to resolve this problem, a modified solution is put forward and analyzed in this thesis, which is installation of an embedded chordwise inertial device with damping properties on the blade in the chordwise direction.\n\n\nAs introduced in the following chapters, the objective of this thesis was to generate an optimum damper design to achieve the maximum transient loads reduction for the Variable Speed Rotor during resonance crossing. In order to achieve this goal, a modified design procedure was presented. Analytical method was employed to convert a frequency domain model of the embedded inertial damper into an equivalent viscous model in the time domain. A comprehensive time domain simulation program was utilized to simulate the lag loads at different damper configurations.

At the same time, searching for a new Taiwanese body continues to be a major direction of theatrical experiments and is under-theorized. In regard to historical surveys, Taiwanese scholars such as Chung Ming-Der, Ma Sen, Lin He-Yi, and Chi Wei-Jan have published considerable work on the development of modern Taiwanese theatre. Shih Wan-Shun, Wang Li-Wen, Chang Ivy I Chu, Liang Pei-Lin, Cheng Fan-Ting, and Wu Chen-Tse have all, in their theses and dissertations, attended to questions of thematics and theatrics in modern Taiwanese practice. However, so far, few works have examined the tension between the historical continuum of political oppression and the immediacy of theatrical performance. The continued sedimentation of politics and aesthetics embedded in bodily performance constitutes a dominant research emphasis in performance studies, but has yet to be fully explored in modern Taiwanese theatre. Via a close reading from a biopolitical perspective of the body in text and on stage, my dissertation bridges the scholarly gap between historiography and theory as each pertain to the theatre. I argue that the body carries ideology-ridden messages, making corporeal existence a crucial site deployed by theatre participants to reconfigure the idea of Taiwan since the Japanese colonial period. \n\nIn my Introduction, I revisit the historical development of modern Taiwanese theatre pertaining to the body. Chapter One focuses on Tian Chi-Yuan (\u7530\u555f\u5143, 1964\u20131996) and his White Water (\u767d\u6c34, Baishui 1993). Concentrating on Tian\u2019s multiple schemas of the body, I argue for a \u201cconstructivist\u201d model of national identity to consider the experiment of modern Taiwanese theatre as a critical hybrid of borrowing and rejecting local traditional resources and foreign cultural references. Chapter Two shifts the focus to two of the most significant playwrights and directors in modern Taiwanese theatre, Stan Lai (\u8cf4\u8072\u5ddd, 1954\u2013 ) and Hugh K. S. Lee (\u674e\u570b\u4fee, 1955\u20132013). The realistic style of performance, or \u201ccritical realism,\u201d a term suggested by Tobin Nellhaus, of Lee\u2019s Far Away from Home (\u897f\u51fa\u967d\u95dc, Xi Chu Yang Guan 1988) and Lai\u2019s A Dream like a Dream (\u5982\u5922\u4e4b\u5922, \u202cRu Meng Zhi Meng\u202d 2000) foreground the nuanced flow between social realities and theatrical representations in which the enacted body can express memories and traumas in response to defining historical junctures. Chapter Three explores the work of Robert Wilson (1941\u2013 ) and Suzuki Tadashi (1939\u2013 ) and their intercultural, flagship productions in twenty-first-century Taiwan, with special attention to Wilson\u2019s Orlando (2009) and Suzuki\u2019s La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias (2011). Overall, I argue that modern Taiwanese theatre provides a powerful instance of intercultural performance functioning as a subjectivity reformed via an emotional articulation of a transfigured postcolonial, political, and cultural identity. In the Conclusion, I reiterate the ways in which the body continues to be an experimental site for challenging issues of identity in modern Taiwanese theatre. \u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\n\nBy analyzing performances in the post\u2013martial law era, I offer micro-reading of the body in performance and formulate an analytical angle on performance with sociopolitical specificities. On this basis, I show that the concepts of modernity, trauma, and subjectivity\u2014themes repeatedly tackled by scholars\u2014are more than abstract notions and textual representations. Instead, these concepts also constitute physical practice by reflexively generating knowledge and affect. I am, therefore, offering an argument in opposition to the idea of interpreting modern Taiwanese theatre as an attempt to construct Taiwan. In my account, modern Taiwanese theatre functions as a biopolitical practice that refracts identity struggles captured in history and in the present day of an impossibly delayed \u201cTaiwanese\u201d identity.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12655], "author_name_tesi": "WANG, WEI-CHIH ", "last_name_ssi": "WANG", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "WEI-CHIH", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charlotte Diane Eubanks", "Charlotte Diane Eubanks", "Shuang Shen", "Jonathan Eran Abel", "On-Cho Ng", "Sarah Jo Townsend"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charlotte Diane Eubanks, Dissertation Advisor", "Charlotte Diane Eubanks, Committee Chair", "Shuang Shen, Committee Member", "Jonathan Eran Abel, Committee Member", "On-Cho Ng, Outside Member", "Sarah Jo Townsend, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Theater", "Taiwan", "Memory", "Performance", "Body", "Postcolonialism"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE INFLAMMATORY CONTROL VALVE:  Modulation of Responses to LPS and IFN-gamma by the RON Receptor Tyrosine Kinase In Vitro and In Vivo\n", "id": "8819", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "948", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We have shown previously that activation of the receptor d-origine nantais (RON) receptor tyrosine kinase by macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) inhibits macrophage production of nitric oxide (NO) induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in vitro, through the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression.  RON knockout mice exhibit elevated delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses and increased susceptibility to endotoxic shock in vivo.  Here, we demonstrate that treatment of primary peritoneal macrophages with MSP followed by IFN-gamma and LPS inhibits the production of interleukin-12 (IL-12) through the inhibition of IL-12p40 expression.  IL-10 also inhibits IL-12p40 expression as part of a negative feedback response through the induction of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) gene expression, we have shown that the inhibition of IL-12 by MSP occurs independently of IL-10.  \n\nLPS-induced IL-12 production by macrophages initiates the production of IFN-gamma by NK, NKT and memory T cells during an innate immune response which forms a positive feedback loop by enhancing the production of IL-12 by activated macrophages.  Our data demonstrate that splenocytes from RON knockout mice express elevated levels of IL-12p40 within three hours following LPS administration when compared with control animals.  Furthermore, we observe enhanced IFN-gamma levels in the serum of these animals at six and twelve hours following injection of endotoxin.  By crossing RON knockout mice with IFN-gamma receptor knockout animals, we show that the enhanced susceptibility of RON knockout mice to endotoxemia is mediated, at least in part, through IFN-gamma.  Taken together, these data suggest that RON regulates IFN-gamma production in vivo through its ability to regulate IL-12p40 expression in response to LPS, and that the de-regulation of IFN-gamma production contributes to the increased sensitivity of RON knockout mice to septic shock.\n\nIFN-gamma secreted during the innate immune response supports the development of T-helper 1 (Th1) cells by up-regulating major histo-compatibility complex (MHC) class II expression and subsequent antigen presentation.  Furthermore, enhanced IL-12 secretion by macrophages in response to IFN-gamma results in a further elevation of IFN-gamma production during the acquired phase of the immune response by promoting Th1 differentiation.  Data described herein demonstrate that, in addition to regulating IFN-gamma production in vivo, MSP inhibits IFN-gamma-mediated responses in macrophages including expression of class II trans-activator (CIITA), resulting in decreased MHC class II expression.  Additionally, MSP stimulation of primary peritoneal macrophages induces the expression of SOCS1 and 3, and reduces cell surface expression of the IFN-gamma receptor in a proteasome-dependent manner.  However, unlike IL-10 which also induces SOCS expression in macrophages, MSP does not result in the up-regulation of STAT3 phosphorylation in these cells.  These data indicate that MSP activation of the RON receptor negatively regulates IFN-gamma-induced gene expression in macrophages via a signaling pathway that is distinct from IL-10 and STAT3.\n\nIn the initial stages of an immune response, LPS induces the production of IFN-beta by activated macrophages via a MyD88-independent signaling pathway which feeds back to cooperate with LPS in the induction of a subset of LPS-responsive genes, which are also dependent on IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation.  This occurs 2-4 hours following LPS stimulation resulting in a delayed induction of the expression of this subset of genes, suggesting that this pathway may be a physiologically relevant target of RON signaling.  Here we demonstrate that MSP inhibits LPS-induced IL-12p40 production, even in the absence of IFN-gamma&#61472;priming.  However we find that MSP specifically inhibits IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, but not LPS-induced STAT1 activation.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that LPS-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN-beta expression are not diminished in the presence of MSP.   Based on our previous studies demonstrating that RON inhibits LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation, we conclude that RON targets TLR4 signaling via the MyD88-dependent, but not the MyD88-independent, pathway.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [940], "author_name_tesi": "WILSON, CALEPH B", "last_name_ssi": "WILSON", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "CALEPH", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pamela Hankey", "Avery August", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Robert Paulson", "Andrew Thomas Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pamela Hankey, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nitric Oxide", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharide", "Interleukin-12", "Interferon-gamma", "Receptor Tyrosine Kinase", "Macrophage", "Innate Immunity", "Immunology"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF TRUST ATTRIBUTES OF VALUE STREAMS IN HOME ENERGY AUDITING PROCESSES", "id": "qv33rw655", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12648", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the past decade, significant investments have been made to advance residential energy auditing methods to enable reduced energy consumption in the residential sector.

Airplanes and car rentals are the most typical modes of public travel. While air transport has earned significant scholarly attention and there exist abundant studies, fleet planning in the car rental business is discussed only minimally in operations research. Therefore, the purpose of this research is not only to build a thorough analytical framework for car rental fleet planning in different time phases, but also to develop practical algorithmic procedures.\n   In long-term planning, pool segmentation and hub selection are studied. All rental locations are split into different pools and a hub is selected within each pool. The proposed clustering-based iterative algorithm offers a reliable clustering method to quickly find an initial solution with a small solution gap and an iterative method to gradually approach a near-optimum. In mid-term planning, inter-pool moves and asset replacement are distributed among different pools based on the change of seasonal demand. Numerical results have shown that the best-improvement descent local search with the structure of better neighbors has very good performance and can obtain a satisfactory solution in an extremely short time. In short-term planning, vehicle imbalance at different locations forces empty vehicles to be redistributed.

Educated citizens need to be able to understand statistics; it is \n\nassumed that adult students who graduate from college will have this ability. Knowing \n\nhow important statistical literacy is, the purpose of this research was to measure statistical \n\nliteracy in adult learners before and after they have completed a statistics class, or a \n\nresearch methods class with no prior statistics, or a  research methods class with prior \n\nstatistics.  \n\nParticipants were 110 adult students, 74 females and 37 males, 72% Caucasian, \n\n26% African American, 1% Native American and 1% Asia/Pacific Islander; ages ranged \n\nfrom 18 to 40 years old (M = 21, S.D. = 3.25), with most reporting marital status as \n\nsingle and being full-time students.   \n\nUsing a quasi-experimental research design, adult students completed pre- and \n\npost-test surveys, which measured statistical literacy, based on Gal\u2019s (2004) Model of \n\nStatistical Literacy that embraced both knowledge and dispositional elements. Fisher\u2019s \n\nLSD post-hoc test results showed a statistically significant difference among class types \n\nfor the knowledge elements, statistical thinking, reasoning, and literacy, but no \n\nstatistically significant differences for the critical questions. Results from a MANOVA on \n\npost-test scores among class types showed no significant differences on the dispositional \n\nelements, affect, cognitive competence, difficulty and value. For beliefs, a Chi-square \n\nanalysis showed that 90% of adult students in the research methods class with prior \n\nstatistics believed that statistics was relevant in their lives. More importantly, further tests \n\nthat examined pre- to post-test scores revealed significant differences among class types. \nImplications for policy include a re-examination of prerequisites for statistics \n\ncourses, and requiring completion of a statistics course before a research methods course. \n\nMany teaching implications are indicated in this research; however, the most important is \n\nthe use of constructivist perspectives in the classroom; accordingly, future research \n\nshould examine teaching methodologies. In addition, statistical literacy needs to be \n\nexamined again; however, using modifications to the model that separates statistics into \n\nits two main branches, descriptive and inferential. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [626], "author_name_tesi": "Wade , Barbara  ", "last_name_ssi": "Wade ", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Barbara ", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Ed Taylor", "Edward W Taylor", "Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Pamela Preston", "John Basil Urenko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Ed Taylor, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward W Taylor, Committee Chair", "Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Member", "Pamela Preston, Committee Member", "John Basil Urenko, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["statistical literacy", "adult education", "statistics", "attitudes and statistics", "beliefs and statistics", "research methods and statistics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Analysis Of Mammalian Overlapping Reading Frames And Species Composition In Metagenomic Samples", "id": "9761", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5773", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation addresses two seemingly unconnected biological questions: (1) understanding the evolution of overlapping reading frames (dual coding) in higher eukaryotes and (2) the development of approaches for delineating taxonomic representation of eukaryotic metagenomic samples, both of which reflect the timeline of my graduate study and the developments that have occurred in life sciences during the past five years.

Raw material cost accounts for 40-60% of production costs for most US manufacturers. In fact, for the automotive industry, the cost of components and parts from outside suppliers may exceed 50% of sales. It is vital to the competitiveness of most firms to be able to keep the purchasing cost to a minimum. In today\u2019s competitive operating environment it is impossible to successfully produce low-cost, high-quality products without good suppliers. An organization cannot afford a strategy that treats all items, products and services in the same manner.  More and more firms are finding that the only way to align the procurement function with the firm\u2019s overall goals is to segregate purchasing into different segments based on supply strategies, supply tactics and supply management approaches. This process is known as supply segmentation. Supply segmentation technique provides a mechanism for distinguishing among different items and services that are purchased by a firm with the goal of developing specific strategies to meet the needs of the organization. \nIn this dissertation we segregate the purchasing process into a 2x2 matrix (4 quadrants) with the cost of products on x-axis (Low/High) and supply risk on y-axis (Low/High). The objective is to develop supplier selection methods for each quadrant of the matrix.  For each quadrant, we formulate a different optimization model and solve it using multi-objective optimization methods.\nFor the Tactical products (quadrant 1, low cost, low risk) we consider a multi-period planning horizon problem. The buyer forecasts the demand of each product for each time period. The objective is to decide what products to buy from which supplier and in which time period; we also incorporate product bundling as a form of quantity discount.\nLeverage items (quadrant 2) have a high price but low supply risk. Hence, the primary objective for supplier selection in this category is to reduce the price of the purchased products. We model and solve the problem as a multi-objective problem with price, lead-time and quality as three conflicting criteria. Typically for leverage items there are many suppliers to choose from; hence, we first pre-qualify the suppliers using cluster analysis. Pre-qualification is the process of reducing large set of initial suppliers to a smaller set of manageable suppliers.\nCritical items represent quadrant 3 (low cost, high risk). Although critical items represent a small portion of the total cost, they present a very high level of service disruption. In this quadrant we suggest the organizations seek supplier base globally. Hence, along with cost we incorporate risk factors in the supplier selection process. We assign a global supplier, primary domestic supplier and primary secondary supplier for every product with the aim of minimizing both cost and risk.\nQuadrant 4 represents strategic items (high cost, high risk) that require long-term partnership with the suppliers. Multi-criteria decision making methods with multiple decision makers are most suitable for this quadrant. We use Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) and Total Cost of ownership (TCO) to measure qualitative and cost criteria. A pairwise comparison method is used to combine AHP and TCO objectives to determine the best suppliers.  \nFinally we introduce the use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in Supply Chain Management and present the benefits of implementing RFID through a real-life case study. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6440], "author_name_tesi": "Wadhwa, Vijay ", "last_name_ssi": "Wadhwa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vijay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin", "Vittaldas V Prabhu", "Charles David Ray Sr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Chair", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Committee Member", "Vittaldas V Prabhu, Committee Member", "Charles David Ray Sr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multi-objective Optimization", "Supplier Selection", "Outsourcing"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Assessment of elastic energy in the plantar aponeurosis and its contributions to human running", "id": "26210", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9991", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tOne of the primary roles of tendons during human locomotion is the storage and release of elastic energy.  As the limbs move in cyclic patterns, some of the lower limb tendons stretch and recoil, functioning like springs that reuse a portion of the energy during each step.  This function assists in improving the efficiency of human locomotion by reducing the work that is required of the muscles.  Testing of cadaveric specimens in situ has demonstrated that the arch of the foot operates in this capacity during simple loading.  However, it remains unclear whether the arch functions in this manner during the more complex task of human locomotion.  Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate one of the main elastic tissues in the arch (the plantar aponeurosis; PA), to examine its ability to store and release elastic energy that potentially contributes to the mechanical energetics of the foot during running.  A second aim was to investigate the influence of the initial foot contact pattern on the function of the PA during the stance phase of running.\n\tA kinematically driven rigid-body model of the human foot was used to estimate the strain, tensile force, and elastic energy stored within the PA.  Calculation of the foot joint moments, powers, and work created by the PA allowed an assessment of the contribution of the PA to the mechanical energetics of running gait.  Elastic energy stored within the PA was found to be approximately 3 J, which is comparable to values found during in situ loading.  The release of this elastic energy generated a small amount of joint power at the talonavicular joint.  This joint power amounted to approximately 5-10% of the combined lower limb joint powers during late stance and contributed to push-off slightly after peak power generation at the ankle.  In addition, this analysis revealed that differences existed in the early stance phase behavior of the PA between a non-rearfoot strike and a rearfoot strike, but that these differences did not exist during push-off.  Future work will use these findings as a foundation to investigate how the mechanical power generated by the PA influences the energetics of other joints within the lower limb as well as the metabolic cost of locomotion.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9704], "author_name_tesi": "Wager, Justin Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Wager", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Henry Challis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Henry Challis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["biomechanics", "multisegment foot model", "locomotion", "plantar fascia", "elastic energy", "strain", "longitudinal arch", "foot strike"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Studies on optimizing Cadmium Telluride solar cells through thickness reduction and the addition of a Nickel Oxide electron-blocking layer", "id": "12935saw5357", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12935", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) solar cells are the current leader in thin film photovoltaic technologies: with record device efficiencies comparable to any other thin film photovoltaic, and a lower cost per watt-peak than any other industrial photovoltaic.  Yet device efficiency and cost must be further improved to continue making these devices economically competitive.  This thesis discusses cost reduction of CdTe solar cells by creating ultrathin (< 1 \u00b5m thick) CdTe absorber layers through Magnetron Sputter Deposition.  Previous research on these devices has demonstrated excellent stability, but significantly reduced efficiency when compared to CdTe devices with thicker (typically > 3 \u00b5m thick) absorber layers.  To avoid this efficiency reduction, research is conducted on adding a < 10 nm NiO layer between the CdTe and the metal back contact.  Ideally this NiO layer would act as electron-blocking / hole-transporting layer (HTL), which is typically necessary with ultrathin solar absorbers.  NiO layers were grown by Atomic Layer Deposition, with surface topography characterized through Atomic Force Microscopy (ALD), crystal structure characterized through Grazing-Incidence X-Ray Diffraction, and optical absorption characterized through UV-Vis Spectrometry.  These methods demonstrated that the ALD NiO films were conformal and continuous, p-type, and had an electronic band-gap of 3.55 eV.  500 nm CdTe solar cells developed with 3.5 nm NiO also yielded promising results: Fill Factor was enhanced by 6.74%, and Photon Conversion Efficiency (PCE) was enhanced by 1.12% with the addition of a 3.5 nm NiO layer.  Beyond these experimental tests, additional simulation work using Analysis of Microelectronic and Photonics Structures (AMPS) software demonstrated that CdTe simulations gained 247 mV of open-circuit voltage, and a PCE increase of 6.13% with the addition of a 3.5 nm layer of NiO.

This research looks at simplifying the application of a numerical finite element model defined using this complex model. The significance of the parameters that define the material model on the results has been determined using a robust sensitivity analysis technique. The results from the analysis have been used to identify the critical parameters for density predictions. Since the recommended testing procedures used to characterize the material parameters are expensive and difficult to perform, alternative testing methods have been investigated for ease in industrial application. A testing protocol using a test method proposed by Coube and Riedel (2000) and a technique proposed in this research has been developed for characterizing the material parameters for the \"cap\" model.\n\nThe protocol has been applied for characterizing two commonly used metal powders for die compaction applications: a water atomized A1000C iron powder and a water atomized 316L stainless steel powder.

At the anode, exoelectrogens oxidize organic matter and donate electrons to the electrode. At the cathode, electrotrophs consume electrons for their metabolic needs. BESs have potential for a number of practical purposes, from generating useful fuels such as hydrogen and methane to generating electricity while treating wastewater. The work described here addresses some of the issues in understanding microbial communities in these systems and in improving the functionality of BESs.\nHydrogen and Methane from Swine Wastewater. The production of a useful and valuable product during swine wastewater treatment, such as hydrogen gas, could help to lower treatment costs. Hydrogen can theoretically be produced from wastewater by electrohydrogenesis in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) or by fermentation. Using a single-chamber MEC with a graphite-fiber brush anode, hydrogen gas was generated at 0.9-1.0 m3-H2 m-3 day-1 using full-strength or diluted swine wastewater. COD removals ranged from 8-29% in 20-h tests, and from 69-75% in longer tests (184 hours) using full-strength wastewater. The gas produced was up to 77 \u00b1 11% hydrogen, with overall recoveries of up to 28 \u00b1 6% of the COD in the wastewater as hydrogen gas. Methane was also produced at a maximum of 13 \u00b1 4% of total gas volume. The efficiency of hydrogen production, based on the electrical energy needed (but excluding the energy in the wastewater) compared to the energy of the hydrogen gas produced, was as high as 190 \u00b1 39% in 42-h batch tests with undiluted wastewater, but was lower in longer batch tests of 184 hours (91 \u00b1 6%). Hydrogen gas could not be recovered in fermentation tests using wastewater with a heat-treated inoculum. Hydrogen production was shown to be possible by fermentation when the wastewater was sterilized, but this process would not be practical or energy efficient. We therefore conclude from these tests that MECs are an effective method for hydrogen recovery from swine wastewater treatment, although the process needs to be further evaluated for reducing methane production, increasing the efficiency of converting the organic matter into current, and increasing recovery of hydrogen gas produced at the cathode.\nOptimal Set Anode Potentials Vary in Bioelectrochemical Systems. In BESs, the anode potential can be set to a fixed voltage using a potentiostat but there is no accepted method for defining an optimal potential. Microbes can theoretically gain more energy by reducing a terminal electron acceptor with a more positive potential, for example oxygen compared to nitrate. Therefore, more positive anode potentials should allow microbes to gain more energy per electron transferred than a lower potential, but this can only occur if the microbe has metabolic pathways capable of capturing the available energy. This review of the literature shows that there is a general trend of improved performance using more positive potentials, but there are several notable cases where biofilm growth and current generation improved or only occurred at more negative potentials. This suggests that even with diverse microbial communities, it is primarily the potential of the terminal respiratory proteins used by certain exoelectrogenic bacteria, and to a lesser extent the anode potential, that determines the optimal growth conditions in the reactor. Our analysis suggests that additional bioelectrochemical investigations of both pure and mixed cultures, over a wide range of potentials, are needed to better understand how to set and evaluate optimal anode potentials for improving BES performance. \nImmobilization of anode-attached microbes in a microbial fuel cell. Current-generating (exoelectrogenic) bacteria in BESs may not be culturable using standard in vitro agar-plating techniques, making isolation of new microbes a challenge. More in vivo like conditions are needed where bacteria can be grown and directly isolated on an electrode. While colonies can be developed from single cells on an electrode, the cells must be immobilized after being placed on the surface. Here we present a proof-of-concept immobilization approach that allows exoelectrogenic activity of cells on an electrode based on applying a layer of latex to hold bacteria on surfaces. The effectiveness of this procedure to immobilize particles was first demonstrated using fluorescent microspheres as bacterial analogs. The latex coating was then shown to not substantially affect the exoelectrogenic activity of well-developed anode biofilms in two different systems. A single layer of airbrushed coating did not reduce the voltage produced by a biofilm in an MFC, and more easily applied dip-and-blot coating reduced voltage by only 11% in a MEC. This latex immobilization procedure will enable future testing of single cells for exoelectrogenic activity on electrodes in BESs.\nCharacterization of anodic and cathodic communities in a pilot-scale bio-electrochemical system. MECs can be used to produce hydrogen or methane gas, but there is little information on the archaeal communities in these systems. Methane production in these systems decreases hydrogen production, but the methane produced may be higher than that possible by anaerobic digestion alone, and methane itself is a valuable fuel with a readily available infrastructure. Communities from biofilms on the anode and cathode and from the suspension of a 1000-L pilot-scale MEC reactor were analyzed for archaea and bacteria. Hydrogen gas was initially produced by the reactor, but it was completely replaced by methane production within ~6 weeks that continued through the life of the experiments (~14 weeks). Archaea identified by rRNA analysis were mainly unidentified clones. Among the organisms that were successfully identified as methanogens, those at the cathode were more likely than the methanogens at the anode to consume hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Visual fluorescent in situ hybridization image analysis confirmed the presence of archaea, but the great majority of microbes were bacteria (~90%). Based on 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis, Pelobacter, Geobacter, and Clostridium were present in large numbers in both anodic and cathodic communities, while they were not dominant in the suspension, suggesting that they are involved in substrate transformation processes that resulted in electron transfer to and/or from electrodes. Microbes most similar to Clostridium were a higher percentage of microbes in bacterial communities at the cathode than the anode or suspension, indicating their importance in the cathodic community metabolism. High-throughput pyrosequencing analysis showed Geobacter dominating both anodic and cathodic communities, with Clostridium again having a more significant presence on the cathode. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7200], "author_name_tesi": "Wagner, Rachel Cain", "last_name_ssi": "Wagner", "middle_name_ssi": "Cain", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "John Michael Regan", "Jennifer Macalady", "Christopher Howard House", "Peggy Ann Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Dissertation Advisor", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microbial fuel cell", "microbial electrolysis cell", "methane", "hydrogen", "community analysis", "immobilization", "latex"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Phenology, morphology and physiology of eastern deciduous seedlings under increased temperature and precipitation treatments", "id": "12527", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5220", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I examined phenology, morphology and physiology of 11 early successional eastern deciduous tree species grown under increased temperature and irrigation treatments over three years in Central Pennsylvania.  The relationship between climate manipulation and the phenology, growth rate and biomass allocation was explored for species predicted to experience changes in habitat suitability over the next century as climate changes.  Seedling physiology was used to test the biological responses to manipulated climate conditions through gas exchange and plant-water relations during the final year of the experimental study.  Climate manipulation treatments were established in a four-hectare area that was clear-cut and fenced in August 2007.  Sixteen plots were established in a 2x2 factorial design with four treatments; ambient (control), irrigated (20% increase), warmed (2\u00b0C increase), and warmed+irrigated (20% + 2\u00b0C increase). Seeds of 9 northeastern and 2 southeastern species were planted in the fall of 2007-2009 and were allowed to germinate and grow under treatment conditions until August 2010.  Both germination and leaf out advanced under warmed treatment conditions (10-20 days and 7-11 days respectively). Increasing temperature stimulates biomass production and growth of young, deciduous seedlings, with the greatest proportional increase found in above ground woody tissue. Seedlings in warmed treatments displayed lower leaf area ratios and altered leaf morphology.  Climate treatments did not appear to alter leaf-level measures of foliar carbon and nitrogen.  Warming also resulted in strong positive correlations between relative growth rate and photosynthetic capacity, suggesting that the increase in temperature facilitated an increase in assimilation and growth for the study species. Warming decreased seedling water potentials, however these decreases did not correspond to declines in biomass allocation (root:shoot), photosynthetic rates or stomatal conductance responses.  Instead, early seedling growth was not limited by changes in plant water potential and the increased rates of photosynthesis are a potential cause for the decreases in predawn water potentials observed over the course of the 2010 growing season.    My results highlight the importance of examining both observable morphological responses, as well as the mechanistic physiological responses that young trees exhibit in response to changing climate.  Increasing the temperature and precipitation experienced by developing seedlings in this study showed that the responses of individuals and species may be limited by the developmental constraints of small tree morphology and physiology.  The implications of the results suggest that temperate forests systems experiencing moderate climate change may have a greater resilience at the seedling stage.

These include DNA replication, repair, recombination and transcription. Packaging of the genome into chromatin is achieved via nucleosome formation using histone proteins. Positions of these nucleosomes play a highly important role in determining access to DNA. Till date, several studies have focused into the principles determining nucleosome positioning in the cell. Such studies have revealed an integrative model of nucleosome organization. This model includes contribution from DNA sequence preferences, trans-acting factors, statistical positioning and process of transcription.\nWhile these studies have provided a basic framework to study the determinants of nucleosome positioning, a lot of questions still remain unanswered. We do not have a deep understanding about role of particular factors in different aspects of nucleosome positioning, and how this is brought about. With this objective in mind, we took a nucleosome reconstitution approach to determine the direct and sufficient roles of different factors in nucleosome positioning. We used high-resolution MNase-ChIP-sequencing strategy to determine nucleosome positions in the yeast genome. Interestingly we found that DNA sequence and transcription have very limited roles in nucleosome organization, while ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers play a major role in nucleosome organization.\nSpecifically we show how nucleosome positioning is reconstituted in a step-wise manner using DNA, histones, chromatin remodelers and sequence-specific factors as minimal constituents. In stage 1, DNA sequence features determine NFR formation and positioning with the help of RSC remodeling complex, which directly reads the DNA sequence to catalyze nucleosome removal. In stage 2, +1 nucleosome is reconstituted using two alternative approaches. In the first approach, INO80 remodeling complex positions +1 nucleosome using DNA sequence and shape features while in the second approach ISW2 remodeler uses Abf1 and Reb1 sequence-specific binding proteins as barriers to reconstitute the +1 nucleosome. In stage 3 & 4, nucleosomal arrays are established with correct spacing using ISW1a remodeler.\nTaken together, the work in this thesis has provided advancement into the role of chromatin remodelers as major players in nucleosome organization. We provide some initial evidence for remodeler mechanisms in nucleosome restructuring and a minimal in-vitro system to reconstitute physiological nucleosome organization.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11730], "author_name_tesi": "Wal, Megha ", "last_name_ssi": "Wal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Megha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Joseph C.

With the passage of time, as the crude oil stays on the ocean surface, evaporation of the lighter components of the crude oil and mixing of water with the oil due to wind and ocean turbulence create emulsions that are more dense and more viscous than oil. This makes the ignition of the oil harder to achieve. Prior studies have shown that emulsions containing more than a certain fraction of water do not burn, and thus present a difficulty in applying the in-situ combustion technique. \nMany normally incombustible materials can be ignited when subjected to a certain minimum heat flux, and sustained fire and flame spread can be achieved on these materials. In the present work, this principle is applied to the emulsion combustion problem so that, if successful, the window of opportunity for in-situ combustion of oil spills can be widened. It is proposed that there exists a threshold heat flux level for most of the emulsions such that, when emulsion is exposed to a heat flux equal to or greater than the threshold heat flux, sustained fire and flame spread can be achieved.\nA test facility was designed and built to conduct laboratory scale burn tests of water-in-oil emulsions to study the threshold heat flux values for different types of emulsions. The emulsion samples, floating on water surface, could be subjected to radiative heat flux ranging from 1.2 kW/m2 to 21 kW/m2 in steps of about 1 kW/m2. \nExperimental measurements of threshold heat flux values were made for emulsions of diesel, Milne Point crude oil and Alaska North Slope crude oil with water. The water fraction in the emulsion was changed from 0% to 80% by volume. The crude oil samples were also tested for effects of evaporation of the lighter fractions from the crude oil. Laboratory scale experiments clearly verified that there exists a threshold heat flux for each type of emulsion studied. For example, emulsions of fresh Milne Point crude oil containing 35% water by volume could not be ignited with external heat flux of 11 kW/m2. But the same emulsion composition could be ignited with external heat flux of 13 kW/m2.  15% weathered Milne Point crude oil could not be burned, in unemulsified state, without external heat flux of 10 kW/m2. Emulsions of 26 % weathered Alaska North Slope crude oil containing 50% water by volume could be successfully burned with the help of external heat flux of 9 kW/m2. \nThe data indicate that higher threshold heat flux is required to cause successful burning of emulsions having higher water content or emulsions of more weathered oil. Upon correlating the threshold heat flux data for the crude oils with the density of the crude oil, it was observed that the threshold heat flux values increase with increasing density of the crude oil.\nPrevious studies have proposed that it is the oil that separates from the emulsion that burns and not the emulsion itself. Combining this idea with the results presented, it can be argued that in order to create a sustained emulsion pool fire, the emulsion must be separated into water and oil at such a rate that the rate at which the oil is separated from the emulsion must be at least equal to the rate at which the oil is consumed by combustion. The results from the study also suggest that in order to achieve flame spread, the fire must be of such size as to impose the surrounding emulsion pool with heat flux equal to or more than the threshold heat flux. \nThe combustion process of a water-in-oil emulsion layer floating on top of a water surface, as in case of in-situ burning of oil, spilled at sea that has turned into emulsion, was modeled using comprehensive mathematical treatment. Mathematical models are available in the literature for oil pool fires but not for emulsion pool fires. This model is unique as it incorporates the separation of emulsion into water and oil, a phenomenon that governs the emulsion pool fires. The burning process is divided into three regimes, as follows.\n1. \tThe initial regime, when the emulsion layer floating on the ocean surface receives heat flux from an external source such as an igniter or a burning oil pool;\n2. \tThe intermediate regime, from the instant when there is first appearance of oil layer on the top of the emulsion layer due to breaking of emulsion until the oil starts evaporating; and,\n3. \tThe final regime, which is characterized by the combustion of oil vapor and continues till the fire extinguishes.\nThe model was solved numerically using finite difference method and it was validated using the data from the laboratory scale burn experiments involving emulsions of diesel with water. The model predictions were used to study the effects of emulsion composition and oil weathering on important emulsion pool fire characteristics such as, the average burning rate, total duration of the burn, the volume of the oil residue and the overall oil burning efficiency.\nThe average oil burning rate, total duration of burn, the volume of the oil residue and the burn efficiency decreased with increasing water content of the emulsion. Average oil burn rate and the overall burn efficiency decreased with increased weathering of the oil whereas the total burn time and the volume of the oil residue increased with increased weathering of the oil. Comparisons of the model predictions with the experimental observations showed that most of the model predictions were found to be within 25% of the observed values. The model has captured the description of significant processes involved in emulsion combustion, and thus is able to describe the experimental observations with sufficient accuracy.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [561], "author_name_tesi": "Walavalkar, Ajey Y.", "last_name_ssi": "Walavalkar", "middle_name_ssi": "Y.", "first_name_ssi": "Ajey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni", "Dr Savash Yavuzkurt", "Ralph Webb", "Sarma V Pisupati"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni, Committee Chair", "Dr Savash Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Ralph Webb, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Crude Oil Emulsions", "Oil Spill", "Oil Spill Modeling", "In-situ Combustion"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Networked Work-life: A Study of Employee Use of Intranet Media and Organizational Communication\n", "id": "18844", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8825", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explored the social influences on employees\u2019 use of technology in two contexts, work and home.

Since hosts have little interest in supplying resources to parasites and parasites often live at high densities, resources can be in short supply. As a result, competition between parasites within-hosts can be intense. The important role that within-host competition plays in the evolution of drug resistance, which is considered to be the greatest threat to human health in the 21st century, has lately been recognized. Drug resistance is often associated with costs, such that drug resistant parasites lose in competition with their drug susceptible conspecifics in untreated environments. Only when drug treatment removes their susceptible competitors from the within-host environment can drug resistant parasites acquire enough resources to proliferate. So, within-host competition for resources could play a key role in the control of drug resistant parasites and understanding the nature of within-host competition is essential.\n\nHere we use a mouse model of malaria infection, Plasmodium chabaudi, to investigate how the availability of within-host resources impacts both the population dynamics of parasites and the emergence of drug resistant parasites. We demonstrate that a micronutrient, para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), limits the growth of parasites and mediates competition between pyrimethamine resistant and susceptible parasites. We show that pyrimethamine resistant parasites require more pABA than susceptible parasites, apparently as a cost of the mutation that confers pyrimethamine resistance. As a result, pyrimethamine resistant parasites suffer intense competitive suppression from susceptible parasites in hosts depleted of pABA. Indeed, depleting pABA from the host causes the competitive exclusion of pyrimethamine resistant parasites and prevents their emergence following drug treatment. pABA depletion has this effect irrespective of the genetic background of either drug resistant or susceptible parasites. We propose depleting resources required in excess by resistant parasites as a novel, potentially 'evolution-proof'  resistance management strategy, which could be used in a wide variety of systems. Motivated by the observation that the availability of pABA within-hosts appears to change how drug resistant parasites interact with the immune system, we develop a modeling framework with which to investigate the nature of the antimalarial immune response and its drivers. The model illuminates that the nature of the antimalarial response changes with the availability of pABA within-hosts, as well as with the genetic background of parasites, and suggests a common mechanism for these observations. It also shows that the immune response may have an important role in determining the availability of another within-host resource required by malaria parasites, namely red blood cells.\n\nOur work shows that changes in within-host resource availability can alter parasite-parasite and host-parasite interactions and can be harnessed in the management of drug resistance.

Gravitropism was studied in one day and kinetics observations for Phaseolus vulgaris basal roots, secondary roots that emerge from the root-shoot interface.  Variation in gravitropism among genotypes, phosphorus treatments, basal root whorls, or ethylene treatments was tested.  Basal root responses to gravistimulation varied among genotypes and whorls.  In kinetics observations, there were differences between the two genotypes tested in curvature and timing of graviresponsiveness.  Decreased mean and increased variance of curvature responses to gravistimulation were observed with ethylene treatment, and this was not attributable to growth rate differences.  Results suggest that graviresponsiveness and ethylene modulation play roles in development of root architecture.  The geometric simulation model SimRoot was used to dynamically model root systems for testing how tradeoffs in allocation between adventitious and basal roots, or how variation in root architecture as determined by fractal analysis affect phosphorus acquisition.  Empirical data validated simulations.  Phosphorus acquisition and efficiency increase with adventitious rooting in soil conditions encountered in nature and agriculture, where more phosphorus is available near the surface than in deeper soil.  This benefit of adventitious rooting is limited to plants with similar respiration among basal and adventitious roots.  Adventitious roots complement basal roots, so that the most phosphorus is expected to be acquired with 30 or more adventitious roots, shallow basal roots, and seeds planted within the phosphorus rich surface soil stratum.  Results will be useful in developing ideotypes for more nutrient efficient crops.  Fractal analysis of simulated roots using fractal dimension, fractal abundance and lacunarity reveals higher correlation with soil phosphorus depletion volume or competition for phosphorus when fractal parameters are combined in multiple regression than when used individually in simple regression.  Root length is highly correlated with soil phosphorus depletion and competition volumes, but, in practice, it is difficult to measure.  Fractal analysis with two dimensional slices indicates correlation of fractal parameters with phosphorus depletion and competition, and this was verified with field trench data.

However, following Katrina (2005) storm surge was removed from the SSHS, resulting in no concise method to communicate storm surge risk despite its significant impacts to both life and property. This study seeks to create a new storm surge scale based on observed data for quick, simple, and clear communication. The proposed scale combines ideas from two well known scales: the SSHS and the Richter Scale. From the SSHS, the link to tangible impacts is used, but with a fiscal loss basis instead of a physical damage one. From the Richter Scale, the logarithmic nature is used to solve saturation issues at the higher end, its intuitive nature is used for ease of understanding, and the added decimal places are used for extra fiscal loss estimate precision. Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) model simulation output data of storm surge height and velocity were obtained for four storms: Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Gustav, Hurricane Ike, and Superstorm Sandy. Storm surge velocity has not been previously used in past scale attempts but is explored here. Four fiscal loss methods were explored on a countywide level. The first three methods used a combination of National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Storm Events Database (SED) property damages and Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) population, per capita personal income, or total income. The fourth method used a combination of National Flood Insurance Program total coverage and paid claims. Correlations between the two proposed storm surge variables and each of the fiscal loss methods indicated that the mode of storm surge data above the 90th percentile had the best results. This method of storm surge representation was chosen for the proposed scale. Multiple linear regression then determined the choice of storm surge variables and fiscal loss method.

The objectives are twofold, 1) to evaluate and modify selected hydraulic conductivity measurement techniques to enhance their reliability and accuracy;  and 2) to comprehensively evaluate the changes in soil properties after receiving over forty years of wastewater irrigation, including the use of improved methodologies addressed in the first objective.\n\n\nThe tension infiltrometer is a standard tool for measuring near-saturated soil hydraulic properties.  We examined the dynamics of the supply tension at the interface between the tension infiltrometer and the measured soil using a pressure transducer under different soil conditions and raised some cautions needed for proper use of this standard device.  Infiltration experiments were conducted on a tension table, a large sand column, and in two field soils of contrasting textures and structures to test the performance of the standard two-piece infiltrometer.  Results showed that during high flow rates (> 200 cm3 min-1) the tension at the infiltrometer/soil interface started to deviate by as much as 15 mm from the desired tension.  However, during field experiments the high flow rates were not experienced, and thus no deviation was observed between the pre-set desired tension and the actual measured tension at the infiltrometer/soil interface.  To alleviate the problem of tension deviation under high flow, the water supply tubing and fitting diameters of the standard infiltrometer were successfully increased to yield a higher flow rate (~300-400 cm3 min-1) without elevated tensions.  \n\n\nThe constant head method for determining saturated hydraulic conductivity is a classical laboratory method for measuring the soil\u2019s ability to conduct water.  One error commonly associated with this technique occurs when there is flow between the edge of the soil sample and the cylindrical ring holding the soil sample.  We developed a method to minimize the effects of this artificial boundary flow.  A new simple permeameter was constructed to separate flow between the outer and inner portions of the soil core. Intact core samples from the surface and subsurface Hagerstown silt loam series were analyzed to quantify the edge flow phenomenon. Outer saturated hydraulic conductivity (associated with possible edge flow) was found to be significantly higher than the inner saturated hydraulic conductivity (p = 0.038, n = 153). The A-horizon surface samples were found to have significant edge flow (n=110,  p =0.049), whereas the subsurface soil samples did not experience significant edge flow because of possible clay expansion.  In addition, brilliant blue dye was used to visually confirm the edge flow phenomenon.   This study also investigated the length of saturation time needed to saturate the soil cores, and found that the heavier textured cores should be saturated for at least a week.  A long term experiment was conducted for eight days to determine if and when the outflow volume reaches steady-state.  The results indicated that, although the core appeared to be at steady-state during short time periods, true steady-state conditions were not achieved until approximately five days into the experiment.  Furthermore, the new permeameter\u2019s results were compared with in situ hydraulic conductivity methods.  Taken altogether, these results suggest that the hydraulic conductivity values from the inner portion of the soil core are more comparable to the in situ tension and double ring infiltrometer conductivity values observed in the field.  \n\n\nFor over 40 years, The Pennsylvania State University (PSU) has irrigated its wastewater onto both cropped and forested lands.  While this method of wastewater disposal has gained popularity in water-deficit regions, it is not widely used in areas that have a surplus of water.  Despite local weather conditions, PSU sprays two inches of wastewater a week.  This irrigation, combined with the natural precipitation, amount to approximately 140 inches of water per year, which is equivalent to tropical rainfall.  The objective of this study was to investigate the morphological and functional changes in soils as a result of this increased water load.  \n\n\nPrevious studies conducted at this site provided an estimate of the original soil properties.  Soil morphological parameters, such as structure, horizonation and redoximorphic features, were evaluated from the soil cores and in situ soil pits.   In addition, soil functional parameters, such as saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, texture, organic matter content, and pH, were evaluated to determine the longevity of the wastewater irrigation system.  \n\n\nResults indicate that the soils are experiencing periods of saturation and local erosion, which are explained by redoximorphic features and over thickened A-horizons found on the site. Although redoximorphic features were found to experience a significant increase in size since the last description in 1978, they did not increase in frequency.  The site was also evaluated based on three different landscape positions: summit, side-slope, and depression.  These positions were found to be statistically different when describing morphological features (i.e., manganese coating percentage, A-horizon depth, soil structure) and physical features (i.e., bulk density). As a result of prolonged irrigation, soil functionality has also changed.  Visual observations of increased runoff amounts are supported by laboratory findings of reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity in some regions of the study area. Collectively, these findings indicate that the summit areas may be the cause of excess runoff, having the lowest hydraulic conductivity values and most eroded A-horizon.  Conversely, while the depressional areas are the most saturated, a result of receiving extra runon from the summit positions, laboratory hydraulic conductivity results indicate these depressions can transmit the greatest amount of water. We therefore propose remediation to increase the hydraulic conductivity of the summit areas in order to keep this area sustainable for future years to come. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1198], "author_name_tesi": "Walker, Charles William", "last_name_ssi": "Walker", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Charles", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hangsheng Lin", "Daniel Dale Fritton", "Maxim J Schlossberg", "Gary Walter Petersen", "Richard Rudolph Parizek"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hangsheng Lin, Committee Chair", "Daniel Dale Fritton, Committee Member", "Maxim J Schlossberg, Committee Member", "Gary Walter Petersen, Committee Member", "Richard Rudolph Parizek, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity", "Wastewater Irrigation", "Hydropedology", "Landscape Hydrology", "Tension Infiltrometer"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Privatization of Political Influence: Professional Grassroots Lobbying in the United States", "id": "7611", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1864", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Institutional grassroots lobbying campaigns \u2013 attempts by corporations, industry groups, public interest groups, and government agencies to mobilize the public as a strategic force in efforts to shape legislative activity \u2013 became prevalent in the U.S. in the closing decades of the twentieth century.  The growth and widespread encouragement and subsidization of citizen activism by large institutions suggests that dramatic changes have taken place in U.S. civil society, as citizens participate less in politics and in their communities, despite growth in the field of voluntary associations.  In examining the rise of these campaigns, I build upon two literatures in the social sciences: (1) civic engagement and the changing means by which individuals participate in community and political life, and (2) the privatization of the modern public sphere.  Using a unique data source on the private firms that provide grassroots political marketing services to institutional clients, this dissertation examines the rise of institutional campaigns to lobby the public and considers how institutional clients vary in their employment of such techniques.  I find that declining participation in politics, an expanding field of advocacy associations, and increasing business advocacy have combined to spur the growth of institutional grassroots lobbying.  For the corporations that use grassroots lobbying techniques, I find that the employment of grassroots lobbying is best understood as an expansion of their existing repertoire of lobbying techniques; industry groups, on the other hand, engage in grassroots campaigns mainly to mobilize the businesses and corporate leaders that comprise their organization.  Public interest groups, by contrast, tend to hire lobbying firms very rarely, and those that do tend to be well-resourced and/or have an extensive member base.  I conclude by considering how institutional grassroots lobbying campaigns are helping to privatize political influence not only in the sense that they assist private interests to express themselves in the public sphere, but in that the forms of civic participation that follow from such institutional campaigns are largely private and individualistic in how they mobilize participation.

Scaling down individual transistors allows integrated circuits to be more powerful and flexible, while reducing their weight and volume. This is highly attractive for space electronics given the cost of launching objects into space. Semiconducting two-dimensional materials (2DMs), such as tungsten diselenide (WSe2), are of recent interest for developing ultimately-scaled transistors. These materials have a layered structure with a thickness of individual atoms at the monolayer limit, and are compatible with existing device fabrication processes. However, the space environment imposes an additional constraint on the device performance of radiation hardness. Space is filled with high energy ionizing radiation \u2013 i.e. X-rays, gamma rays, protons, electrons, and heavy ions \u2013 that can damage and destroy devices. As such, the stability of WSe2 against various forms of ionizing radiation should be critically examined to determine if it possesses sufficient radiation hardness for space applications.\n     In this work, the stability of WSe2 against X-rays, low energy plasma, protons, and heavy metal ions has been studied. WSe2 was prepared using a combination of transfer via mechanical exfoliation and growth via metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Mechanical exfoliation is used to transfer micrometer-thick flakes onto substrates. To obtain nanometer thick films and individual layers, MOCVD was used. In this process, WSe2 is formed by controllably reacting gas phase pre-cursors of its constituent elements at elevated temperatures. The pre-cursors react on the surface of a substrate (e.g. silicon carbide (SiC)), nucleate as a WSe2 crystal, and grow into individual domains or coalesced films. X-ray exposure was achieved using the soft X-rays generated in an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system for 12 hours in ultra-high vacuum. Plasma was generated by the ionization of helium and oxygen gas under medium vacuum conditions using an RF generator. Protons and heavy ions were generated by stripping the electrons from gases of hydrogen, iron, and silver, and were accelerated into the WSe2 samples under high vacuum conditions. Total fluences are varied from 1014 particles/cm2 to ~1018 particles/cm2, which covers the typical expected values for space electronics. Modification to the WSe2 induced by ionizing radiation is primarily studied using XPS, a highly surface sensitive characterization technique.\n     It is found that each form of ionizing radiation has a different impact on the WSe2. Soft X-rays induce a charge in the WSe2 that is dependent on the domain size and surface coverage. Isolated domains of MOCVD-grown WSe2 are subject to a small surface potential on the order of 100 meV, which is attributed to interface states formed at the edges of these domains. Fully coalesced films of MOCVD-grown WSe2 were not significantly affected by X-rays, even at a fluence of 1.86 \u00d7 1018 photons/cm2. The low energy plasma can be used to convert the top layers of WSe2 into a mix of tungsten oxide (WOx) and selenium oxide. MOCVD-grown WSe2 is found to be more susceptible to oxidation than the exfoliated material, perhaps due to a greater defect density. Surprisingly, the extent of oxidation is not very sensitive to changes in plasma parameters such as pressure or gas flow rate, suggesting that much of the oxidation is due to air exposure after the treatment.\n     Knowledge of the effects of protons and heavy ions with energies in the mega-electron-volt (MeV) range are the most directly related to knowledge of WSe2 stability in the space environment. It was determined that WSe2 flakes exfoliated onto SiC were not affected by 2 MeV proton bombardment up to a dose of 1015 protons/cm2.  Once a dose of 1016 /cm2 had been achieved, there was significant charge transfer between the WSe2 and the SiC substrate that arose from damage to the SiC. The SiC was observed to turn black due to the large generation of vacancies corresponding to a deep acceptor lying 1.1 eV below the conduction band edge. The damage to SiC and charging in WSe2 are expected to permanently disrupt device operation, despite a lack of physical damage to the WSe2. No physical changes such as oxidation occurred in the WSe2 due to this bombardment, suggesting that it is highly stable against cosmic radiation that mostly consists of protons. As such, the choice of substrate will be critical in tuning the radiation hardness of WSe2-based devices. Additionally, this damage threshold is several orders of magnitude greater than what was observed for damage to MoS2-based devices on SiO2. As such, top-gated 2DM-based devices using semi-insulating SiC as a substrate are suggested for future miniaturized space electronics. 1 MeV protons are found to have a qualitatively similar effect as the 2 MeV protons. By using lower energy protons (i.e. 0.2 MeV and 0.04 MeV), the vacancy-rich region in the SiC is found to move closer to the sample surface, and the charging in the WSe2 is reduced.\n     In contrast, exposure to heavy metal ions such as iron and silver at a fluence of 1016 ions/cm2 leads to significant physical damage for both the exfoliated WSe2 and the SiC substrate. The WSe2 is converted into a mixture of Se-poor WSe2 and WOx due to selenium volatilization during the bombardment and oxidation once exposed to air.  The material continues to lose selenium and gain oxygen over time even when stored in medium vacuum. The SiC turns black and becomes fully amorphous. Significant concentrations of silicon oxide are generated after air exposure, suggesting that carbon is preferentially sputtered out from the sample due to ion bombardment. However, the SiC is stable under storage in medium vacuum and does not significantly change from its damaged state. The valence band spectra revealed that the heterostructure undergoes a semiconducting to metallic transition due to the extensive damage. As such, a device in the space environment based on the WSe2/SiC heterostructure would be expected to be permanently destroyed after exposure to this fluence of heavy metal ions. Complimentary proton and ion studies using MOCVD-grown material are in the planning stages and highly recommended as future work.\n     This work has elucidated some of the physical responses of WSe2 to ionizing radiation. This material appears to be robust against soft X-rays but is susceptible to low energy plasma, high energy protons, and high energy ions. Further work determining the sensitivity of WSe2-based devices to X-rays, protons and ions is recommended to measure the changes to the electronic properties of this material, as well as critical points of failure in the devices. To accomplish this, the stability of the WSe2/dielectric interface must also be studied, and the compatibility of high-k dielectric materials, such as HfO2, with 2DMs must be determined.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14585], "author_name_tesi": "Walker, Roger Craig", "last_name_ssi": "Walker", "middle_name_ssi": "Craig", "first_name_ssi": "Roger", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua Alexander Robinson", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Saptarshi Das"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua Alexander Robinson, Thesis Advisor", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Saptarshi Das, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["two-dimensional materials", "tungsten diselenide", "radiation", "X-ray", "proton", "ion", "plasma", "radiation materials science", "nanomaterials", "semiconductors", "silicon carbide", "layered materials", "space electronics", "radiation tolerance"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Detection of Multiple Pathogens by Surface Plasmon Resonance Imaging", "id": "10892", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5747", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this research was to determine if a surface plasmon resonance imaging device could be used to detect multiple pathogenic microorganisms that are commonly connected to food related illness.  First, the dynamic range of the SPR imaging device was improved by the conversion of the device from a fixed-angle configuration to a scanning angle configuration by the addition of a computer-controlled stepper motor on the prism assembly.   The enhanced dynamic range was challenged by studying the application of multiple, alternating thin polymer films of Poly(L-lysine) hydrobromide and poly(L-glutamate).  The original fixed angle configuration was theoretically limited to differentiating less than 5 pairs of alternating films while the scanning angle configuration was tested to 7 pairs of alternating films without reaching the limit of dynamic range. \nThe scanning imaging SPR device was applied to the detection and differentiation of: E. coli O157 and two non-O157 STEC strains, E. coli O128 and E. coli O101.   To functionalize the gold surface of the SPR slide with an array of antibodies, self-assembled layers of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid, poly(ethylenimine) and ExtrAvidin were applied.  A commercial biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was mated to the ExtrAvidin surface and then antibody probes were acquired directly from the three types of rabbit antiserum.  The results for this methodology were disappointing, with no differences between the antibody-functionalized array spots and non-functionalized control spots for any of the three E. coli strains.\nThe methodology and goals were simplified and the SPR imaging device, restored to a fixed-angle configuration, was applied to the detection of E. coli O157, Salmonella enterica, and Listeria monocytogenes in pure cultures and in apple juice. Again using a self-assembled multilayer approach, the surface was functionalized with layers of 11-Amino-undecanethiol hydrochloride, N-succinimidyl-S-acetylthiopropionate, and streptavidin-maleimide resulting in a streptavidin surface layer.

Using RT-PCR, Nampt cDNA was identified in multiple tissues in the chicken, with the deduced amino acid sequence chicken Nampt being 92-93% homologous to mammalian Nampt. Skeletal muscle was found to contain 5-fold and 3-fold greater quantities of Nampt mRNA and protein than the abdominal fat pad, respectively.

Similarly, the dissolution of bornite by ferric sulfate solutions also produced changes to the \n\nmineral structure: a contraction of the bornite unit-cell volume as \u201cnon-stoichiometric bornite\u201d formed.  XRD \n\nresults demonstrated that the structure of non-stoichiometric bornite is similar to mooihoekite \n\n(Cu<sub>2.25</sub>Fe<sub>2.25</sub>S<sub>4</sub>). These results clarified the reaction sequences that occur \n\nwhen ferric sulfate solutions dissolve chalcocite and bornite.\n<br><br>\nBy combining time-resolved diffraction data of these Cu sulfide dissolution reactions with real-time sampling \n\nand isotopic analysis of the eluates, we were able to discern structural controls on Cu isotope fractionation \n\nduring dissolution.  As described in Chapter 3, during the initial stages of bornite oxidative dissolution by \n\nferric sulfate (<5 mol% of total Cu leached), dissolved Cu was enriched in isotopically heavy Cu \n\n(<sup>65</sup>Cu) relative to the solid, with an average apparent isotope fractionation (&Delta;<sub>aq-\n\nmin</sub> = &delta;<sup>65</sup>Cu<sub>aq</sub> -  &delta;<sup>65</sup>Cu</sup><sub>min</sub>o, where \n\n&delta;<sup>65</sup>Cu<sub>aq</sub>  is the isotopic composition of the leached Cu and \n\n&delta;<sup>65</sup>Cu<sub>min</sub>o is the isotopic composition of the beginning mineral powder) of  2.20 \u00b1 \n\n0.25\u2030 (Chapter 3).  When >20 mol% Cu was leached from the solid, the difference between the Cu isotope \n\ncomposition of the aqueous and mineral phases approached zero, with &Delta;<sub>aq-min</sub>o values ranging \n\nfrom -0.21 \u00b1 0.61\u2030 to 0.92 \u00b1 0.25\u2030. We propose that the decrease in the apparent isotope fractionation as the \n\nreaction progressed resulted from distillation of isotopically heavy Cu (<sup>65</sup>Cu) during dissolution \n\nor isotope effects associated with the formation of a leached layer on the surfaces of bornite particles. \n<br><br>\nSimilarly, during the initial stages of chalcocite oxidative dissolution (Chapter 4), leached fluids were \n\nenriched in heavy Cu (<sup>65</sup>Cu) with &delta;<sup>65</sup>Cu values of ~3\u2030.  As the dissolution \n\nreaction progressed and chalcocite transformed to covellite, the leached Cu became isotopically lighter and \n\n&delta;<sup>65</sup>Cu values of the leachate decreased to as low as -3.01\u2030.  Isotope box models are \n\nconsistent with two isotope effects that influence the degree of fractionation observed during the reaction: \n\none due to oxidation (&alpha; ~ 1.003) and another due to changes in bonding during mineral transformations \n\n(&alpha; ~ 1.001). These results may be useful in interpreting the extent of weathering in Cu ore bodies and \n\nthe potential for Cu release from acid mine drainage environments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [180], "author_name_tesi": "Wall, Andrew James", "last_name_ssi": "Wall", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney", "Peter J Heaney", "Susan Louise Brantley", "Matthew Scott Fantle", "William D Burgos"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter J Heaney, Committee Chair", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Member", "Matthew Scott Fantle, Committee Member", "William D Burgos, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cu isotopes", "chalcocite", "bornite", "copper sulfides", "isotope fractionation", "synchrotron X-ray diffraction"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS\nIN PLANT COMPARATIVE GENOMICS\n", "id": "8625", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4917", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The integration and advancements of molecular biology, evolution, and computer science over the past few decades have led to the development of several new fields of study.  Comparative genomics, the study of the similarities and differences between two or more genomes, continues to be fueled by the rapidly growing number of fully sequenced genomes in our public databases.  As of 2008, the plant scientific community has sequenced ten plant genomes, with plans to sequence more than twenty genomes over the next few years.   Therefore, there is a need for flexible, gene family focused databases that provide rich toolsets for comparative analyses of plants.  The PlantTribes database is based on the results of a series of controlled protein clustering experiments performed at multiple stringencies, which produce sets of objectively defined plant gene families. Nearly a dozen published articles to date have relied on data extracted from PlantTribes including the recent Populus and papaya genome sequence papers, expression divergence following gene duplication, identification of gene families for intensive phylogenetic analysis, identification of microRNAs and their associated targets, and genome duplication history of basal angiosperms.  Comparative genomics has also been aided in the rapid advancements in sequencing technologies over the last few decades.  Next Generation (NG) sequencing technologies have become a great resource to the genomics community because of the extremely low \u2018per base\u2019 cost of sequencing.  A simulation approach was developed to help determine the optimal mixture of sequencing methods for most complete and cost effective transcriptome sequencing.  In terms of sequence coverage alone, the NG sequencing platforms are a dramatic advance over capillary-based sequencing. Sequencing and microarray outcomes from multiple experiments suggest that our simulator will be useful for guiding Next Generation transcriptome sequencing projects in a wide range of organisms.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4894], "author_name_tesi": "Wall, P.

The effects of inversions on most of these organisms are frequently and extensively studied. Drosophila pseudoobscura is known to have more than 30 different inversions on its third chromosome and is one of the most frequently studied inversion systems. We employed this inversion system to study the evolutionary history of the gene arrangements that resulted from some of these inversions. The standard and most widely accepted phylogeny of the D. pseudoobscura gene arrangements was generated in the early 1900\u2019s and the phylogeny was established using cytological analyses. The fairly recent sequencing of the D. pseudoobscura genome enabled us to develop a large molecular dataset to investigate the phylogeny of the inversion system. The dataset contained regions near inversion breakpoints because these regions are potentially informative because recombination is suppressed at inversion breakpoints. Several non-breakpoint regions were also included in the data set. There were three key questions addressed in this study. 1) Is the origin of the inversion polymorphism monophyletic? 2) Is the molecular phylogeny consistent with the cytological phylogeny? 3) Which arrangement is the ancestral in the D. pseudoobscura population? We were able to provide support for a monophyletic origin of this inversion polymorphism and our results also provided support for the cytological phylogeny. Though further experimentation is necessary to identify the exact ancestor, we were able to determine that the ancestral arrangement is either the Santa Cruz or the Hypothetical arrangement.\nA population genetics study was also performed using the same dataset. In this study, we investigated how nucleotide diversity within and between D. pseudoobscura inversions was altered by differences in the levels of genetic exchange across the chromosome. Consistent with theoretical predictions, regions within the proximal segment had lower levels of recombination than regions in the distal segment of the chromosome. We also identified one inversion (PP) that shared more genetic information with all other arrangements than any other arrangement studied. Finally, our results indicated that positive selection is acting on this species and that this species has recently experienced a population expansion.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [130], "author_name_tesi": "Wallace, Andre George", "last_name_ssi": "Wallace", "middle_name_ssi": "George", "first_name_ssi": "Andre", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Hong Ma", "Mary Poss", "Avery August"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member", "Hong Ma, Committee Chair", "Mary Poss, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chromosomal inversion", "breakpoints", "gene conversion", "Drosophila pseudoobscura", "Population Genetics", "Recombination"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Development and Validation of a Wind Generator Field Testing Methodology\n", "id": "11556", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "663", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to develop a wind turbine field testing system with the capability of performing comprehensive power production and rotor aerodynamics studies.

This work involved the prediction and experimental measurement of the electrical and aerodynamic performance of three wind turbines; a 3 kW rated Whisper 175, 2.4 kW rated Skystream 3.7, and the Penn State designed Carolus wind turbine. Both the Skystream and Whisper 175 wind turbines are OEM blades which were originally installed at the facilities. The Carolus rotor is a carbon-fiber composite 2-bladed machine, designed and assembled at Penn State, with the intent of replacing the Whisper 175 rotor at the off-grid system. Rotor aerodynamic performance is modeled using WT$\\_$Perf, a National Renewable Energy Laboratory developed Blade Element Momentum theory based performance prediction code. Steady-state power curves are predicted by coupling experimentally determined electrical characteristics with the aerodynamic performance of the rotor simulated with WT_Perf. A dynamometer test stand is used to establish the electro-mechanical efficiencies of the wind-electric system generator. Through the coupling of WT_Perf and dynamometer test results, an aero-electro-mechanical analysis procedure is developed and provides accurate predictions of wind system performance. The analysis of three different wind turbines gives a comprehensive assessment of the capability of the field test facilities and the accuracy of aero-electro-mechanical analysis procedures. Results from this study show that the Carolus and Whisper 175 rotors are running at higher tip-speed ratios than are optimum for power production. The aero-electro-mechanical analysis predicted the high operating tip-speed ratios of the rotors and was accurate at predicting output power for the systems. It is shown that the wind turbines operate at high tip-speeds because of a miss-match between the aerodynamic drive torque and the operating torque of the wind-system generator. Through the change of load impedance on the wind generator, the research facility has the ability to modify the rotational speed of the wind turbines, allowing the rotors to perform closer to their optimum tip-speed.

Emphasis was placed on monolithic integration with interposer electronics, and in understanding the role of mechanical boundary conditions on the ferroelectric/ferroelastic response.\n\nCo-processing of ZnO thin film transistors (TFTs) with Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)0.98Nb0.02O3 (PZT)-based piezoelectrics was investigated to assess whether interposer electronics on PZT can serve as a control scheme for large area arrays of sensors or actuators. ZnO TFT processing produced no measured changes in remanent polarization, dielectric constant, loss tangent, or aging rates. The TFT performance also did not degrade when fabricated on top of the PZT, the mobility (> 24 cm/Vs) remaining comparable to TFTs deposited on glass. To show ZnO array integration, a 5x5 array of PZT capacitors on glass was fabricated as a prototype for an adjustable X-ray mirror, where the ZnO TFT were used for row-column addressing of the actuators. 1.5 \uf06dm thick sputter deposited PZT on glass patterned with large area (cm2) electrodes had a dielectric constant of >1200, tan\uf064 ~ 2% and an average remanent polarization >23 \u03bcC/cm2. Photoreactive benzocyclobutene (BCB) electrically isolated the ZnO TFTs from the top electrodes of the piezoelectric.  Flex cables were bonded to the wafer using anisotropic conductive film (ACF) to connect the gates (row control) and the drains (column control) in the TFT array to a control box. It was found that when actuating the PZT cells through the TFT array, the glass mirror experienced approximately 1.5 \u00b5m of deflection for a 10 V application. \nStudies on ferroelectric/ferroelastic domain reorientation were also performed on 1.9 \uf06dm thick tetragonal {001} oriented PbZr0.3Ti0.7O3 films doped with 1% Mn. Different mechanical boundary constraints were investigated and domain reorientation was quantified through the intensity changes in the 002/200 Bragg reflections as a function of applied electric field. As the silicon substrate was systematically removed from beneath the electrode film and the mechanical boundary constraints of the substrate are relaxed, it was found that domains have an increased ability to reorient under applied fields. When 75% of the substrate was removed, more than a six fold increase in domain reorientation was observed. This approaches values for bulk ceramics and suggests that the piezoelectric coefficients should be enhanced upon declamping. \n\nThe geometry of the released structures was also found to influence the domain reorientation. An untextured 1.77 \u00b5m thick PbZr0.3Ti0.7O3 thin film doped with 1% Mn was fabricated with electrodes which were 75% released in two different geometries, a circular diaphragm and an elongated beam diaphragm. It was found that when the electrodes were locally released (unable to freely deform and curl upon actuation) the amount of domain reorientation observed in clamped electrodes and the electrodes with circularly released diaphragms was approximately the same. Two times more domain reorientation was seen in locally released electrodes with elongated diaphragms for the same field excursion. This disparity between the two types of release state was shown to be due to the presence of in-plane stress which was not fully relieved upon the removal of the Si substrate. In release geometries where the perimeter of the free boundary is small, such as the case with the hole geometry, the in-plane stress suppresses domain reorientation. To further investigate the role of the substrate, in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction was used to study intensity exchanges on 101/110 reflections in unoriented 950 nm thick PbZr0.3Ti0.7O3 thin film doped with 1% Mn on two substrates with different elastic properties: silicon and a borosilicate glass. The film on glass showed 32.1% domain reorientation at 3 Vc while the film on silicon showed 28.7%. Moreover, the amount of backswitching the films experienced upon release in field was shown to occur in a similar ratio to the difference in substrate elastic moduli. Films on glass which showed better saturated domain alignment (from less backswitching after poling), had smaller irreversible Rayleigh coefficients, \u03b1. Additionally, while the films were untextured, there was a higher {001} texture in the film on silicon. While this might have predisposed the film on silicon to have a higher a e31,f than the film on glass, it was found that due to the higher remanence in the film on glass, the measured piezoelectric coefficients between the two films were within error (e_(31,f)^glass~ \u20135.9 C/m2, e_(31,f)^silicon~ \u20135.7 C/m2).\n\nFinally, a process is presented for transferring a 850 nm thick Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)0.98Nb0.02O3 thin film from a silicon substrate, where it was grown, to a polymer substrate using a ZnO sacrificial layer. The developed process enabled measurements of PZT thin films with only 5 \u00b5m of polyimide as the substrate. Released electrodes were tested and compared to the response of a clamped film deposited concurrently. It was found that the film on polymer shows a slight increase in maximum and average remanent polarization as a result of imprint produced during the release process. Therefore, the films on polymer had a more saturated domain alignment after poling. When the films were electrically deaged, the Rayleigh behavior of both the clamped and released films was similar. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10511], "author_name_tesi": "Wallace, Margeaux Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Wallace", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Margeaux", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Clive A Randall", "Joshua Alexander Robinson", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Raegan Johnson Wilke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Dissertation Advisor", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Joshua Alexander Robinson, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member", "Raegan Johnson Wilke, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thin films", "piezoelectrics", "integrated electronics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Stochastic post-processing for topology design and capacity assignment on a multi-class network with guarantees on robustness and Quality Of Service.", "id": "15183", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7297", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis considers a domain in the Internet and proposes a strategic problem of designing its network.

Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentrations in the anode chamber >500 mg/L can also prevent bacteria from efficiently utilizing acetate, reducing power production by the cell.\nTo reduce nitrogen crossover into the anode chamber, an additional low concentration (LC) chamber and AEM were installed between the high concentration cell in the RED stack and the adjacent anode chamber, and ion exchange resin was added to increase the chamber conductivity and reduce internal resistance. With this configuration, the overall nitrogen crossover into the anode was reduced by up to 96.5% compared to a standard configuration (no additional chamber) in a 24-hour fed-batch cycle. Anode pH rose from 8.5 to 10.5, instead of decreasing as is normally observed in an MREC. Resistance due to all membranes in the stack increased from 103 \u03a9-cm2 to 295 \u03a9-cm2, and an additional 637 \u03a9-cm2 resistance was introduced by the solution in the low concentration chamber. When the additional LC chamber was filled (50%) with anion exchange resin, solution resistance decreased by 74% to 166 \u03a9-cm2. In a lab-scale MREC, it was estimated that three additional RED cell pairs would be necessary to make up for power loss due to the membrane and solution resistance introduced by the LC chamber.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10586], "author_name_tesi": "Wallack, Maxwell James", "last_name_ssi": "Wallack", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Maxwell", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Manish Kumar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Thesis Advisor", "Manish Kumar, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["MFC", "MREC", "MRC", "electrodialysis", "resin", "membrane", "nitrogen", "ammonia", "crossover"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Defect Growth Detection Potential Using Guided Waves", "id": "t435gc96m", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12924", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Modern society relies on vast networks of infrastructure such as bridges, pipelines, railroads, and electric generating stations to name a few.

Inspection is carried out via a range of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques depending on the application.  Ultrasonic guided wave testing is a popular NDE technique because of its versatility and ability to quickly inspect large structures and to detect hidden defects.  However, ultrasonic guided wave propagation is complex and requires an understanding of wave mechanics for effective inspection.  In this thesis, different guided wave modes and frequencies are tested for tracking simulated crack growth in a steel pipe, based on the hypothesis that the effectiveness of the mode and frequency combinations will differ based on the wave structure.  Along the way, many concepts relevant to NDE and ultrasonic guided waves such as maintenance philosophies, defect growth and fracture mechanics, guided wave excitation, dispersion principles, source influence, wave structure, noise, and variability in results are discussed.

The regulation defining a legal antlered deer for harvest remained unchanged from 1953 to 2002, when the Pennsylvania Game Commission re-defined the minimum antler size.  The new antler point restrictions (APRs) were a \u22653- or \u22654-points on one antler depending on the wildlife management unit (WMU).  New APRs were designed to protect 50 \u2013 75% of subadult antlered deer (\u22641.5 years of age), whereas remaining subadults and most adult males (\u22652.5 years of age) were legal for harvest.  The purpose of the APRs was to allow more subadults to advance into the adult age class, thus increasing the proportion of older males and antlered deer in the population.  Although APRs have been applied to management of other ungulate species to increase the male age structure and the proportion of antlered males to females, they have been controversial with some wildlife biologists and hunters.  Little research has been done to document the effects of APRs on deer survival, hunter harvest, and hunter support.   I designed a research study using radio-collared subadult and adult male white-tailed deer to measure harvest and survival rates when hunting occurs with APRs.  Simultaneously, I used pre- and post-hunting season surveys to evaluate hunter perception and support for APRs.   \nI established  study areas in Centre and Armstrong counties.  During 2002 \u2013 2005, I captured, radio-marked, and monitored 453 subadult and 103 adult males to estimate hunting and non-hunting season survival parameters and cause-specific mortality.  To assess hunter support and attitudes toward APRs, I conducted 7 deer hunter surveys.  The first 6 surveys were pre- and post-hunting season surveys for the 12-day firearms deer season during the 2002, 2003, and 2004 hunting seasons. The first survey was conducted before APRs began, and served as a baseline measure of hunter support for APRs.  I surveyed 2 different groups of hunters: a random sample, and a longitudinal panel consisting of hunters who filled out the first 6 surveys. If a panel member failed to return a survey, they were dropped from the panel, but were surveyed at the end of the study.  The final survey from panel members and the final survey to dropped panel members were used to determine directional support (increasing or decreasing) for APRs after 3 years.  I used harvest and survival rate data from radio-collared deer and mail survey data to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of APRs. \n\tI found no difference in survival rates between study areas and years of the study, but survival rates differed by age (adult, subadult) and month.  Monthly survival rates for subadults ranged between 0.64 (95% CI = 0.58 \u2013 0.69) and 0.99 (95% CI = 0.97 \u2013 1.0), with an annual survival rate of 0.46 (95% CI = 0.41 \u2013 0.52).  For adults, monthly survival rates varied between 0.36 (95% CI = 0.29 \u2013 0.45) and 1.00, with an annual survival rate of 0.28 (95% CI = 0.22 \u2013 0.35).  Harvest rate for subadults was 0.31 (95% CI = 0.23 \u2013 0.38), and for adults was 0.59 (95% CI = 0.40 \u2013 0.72).  After surviving their second hunting season, adult survival was 0.92 to the start of their third season.  Most out-of-season losses for subadults and adults were from vehicle accidents.  Other than legal harvest, sub-legal kills accounted for most mortalities during the hunting season.  The statewide legal harvest declined because of the reduction in subadult harvest, while the adult harvest increased despite declining deer populations in most WMUs.\n\tFrom the random sample surveys, I found hunter support for a statewide APR regulation varied between 0.61 (95% CI = 0.59 \u2013 0.64) and 0.70 (95% CI = 0.66 \u2013 0.73).  Between 0.60 (95% CI = 0.57 \u2013 0.62) and 0.67 (95% CI = 0.64 \u2013 0.71) of all hunters supported APR regulations in the unit they principally hunted for deer. There was little change in the proportion of hunters supporting APRs from before the regulations were implemented to 3 years afterward.  With regard to APRs as a statewide regulation, 0.23 were more supportive, 0.29 were less supportive, and 0.48 were unchanged in their level of agreement.  Similar results were found for support of APRs in the unit the respondent hunted for deer (0.23 more supportive, 0.30 less supportive, and 0.47 unchanged). \n\tAntler point restrictions were successful from a biological perspective.  During my study, APRs reduced harvest rates of subadults, and after surviving their first season with antlers, adult survival was 92% to the following hunting season.  In addition, harvests exhibited an increasing number of adult males, despite declining deer abundance during the study years.  Socially, a majority of hunters (62%) remained supportive (28% were unsupportive) with the use of APRs after 3 years of use. \n\tEmpirical data from my research indicated reduced subadult harvest rates, high survival rates outside of the hunting season, and an increased number of adults in the harvest.  Hunters should have observed more antlered deer during their hunting experience.  However, there was little change in directional support for APRs after 3 years.  I believe hunters had an initial impression of what the effects of APRs would be, and then ignored any additional information once APRs were implemented.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7108], "author_name_tesi": "Wallingford, Bret Daniel", "last_name_ssi": "Wallingford", "middle_name_ssi": "Daniel", "first_name_ssi": "Bret", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski", "Gary San Julian", "Harry Zinn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach, Dissertation Advisor", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski, Committee Member", "Gary San Julian, Committee Member", "Harry Zinn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["white-tailed deer", "antler point restrictions", "deer harvest rate", "deer survival rate"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "INTOXICATION, REJUVENATION, COMMUNITY: LITERARY EXPRESSIONISTS AND RADICAL WEIMAR CONSERVATIVES IN EARLY TWENTIETH-CENTURY GERMANY\n", "id": "10720", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4037", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation compares and contrasts postwar literary Expressionists and radical conservative writers of the Weimar Republic.  Both Expressionists and radical Weimar conservatives believed that the world engendered chaos, pain, fear, horror, fragmentation, and other emotions that could shock an individual into abstraction, or into a psychologically distant state from normal perceptions and the order of the world.  Related to abstraction and littered throughout Expressionist and Weimar right-wingers\u2019 works are the terms \u201cintoxication,\u201d \u201cTat,\u201d (\u2018activity/action\u201d) \u201cLeben\u201d (\u201clife\u201d), and \u201cAufbruch\u201d (\u201cbreak through/departure\u201d).  These terms entail people\u2019s uprooting from their submissive, everyday existences making them more active individuals who seek discharge for their actions.  To designate a person\u2019s acceptance of their new ideas, Expressionists and Weimar\u2019s ultraconservatives use the term Wandlung, or other words such as Verwandlung (\u201cmetamorphosis\u201d/\u201dchange\u201d), Erneuerung (\u201crejuvenation\u201d), Wiedergeburt (\u201crebirth\u201d), and the \u201cNew Human Being,\u201d which stand for everything that Expressionists and radical Weimar conservatives viewed as positive.  After the rebirth of the human being, an all-encompassing rebirth of humans will lead to the Gemeinschaft or \u201ccommunity.\u201d  Despite being both groups\u2019 teleologies, the birth of the \u201cNew Human Being\u201d and ultimately the \u201cGemeinschaft\u201d are methods to propagate their own very different ideologies.  In other words, they are structures or significations that are conceptualized through more important ideas or content.  Late Expressionism consisted for the most part of either leftist or apolitical pacifists who often fought in the German Revolution of 1918/1919, who pleaded for a loving and more humane world, and who preached a European or international fraternity of human beings.  Conversely, radical Weimar conservatives praised the First World War, reprobated the Revolution of 1918/1919, celebrated the German nation, and demanded that a dictatorship seize power in Germany.  Both Expressionists and radical Weimar conservatives used these signifiers with radically different content to disseminate their ideologies because they best appealed to the commonality of feelings, experiences, and sufferings of Germans during this time period.  Since the National Socialists used many of the same constructs as late Expressionists and radical conservatives of the Weimar Republic in promoting their fascist ideology, this dissertation helps explain the etiology of National Socialism among a disillusioned German populace.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4010], "author_name_tesi": "Wallo, Michael Chad", "last_name_ssi": "Wallo", "middle_name_ssi": "Chad", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Sophie C De Schaepdrijver", "Martina Kolb", "Thomas Oliver Beebee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Chair", "Sophie C De Schaepdrijver, Committee Member", "Martina Kolb, Committee Member", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["New Human Being", "Community", "World War I", "Weimar Republic", "Conservative Revolution", "Expressionism", "Ernst Junger", "Georg Kaiser"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A cyber-age approach for global management of barley yellow dwarf virus in winter wheat", "id": "23625", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10646", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Precision agriculture often uses computer-based decision-support systems (DSS\u2019s) to disseminate pest and disease information to growers to more efficiently manage agricultural productions. In this thesis, a DSS is developed to be accessed by growers for management of barley yellow dwarf disease caused by Barley yellow dwarf virus. The disease devastates grain growing regions around the world in epidemic patterns. It is a well-studied disease, but management can be greatly improved with determination of necessity and optimal timing of insecticide-treated seed, planting date, pest scouting, and foliar insecticide spray treatments, in chronological order. Using published literature and interviews with experts in BYDV epidemiology and agricultural decision-making, dependency networks were used to model field conditions that would logically warrant these management actions. The networks represented nine possible outputs: use insecticide-treated seed, use untreated seed, plant crop immediately, delay planting, scout for aphid vectors of BYDV, do not scout, full foliar insecticide spray, \u00bd (diluted) insecticide spray, and no insecticide spray. There were a total of 243 total combinations of conditions to reach the seed treatment recommendations, 9,720 to reach the planting date recommendations, 62,208 to reach the scouting recommendations, and 216 to reach the insecticide spray recommendations. In this work, I consider and strive to improve the mechanism for inferring output recommendations even when using only partial data sets.\nInference mechanisms are necessary components of DSS\u2019s to extrapolate outputs from input data to give users recommendations. The dependency networks represent inference mechanisms that require all input information be present before a management recommendation can be made. This thesis proposes a novel secondary inference mechanism structure to be overlaid onto the dependency networks that uses a numerical, rather than categorical or ordinal, calculation system to handle partial input information. This inference mechanism used the dependency networks as a template to make a prototype numerical representation of importance of field conditions in making management decisions. Secondly it calculates a likely success of these management decisions when executed, and penalizes the grower if he or she executes an incorrect management tactic. The success or penalties are measured in terms of optimum yield. It is also proposed that this secondary inference mechanism can allow a BYD management decision forecast based on pest and disease statuses, as well as real-time recommendations. \nThe purpose of the DSS developed in this thesis is to show the applicability of implementing DSS\u2019s based on expert knowledge into a platform (iPIPE) that is capable of gathering data from users in a two-way feedback loop. Since future management decisions rely on previous ones the feedback loop allows management practices conducted by the grower to alter future management recommendations given by the system. It also enhances large scale (regional) pest monitoring with input of individual field data. The DSS reported in this thesis will serve as a basis for the evolution of precision management of crop diseases. It will aid in reducing input cost and increasing sustainability and cereal grain yield in BYD management and eventually it will serve as model to better manage other crop pests and diseases.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10280], "author_name_tesi": "Walls, Joseph Thaddeus", "last_name_ssi": "Walls", "middle_name_ssi": "Thaddeus", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cristina Rosa", "John Frazier Tooker", "Edwin George Rajotte", "Joseph Russo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cristina Rosa, Thesis Advisor", "John Frazier Tooker, Thesis Advisor", "Edwin George Rajotte, Thesis Advisor", "Joseph Russo, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Barley yellow dwarf virus", "decision support systems", "winter wheat", "aphid", "iPIPE", "dependency network", "integrated pest management"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Northern Hemispheric Flood Fingerprints\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "9548", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3413", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Heavy rain events, which often lead to flooding, affect millions of people every year.

The two codes used for work on this thesis are TRACE and PARCS.

Patients living with heart failure report significant impacts to their perceived health-related quality of life. The majority of current evidence has been conducted with older individuals living with heart failure and limited data exists on health-related quality of life in younger individuals and the impact of heart failure on life course.\n\nMethods: Participants with heart failure between the ages of 35 and 55 were recruited from two hospital systems in this explanatory sequential mixed methods study. Each participant completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHFQ) and the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaires. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted based on questionnaire responses to explore the complex, subjective nature of what constitutes health-related quality of life and how it is affected by heart failure during critical transitions in the life course. Qualitative interviews continued until saturation was reached. Questionnaires were scored according to published guidelines and analyzed using linear regressions. Qualitative data were analyzed utilizing a thematic analysis approach. Inferences were drawn about how the qualitative results helped explain the quantitative results. \n\nResults: Participants with heart failure (n=18) yielded questionnaire results that were comparable to existing literature, revealing very poor health-related quality of life in this population. Statistical significance could not be determined between questionnaire results and demographics due to small sample size. Seven themes emerged: Role fulfillment, autonomy, financial impact, perception, retrospective life changes, symptom burden, and outlook. Participants frequently linked health-related quality of life to accomplishing life goals and to a sense of productivity and purpose. This was reflected in how participants perceived their roles as a parent, caregiver, spouse, employee, and friend have been affected by heart failure. Participants reported high levels of depression, anxiety, and fatigue throughout the interviews. The majority of participants also expressed regret for life choices that may have led to the progression of their heart failure.\n\nConclusions: Younger individuals living with heart failure have a markedly different perception of what constitutes health-related quality of life than their older counterparts. This is largely a result of how heart failure affects critical transitions that traditionally occur earlier in the life course such as establishing a career, meaningful relationships, family, and financial security. By using an explanatory sequential design, this study was able to contribute to existing literature on this population by adding rich qualitative data to help explain the consistently low health-related quality of life scores. The Lifespan Developmental Perspective also adds a unique viewpoint that addressed critical transitions that commonly occur earlier in the lifespan, and how an interruption in these transitions as a result of heart failure can negatively impact health-related quality of life. In order to provide holistic care to patients living with heart failure, nursing interventions to improve health-related quality of life should be considered in relation to the heavy burden of psychosocial symptoms and the alterations in role fulfillment experienced by the younger population.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14389], "author_name_tesi": "Walsh, Alison Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Walsh", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Alison", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa Ann Kitko", "Lisa Ann Kitko", "Judith E Hupcey", "Ying-Ling Jao", "Linda Ann Wray"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa Ann Kitko, Dissertation Advisor", "Lisa Ann Kitko, Committee Chair", "Judith E Hupcey, Committee Member", "Ying-Ling Jao, Committee Member", "Linda Ann Wray, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heart failure", "CHF", "HF", "Quality of Life", "Health-Related Quality of Life", "HRQoL", "QoL", "Lifespan", "Young adult", "Middle aged adult", "Mixed methods"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Eosinophil Functions in the Development of Allergic Asthma\n", "id": "9461", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1851", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Eosinophils have been implicated as playing a major role in allergic airway responses. However, the importance of these cells to the development of this disease has remained ambiguous despite many studies, partly due to lack of appropriate model systems.  Here, using transgenic murine models, we clearly delineate a role for eosinophils in asthma.  We report that there are strain specific differences in the generation of allergic asthma in eosinophil-deficient &#916;dblGATA mice, and that eosinophils are required for development of this disease on the C57Bl/6 background, but not the Balb/c background. This defect was due to reduced chemokine production in the lungs, defective T cell recruitment to lungs, and subsequent Th2 cytokine production.  We found that adding WT eosinophils or chemokines back to the lungs of these mice could restore all of these processes, suggesting that eosinophils provide a signal integral to the initiation of the allergic response.\n   The signal that eosinophils provide to induce the recruitment of T cells to the lung during an allergic response is unclear, but other studies and this research show that eosinophils contain preformed message for the cytokine IL-13.  Thus, we wanted to determine how eosinophil production of this cytokine contributes to allergic asthma.  We were able to rescue symptoms of allergic asthma, such as airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and Th2 cytokine production when we administered IL-13 back to the lungs of C57Bl/6 &#916;dblGATA mice.  We also found that eosinophils deficient in this cytokine were unable to rescue AHR, T cell recruitment to the lungs, and Th2 cytokine/chemokine production in &#916;dblGATA mice, even if Th2 cells were added back with IL-13-/- eosinophils.  However, eosinophil-derived IL-13 was not able to rescue an allergic asthma response in the absence of IL-13-competent T cells in IL-13-/-mice, although increased chemokine production and CD4+ T cell recruitment were found in the lungs of mice reconstituted with WT eosinophils. This suggested that although eosinophil production of IL-13 is required for T cell recruitment to the lungs, it is not sufficient for the perpetuation of an allergic asthma response. These data indicate that eosinophils and T cells have an interdependent relationship in the development of allergic asthma.\n   Targeting T cells and eosinophils simultaneously in allergic asthma is an immense challenge.  Using small molecule inhibitors against a common protein component in the T cell and eosinophil signaling cascade would be a good way to counteract the effects of these cells during the course of an allergic response.  ITK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed in eosinophils and T cells.  It is known that this kinase is important in the development of Th2 T cells and that T cells lacking ITK are unable to generate an allergic response.  We hypothesized that ITK would also be integral to the function of eosinophils in allergic asthma development.  We found that compared to &#916;dblGATA reconstituted with WT eosinophils, eosinophils lacking ITK were unable to induce AHR, T cell recruitment to the lung, and TH2 cytokine production when transferred to &#916;dblGATA mice and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA).  This may partially be due to reduced MAPK signaling in these cells downstream of the CCR3 receptor, as stimulation with Eotaxin-1 led to lower and delayed ERK1/2 activation in these cells.  These data suggest that developing drugs against ITK could be one potential therapy to combat allergic asthma.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1835], "author_name_tesi": "Walsh, Elizabeth Rose", "last_name_ssi": "Walsh", "middle_name_ssi": "Rose", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Avery August", "Avery August", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Pamela Hankey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Avery August, Dissertation Advisor", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["allergic", "asthma", "eosinophil", "T cell", "Th2"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Repetitive Dna Sequence Elements and Dna Polymerases Modeulate Instability in the Human Genome", "id": "20639", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9618", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\nRepetitive DNA sequences make up over 50% of the human genome and are located in both intra- and inter-genic regions. These sequences are prone to deletion and expansion errors during replication-, repair-, and recombination-associated DNA synthesis. Additionally, alternative DNA structures that form with repetitive DNA sequences can directly impede the replication machinery during DNA synthesis. Through these mechanisms, repetitive sequences contribute to genomic instability. This thesis focuses on two types of genomic instability that occur in the human genome: microsatellite instability, which occurs primarily as a result of length alterations due to DNA strand slippage and misalignment within microsatellite repeat sequences (tandem repeats composed of one to six base pair units); and chromosomal instability, which refers to gross chromosomal aberrations, including deletions, amplifications and translocations. In particular, the goals of this thesis are to: 1) investigate the mutational behaviors of microsatellite repeats, in order to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which microsatellite instability is driven in the human genome; and 2) investigate the types of repetitive sequence elements and replication proteins modulating chromosomal instability at regions of the human genome known as common fragile sites (CFS).\nBoth DNA sequence- and cellular repair-dependent mechanisms impact the mutability of microsatellites in the human genome. As a result, the mutational behaviors of specific microsatellites located within protein or functional RNA encoding genes can directly affect gene expression levels. Additionally, cellular deficiencies of specific repair pathways can lead to increased levels of microsatellite instability genome-wide. Previous studies investigated the roles of these two mechanisms in contributing to microsatellite instability. However, a limited number of studies focused on the distinct mutational behaviors of specific microsatellites. This area of study bears biological significance towards increasing our understanding of how instability at specific repetitive sequences impacts species evolution as well as tumorigenesis.\niv\nIn Chapter 2, I present data from my experimental studies and computational studies performed by Dr. Guru Ananda from the laboratory of Dr. Kataryna Makova (Penn State University, University Park) with whom the Eckert lab collaborates. Direct comparison of computationally derived human polymorphism incidence rates and experimentally determined polymerase slippage rates within tandem repeat sequences was carried out to determine the mechanisms contributing to the mutability of mononucleotide and dinucleotide microsatellites in the human genome. Experimentally determined polymerase error frequencies (Pol EF), representing polymerase insertion and deletion errors within tandem repeat tracts, were plotted as a function of repeat length alongside a curve representing log-scale polymorphism incidence versus repeat length for mono- and dinucleotide tandem repeats. Interestingly, these curves displayed significant overlap for mononucleotide tandem repeats, suggesting that mononucleotide tandem repeat mutability might be driven largely by polymerase slippage-based errors. In contrast, for dinucleotide tandem repeats, significant differences were observed for the dinucleotide tandem repeat polymorphism incidence and Pol EF curves, suggesting that cellular mechanisms other than polymerase slippage contribute to dinucleotide tandem repeat mutability. Furthermore, I present experimentally determined data demonstrating that polymerase slippage errors within tandem repeats depend on the identity of the DNA polymerase. Specifically, the Pol \u03b2 EF within [TA]n dinucleotide tandem repeats was higher than the Pol \u03b1-primase EF at all tandem repeat lengths. Additionally, the Pol \u03b2 EF at dinucleotide tandem repeats was dependent on the motif sequence. Together, our results demonstrate that specific tandem repeats exhibit distinct mutational behaviors in the human genome. These findings are significant for future computational and statistical analyses of microsatellite occurrence, distribution, and mutational properties in the genome, as well as their effective use as genetic markers.\nCFS are chromosomal loci prone to instability in the form of gaps and breaks. Instability at CFS is induced upon replication stress or loss of specific replication, repair, or cell cycle\nv\nproteins. CFS are also frequently deleted or translocated in cancer. A predominant model for CFS breakage involves perturbation of replication due to the presence of repetitive sequence elements. In Chapter 3, I test the hypothesis that enrichment of specific repetitive sequence elements at CFS regions contributes to fragility through replication perturbation by directly impeding the replicative DNA polymerases. To test this hypothesis, the efficiency of in vitro DNA synthesis by the four subunit, lagging strand DNA polymerase \u03b4 (Pol \u03b4) was quantified using templates corresponding to regions within FRA16D and FRA3B harboring specific repetitive elements, in the presence and absence of replication accessory proteins. Analysis of DNA synthesis progression by human Pol \u03b4 demonstrated significant synthesis perturbation both at [A]n and [TA]n repeats in a length-dependent manner, and at short (<40 base pairs) quasi-palindrome (inverted repeat) sequences. Using DNA trap experiments, I show that Pol \u03b4 pauses within CFS sequences are sites of enzyme dissociation, and dissociation occurs in the presence of RFC-loaded PCNA. Using a 3\u2019\uf0e05\u2019 exonuclease defective Pol \u03b4 mutant, I show that pausing is decreased relative to the wild type Pol \u03b4. This suggests that Pol \u03b4 pausing at predicted CFS hairpin structures might involve 3\u2019\uf0e05\u2019 exonuclease idling. I also investigated CFS repetitive sequence-dependent pausing for the leading strand replicative polymerase \u03b5 and found that CFS repetitive sequences also contribute to significant perturbation of DNA synthesis by this polymerase. These findings support a model wherein enrichment of repetitive sequence elements at CFS regions contributes to fragility by perturbing replication through multiple mechanisms, including replicative polymerase pausing and dissociation.\nAs components of chromosomal structure in all humans, CFS require the activity of numerous replication, repair and recombination pathways in order to maintain their stability in normal cells. Of importance to this thesis, depletion of DNA polymerase \uf068 (Pol \u03b7) was shown previously to lead to increased chromosomal breakage at FRA7H, a slight delay in S phase, and a decrease in the number of late S phase replication foci. Depletion of either Pol \u03b7 or polymerase \u03ba\nvi\n(Pol \uf06b) results in increased double stranded breaks upon ectopic integration of constructs containing non-B DNA elements, suggesting that these specialized Pols might function specifically in replication of repetitive sequences. It was further demonstrated in the Eckert lab that Pol \u03ba displays significantly less synthesis termination within mononucleotide [T]11 and dinucleotide [GT]10 microsatellites, compared to replicative polymerases. In Chapter 4, I test the hypothesis that Pols \u03ba and \u03b7 are important for maintaining efficient replication of CFS sequences through synthesis of repetitive DNA sequences. To test this hypothesis, DNA synthesis efficiency through CFS templates containing repetitive DNA sequence elements was determined for the specialized Pols \u03ba and \u03b7 using a primer extension assay, and compared to the replicative Pol \u03b4. Pol \u03b7 displayed significantly decreased levels of pausing, particularly at predicted hairpin structures, which correlated with greater rates of synthesis through CFS templates than Pol \u03b4. The specialized Pol \u03ba showed the least pausing at mononucleotide microsatellites, and this also corresponded with significantly greater synthesis rates than Pol \u03b4. Together, our findings of DNA synthesis dynamics within CFS sequences support a model whereby sequence elements with non-B potential impede the replicative Pol, and specialized Pol functions are required to prevent breakage. Perhaps, this occurs through recruitment of specialized Pols to sites of replicative Pol stalling at CFS repetitive sequences in cells. Comparison of synthesis fidelity by Pols \u03b4 and \u03b7 demonstrate that Pol \u03b7 can synthesize CFS repetitive elements with relative fidelity, but recruitment of Pol \u03b7 to CFS for efficient synthesis of repetitive sequences might occur at the expense of accuracy. Based on findings of altered expression of Pols \u03ba and \u03b7 in many cancer types, I propose that this could contribute to CFS breakage that often occurs during tumorigenesis.\nThe findings presented in Chapter 1 through 4 of my thesis contribute greatly to our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms by which different repetitive sequences modulate instability in the human genome. In Chapter 5 I present the development of an ex vivo replication\nvii\nassay in human cells, which will be of great value for future studies of repetitive DNA sequences. In this chapter, I also investigate the question: what is the minimal repetitive sequence element(s) sufficient to cause replication stalling in cells? My findings suggest that although single CFS repetitive sequence elements are sufficient to contribute to pausing by the replicative Pols \u03b4 and \u03b5 in vitro, cellular replication stalling might require clustering of additional repetitive elements. Alternative models exploring the mechanisms by which repetitive sequence elements contribute to CFS instability are developed in Chapters 5 and 6.\nThe work presented in this thesis advances our understanding of how repetitive sequences modulate genomic instability, in the context of both microsatellite instability and chromosomal instability. As discussed in Chapter 6, the question remains: are these two mechanisms of genomic instability interrelated, and how? The data presented here, along with the establishment of a cellular replication assay in human cells, will be of substantial importance to future investigations of this research field.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9381], "author_name_tesi": "Walsh, Erin ", "last_name_ssi": "Walsh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Erin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kristin Ann Eckert", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "Gregory Steven Yochum", "Lisa M Shantz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kristin Ann Eckert, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Member", "Gregory Steven Yochum, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Specialized DNA Polymerase", "Repetitive DNA Sequence", "Replication Stalling", "Microsatellite DNA", "Common Fragile Sites"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A PRELIMINARY ACOUSTIC INVESTIGATION OF A COAXIAL HELICOPTER IN HIGH-SPEED FLIGHT", "id": "c534fn92g", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12871", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The desire for a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft capable of high forward flight speeds is very strong.

This work utilizes a coupling between the Rotorcraft Comprehensive Analysis System (RCAS) and PSU-WOPWOP, to computationally explore the acoustics of a lift-offset coaxial rotor system. Specifically, unique characteristics of lift-offset coaxial rotor system noise are identified, and design features and trim settings specific to a compound lift-offset coaxial helicopter are considered for noise reduction. At some observer locations, there is constructive interference of the coaxial acoustic pressure pulses, such that the two signals add completely. The locations of these constructive interferences can be altered by modifying the upper-lower rotor blade phasing, providing an overall acoustic benefit. Significant noise reduction (and power reduction) is possible by reducing rotor tip speeds $-$ an option available because the coaxial rotor in a compound configuration does not need to provide all the propulsive force. Alternative blade designs and blade configurations also enable noise reduction at an in-plane, forward, target observer.

Scientists estimate that by 2050 one in three Americans will have type 2 DM (Boyle et al., 2010). Although type 2 DM related mortality has declined in recent years, it remains a major public health concern (Whiting et al., 2011). The exact etiology of type 2 DM is not known, but scientists have identified multiple genetic and environmental factors (e.g., obesity, diet, socioeconomic status, physical inactivity) that likely contribute to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disease (Codario, 2011).  In recent years, scientists have started to investigate the role of psychological factors, such as psychosocial stress, in the pathophysiology of type 2 DM (Nathan et al., 2009).  Data from observational studies provide suggestive evidence that psychosocial stress is a factor affecting type 2 DM onset and progression (e.g., Mommersteeg et al., 2012; Pouwer et al., 2010; Toshihiro et al., 2008). However, the stress physiological mechanisms involved in the relationship are unclear, and there is a paucity of research examining stress physiological processes in individuals with type 2 DM.\n     The primary aim of this dissertation was to determine if men with type 2 DM who do not have major disease-related complications have dysregulated stress systems by examining the effects of acute psychosocial stress exposure on HPA-axis and SAM-axis function. A secondary aim of this dissertation was to investigate if allostatic load, a measure of chronic stress exposure, influences stress physiological processes in men with type 2 DM. This dissertation study used a mixed between- and within subjects-design to examine the effects of type 2 DM and acute psychosocial stress (Trier Social Stress Test) on stress physiology in a sample of 34 men (20 healthy, 14 type 2 DM) between the ages of 25 and 65. Primary dependent measures included biomarkers of the HPA-axis (salivary cortisol, salivary DHEA-S) and SAM-axis (salivary alpha-amylase), as well as allostatic load parameters (cardiovascular, metabolic, neuroendocrine, anthropometric, immune measures). Results revealed that men with type 2 DM displayed significantly higher total allostatic load levels and significantly lower DHEA-S levels compared to healthy men. Furthermore, men with type 2 DM were able to mount both HPA- and SAM-axis responses to the acute stressor that was comparable to the healthy participants. Overall, the findings suggest that men with type 2 DM without major disease-related complications are able to physiologically respond to acute psychosocial stressors, in spite of having increased total allostatic load and decreased DHEA-S levels.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9359], "author_name_tesi": "Walter, Kimberly Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Walter", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Laura Klein", "Laura Klein", "David Manuel Almeida", "Elizabeth Susman", "Sheila Grace West"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Laura Klein, Dissertation Advisor", "Laura Klein, Committee Chair", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Member", "Elizabeth Susman, Committee Member", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Type 2 diabetes mellitus", "Acute psychosocial stress", "Stress physiology"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "An Investigation of Geometric Scaling of Mean and Turbulent Flows in Cylindrical Stirred Tank Reactors\n", "id": "8334", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2098", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Experiments have been performed in order to study the effects of geometrical scale in stirred tank reactors.

The work described in this dissertation is an extension of this molecular wire technology and involves designing a modified dicluster ferredoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum to tether PS I to catalytic enzymes containing surface exposed [4Fe-4S] clusters or Pt-NP. The presence of two externally facing cysteine residues should permit the dicluster ferredoxin to take the place of the molecular wire, allowing it to function in vivo.

After exploring the dominant tradition\u2019s discomfort with touch and disability, I show that disability is actually integral to the shaping of the able orator. Theories from disability studies regarding how the disabled body has been medicalized, rehabilitated, and normalized illuminate how rhetoric and rhetorical bodies have been similarly treated by Plato, Aristotle, Cicero and Quintilian.\nAs an alternative to this tradition, I redefine the sophistic concepts of logos, metis, and kairos as tactile rhetorics, arguing that these flexible practices can reshape rhetoric for a wide range of rhetors. I draw on Empedocles\u2019 theories of fleshy logos and integrate current writing by people with disabilities to redefine logos as multi logos. Similarly, I blend sophistic theories and disabled rhetorics to redefine metis as tactile intelligence (rather than cunning intelligence) and kairos as tactile timing (rather than simple timing). I construct a theory of \u201crhetoric reshaped\u201d which stretches contemporary rhetoric and composition studies to respond to the needs and contributions of disabled rhetors. Rhetoric reshaped transforms the traditional rhetorical appeals of ethos, pathos and logos and the traditional canons of invention, arrangement, style, delivery and memory, for a range of rhetorical situations. I coordinate between neo-sophistic studies, feminist rhetorics and disability studies to explore the possibilities disabled rhetors offer to contemporary rhetorical and composition studies.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5646], "author_name_tesi": "Walters, Shannon Kelly", "last_name_ssi": "Walters", "middle_name_ssi": "Kelly", "first_name_ssi": "Shannon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Merrill Squier", "John L Selzer", "Stuart Selber", "Michael Francis Berube", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Merrill Squier, Committee Chair", "John L Selzer, Committee Member", "Stuart Selber, Committee Member", "Michael Francis Berube, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Disability Studies", "Rhetoric"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "The Chloroplast as Mediator of Phenolic Induction", "id": "6039", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "36", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-12-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The degree to which insect herbivores and plant pathogens elicit accumulation of phenolic defenses in plants is variable in nature.  Because light and leaf development, factors which can alter resource levels in chloroplasts, influence enemy responses to plants, I was interested in the degree to which chloroplast carbon resources constrain phenolic induction responses.  To address the central role of the chloroplast in supplying carbon resources for induced phenolic accumulation, I devised the Chloroplast Control Hypothesis: constraints on phenolic induction occur when stromal substrates are limited.  Levels of carbon resources were manipulated by shading plants and monitoring phenolic accumulation responses to Jasmonic acid (JA), a wound signal that elicits phenolic metabolism in plant leaves much as does wounding or herbivory.  Phenolic accumulation was prevented in darkened tobacco plants, and low light constrained phenolic accumulation, but photosynthetic carbon assimilation was a poor predictor of resource investment in phenolic defenses.  While young leaves which are carbon resource sinks were more responsive to JA, metabolite import was not enhanced in these leaves.  In fact, activity of the chloroplast phosphoenolpyruvate/ phosphate transporter was not required for Arabidopsis plants to mount strong shikimate-based defense responses that deterred an insect herbivore.  These results suggest that chloroplasts must possess alternate means of acquiring substrates for induced phenolic synthesis, possibly via starch breakdown.  I was unable to disprove the chloroplast control hypothesis, as mechanisms of resource allocation to induced phenolics are much more complex than I originally envisioned.  Chloroplasts may possess at least three avenues to acquire carbon resources for the shikimate pathway, allowing plants to compensate for deficiencies in one route when others are limiting.  Such redundancy in resource supply may not be surprising since products of this pathway play central roles in plant physiology.

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that regulate luteal function may facilitate the development of new strategies to improve reproductive efficiency in dairy cows. Luteal function is regulated by immune cell mediators, but what is not clearly understood is 1) how the recruitment of immune cells into the CL is regulated and 2) how luteal cells communicate with and affect the function of particular subsets of T lymphocytes. To understand how the process immune cell recruitment into the CL is regulated, a protocol was developed to isolate endothelial cells from the CL. Endothelial cells were enriched from dissociated luteal cells by sequential filtration through microsieves of 50, 15 and 10 \u00b5m. About 90% of the enriched endothelial cells bound BS-1 lectin and the majority were immunoreactive for von Willebrand factor VIII. To determine if endothelial cells activated autologous T lymphocytes, endothelial cells were cocultured with autologous T lymphocytes. Endothelial cells activated autologous T lymphocytes by inducing proliferation and increasing the proportion of IL2R\u03b1+ T lymphocytes compared to T lymphocytes cultured alone. To determine if prostaglandins (PGs) modulate the recruitment of T lymphocytes into the CL, endothelial cells were treated with progesterone (0, 5, 1, 5, 10 and 20 \u00b5M), PGE2 (0.002, 0.02 or 0.2 \u00b5M) and PGF2\u03b1 (0.002, 0.02 or 0.2 \u00b5M) and exposed to either PBS or TNF\u03b1 (50 ng/mL) and IL1\u03b2 (50 ng/mL). Calcein-AM labeled T lymphocytes were then incubated with endothelial cells and the number of adhered T lymphocytes was determined by fluorescence. T lymphocyte adhesion to endothelial cells was affected by the concentration of progesterone (cubic response; P<0.05) in both cytokine treated and untreated endothelial cells. Increasing the concentration of PGE2 and PGF2\u03b1 from 0 to 100 ng/mL linearly increased and decreased, respectively, the binding of T lymphocytes on endothelial cells and there was a significant interaction of the prostaglandin treatment and cytokine treatment (P<0.05). To determine the effect of luteal prostaglandins on bovine T lymphocytes, the expression of receptors for PGF2\u03b1 (PTGFR), PGE2 (PTGER2 and 4), and PGI2 (PTGIR) in bovine T lymphocytes was examined. T lymphocytes expressed transcripts for PTGIR, PTGER2 and 4, but not PTGFR. Luteal cells treated with either prostaglandin H2 synthase inhibitor (indomethacin) or phospholipaseA2 inhibitor (PLA2X) to inhibit endogenous prostaglandins were cocultured with T lymphocytes. Inhibiting endogenous prostaglandins had no effect on luteal cell-induced T lymphocyte proliferation (P>0.05). In addition to the effects of prostaglandins on T lymphocytes, acute (Ca2+ influx and Zap70 phosphorylation) and chronic (cytokine gene expression, interleukin 2 receptor \u03b1 expression and cell cycle distribution) effects of progesterone on T lymphocytes were examined. Progesterone increased Ca2+ influx, interleukin 2 (IL2) gene expression, but decreased the activity of Zap70 and the proportion of T lymphocytes in the S-phase of the cell cycle in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Progesterone had no effect on IL2 receptor \u03b1 protein (P>0.05). Inhibition of the synthesis of steroids including progesterone in luteal cells using P450 side chain cleavage enzyme inhibitor, aminoglutethimide (AG) decreased the proportion of \u03b3\u03b4+IL10+ T lymphocytes (P<0.05). To determine if the microenvironment within the CL modulates the function of resident T lymphocytes, luteal cells from either functional or regressing CL were cultured with \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocytes. The proportion and type of \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocyte induced to proliferate, and the cytokines produced were assessed by flow cytometry. Luteal cells of midcycle significantly induced proliferation of the \u03b3\u03b4+ WC1- subset (P<0.05) while luteal cells of regressing CL induced proliferation of the \u03b3\u03b4+ WC1+ subset (P<0.05). In addition, midcycle luteal cells increased \u03b3\u03b4+IL10+ and \u03b3\u03b4+GATA-3+ and reduced \u03b3\u03b4+IFN\u03b3+ T lymphocytes (P<0.05), but had no effect on the proportion of IL4+, TNF\u03b1+ and T-bet+ \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocytes. Coculture of \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocytes with luteal cells from regressing CL had no effect on the proportion of \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocytes expressing each cytokine. To test the hypothesis that midcycle luteal cells induce hyporesponsiveness in \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocytes, \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocytes were cultured alone or with midcycle luteal cells. \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocytes were harvested and restimulated with concanavalin A (ConA). Exposure of \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocytes to luteal cells did not alter the mitogenic response of \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocytes to ConA. To determine the mechanism by which luteal cells stimulate \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocytes, the expression of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166) which is a ligand for CD6 that is mainly expressed on \u03b3\u03b4+WC1- T lymphocytes was examined in luteal tissue and its effect on the proliferation of \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocytes was examined. The steady-state concentration of ALCAM mRNA was inversely proportional to the expression of ALCAM protein across the luteal phase. ALCAM was expressed by steroidogenic cells and noncapillary endothelial cells, and its expression on luteal cells was increased by LH, IFN\u03b3 and PMA (P<0.05), but not PGF2\u03b1. Inhibition of CD6-ALCAM interactions by anti-CD6 antibodies tended (P=0.06) to reduce luteal cell-induced \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocyte proliferation, but siRNA-mediated suppression of ALCAM did not decrease luteal cell-induced \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocyte proliferation (P>0.05). In conclusion, PGE2, PGF2\u03b1 and progesterone potentially modulate T lymphocyte recruitment into the CL. Within the CL, the function of T lymphocytes is modulated by the microenvironment. The high concentration of progesterone within the functional CL may potentially suppress the function of resident T lymphocytes. In addition, luteal cells in a functional CL selectively decrease the synthesis IFN\u03b3 in \u03b3\u03b4+ T lymphocytes and induce the expansion of \u03b3\u03b4+WC1-, but upon the induction of luteal regression, luteal cells induce the expansion of \u03b3\u03b4+WC1+ T lymphocytes, which are associated with inflammation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8095], "author_name_tesi": "Walusimbi, Sadhat Sulaiman", "last_name_ssi": "Walusimbi", "middle_name_ssi": "Sulaiman", "first_name_ssi": "Sadhat", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joy Lee Pate", "Joy Lee Pate", "Daniel R Hagen", "Troy Ott", "Alan Leslie Johnson", "Na Xiong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joy Lee Pate, Dissertation Advisor", "Joy Lee Pate, Committee Chair", "Daniel R Hagen, Committee Member", "Troy Ott, Committee Member", "Alan Leslie Johnson, Committee Member", "Na Xiong, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bovine", "Corpus luteum", "T lymphocytes", "Gamma-delta T lymphocytes", "ALCAM/CD166", "progesterone", "Zap70", "prostaglandins"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "OPTICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF BOWTIE AND HETERODIMER ANTENNAS: OPTIMIZING DEVICE PROPERTIES FOR SENSING OR PHOTOHARVESTING APPLICATIONS", "id": "ws859f64s", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13136", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study investigates the optical characteristics of bowtie and heterodimer antennas designed to operate in the visible to near-infrared spectrum. Two main applications are in mind: a bowtie antenna (BT) device that utilizes field emission or quantum tunneling under an external bias to detect specific frequencies (an optical sensor) and a geometrically-asymmetric heterodimer (HD) that might be used as an optical rectifying device for solar-energy harvesting. We have three main objectives. First, although single devices and arrays of identical devices have been investigated by others, we seek to confirm the optical response of both isolated and strongly-coupled arrays of devices. Second, because the heterodimer device (i.e. the geometric rectifier) has not been extensively studied, we seek further insight into this coupling, since it is an important geometry for solar harvesting via a geometric diode. Third, we investigate how modifying plasmonic devices with Cu atomic layer deposition (ALD) changes the optical response of the devices.\nNanoantennas are fabricated on silica employing electron-beam lithography, with gold or palladium as the nanoantenna material. Device arrays are characterized via optical extinction spectroscopy, performed in a confocal microscopy arrangement, and using a broadband light source. Some of the palladium devices then undergo Cu-ALD in order to reduce the gap between the dimer electrodes. We present three experimental studies. The first investigates the effects of varying the device length and the gap between electrodes for relatively isolated nanoantenna; this establishes intra-device interaction properties. The second investigates inter-device interactions. The edge-to-edge distance is varied in the vertical and horizontal directions individually and then both simultaneously. The third demonstrates the effects of adding Cu-ALD on palladium devices. We compare many of our experimental measurements to the results of finite-difference time-domain simulations.
