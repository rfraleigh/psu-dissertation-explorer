This study explores their effectiveness in reducing propagations of tonal noise by means of acoustic wave cancellation.  Resonators are a non-intrusive method of generating a secondary sound field near the plane of a rotor.  As they can be strategically tuned to reduce radiated noise at the blade passage frequency (BPF) and its harmonics, resonators can be useful for a variety of applications to quiet existing and future turbomachinery.  \nExperiments have demonstrated that a single quarter wave resonator is effective in reducing unidirectional plane wave propagations for long wavelength ducted applications while an array is effective for shorter wavelength or un-ducted facilities where shrouded fans are used.  Testing conducted at Center for Acoustics and Vibrations (CAV) at the Pennsylvania State University the Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR) in Berlin, Germany demonstrated that resonator arrays were effective in attenuating shorter wavelength plane-wave and higher order modal propagations of blade tone noise.  A chiller fan enclosure, constructed in the CAV laboratory emulated an industrial chiller in its operation.  Using this facility, resonators were observed to attenuate blade tone noise from a non-ideal ducted geometry. \nThe approaches used in this study evolved from Helmholtz resonators to conventional quarter wave tubes, to mouth tunable resonators, and finally to back-wall tunable resonators.  These developments in tuning allowed for independent control of a resonator\u2019s magnitude and phase of the secondary sound field produced by the resonators.  It was demonstrated that the use of two tunable resonator chambers oriented axially on either side of the blade region enables a dipole-like secondary sound field to be passively generated and bi-directional attenuations of plane wave noise to be achieved. Tonal attenuations of 28 dB were attained and BPF tones were reduced to less than 5 dB from the broadband noise floor for each case discussed above.\nIn parallel with experimental work, analytical models were developed to effectively model and predict optimal resonator configurations for a given fan in operation.  Interactions between resonators and the driving pressure field from the rotor blades are modeled using transmission line (TL) theory.  Blade tone acoustic pressure is obtained using a finite element method (FEM) propagation code.  By combining of these two methods, a resonator configuration that achieves optimal attenuation can be numerically obtained.  \nThe use of resonators has been shown to significantly attenuate fan noise in the conditions explored in the considered experiments.  Numerical modeling has shown consistency in the response of flow driven resonators and their.  These results indicate a strong potential for active control of fan noise using resonators and an approach to applying this control is presented. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3747], "author_name_tesi": "Gorny, Lee James", "last_name_ssi": "Gorny", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Lee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Koopmann", "Gary Hugo Koopmann", "Dean Capone", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin", "Martin Wesley Trethewey", "John Brian Fahnline"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Koopmann, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary Hugo Koopmann, Committee Chair", "Dean Capone, Committee Chair", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Committee Member", "Martin Wesley Trethewey, Committee Member", "John Brian Fahnline, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rotor Stator", "Dipole Source", "Flow Driven Source", "Axial", "Resonators", "Fan Noise", "Interaction Noise"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "OPTIMIZATION OF THE DESIGN OF TRANSVERSE HYDRAULIC FRACTURES IN HORIZONTAL WELLS PLACED IN DUAL POROSITY TIGHT GAS RESERVOIRS\n\n\n", "id": "10833", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5570", "abstract_tesi": "The exploitation of the gas from tight gas reservoirs has been increasing due to the advances in unconventional gas technologies and depletion of conventional gas resources.  Drilling horizontal wells and using hydraulic fractures are needed to produce economically viable amounts from tight sands.  In this research, optimization of a hydraulically fractured horizontal well placed in naturally fractured tight gas sand reservoir systems was studied. A commercial reservoir simulator coupled with artificial neural network (ANN) in order to create an expert system that can be used to design an efficient stimulation strategy. Reservoir simulation was used in order to generate production profiles of the reservoir system which was, then, used to train the artificial neural network system. The ANN developed in the project consists of two parts: forward and inverse processes. In the forward process, an input data set which includes well and completion design parameters and reservoir properties are used to create an ANN toolbox in order to predict the production profile. In the inverse process, several design parameters and the desired production profiles were introduced as the input data in order to create an ANN toolbox to estimate the optimum design parameters. It is found that in both expert systems, functional links play a significant role in the success of the ANN tool. The results estimated by this developed toolbox can be used as preliminary information about the production profiles or the required wellbore and fracture design parameters for different cases. \n\nThis study showed that natural fracture permeability is the principal factor that determines the magnitude of the production. For this reason, the ANN toolbox is sensitive to a larger range of natural fracture permeability. In addition, conductivity of the natural fractures and the hydraulic fractures are important factors affecting production.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5561], "author_name_tesi": "Gorucu, Seyhan  Emre", "last_name_ssi": "Gorucu", "middle_name_ssi": "Emre", "first_name_ssi": "Seyhan ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Horizontal Wells", "Tight Gas", "Dual Porosity", "ANN", "Transverse Fractures"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Reduced Phase Equilibrium Calculations: New Reduced Parameters, Critical Analysis And Fluid Characterization  ", "id": "19974", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9583", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Phase equilibrium calculations constitute a significant percentage of computational time in compositional simulation, especially as the number of components and phases increases.  Reduced methods address this problem by carrying out phase equilibrium calculations using a reduced number of independent parameters.  Some researchers have found that reduced methods speed up flash calculations, decrease simulation times, and also improve robustness.\nWe propose new reduced parameters using the two-parameter binary interaction parameter (BIP) formula originally proposed by Li and Johns (2006).  We implement the new reduced parameters to two- and three-phase equilibrium calculations. We compare the new reduced two-phase flash calculations with several reduced and conventional techniques in terms of robustness and speed. The new reduced two-phase flash calculations show improved robustness with similar speed as the fastest reduced flash calculations. The new algorithm is also shown to be significantly faster than the conventional methods. We further critically analyze several proposed reduced algorithms and explain why some of the reduced techniques are slower than others.\nWe further compare our new reduced multiphase equilibrium calculations with the reduced multiphase equilibrium calculations of Okuno et al. (2010a). Our results show that the improved robustness in our two-phase flash calculations becomes more significant in the three-phase region indicating a larger radius of convergence. We have also observed that our three-phase flash calculations converge to the correct solution more often than the other reduced technique.\nReduced methods may improve accuracy when many components and phases are used in phase equilibrium calculations. Reduced methods, however, may not be able to fit the exact BIPs determined from conventional cubic EOS characterizations. Therefore, one of the remaining questions is accuracy. We carry out fluid characterization steps in a suitable manner for reduced phase equilibrium calculations. We show that for the fluids studied, reduced parameters estimate the experimental data well without compromising speed during phase behavior calculations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9350], "author_name_tesi": "Gorucu, Seyhan  Emre", "last_name_ssi": "Gorucu", "middle_name_ssi": "Emre", "first_name_ssi": "Seyhan ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns", "Russell Taylor Johns", "Turgay Ertekin", "Yilin Wang", "Christopher Griffin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns, Dissertation Advisor", "Russell Taylor Johns, Committee Chair", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Yilin Wang, Committee Member", "Christopher Griffin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["flash calculations", "phase behavior", "stability analysis", "phase equilibrium calculations", "solution of nonlinear equations", "Newton's method", "Newton-Raphson", "Minimization", "fluid characterization"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PIEZOELECTRIC PUMP USING CYMBAL TRANSDUCER", "id": "10737", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5442", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis treats an innovative piezoelectric pump based on one of the piezoelectric actuators, the \u2018cymbal\u2019.

The cymbal actuator has previously been shown to have larger displacement and generative force than the bimorph actuators.

In addition, ease of fabrication makes this device an attractive candidate for large scale production/industrial use. Taking inspiration from current and past trends, the aim was to balance the trade-off between efficient performance and device size. Therefore, a key feature of this pump is performance with respect to size (volume less than 1.5cm3).

The code was then validated using numerous of experimental databases, including the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) / Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (NEA-OECD) Boiling Water Reactor Full Bundle Tests (BFBT) Benchmark. The BFBT benchmark contains a large amount of test cases representative of BWRs steady-state and off-nominal operating conditions, which makes it one of the most widely used benchmark for validating BWR modeling tools. Two of the main experimental tests involve critical power tests and void distribution tests. Specific experimental cases were chosen and simulated using CTF. Statistical studies were carried out on the void distribution cases to evaluate the code modeling uncertainties.\n         This thesis also focuses on application of CTF to mini- and whole-core BWR calculations on a pin-cell resolved level; as well as on demonstrating that CTF can properly model bypass flow in BWR cores.

These ideas must be quickly evaluated and filtered in order to select a few candidate concepts to move forward in the design process. While creativity is often stressed in the conceptual phases of design, it receives little attention in these later phases \u2013 particularly during concept selection. This is largely because there are no methods for quickly rating or identifying worthwhile creative concepts during this process. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to develop and test a novel method for evaluating the creativity and feasibility of design concepts. The first phase of this research involved the creation of a creativity evaluation methodology that utilizes word selections and semantic similarity to quickly and effectively evaluate candidate concepts. To test its utility during concept selection, an empirical study with ten engineering designers was completed. The results revealed that our methodology and rating system could be used as a proxy for measuring design creativity regardless of the openness of the design task. The second phase of this thesis sought to investigate the impact of decision-making bias during concept selection and to refine our design creativity evaluation methodology. In order to accomplish this, an online questionnaire was developed and administered to 11 expert and 11 novice design engineers. The results from this study supported the use of our creativity evaluation methodology with both expert and novice raters for early design creativity. It also contributes to our understanding of experience bias in creativity evaluation and provided a framework for computational design creativity systems. The final phase of this thesis sought to explore the use of the creativity assessment methodologies within a classroom setting and to compare the results from team evaluations and individual team member evaluations. During this phase, our creativity evaluation methodology was developed into a printable toolkit to help students evaluate designs for an in-class project. In this study, 32 students in teams of four utilized the toolkit to analyze design sketches from their team members. The results from this study showed significant relationships between individual and team perception based evaluations that utilized sliding scales and group discussion and our adjective selection method. However, the widely adopted creativity evaluation method from academia that compared designs feature by feature appeared to be measuring something else entirely. The results from this thesis are used to develop recommendations for the use of creative concept selection tools in engineering design. In addition, the results are extrapolated to create recommendations for an online web application geared enhancing the usability and accessibility of concept selection tools for both academic and industrial implementation.

First, I test whether the extratropical response to convective anomalies associated with Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) phases 1 and 5 over the North Pacific and North America is sensitive to the initial extratropical flow. It is found that a characteristic flow consisting of low geopotential height anomalies over northeastern China, and high geopotential height anomalies to the north and south, is associated with an amplified extratropical response for both MJO phases. Next, I test whether transient eddy interference with the Northern Hemisphere climatological stationary wave is associated with anomalous tropical convection and Arctic surface air temperature (SAT). Prior to constructive transient eddy interference, it is found that convection over the warm pool region is enhanced. During and after the constructive interference, the Arctic SAT shows anomalous warmth. Warm pool convection and Arctic SAT anomalies are of opposite sign when transient eddies show destructive interference with the climatological stationary wave.\n\nA comparison of the extratropical response over the North Pacific and North America to MJO versus El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) convective heating is subsequently performed. For MJO phase 1 versus El Ni\u00f1o, although the equatorial precipitation has a similar spatial structure, the extratropical response shows opposite-signed anomalies in key regions, such as over northwestern North America. The same is true when we compare MJO phase 5 and La Ni\u00f1a. It is found that the sign of the response over the North Pacific and North America is associated mostly with the sign of the dominant convective anomaly over the western and central equatorial Pacific. For El Ni\u00f1o and MJO phase 5, this corresponds to anomalously strong convection. For La Ni\u00f1a and MJO phase 1, this corresponds to anomalously weak convection. When neither precipitation anomaly is dominant, the extratropical response over the North Pacific and North America is weak.

I sought to understand their pedagogic values through observation, interviews, and examination of repertoire lists.  The participants\u2019 pedagogic values emerged as values of ends and of students.  Directors identified undergraduate music education experiences, reflection, and teaching experiences as sources of their values.\nThe purpose of my second investigation was to ascertain the values and sources of pedagogic values held by band directors and how contextual factors influence stasis or change in values.  I used a descriptive survey design for this inquiry.  Participants were band directors from six states representing the six National Association for Music Education regional divisions.  Results indicated that values could be described as three constructs - traditional practices, non-traditional practices, and performance.  In addition contextual factors had no influence on pedagogic values.  Directors cited personal reflection and goals they set for themselves as sources of their values.\nFinally, through the third investigation, I examined professional and social aspects of a band director\u2019s life to understand his self-cultivation, a process through which one experiences personal growth through professional and social experiences.  Through case study methodology, I observed and interviewed my participant, Michael, in order to understand the role self-cultivation plays in his practice.

They are notorious due to a low infectious dose of 10-100 CFU. Upon ingestion, the symptoms progress from watery diarrhea, to bloody diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps. In some cases, the infected patients develop hemorrhagic colitis (HC) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). There is great genotypic diversity within E. coli O157:H7. Clade classification based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified a hyper-virulent subset, designated clade 8. Compared to other clades, strains clustered within clade 8 show increased hospitalization rate and higher incidence of HUS. \nAmong the virulence factors associated with E. coli O157:H7, expression of Shiga toxins (Stx) is an important determinant of pathogenicity. The stx genes are encoded within lamboid prophages which, when induced by DNA damaging agents, lyse the bacterial host as they switch from lysogenic to lytic life cycle. Examples of DNA damaging agents include antibiotics that function by targeting DNA replication, UV light, hydrogen peroxide, neutrophils and DNase colicins. In addition to induction by DNA damaging agents, non-pathogenic bacteria can also enhance Stx2 expression. Previous work on interactions between E. coli O157:H7 and non-pathogenic E. coli strain C600 demonstrated that Stx2 expression increased from basal levels when the two were co-cultured. The phage spontaneously induced from E. coli O157:H7 infects susceptible E. coli strains, resulting in increased phage and Stx accumulation. Apart from phage-mediated lysis, the non-pathogenic strains can also enhance Stx2 production by secretion of factors, such as DNase colicins. \n \n\tOur lab investigated the diversity of Stx2-converting phage genomes by sequencing 22 inducible phage from different E. coli O157:H7. This lead to the identification of 9 phage sequence types (PSTs), which grouped into 3 clusters. A notable cluster, termed PST2, grouped phage from two clade 8 E. coli O157:H7 strains, PA2 and PA8, with phage from prominent non-O157 outbreak strains, such as E. coli O104:H4, E. coli O103:H25 and E. coli O103:H2. \nThe Stx2-converting phage genome of PA2, when compared to prototypical strains Sakai and EDL933, showed differences in the early regulatory and replication region. To test the phenotypic manifestations of the genetic variations seen between Stx2-converting phage, we studied the kinetics of phage and Stx2 production upon induction with DNA damaging agents, as well as when co-cultured with E. coli C600. When induced with an antibiotic ciprofloxacin, PA2 produced the lowest amount of phage and Stx2, as compared to EDL933 and Sakai. However, when co-cultured with non-pathogenic C600, PA2 showed 20-fold higher Stx2 than when present alone. The Stx2 quantified from PA2 co-cultured with C600 was also significantly higher than C600 coincubated with Sakai and EDL933. Similarly, the other clade 8 strain, PA8 that also clustered within PST2 showed increased Stx2 expression with C600. Twelve non-pathogenic E. coli strains were co-cultured with O157:H7 to test Stx2 amplification. Four of the 12 strains showed increased Stx2 accumulation when co-cultured with the three E. coli O157:H7 strains. One of the 4 commensals expressed factors that enhanced Stx2 expression. Four categories of non-pathogenic E. coli strains; three of which amplified Stx2, while the fourth did not, were recognized. The Stx2 levels recorded when co-culturing the three O157:H7 with 12 commensals showed that PA2 corresponded with higher cumulative fold amplification, compared to EDL933 and Sakai. \n \nOur results show strain specific variations in the fold amplification of Stx2 when susceptible E. coli are co-cultured with three E. coli O157:H7 strains. It is notable that PA2, showing highest fold amplification in co-culture, is a low producer of phage and Stx2 when present alone. This phenotype is also seen with PA8, another strain from the PST2 cluster.  Additionally, we identified 4 categories of commensals that alter Stx2 levels by different mechanisms, which suggest that the host microbiota may alter the course of an E. coli O157:H7 infection. These findings may explain why some E. coli O157:H7 are more pathogenic.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10261], "author_name_tesi": "Goswami, Kakolie ", "last_name_ssi": "Goswami", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kakolie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward G Dudley", "Stephen John Knabel", "Catherine Nettles Cutter", "Chitrita Debroy", "Michael Mugo Mwangi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward G Dudley, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen John Knabel, Committee Member", "Catherine Nettles Cutter, Committee Member", "Chitrita Debroy, Committee Member", "Michael Mugo Mwangi, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["E.coli O157:H7", "foodborne pathogen", "Shiga toxin", "commensal"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "COCTEAU BETWEEN THE TWO WORLD WARS: THE POTOMAK, THE EUGENES OF WAR, AND THE END OF THE POTOMAK\n", "id": "8211", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1264", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the most prolific, admired, but also contested figures of the twentieth century, author, filmmaker, and painter Jean Cocteau, left a significant body of highly plurisemic works, some of which he claimed to have made deliberately obscure. To fully grasp the complexity of Cocteau's contributions to the arts as well as the ways he positioned himself within his time (not only aesthetically but also politically), one must penetrate that obscurity with the aid of the rare clues the artist himself provided and a keen awareness of cultural, artistic, and historical context. The three works that form the core of my dissertation are among the least known and most enigmatic in Cocteau\u2019s multi-faceted oeuvre: Le Potomak (1913-1914); its first sequel, the album Les Eug\u00e8nes de la guerre (1915); and La Fin du Potomak (1939). Spanning one of the most turbulent periods in French and European history, one that also revolutionized the arts, the Potomak triad constitutes an invaluable key to both the epoch and Cocteau\u2019s originality.\nA tantalizing clue to the Potomak cycle is found in Cocteau\u2019s 1922 essay, \u201cLe Secret Professionnel\u201d: \u201cI masked the tragedy of the Potomak under a thousand farces.\u201d This enigma prompts a series of questions: What is this tragedy covered by laughter? To what \u201cprofessional secret\u201d is due the aesthetic appeal of the Potomak cycle? What does Cocteau\u2019s hermetic vision convey about the nature of war and society in the first half of the twentieth century? What can we learn from the Potomak cycle regarding the dynamic tensions involving modernism, the avant-gardes, text-image relationships, and the many faces of modernity (socio-political, economic, and technological) at a time when mass culture begins to irrigate learned culture?\nThese are the questions to which my dissertation proposes detailed answers.

Their impact on the genomes of different species varies greatly, yet they made an important contribution to eukaryotic genomes, including on those of vertebrate and mammalian species. Almost half of the human genome itself originated from various TEs, few of them still being active. Often times, TEs can disrupt the function of certain genes and generate disease phenotypes, but over long evolutionary times they can also offer evolutionary advantages to their host genome. For example, they can serve as recombination hotspots, they can influence gene regulation, or they can even contribute to the sequence of protein coding genes. Here I made use of multiple computational tools to investigate in more detail a few of these aspects. Starting with a set of well characterized proteins to complement inferences made at the level of transcripts, I investigated the contribution of TEs to protein coding sequences. I show that old TEs can indeed be found in functional proteins, albeit to a lesser extent than previously thought. I also investigated the protein coding potential of Alu elements, which are found in the alternatively spliced forms of many genes. No strong evidence could be found to support this hypothesis, but novel ways in which Alu elements can contribute to the human proteome are proposed. Complementing their protein coding potential, TEs were also shown to have a big potential to influence cis regulation of genes due to the composition of their sequence. This appears to be one important factor that determines their fate after insertion at new loci. A database, called the ScrapYard database (SYDB), was ultimately created to provide an efficient tool in addressing various questions related to the presence of TE sequences in vertebrate transcripts. At the present time, when genomic and genetic data are generated at increased rates, important advancements in biological knowledge can only be made with the help of computational tools.

The models are patched together combined using a new patching methodology designed to take advantage of the one-way motion of vapor from the CFD region to the DSMC region.

This novel technique allows a hybrid method to be applied to rapidly rarefying PVD flow fields in a stable manner.\n\nParameter studies are performed on a CFD, Navier-Stokes continuum based compressible solver, a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) rarefied particle solver, a collisionless free molecular solver and the hybrid CFD-DSMC solver.

The failure mode of VRLA batteries under HRPSOC cycling is accumulative sulfation in the negative electrodes. New HEV batteries, such as PbC batteries and UltraBatteries, based on the technologies combining conventional lead acid batteries and super capacitors have emerged in the last decade. PbC batteries replace the negative lead plate with an activated carbon (AC) plate, completely removing the sulfation in the negative electrode. UltraBatteries use a hybrid negative plate consisting of lead and AC materials and relieve the high-rate loads on the lead-acid cells and extend their lifetime. However, since the AC electrode material in PbC batteries and UltraBatteries lowers the battery energy density and increases gassing rate during charge, a model is useful to quickly optimize battery design and analyze gassing phenomena with different AC materials before physical prototypes. Further, the interactions between the battery and capacitor materials in an UltraBattery need in-depth understanding and the current partitioning between the two components needs to be predicted and evaluated.\nTo date, both lead acid battery models and electrochemical capacitor models are available, but were developed separately. No models have been developed to understand the hybrid battery with presence of both battery and capacitive electrodes. In this work, a mathematical model for PbC batteries was firstly developed to predict performance under various operating conditions. This model couples the electrochemical, mass transport and thermal processes and also accounts for the gassing behaviors at electrodes during charge. With the feature of capacity and gassing rate predictions the model can serve as a design tool to compare and select desirable carbon candidates for specified applications of PbC batteries. The PbC battery model is applied to simulate and analyze the gassing and thermal behaviors during both galvanostatic charging and cycling processes. The galvanostatic charging processes with different gassing kinetics are investigated. Hydrogen gassing rate and charge efficiencies are focused on for cycling simulation and the effect of operational factors are demonstrated. The temperature rise due to gassing processes is compared among different electrode specifications.\nIn addition, a fundamental model for UltraBatteries with lead-acid cells and capacitor cells was developed. Dynamic behaviors of internal parameters such as electrolyte potential and current density across the cells during cycling are revealed. One important parameter is introduced as a design ratio, namely the volume fraction of the lead electrode portion in the cell. The effect of design ratio on energy and power performance, such as capacity, current partitioning between cells and electrode utilization efficiency are studied through cycling simulations. Operational factors are evaluated as well, including the effects of duty ratio of a cycle, , starting SOC, cycling frequency and cycling current on current partitioning. This model unveiled the internal dynamics of current partition inside UltraBatteries through simulation results and offered guidelines for improving the design of batteries with hybrid electrodes and optimizing the operating strategies to reduce the peak discharge load on lead electrodes and thus prolong battery lifetime.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7923], "author_name_tesi": "Gou, Jun ", "last_name_ssi": "Gou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Chao Yang Wang", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Christopher Rahn", "Donghai Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["modeling", "lead-acid batteries", "carbon electrodes", "hybrid electrodes", "gassing", "current partitioning"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Sensemaking Approach to Visual Analytics of Attribute-rich Social Networks", "id": "15310", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7605", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Social networks have become more complex, in particular considering the fact that elements in social networks are not only abstract topological nodes and links, but contain rich social attributes and reflecting diverse social relationships. For example, in a co-authorship social network in a scientific community, nodes in the social network, which represent authors, have multiple attributes, including academic rank, affiliation, expertise domain, and so on. Analyzing such attribute-rich social networks requires making sense of not only its structural features, but also the relationship between social attributes and network structures. Current social network analysis tools usually treat actors and relationships in social networks as abstract topological components, i.e., nodes and links, and ignore the impacts of social attributes over network structure. Furthermore, these tools often combine social network analysis with statistical methods and produce complex visual results; however, they often overlook users\u2019 needs for sensemaking tools that help to gather, synthesize, and organize information. \nTo address these challenges, this study proposes a sensemaking approach to visual analytics of attribute-rich social networks in this dissertation. A sensemaking framework is first presented, which consists of both bottom-up processes, constructing new understandings based on collected information, and top-down processes, using prior knowledge to guide information collection, in analyzing attribute-rich social networks. Then, this study introduces a graph model of attribute-rich social networks and designs a novel visualization technique, TreeNetViz, to analyze network patterns over social hierarchical attributes. A case study shows that TreeNetViz help users to understand multiscale and cross-scale network patterns for networks with hierarchical attributes. Further, this study also proposes new methods of actor similarity analysis to leverage both network information and social attributes with the graph model and demonstrate their applications in the field of information retrieval and information visualization. Finally, guided by the framework, a system, SocialNetSense, is designed and developed to support the sensemaking in visual analytics of attribute-rich social networks.

At the heart of the method is a new reactor physics computer code, PEBBED, which accurately and efficiently computes the neutronic and material properties of the asymptotic (equilibrium) fuel cycle. This core state is shown to be unique for a given core geometry, power level, discharge burnup, and fuel circulation policy. Fuel circulation in the pebble-bed can be described in terms of a few well?defined parameters and expressed as a recirculation matrix. The implementation of a few heat?transfer relations suitable for high-temperature gas-cooled reactors allows for the rapid estimation of thermal properties critical for safe operation. Thus, modeling and design optimization of a given pebble-bed core can be performed quickly and efficiently via the manipulation of a limited number key parameters. Automation of the optimization process is achieved by manipulation of these parameters using a genetic algorithm.

DED uses a laser or electron beam to melt either\nmetallic powder or wire, which is controlled numerically to deposit the material onto a substrate\nor existant component. Computational models of DED processes are used for two primary\nreasons: process parametization and prediction of material properties. For the first reason,\nthermo-mechanical models are completed to determine the distortion and residual stresses\nthat develop due to the high thermal gradients inherent during deposition. With accurate\nmodels, investigations can be made to mitigate these negative phenomena by alteration of\nprocess parameters including laser power, laser path, and environmental conditions. For the\n2nd modeling motivation, thermal models are completed from which the thermal gradients,\ncooling rates, or solidification rates may be computed, which are the phenomenon which drive\nmicrostructural development, which in turn determines the final material properties of the\ndeposited material.While DED technology is mature, having long been used to rapidly clad,\nrepair, or build new components, the modeling of these processes is only now able to achieve the\naccuracy and speed necessary for industrial implementation.\nIn this work finite element (FE) models are developed and validated for DED processes.\nIn situ measurements of temperature are taken during the single layer laser cladding of\nInconel R \u20dd 625625. These are used to develop and validate the application of thermal boundary\nconditions aiming to improve model accuracy. First, the application of convection boundary\nconditions are explored. During DED deposition, the gases used to propel the powder and prevent material contamination in the melt pool cause a significant convective cooling.\nComparisons are made between various methods of applying convection including using natural\nconvection only, forced convection measured from the lumped capacitance method, convection\nfrom an impinging jet heat transfer paper, convection measured by hot film anemometry, and\nignoring convection. The importance of applying convection to the evolving free surface was\nalso investigated. It was shown that using the hot film anemometry values applied to an evolving\nfree surface yielded the most accurate model, with 3-13% error. Secondly, conduction losses\ndue to fixturing during laser cladding processes were investigated. Two Inconel R \u20dd 625625 laser\ncladding experiments were completed, each using identical processes parameters, one which\nwas held in a cantilevered fixture, one bolted directly to the work bench. These represent the\nminimum and maximum contact area during deposition. In situ measurements of temperature\nwere taken, which were used for the calibration and validation of the subsequent thermal\nsimulations. Though two bodies may be in contact, there is a loss of thermal conduction at their\njunction due to the microscopic irregularities of the surfaces. The drop in thermal heat transfer\nis called contact resistance and the effective conductivity through the point of contact is called\ngap conductance. A method for estimating the maximum gap conductance and application to\nFE models was developed. Calibration of gap conductance was completed for each experimental\ncase. For the cantlivered clad, it was estimated that that merely 2% of the total heat loss occurred\nthrough the fixture. Application of the gap conductance model improved the accuracy of the\nmodel near the point of contact, but did not greatly affect the remainder of the substrate or clad\nmaterial. For the work bench bolted clad, it was estimate that between 70-85% of the input heat\nleft via conduction. It was shown that the accuracy of the thermal model for this case was vastly improved by using the gap conductance model, but that the effectiveness of the modeling was\nlimited somewhat by the thermo-mechanical interaction.\nWith the improved accuracy of the thermal models gained by the preceding advancements\nin boundary condition handling, the focus was shifted towards capturing the material\nsolidification and ensuing microstructure with the FE model. To this end, single track depositions\nwere performed using 4 sets of laser power and scan speed, for both Inconel R \u20dd 625625 and\nTi\u22126Al \u22124V. Type K thermocouples were used for far-field validation of the thermal model\nwhile high temperature Type C thermocouples were threaded through the underside of the\nsubstrate, to lay flush with the surface. This allowed for the in situ measurement of melt pool\ntemperatures during deposition. Post process, the plates were sectioned and the melt depth\nwas measured. Two modeling techniques were used to improve the accuracy for attaining\nboth of these measured phenomenon: altering the melt temperature specific heat to account for\nchanges in liquid density and altering the melt temperature thermal conductivity to approximate\nconvection within the melt pool. This method reduced the simulated melt depth error to under\n10% for 5 of the cases and the simulated melt temperature error under 25% for all 8 cases. It\nbeing concluded the model can accurately predict melt pool behavior, a model for predicting the\nmaterial properties of laser clad Inconel R \u20dd 625 was developed. Empirical correlations have been\nproduced from Inconel R \u20dd 625 hardness, yield strength, and microstructure measurements from\npublished works from a variety of AM processes. Using the preceding single track study it was\nshown that using similar processing parameters the model could approximate the solidification\ntime. It is the solidification time which controls the microstructure of Inconel R \u20dd 625. The\nthermo-property model was calibrated against microstructure and hardness measurements from\nthe laser clad. Experimental measurements of microstructure, hardness, and yield strength from 3 Inconel R \u20dd 625 wall builds were used to validate the semiempirical model.This work yields a\npathway from the process parameters to the material properties of laser clad Inconel R \u20dd 625 which\ncan be used to estimate or design the mechanical properties of DED Inconel R \u20dd 625 components.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11660], "author_name_tesi": "Gouge, Michael Fielding", "last_name_ssi": "Gouge", "middle_name_ssi": "Fielding", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Panagiotis Michaleris", "Todd Palmer", "Allison Michelle Beese", "Reuben H Kraft"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Panagiotis Michaleris, Dissertation Advisor", "Todd Palmer, Committee Member", "Allison Michelle Beese, Committee Member", "Reuben H Kraft, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Laser Cladding", "Finite Element Modeling", "Inconel 625", "Heat transfer", "Material property prediction", "Microstructure prediction"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Empirical Analysis of Employment Arbitration Decisions", "id": "8405", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4045", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Supreme Court rulings in Gilmer v.

Dielectric elastomers are of particular interest for many biomedical applications due to their high actuation speeds and very large strains, on the order of hundreds of percent strain. The dielectric elastomer actuator is a three-component system consisting of a soft dielectric elastomer between two compliant electrodes. Application of a voltage causes the elastomer to increase in area and decrease in thickness.  The elastomer recovers its initial configuration upon removal of the voltage. \nA dielectric elastomer membrane actuator is to be incorporated into the design of a prosthetic blood pump.  This electroactive polymer membrane is being considered as a potential replacement for the passive diaphragm in a current left ventricular assist device.  In its perceived mode of operation, the circular active membrane, clamped around the edges, will deform in response to a voltage from its initially in-plane configuration to an inflated state so as to displace blood from the adjoining blood sac; thus, mimicking the pump-like behavior of the natural heart.  Using a dielectric elastomer membrane actuator eliminates the need for a separate actuation source in the pump, which will create a simpler, lighter, and more compact device.\n\tThe material and geometrical nonlinearities of dielectric elastomer actuators make them more difficult to model than traditional linear actuators.  In this dissertation, a large deformation electro-elastic model of dielectric elastomer membrane actuators is developed by combining Maxwell-Faraday electrostatics and nonlinear elasticity theory.  Initial models assumed an elastically linear constitutive model and considered the electrostatic Maxwell effect as an externally applied force across the thickness [1].  Improvements to such models have been made by using nonlinear elastic models [2].  Here, taking a different approach than previously described yields a new model.  The dielectric is modeled as a continuum placed in an electric field subject to external surface tractions.  Taking a continuum mechanics approach, the stress in the dielectric medium is determined by a superposition of the mechanical stress due to the local elastic state and the Maxwell stress due to the electrostatic field.  Based on the proposed expression for the electro-elastic stress, a large deformation model is derived using membrane theory.  Since the thickness of the membrane is much smaller than the radius, and given that bending effects are negligible, it is reasonable to assume that membrane theory is applicable to active membrane inflation.  Using Green\u2019s membrane theory as a starting point [3], various researchers have obtained solutions for the quasi-static inflation of a planar elastic membrane (passive), the dynamic inflation of a planar membrane, and the inflation of viscoelastic membranes.  Here, solutions for the inflation of electro-elastic membranes are presented.  Specifically, this contribution has been derived by modifying Adkins and Rivlin\u2019s theory of inflatable elastic membranes to account for material stiffening at high strains (using an Ogden model) and electrical effects [4].  The quasi-static inflation of dielectric elastomer actuators by a uniform mechanical pressure and an applied voltage are presented.  The model is used to solve for the resultant membrane behavior, subject to changes in various system parameters such as prestretch, external pressure, applied voltage, and the percentage electroded area of the dielectric.  A method for calculating the blocked pressure specific to inflatable active membranes is also introduced.  A hypothetical work-loop simulating cardiac diaphragm conditions is constructed and evaluated.  In addition, parameter studies are conducted to explore the feasibility of optimizing the active diaphragm for pump application.  The numerical quasi-static results are compared to experimental data for actuators made from 3M VHB polyacrylate films.  It is shown that the theoretical model for the active inflation of hyperelastic membranes, like passive membrane inflation models [5], is sensitive to the explicit form of the assumed strain energy function.  Using the best overall values for the material constants the electro-elastic model predicts the zero-voltage and voltage-dependent behavior for the inflation of dielectric elastomer actuators.  The correlation between the numerical results and the experimental data is good for the prestretch range considered.  Finally, it is shown how the membrane design can be optimized for a single variable \u2013 the prestretch, using four different numerical optimization techniques.    \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4599], "author_name_tesi": "Goulbourne, Nakhiah C", "last_name_ssi": "Goulbourne", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Nakhiah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Richard Benson", "Alan Snyder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker, Committee Chair", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Chair", "Richard Benson, Committee Member", "Alan Snyder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electroelastic membrane", "blood pump", "dielectric elastomer actuator"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "REGENERATING OAK DOMINATED STANDS: DESCRIPTIONS, PREDICTIVE MODELS, AND GUIDELINES\n", "id": "6674", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4894", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Regenerating oak-dominated forests is a major challenge faced by forest managers in the eastern United States.  Even-aged silvicultural systems are considered the best systems for regenerating oaks, but in the central Appalachians (and elsewhere) oaks are nevertheless often replaced by other species after timber harvests.  The present work addresses several aspects of the oak regeneration problem.  The post-harvest development of 90 formerly oak-dominated stands (> 50 percent oak before harvest) is described in terms of \"developmental pathways.\"   The developmental pathways link stand conditions around the time of harvest to stand compositions and forest structures in the \"third decade\" (20 - 32 yrs) following harvest.  Pathways were described by first identifying four outcome classes (based on third-decade compositions) using cluster analysis.  Differences between outcome classes in stand compositions before harvest (overstory and advance regeneration compositions) and two years after harvest were then identified.  Of the four pathways, only the OAK pathway resulted in the regeneration of oak-dominated stands.  The loss of oak dominance in the other pathways corresponded with poor oak regeneration potential at the time of harvest.  The RED MAPLE pathway featured a rapid post-harvest transition to dominance by red maple (Acer rubrum L.), a shade-tolerant species that established as advance regeneration in the pre-harvest stands.  Stand compositions in the MIXED pathway changed markedly after harvest with the establishment of black birch (Betula lenta L.) and other pioneer species.  Regeneration failure occurred in the UNSTOCKED pathway, which featured pre-harvest mortality and a post-harvest loss of regeneration.  The pathways reflect several ecological models of forest succession.  More importantly, they highlight the importance of stand conditions around the time of harvest to subsequent development.   \n\tModels are presented to measure oak regeneration potential, expressed as expected third-decade oak stocking (i.e., the percentage of growing space occupied by oaks in the third decade after harvest).  The models were created primarily using a long-term dataset developed from operational data collected in the course of timber sales, and a short-term research dataset collected as part of an on-going project examining regeneration development in Pennsylvania.  A plot-level model was developed to measure the regeneration potential of advance oak regeneration sampled on milacre plots.  The model uses plot aggregate height, the sum of oak seedling heights, to estimate the probability that an oak will occupy the plot in the third decade after harvest.  Inverse modeling was employed to fit the plot-level model using both the long-term and short-term datasets.  A second model estimates the contribution of oak stump sprouts to third-decade oak stocking, based on the species and diameter of parent trees.  \n\tThe two models are incorporated into comprehensive guidelines designed to aid forest managers in the regeneration of oaks.  The guidelines recommend regeneration prescriptions based on management goals, expected third-decade oak stocking, and other stand conditions.  Decision charts to assign prescriptions were developed using expert opinion and emerging information.  Overstory removals are recommended when the current oak regeneration potential is adequate to meet management goals.  When the current potential is lacking, treatments are to improve the seed-origin regeneration potential are recommended.  \n\tThe effects of competition on the development of individual oak seedlings following clearcutting are evaluated to test whether competition terms can significantly improve individual tree regeneration models.  Current oak regeneration models do not explicitly consider competitive effects when predicting oak regeneration development.  An unusual dataset from the Missouri Ozarks that tracks 405 naturally-established oak seedlings from before harvest to about 20 yrs after harvest was used.  Models were fit to predict 20-yr success (reaching a dominant or codominant crown class) based on pre-harvest seedling height (size model) and pre-harvest height plus an index of local competition (competition model).    The competition model produced predictions that better matched observations across a range of competitive conditions.  The results suggest that including competition terms can significantly improve future oak regeneration models.     \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4871], "author_name_tesi": "Gould, Peter Jay", "last_name_ssi": "Gould", "middle_name_ssi": "Jay", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kim C Steiner", "Marc Eric Mcdill", "James Craig Finley", "Susan L Stout", "Alan H Taylor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kim C Steiner, Committee Chair", "Marc Eric Mcdill, Committee Member", "James Craig Finley, Committee Member", "Susan L Stout, Committee Member", "Alan H Taylor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["silviculture", "forest management", "forest modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Coarse Woody Debris in Riparian Corridors of Central Pennsylvania: How Abundance, Characteristics, and Dynamics Vary with Anthropogenic Disturbance", "id": "14876twg5075", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14876", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The wetlands and riparian corridors of North America\u2019s Mid-Atlantic Region (MAR) have been under constant and continuing pressure from anthropogenic settlement since before the arrival of the first Europeans on the continent.

An understanding of the detrimental effects of landscape alteration has grown within the past few decades, and in this relatively short period of time, a wealth of research has been compiled on how to reverse these effects through restoration.  Floodplains, often heavily settled and modified, have been of particular interest as they provide valuable services such as flood attenuation, soil enrichment, and water storage.  Within the context of floodplains, limited attention has been paid to coarse woody debris (CWD) and its role in the ecosystem.  Historically, coarse woody debris has been removed from channels and riparian corridors by people for a number of reasons.  It is now understood to be a crucial element of ecosystem architecture, and efforts are being made to characterize how CWD dynamics within the landscape affect functioning and service provisioning.  Although a body of work on this subject has been produced in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S., there are still many questions that remain to be answered.  This research utilizes data collected during rapid field assessments of habitat quality, in conjunction with intensive surveys of debris, to determine how anthropogenic disturbance influences debris abundances and characteristics in floodplain systems.  This study was completed in the central Pennsylvania portion of the MAR, an area that, though heavily forested, has received little attention in debris studies.  Results demonstrate that the greatest quantities of debris are associated with sites experiencing the least amount of anthropogenic disturbance, and that the debris found at these sites shows greater diversity in size than debris found elsewhere.  A moderately-robust mathematical relationship was also established between debris counts and riparian forest basal areas, indicating that this measurement of habitat quality may be the best predictor of debris concentration.

The habitat provided by these foundation species supports diverse assemblages of smaller heterotrophic invertebrates.  This dissertation consists of five chapters that characterize the ecology of hydrothermal vent communities associated with the giant vestimentiferan tubeworm Riftia pachyptila (Polychaeta: Siboglinidae) at the East Pacific Rise.  The first chapter reviews the literature on the physical environment, the biology of the dominant species, and the patterns and dynamics of hydrothermal vent communities.  The second chapter presents the results of a clearance and transplant experiment, designed to test the role of biological interactions in the succession of low-temperature hydrothermal vents.  The unexpected results provide an opportunity to characterize the patterns of recruitment and community assembly associated with an aggregation of R. pachyptila that developed in less than one year.  The third chapter examines the spatial and temporal variability of the R. pachyptila community, sampled at two discrete sites and in two consecutive years.  Although the temperature ranges did not vary between sites or years, the chemical composition of the diffuse hydrothermal fluids was significantly different at each site.  The physiological condition of the R. pachyptila individuals appeared to reflect the environmental conditions, but the structure and the composition of the community was remarkably similar between sites and years.  The fourth chapter tests the hypothesis that the physical structure of R. pachyptila aggregations supports high local species diversity in a high productivity habitat.  The results of deploying artificial tubeworm aggregations along a productivity gradient for one year demonstrate the importance of physical structure, productivity and biological attributes of foundation species in the regulation of the epifaunal community structure.  A summary of this work is discussed in the fifth chapter, integrating the results of quantitative sampling and experimental manipulations to investigate the roles of environmental variability, productivity, habitat provision and modification, and biological interactions in the structure of the epifaunal community associated with R. pachyptila.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [826], "author_name_tesi": "Govenar, Breea ", "last_name_ssi": "Govenar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Breea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "Eric S Post", "Ottar N Bjornstad", "Duane R Diefenbach"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Chair", "Eric S Post, Committee Member", "Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Member", "Duane R Diefenbach, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrothermal vent", "East Pacific Rise", "tubeworm", "Riftia pachyptila", "marine benthic", "community ecology"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Heidegger and the Question of Tragedy", "id": "6504", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3386", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-11-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Heidegger and the Question of Tragedy, examines the significance of ancient Greek tragedy for the thought of arguably the most important philosopher of the twentieth century and critic of modern Western society, Martin Heidegger (1889-1976).  References to Greek tragedy only appear in Heidegger?s writing during the years 1933-1946.  This decade and a half following the 1927 publication of Being and Time is considered to be the most important, and undoubtedly the most controversial, period in Heidegger?s long career.  I argue that Heidegger?s thought of the tragic illuminates an irresolvable tension that he finds at the origin of the Western tradition and its understanding of being.  This tension appears at  the inception of Western thought as the tendency for being to show itself as pure presence; as a stable, unchanging origin; an infinite source of all beings.  While this interpretation of being has taken various forms during the epochs of the Western tradition, it has consistently and with accelerating force resulted in the concealment of the temporal character of being.  According to Heidegger?s diagnosis, this oblivion of being has led in the modern age to an increasingly fervent drive for technological mastery of nature and peoples; a hubristic faith in the human capacity to order and control; and an understanding of truth that tends to universalize and to assure human dominion.  \nYet Heidegger finds that the modern obsession with technological mastery and scientific truth, while nearly indomitable, betrays in its very fervency a tacit acknowledgement, concealed from itself, of this other, hidden character of being that cannot be captured by the conceptual tools for thinking it that the tradition assigns.  Heidegger?s fundamental, tragic insight is that both the understanding of being as pure presence and the self-concealing counterplay of being in its temporal, finite character issue from being itself; that the manifestation of being is also its concealment, and that this dynamic structure in which being is constantly at odds with itself is proper to it.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3374], "author_name_tesi": "Gover, Karen Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Gover", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Karen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Sallis", "Charles Edward Scott", "Dennis Schmidt", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "John Philip Christman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Sallis, Committee Chair", "Charles Edward Scott, Committee Member", "Dennis Schmidt, Committee Member", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heidegger", "tragedy"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF A WET GRID MODEL FOR \nTWO \u2013 PHASE DISPERSED FLOW FILM BOILING PHENOMENA\n\n", "id": "11495", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6067", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study focuses on the development of a Wet Grid Model to describe the wet grid phenomenon observed during the reflood stage of a postulated Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) in a nuclear reactor. At high flooding rates, it has been observed that the spacer grids at elevations above the quench front undergo rewetting much earlier than the fuel rod. A consequence of this is the establishment of a liquid film on the surface of the spacer grid. Liquid droplet sizes found downstream of a wet grid are larger than those found upstream of the grid indicating a distinctly different mechanism of droplet generation as compared to a dry grid scenario for which the droplets decrease in size as they pass through the grid. In this study, a possible mechanism is postulated and a mathematical model is derived for the same.  \n      The wet grid phenomenon is postulated to be consisting of four individual processes. Firstly, the deposition of droplets from the dispersed two phase mixture onto the spacer grid surface, then the establishment of a liquid film of equilibrium thickness on the surface of the spacer strap, thirdly, the entrainment of liquid ligaments from the liquid film due to the shear action of the steam flow and finally the breakup of these ligaments into a number of fine droplets downstream of the grid. A mathematical model is formulated for each of these processes which can be used to predict the droplet diameter downstream of a wet grid, given the flow and system conditions upstream of the grid. In addition, a numerical based correlation is proposed to obtain the downstream to upstream ratio of the sauter mean diameter of droplets in a wet grid situation.\n      The flow of superheated steam through the span of a wet spacer grid results in a significant de \u2013 superheating and acceleration of the steam due to the evaporation of the liquid film on the surface of the wet spacer grid. The simultaneous effect of steam de \u2013 superheating and acceleration greatly enhances the heat transfer rate from the surface of the nuclear fuel rod, downstream of a wet grid. A mechanistic model is proposed to determine the Grid Enhanced Heat Transfer (GEHT) downstream of a wet grid. The numerical solution to the model equations shows that over a void fraction range of 0.99 to 0.999, the equilibrium film thickness varies between 0.12 and 0.1 mm while the average liquid film velocity varies between 0.7 and 0.1 m/s. The downstream to upstream ratio of the sauter mean diameter of the droplets was found to vary between 2.75 and 0.8. A reduction of around 100 deg. C in the steam temperature was obtained as it flows through the span of the wet spacer spacer grid. A wet grid was found to be more effective in augmenting heat transfer than a dry grid under the same flow conditions. This augmentation was found to be as much as three times higher for void fractions very close to unity. Results obtained from the models, however, are still parametric in nature since no experimental data under wet grid like conditions is available in the literature for model development and validation. Future experiments to obtain the much needed droplet data under wet grid conditions is suggested at the end of this work. Once the present models are validated, they can be implemented directly into best estimate systems analysis codes such as COBRA \u2013 TF and TRACE for predicting the rate of cooling of the fuel rods during the reflood transients following a LOCA in a nuclear reactor.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6059], "author_name_tesi": "Goverapet Srinivasan, Sriram ", "last_name_ssi": "Goverapet Srinivasan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sriram", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung", "Fan Bill B Cheung"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung, Thesis Advisor", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["LOCA", "Wet Grid Phenomena", "Dispersed flow", "Grid Enhanced Heat Transfer"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Hyperthermal Oxidation and Pyrolysis of Carbon based Materials: Chemistry and Dynamics using the Reaxff Reactive Force Field", "id": "23026", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10532", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary focus of this work was to study the chemistry and dynamics of hyperthermal collisions of oxygen atoms with carbon based materials of the kind witnessed in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment and their pyrolysis through atomistic simulations using the ReaxFF reactive force field and to develop ReaxFF potentials for such applications.  In particular, ReaxFF was used to study the oxidative erosion of graphene, graphite and diamond subjected to collisions with energetic oxygen atoms at elevated surface temperatures. Prior to these simulations, the ReaxFF C/H/O potential was validated against quantum chemical (QC) data for the energetics associated with the loss of a CO2 molecule from a model graphitic system and for various other chemical reactions occurring during the collision of a hyperthermal oxygen atom with a pristine and defective graphene sheet and a diamond slab. ReaxFF based simulations suggested that the breakup of a graphene sheet and graphite structure upon hyperthermal oxygen atom impact could be divided into distinct regimes. Graphene erosion proceeded through the formation of epoxides on the surface followed by the creation and growth of vacancy defects while the breakup of graphite occurred through the formation of epoxides on the top layer, creation and growth of vacancy defects on the top layer followed by epoxide formation on the bottom layer, creation of defects and their growth on the bottom layer. As such the breakup of graphite was observed to be a layer by layer event with the rate of growth of defects much larger along the basal plane directions compared to the axial direction. With increase in temperature, the rate of mass loss from graphite was observed to increase. While the impact of the oxygen atoms occurred at hyperthermal energies, the chemical reactions leading to mass loss from graphite were thermal in nature. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations of carbon loss from graphite at various surface temperatures upon hyperthermal oxygen atom collisions were used to obtain an Arrhenius type rate law for the carbon atom loss rate under such conditions. Further, the direction dependent etching properties of graphite exposed to hypothermal atomic oxygen collisions were also investigated. These simulations revealed that graphite basal planes are poorly resistant to energetic oxygen atom etching while the armchair and zigzag edge surfaces are an order of magnitude more resistant to energetic oxygen atom etching. To compare the response of diamond surfaces with graphite, energetic oxygen atom etching of low index diamond surfaces namely, diamond (100), diamond (111) and diamond (110) were carried out at various surface temperatures using the ReaxFF C/H/O potential. ReaxFF simulations on small oxygen terminated diamond slabs indicated that a variety of functional groups such as ethers, peroxides, oxy radicals and dioxetanes can form on the surface, in agreement with earlier experiments and first principles based calculations. Successive oxygen collisions on larger reconstructed diamond surfaces showed that all the low index surfaces can be etched by hyperthermal atomic oxygen with diamond (100) showing the lowest etching rate and diamond (110) presenting the largest etching rate. The erosion yield of these surfaces is in good agreement with experimental results. The simulations performed here have been used to obtain an Arrhenius type rate law for the mass loss from these surfaces under such conditions. Although diamond surfaces can be etched by energetic oxygen atoms, they were found to be more than two orders of magnitude more resistant to oxidative erosion as compared to graphite basal planes. These simulations suggest that diamond thin films are promising materials for the surface of space crafts exposed to LEO conditions and in general, the ability of ReaxFF to be used as an effective tool to screen or characterize materials for applications in extreme environments.\nIn order to study the interaction of hyperthermal atomic oxygen with silica surfaces, a widely used material for the thermal protection system of high speed aircrafts, the ReaxFFSiO potential was extended to describe oxygen \u2013 silica gas surface interactions by harvesting model clusters representative of a reconstructed (001) silica surface and surface defects on silica, obtaining density functional theory (DFT) based potential  energy curves for the approach of an atomic and molecular oxygen to these clusters followed by re-parametrization of the ReaxFFSiO potential against this data. The new potential, ReaxFF-SiO/GSI, can be employed for accurate molecular dynamics simulations of oxygen \u2013 silica gas surface interactions.\nThe thermal fragmentation of a large fullerene molecule was studied through molecular dynamics simulations in order to understand the mechanisms underlying the pyrolysis of carbon based materials. While the performance of the ReaxFF C/H/O potential for the chemistry of graphite and diamond oxidation was very good, its description of the mechanical deformation of carbon condensed phases was not satisfactory. Thus ReaxFF C/H/O was re-parameterized against DFT data for the equation of state of graphite, diamond, the formation energies of defects in graphene and amorphous carbon phases from fullerenes. The newly developed ReaxFF potential (ReaxFFC-2013) was used in the molecular dynamics simulation of the thermal fragmentation of a C180 molecule. The simulations indicated that the thermal fragmentation of these giant fullerenes can be classified into two distinct regimes \u2013 an exponential regime followed by a linear regime. In the initial exponential regime, the molecule shrinks in size but retains the cage like structure while in the final linear regime, the cage opens up into an amorphous phase, resulting in an acceleration of the decay process. Arrhenius parameters for the decay of the molecule in both the regimes were obtained by carrying out simulations at various temperatures. While the decay of the molecule occurred primarily via the loss of C2 units, with increase in temperature, the probability of loss of larger fragments was found to increase. The newly developed potential along with the methods used in this study can readily be extended towards the full computational chemical modeling of the high temperature erosion of graphitic rocket nozzles and ablation of carbon based spacecraft materials during atmospheric reentry.  \nFinally, to explore the possibility of developing carbon based materials resistant to oxidative erosion through the impact of hyperthermal oxygen atoms, oxygen interaction with boron doped graphene was considered. Model clusters representative of boron doped graphene were used to obtain DFT based potential energy curves for the approach of an atomic oxygen to these clusters. This dataset can now be used to parameterize ReaxFF to describe oxygen \u2013 boron doped graphene gas surface interactions.\nThe research work reported in this dissertation lays out a clear strategy to develop a ReaxFF reactive potential and to apply it to study the oxidative degradation and pyrolysis of materials subjected to extreme conditions. Further it provides a straightforward way to extract Arrhenius type parameters from molecular dynamics simulations for the erosion of materials under such conditions. These parameters can be used directly in mesoscale simulation schemes such as Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), thereby providing the vital link between atomic scale and macro scale in bottoms up materials design approach.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10181], "author_name_tesi": "Goverapet Srinivasan, Sriram ", "last_name_ssi": "Goverapet Srinivasan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sriram", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin", "Zoubeida Ounaies", "Randy Lee Vander Wal", "Lasse Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin, Dissertation Advisor", "Zoubeida Ounaies, Committee Member", "Randy Lee Vander Wal, Committee Member", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ReaxFF", "Graphite oxidation", "Diamond oxidation", "Fullerene fragmentation", "Gas surface interaction", "hyperthermal etching"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Multiscale Anabolic Bone Responses to Fluid Flow and Post-irradiation Loading", "id": "25657", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11142", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The long-term goal of this work is to reduce the burden of skeletal fractures by learning how to appropriate and guide the body\u2019s inherent capacity for adaptive bone formation. This tissue-level adaptation to mechanical load is the end product of bone cells responding to physical phenomena in their microscopic niche. Our objective was to elucidate if, and how, the initial stimulation of cells might ultimately bring about bone adaptation to strengthen bones at risk for fracture, specifically those damaged by radiation therapy. Our study followed that sequence: we first examined the response of osteocytic cells\u2014those thought to orchestrate the adaptive response\u2014to in vitro fluid flow simulating the physical stimulation present at the microscopic scale upon loading. We identified novel cell signaling using high-throughput analyses of the whole gene transcriptome and proteome, enriched by network mapping and functional association databases. These results implicated inflammatory cellular recruitment, most notably via up-regulation of stem cell homing chemokines Cxcl1 and Cxcl2. Therefore, we examined recruitment of cells to loaded bones as we progressed to the whole tissue scale of adaptation. First, in mice in vivo, we determined compression loading was best suited for examining both trabecular and cortical tibia bone adaptation since cantilever loading brought about trabecular bone loss. Importantly, compression loading attenuated bone loss, and even added additional new bone in mice modeling our at-risk population of irradiated bone marrow transplant recipients. Hence, we propose that cancer and transplant patients subject to similar therapies may also retain robust physiological capacity for load-induced bone adaptation to alleviate fracture risk. To unify these cell- and tissue-scale observations, we examined recruitment of transplanted donor cells. We found no up-regulation of donor cell proportions in marrow of loaded bones, but a non-significant trend toward increased donor cell presence in loaded bone itself. In sum, these findings lead us to propose that when irradiated bones are loaded, fluid flowed osteocytes signal for recruitment of marrow- or vasculature-derived osteoprogenitors, thereby increasing adaptive bone formation and fracture resistance.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10706], "author_name_tesi": "Govey, Peter Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Govey", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Donahue", "Justin Lee Brown", "Gregory Stephen Lewis", "Christopher Niyibizi", "Christopher Alan Siedlecki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Donahue, Dissertation Advisor", "Justin Lee Brown, Committee Member", "Gregory Stephen Lewis, Committee Member", "Christopher Niyibizi, Committee Member", "Christopher Alan Siedlecki, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bone", "mechanical loading", "fluid flow", "bone adaptation", "radiation", "irradiation", "stem cell", "mechanotransduction", "bone marrow"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Algebraic Aspects of Higher Spin Symmetry", "id": "26000", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11417", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Massless conformal scalar fields in four-dimensional and six-dimensional Minkowski space-time correspond to minimal unitary representations of SO(4,2) (isomorphic to SU(2,2)) and SO(6,2) (isomorphic to SO*(8)), respectively.

RPD sets the levels of the control factors in order to minimize variation caused by changes in uncontrollable noise factors. Though noise is uncontrollable during the real operation of the system or use of the product, it has been assumed to be controllable and deterministic for experimentation purposes. In this dissertation, a response surface approach is used to develop a robust design framework that accounts for random variation in noise variables about a controllable mean during the experimentation phase. The Noise Perturbation Model (NPM) is proposed and an iterative method is developed that provides coe cient estimates for this model since ordinary and weighted least squares are not e cient. The NPM approach with the iterative estimation method is shown to provide estimates that have lower mean squared error when compared to ordinary least squares estimates. The practical advantage of using these estimates for robust design is also shown. \n\nIn an application of the framework developed, the robust design of queueing systems is considered. Queueing systems are usually subject to several random and uncontrollable variables that need to be taken into account while designing the system. Though the average or mean performance has traditionally been used as a metric, variance is of considerable importance as a measure for evaluating queueing systems. iii The NPM approach is used to factor noise into the response surface models for the mean and variance of a queueing performance measure. Doing so accounts for noise variable  uctuation during the experimentation stage; for example, the inter-arrival time is a random variable, not only in reality, but also during the experimentation stage. A two-stage estimation technique, that is generally applicable to models of the form considered, is proposed to estimate the mean and variance response surfaces. Such response surfaces can be used to adjust system parameters without further experimentation when the properties of random variables a ecting the system change.

The peak power consumption of these \ndatacenters significantly impact their sustainability: both their recurring \nelectricity\nbill (Op-ex) and one-time construction costs (Cap-ex). Existing pieces of work\noptimizing these cost are largely inadequate due to two main reasons, (i) they\nrely on overly conservative face-plate rating based estimates of datacenter peak\nneeds, rendering them ineffective, and (ii) they employ demand throttling (DVFS)\nand/or demand shaping (load spreading/migration) techniques, both with heavy\nperformance degrading implications.

Previous work has focused on the economic factors and optimal operation strategy that influence the decision to install a single CHP unit. Our approach is to assess the economic potential for CHP in electricity-market equilibrium framework, accounting for the impact that CHP adoption will have on energy prices. A statistical model of electricity supply and pricing is utilized to estimate zonal supply curves for transmission constrained electricity markets. The above model of electricity prices is coupled with simulated usage of CHP in different types of buildings, using the Philadelphia area as a case study. Incremental installations of CHP reduce the electricity demand from the grid, thus reducing wholesale electricity prices. The results suggest that electricity price reduction (and savings) is sensitive to natural gas prices and the operational strategy of CHP. In particular, the impacts of CHP adoption will have larger impacts on the electricity prices under high gas-price scenarios. This is due primarily to the reductions in peak-time electricity demand.  Also, operating CHP units in FEL mode has a larger impact on the electricity price duration curve (through larger reductions in demand for grid-provided electricity) than does operating CHP units in FTL mode. The net present value from CHP is modeled as a function of wholesale electricity prices, and thus decreases with each additional unit of CHP installed. Marginal savings and marginal NPV curves were estimated for three gas price scenarios and two CHP operation strategies (i.e., CHP-FTL and CHP-FEL). The marginal savings and marginal NPV decrease as the number of CHP units increase for all three-gas price scenarios and two CHP operation strategies. At low natural gas prices, the economic potential for CHP-FTL is about one-tenth of technical potential. If all CHP units are operated according to FEL, the economic potential is larger (around three to four times as large as under FTL operations) but still substantially smaller than the technical potential in the lower gas price scenarios. This study suggests that the priority rankings for CHP deployment are important considering a large-scale adoption of CHP in a region. The results suggests that higher natural gas prices and hence higher electricity prices, is favorable for CHP adoption. Under a range of operational assumptions and fuel prices, substantial CHP deployment could be achieved without reducing returns to the point where existing and incremental CHP installations would become uneconomic.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8993], "author_name_tesi": "Govindarajan, Anand ", "last_name_ssi": "Govindarajan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anand", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Combined Heat and Power", "Electricity Market Modeling", "Energy Efficiency"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Modeling and Simulation of a Six Wheel Differential Torque Steer Vehicle", "id": "10784", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4487", "abstract_tesi": "Autonomous Ground vehicles (AGV) are often required to automatically follow a pre-defined trajectory.

Despite the availability of a multitude of online retail web sites, there is a lack of effective comparative online search tools available for consumer use. Currently, consumers who want to compare similar products from different retail websites carry out the task by searching individual websites. Effective algorithms that can extract accurate product (as opposed to non-product) information from different vendors and represent them on a comparative basis have the potential to significantly reduce online shopping times. As a first step towards building such a comparative tool (for any product category), product web pages need to be identified.\n\nThe objective of this research is to develop and test algorithms to identify product web pages among a collection of product and non-product web pages. A typical web page can be identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and contains text (user interface data) and html code (user-hidden data which includes title tags, anchor tags, head tags and body tags) that can be utilized to classify web pages. The first algorithm is based on using URLs to identify product web pages. The second algorithm proposes and tests three methods of screening html information to create feature sets as input data to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Each feature set generated from the three techniques is given as input to the SVM and the classification accuracy is determined. The highest classification accuracy obtained determines the best Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) screening method to create the feature set.\n\nThe data set for the first algorithm consisted of seventy six URLs from product and non product web pages of a commercial computer vendor. The data set for the second algorithm consisted of one hundred product and non-product web pages each from four commercial vendors.\n\nThe experimental result using the first algorithm to identify certain web pages is promising, provided there are valuable keywords in the URLs. Using the feature set generated by method 3, the SVM based algorithm provided a good classification accuracy of 93% and also reduced the learning phase of the SVM algorithm. The thesis presents experimental results in detail and also discusses the advantages and limitations of the developed algorithms.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1670], "author_name_tesi": "Gowda Aghalya Shyama Sundar, Deepika ", "last_name_ssi": "Gowda Aghalya Shyama Sundar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Deepika", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prasenjit Mitra", "Prasenjit Mitra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prasenjit Mitra, Thesis Advisor", "Prasenjit Mitra, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Machine Learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Expression profiling of interindividual and interspecies variability in hepatic models. \n\n", "id": "9046", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3601", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although in vivo rodent models are a necessary part of the risk assessment process, incorporation of human models is necessary in order to evaluate whether effects in rodents are applicable to humans. Studies with in vitro hepatocytes have been hindered by the dramatic loss of differentiation status and liver-specific functions after isolation. In this study, expression profiling analyses demonstrate that hepatocytes cultured in a sandwich configuration and in the presence of physiological levels of dexamethasone maintain expression levels of liver-enriched transcription factors, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and transporters similar to that in human liver tissues. Additionally, hepatocytes in these conditions exhibit a complex biological response after xenobiotic challenge, namely, induction of cytochrome P450 mRNA and protein, marking these cells as a robust model system for studies of drug metabolism. An additional complicating factor of using primary hepatocytes in risk assessment is the magnitude of interindividual variability in hepatocytes from different donors. This study presents a detailed analysis of the comparability of response genes in hepatocytes from ten donors after challenge with xenobiotics that exhibit distinct mechanisms of action. A gene to gene comparison shows that hepatocytes exhibit limited reproducibility in response genes across donors, although a comparison of functional categories significantly increases reproducibility. Using this functional category approach, profiling results in primary human hepatocytes were compared to profiling results in mice after treatment with the same xenobiotics. Conserved cross-species responses were consistent with literature-reported mechanisms for each chemical. Interestingly, mitochondrial oxidative metabolism genes, specifically those genes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the electron transport chain, were consistently decreased in mice but were often increased in primary human hepatocytes. Finally, expression profiling of phenobarbital response genes identified a novel gene, Tsukushin (TSKU) that was reproducibly increased after treatment in nine of the ten human hepatocyte donors. TSKU knockdown in primary human hepatocytes resulted in a diminished cytochrome P450 induction response through an indirect mechanism.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3581], "author_name_tesi": "Goyak, Katy M.

The high sensitivity of the QCM was achieved via miniaturization of the QCM using micromachining techniques. The absolute mass sensitivity of sensor was increased by decreasing the thickness and the area of the electrodes of the resonators. Through optimal design, fabrication, and miniaturization the mass sensitivity of the sensors was increased by more than four orders of magnitude to less than 1 pg/Hz; as compared to 17 ng/Hz for commercially available 5 MHz bulk resonators. Miniaturization of the resonators enables their fabrication in an array format with each pixel of the array being individually addressed. This enables true spatial and temporal mass sensing capabilities. The fabricated resonators were tested for operation in air and water and high quality factors of 7500 and ~2000 were obtained respectively. \nA dielectric etch process was developed to achieve the miniaturization of the sensors. The optimization of the dielectric etch process was achieved using statistical techniques such as Design of Experiment (DOE). An etch rate of 0.5 \u00ecm/min at rms surface roughness of less than 2 nm was achieved after the optimization process. The process parameters, namely the ICP power, the substrate power, the flow rate of gases, the operating pressure of the etch tool, distance of substrate holder from the source, and the temperature of substrate holder, were quantitatively related to the etch rate and rms surface roughness using least square fit to the etch data. \nThe QCMs were integrated with carbon nanotubes using a simple spray-on technique. It was found that the addition of carbon nanotubes onto the electroded surface of the resonator increased its Q-factor by as much as 100%. It was proposed that the carbon nanotubes due to their high stiffness suppress the out-of-plane flexural vibrations in the QCMs thereby suppressing an energy loss channel and a consequent increase in the Q-factor. Measurement of out-of-plane vibrations of the quartz crystals using a laser based optical vibrometer revealed that the out-of-plane vibrations of QCM increase from 13 pm to 26 pm when carbon nanotubes are removed from the surface of the resonator \u2013  directly confirming the suppression of the out-of-plane motion on the resonator surface by carbon nanotubes.\nAdditionally, the QCMs were used to study the gas adsorption and desorption behavior of nominally \u201copen-ended\u201d isolated and nominally \u201cclose-ended\u201d bundled SWNTs. Using the ultrasensitive QCM, we were able to probe gas storage properties of carbon nanotubes. It was found that carbon nanotubes can adsorb large amount of gas molecules not only in the cylindrical pore that they enclose, but also on their external surface. Four different gases were tested, namely Helium, Nitrogen, Argon, and SF6. It was found that the change in resonance frequency and quality factor for the \u201cfill in\u201d and \u201cevacuation\u201d of gases from carbon nanotubes exhibited a characteristic ~  relationship, where MW is the atomic/molecular weight of gas species adsorbed. Such a behavior was consistently observed both for change in resonance frequency and Q-factor during the events of \u201cfill in\u201d and \u201cevacuation\u201d in the case of bare quartz with gold electrode, gold electrode covered with isolated \u201copen-ended\u201d SWNTs, and gold electrode with bundled \u201cclose-ended\u201d SWNTs. In the case of bare quartz with gold electrode, the observed change in resonance frequency and Q-factor and their characteristic ~  relationship can be explained on the basis of the viscous dissipation arising in gas ambient through the Gordon-Kanazawa equation. In the case of QCM with carbon nanotubes, the change in Q-factor and its characteristic ~  relationship could be explained on the basis of enhanced viscous dissipation arising due to surface roughness or modified Gordon Kanazawa equation. However, for the case of frequency change in the presence of carbon nanotubes, the characteristic ~  relationship and the observed change in magnitude of resonance frequency was explained in terms of physical adsorption of gas molecules near the inside and outside walls of carbon nanotubes, in regions where the potential due to the carbon atoms for gas atoms and molecules is attractive.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [493], "author_name_tesi": "Goyal, Abhijat ", "last_name_ssi": "Goyal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Abhijat", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Karen Eklund", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Charles Lee Croskey", "David Lawrence Allara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Chair", "Karen Eklund, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Charles Lee Croskey, Committee Member", "David Lawrence Allara, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gas Adsorption", "Quality Factor", "Carbon Nanotubes", "Automatic Gain Control Circuit", "Sensor", "Etching", "Quartz Crystal Microbalance", "Y-cut quartz", "infra red sensor", "self assembled monolayers."]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Predictive Analytics for Enhancing Customer Service In Electric Utility", "id": "29010", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12618", "abstract_tesi": "Electric power outages in USA alone causes loss of billions of dollars per year and affects nearly all kind of industries.

Since it is important in service organizations, understanding formal human resources practices in improving emotional performance is necessary. Selection, monitoring, and rewarding emotional labor have been explored in previous research (Leidner, 1999; Rafaeli & Sutton, 1987). Recently, however, authors have argued that in order to increase, improve, and maintain emotional performance, it may be necessary for organizations to provide emotional labor training (Goldberg & Grandey, 2007; Kim, 2007; Tan, Foo, & Kwek, 2004). Thus, training is a logical next step in furthering our understanding of emotional labor. The current research attempts to answer several research questions about the occurrence and consequences of emotional labor training. Using field survey data, study 1 answers questions about whether emotional labor training 1) occurs less frequently than rewards or monitoring, 2) occurs more frequently in jobs with high customer contact, 3) is more common in jobs with lower turnover, and 4) predicts emotional performance. Results indicate that training occurs less frequently than social rewards and monitoring for emotional labor and occurs more frequently in jobs with higher customer contact; however, training was unrelated to occupational turnover. Training for emotional labor was also found to positively relate to self-reported emotional performance beyond demographics and customer contact frequency. Study 2 was designed to test whether emotional labor training resulted in more or less negative reactions than other typical forms of training. Using a between-person experimental design and vignettes to manipulate type of training, results indicate that training for emotional labor does not result in negative reactions but actually enhances perceived social benefits more than other (technical skills) training.

Since personality has been shown to predict performance in all jobs (e.g., Barrick, Mount, & Judge, 2001), including specific and unique predictions for jobs with high interpersonal interactions (Mount, Barrick, & Stewart, 1998), service organizations would benefit from including personality in their selection processes.

Despite extensive research, few effective antiviral drugs exist to treat RNA virus infection.  Thus, the development of new antiviral drugs, and, more importantly, new antiviral strategies, is an essential medical research goal\nRNA viruses replicate at a high error frequency, resulting in the generation of a highly diverse virus population termed a quasispecies.  It has been postulated that RNA viruses exist at or near the error rate that allows optimal evolutionary flexibility while still maintaining viability of the viral genome.  However, it has been shown that increasing the inherent mutation rate just slightly can lead to \u201cgenetic meltdown\u201d, wherein the error rate is too high to maintain virus viability.  This has led to the idea of \u201clethal mutagenesis\u201d as an antiviral strategy, whereby drugs that can increase the mutation rate of an RNA virus can be administered in order to induce such a genetic meltdown in virus population, driving them to extinction.\nWork with the antiviral nucleoside ribavirin has suggested that such a mechanism may already be in clinical use.  Furthermore, extensive research in the past decade has shown that lethal mutagenesis may be a broadly applicable strategy against a wide variety of RNA viruses.\nThe work contained herein describes the synthesis and biological and biochemical evaluation of nucleoside analogs predicted to act as lethal mutagens of RNA viruses.  Our hypothesis was that lethal mutagenesis is a viable broad-spectrum antiviral strategy for combating clinical RNA virus infection.  As such, our goals were three-fold: (1) validate lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral strategy in vitro; (2) improve upon the mutagenic properties of ribavirin by developing more effective lethal mutagens as potential lead compounds for drug development; and (3) begin to understand the biological implications of lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral strategy.  Our work in this regard is described in the following pages.\nChapter 2 describes our efforts to synthesize novel mutagenic cytidine analogs as lethal mutagens, based on previous work with 2\u00a2-deoxyribonucleosides and HIV.  Chapter 3 describes our antiviral investigations with the highly mutagenic pyrimidine analog, rP.  Chapter 4 covers work with a series of substituted purine analogs that were found to be effective viral mutagens in cell culture.  Chapter 5 explains the differences observed between related viruses in their susceptibility to lethal mutagenesis.

Urban areas bring denser living conditions for both people and buildings. Growing global energy use has brought interest in the study of energy use in these rapidly growing urban areas. Common building materials absorb sunlight at a much higher rate than naturally occurring ecology. On the large scale, this results in the urban heat island effect, which refers to the higher temperatures present in dense urban areas compared to surrounding rural and suburban regions. The coefficient of performance of some common building HVAC systems is highly sensitive to local outdoor temperatures. Quantification of the degradation of COP in dense urban areas due to local temperatures is an important area of study as the world\u2019s population continues to urbanize.\n\tThe goal of this master\u2019s thesis is to use computational fluid dynamics modeling combined with building energy/thermal modeling to predict local temperatures in urban environments consisting of both low dense suburban/rural regions and dense city centers. Open source software packages OpenFOAM and EnergyPlus are used in tandem to calculate local air temperatures. The study offers insight on the use of these packages for calculating urban thermal environments. The ability of the software to predict local temperatures in urban environments is validated by comparing simulation results to temperatures collected in an actual urban environment. Following this validation, the same procedure is used to estimate local air temperatures in uniform neighborhoods of varying density. The findings indicate that rooftop air conditioners in urban areas can have a reduction in COP of up to twenty percent, compared to a corresponding rural area. Window air conditioners can have reductions in COP of over twelve percent, depending on placement.\t\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9708], "author_name_tesi": "Gracik, Stefan M", "last_name_ssi": "Gracik", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Stefan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["urban", "density", "cfd", "openfoam", "energyplus", "energy efficiency", "hvac", "outdoor cfd", "urban heat island"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Discipline of Genius: Nature, Freedom and the Emergence of the Idea of System in Kant's Critical Philosophy\n", "id": "8436", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3541", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this dissertation is to provide an account of the movement toward systematic unity in Kant\u2019s three Critiques by reading the discussion of artistic genius in the Critique of Judgment as a figure for the mediating power of the transcendental imagination.

While other directors of the genre tend to showcase a one-dimensional \u201cbrutal savage\u201d archetype (especially in the early sound era), Ford resisted this tendency in favor of multidimensional depictions. As a director, Ford was particularly opinionated about music and wielded ultimate control over the types of songs used in his films. The resulting artworks, visual and aural, were therefore the vision of one creator. To investigate the participation of music in Ford\u2019s approach, I have investigated three archetypal products of the Western\u2019s three early periods: The Iron Horse (1924), Stagecoach (1939), and The Searchers (1956).\n\tIn The Iron Horse, an Indian duality is visually present with the incorporation of friendly Pawnees and destructive Cheyennes. My recent recovery of the score, however, reveals a more complicated reading due to thematic borrowing that identifies white characters as the source of Indian aggression. Stagecoach builds upon this duality by adding a third morally ambiguous Indian character, Yakima. This addition and the links drawn musically between white and Indian societies challenge the traditional reading of Apache villainy. The Searchers fully integrates this concept of cultural parallels, resulting in a story centered on issues of tribe rather than race. The pairing of Anglo and Indian cultures that are fully realized both visually and aurally thereby deconstructs the concept of virtue determined by race alone. Ford\u2019s use of music brings to light his constantly evolving portrayal of Native Americans, allowing him to transcend the demeaning stereotypes of contemporaneous Westerns.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8315], "author_name_tesi": "Graff, Peter Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Graff", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Musicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Dowell Youmans"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Dowell Youmans, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["John Ford", "Musicology", "Race", "Westerns", "Iron Horse", "Stagecoach", "Searchers"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Molecular and isotopic indicators of canopy closure in ancient forests and the effects of environmental gradients on leaf alkane expression", "id": "22863", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9285", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dense forests with closed canopies are of enormous climatic and ecological significance. Three-dimensional forest structure affects surface albedo, atmospheric circulation, hydrologic cycling, soil stability, and the carbon cycle, both on the local and global scale. Increasingly, dense canopy forests are recognized for their role in plant and animal evolution and provide a great variety of microhabitats into which much of the diversity of animal and plant life has specialized. The geologic history of three dimensional forest structure is poorly known, however, because fossil assemblages seldom reflect tree spacing, size, or branching and adaptations specific to closed-canopy forests \u2013 such as large, fleshy fruits or branchless boles \u2013 rarely preserve. The best preserved and most abundant plant fossils are leaves and leaf fragments, however leaf morphology alone does not indicate canopy conditions. This study focuses on leaf biochemical signatures that have potential to record light environment, preserve in geologic archives, and ultimately serve as proxies of canopy density.\n\nDense, closed-canopy forests are defined by strong vertical light and humidity gradients, and a pronounced decrease in photosynthetic rate in the understory. This rate difference results in an enrichment in the carbon isotope composition of leaves (\u03b413Cleaf) at the top of the canopy relative to the lower levels. Our study found that leaves from a deeply-shaded closed-canopy forest in Panama had a ~10\u2030 vertical range in \u03b413Cleaf values, vertically, while leaves from a seasonal canopied forest in Maryland expressed only a ~6\u2030 range. A Monte Carlo model that resampled \u03b413Cleaf values indicated that canopy closure could be identified by isotopic range from a relatively small (~50) number of leaves. Based on this result, we used \u03b413Cleaf range as a diagnostic feature of canopy coverage and measured \u03b413Cleaf values of fossil leaves to identify canopy density characteristics of three ancient forests. Our results confirm the earliest closed-canopy Neotropical forest in a Paleocene fossil assemblage and identified open canopy features in a Cretaceous fossil assemblage and a forest edge in another Paleocene assemblage.\n\nIdentifying canopy closure in fossil leaves by analogy by isotopic leaf features observed in modern plants assumes that patterns of photosynthetic carbon isotope fractionation (\u2206leaf) are the same in ancient plants and their extant relatives. \u2206leaf values calculated for modern leaves had a wide range of values from canopy to understory. \u2206leaf values calculated from fossil leaf data indicated that the majority of leaves in the assemblages were from the upper canopy. A similar analysis of n-alkanes from modern found that modern leaves express a wide range of \u03b413Clipid values, in correlation with humidity, canopy height, and irradiance. \u03b413Clipid values from fossil leaves had smaller ranges than modern relatives but a mixing model that used the relative abundance of leaves in the assemblage and the fossil \u03b413Clipid data closely reproduced the chain-length distribution and \u03b413Clipid of alkanes from bulks sediments from the fossil assemblage. Calculated fractionation during lipid synthesis (\u03b5lipid) in fossil leaves was less negative than modern leaf values and may reflect drier climates or the bias in fossil leaf assemblages toward upper canopy leaves.\nThe amount of n-alkanes made by a leaf is greater in the understory than it is in the canopy. Understory leaves also have more depleted \u03b413Clipid values. Alkanes extracted from fossil leaves in the closed-canopy assemblage also exhibited depleted \u03b413Clipid values in leaves with higher alkane content. An analysis of the published literature found leaf higher angiosperms produce greater concentrations of leaf alkanes. The systematic increase in alkane production as well as the higher alkane amounts in understory leaves may be related to the enhanced fungal resistance proffered by alkanes that would be necessary in humid understories. Increased alkane production may then also be related to shade tolerance and early adaptation by higher angiosperms to closed-canopy conditions.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9091], "author_name_tesi": "Graham, Heather Valeah", "last_name_ssi": "Graham", "middle_name_ssi": "Valeah", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman", "Lee Kump", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY", "Peter Daniel Wilf", "Erica A H Smithwick", "Scott W Wing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman, Dissertation Advisor", "Lee Kump, Committee Member", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY, Committee Member", "Peter Daniel Wilf, Committee Member", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Member", "Scott W Wing, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["n-alkanes", "canopy", "isotope fractionation", "Cerrejon", "Guaduas"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Carotenoid biosynthesis in Synechococcus sp.

Synechoxanthin is a member of a family of ?,?-carotenes found in a variety of cyanobacteria. The discovery of these compounds demonstrates synthesis of aromatic carotenoids by cyanobacteria and provides the first instance of an organism capable of de novo synthesis of  ?,?-carotenes. The functions of the CrtH lycopene isomerase, CrtR C-3-?-hydroxylase, CrtW C-4-ketolase were evaluated and verified. Phylogenetic analysis was used to identify additional genes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in this organism. Among the new genes identified were cruA and cruP, which encode lycopene cyclases that belong to a new fourth family of lycopene cyclases and fill a major gap in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of cyanobacteria that lack the CrtL (plant-type) lycopene cyclases.  Two new genes were identified in the myxoxanthophyll pathway, cruF, cruG. CruF and CruG are respectively a 1\u2019-hydroxylase and 2\u2019-glycosyltransferase. Also two genes involved in the biosynthesis of synechoxanthin, cruE and cruH were characterized. CruE is a ?-ring desaturase/methyl transferase that forms aromatic ?-rings, CruH is a C-18-?-ring hydroxylase. Combined these constitute six of the now twelve known carotenoid specific biosynthetic enzymes in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. These findings shed light on the synthesis of cyclic carotenoids and xanthophylls in cyanobacteria, and on the biosynthesis of carotenoids in general. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2649], "author_name_tesi": "Graham, Joel Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Graham", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Joel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Ashley Bryant", "John H Golbeck", "James Gregory Ferry", "Kathleen Postle", "Juliette Lecomte"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Ashley Bryant, Committee Chair", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member", "James Gregory Ferry, Committee Member", "Kathleen Postle, Committee Member", "Juliette Lecomte, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aromatic carotenoids", "carotenoids", "carotenes", "myxoxanthophyll", "lycopene cyclase", "synechoxanthin", "carotenoid biosynthesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Quantum Monte Carlo Studies of Strongly Correlated Two-Dimensional Electron Systems\n", "id": "6661", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3464", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Strongly interacting electron systems, where the interaction between electrons can- \nnot be ignored or treated perturbatively, are among the most complicated systems \nfound in nature.

Accurately segmented airways are particularly important for image-based bronchoscopic guidance. Here, the segmented airways provide a patient-specific 3D airway model, which is used to  generate Virtual Bronchoscopic (VB) images simulating the view of a real bronchoscope inside the patient's airways. The VB views are compared with the live bronchoscopic video to lead the bronchoscopist to a predetermined airway site, where a diagnostic tissue sample is taken. VB guidance has a demonstrated potential for improving the diagnostic utility of bronchoscopy, especially for peripheral sites located many generations deep into the airway tree. Existing segmentation methods are insufficient for peripheral VB guidance, however, as they frequently fail to segment small peripheral airways with weak image signatures. \n\nThis thesis proposes a novel automatic airway-segmentation algorithm, which searches the entire lung volume for airway branch signals and poses segmentation as a global graph-theoretic optimization problem. The algorithm is extensively  validated on scans of both healthy and diseased airways obtained from several different sources. In particular, comparisons with ground-truth airway segmentations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm extracts substantially more peripheral airways than existing methods while producing very few false-positive branches. The automatic algorithm is combined with a suite of interactive tools for cleaning and extending critical local areas of the airway tree to form a complete computer-based segmentation system. We present results from a clinical pilot study validating the utility of the full segmentation system. During this study, airway-tree segmentations produced by the proposed system were used to help plan and guide live peripheral bronchoscopic surgery in humans. The successful outcome of the pilot study was due, in large part, to the representational accuracy of patient-specific 3D airway models derived from segmented airways produced by the proposed system.\n\nThis thesis also addresses the problem of matching pairs of anatomical trees depicted in two different high-resolution 3D images. Three basic steps are used to match the trees: (1) image segmentation, to extract the raw trees from the 3D image data; (2) axial-analysis, to define the underlying centerline structure of the trees; and (3) tree matching, to determine corresponding branches and branchpoints between the centerline structures of the trees. This thesis focuses on step (3). The matching task is complicated by\nseveral problems associated with current segmentation and axial-analysis methods, including missing branches, false branches, and other topological errors in the extracted trees. A model-based approach is proposed in which the input trees are assumed to arise from an initially unknown common tree corrupted by a sequence of\ntopological deformations. A set of valid matches consistent with this model is constructed and the optimal match is defined to be the valid match that maximizes a similarity measure. We derive and\nanalyze a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that efficiently locates a globally-optimal match. The proposed algorithm is validated by comparing automatically-generated matches with ground-truth hand-generated matches. In particular, the proposed algorithm is shown to increase an important measure of matching accuracy from the 57\\% achieved by the best existing method to more\nthan 96\\% for human airway-tree data. Finally, the proposed tree-matching methodology is shown to be useful in automatically labeling human airway-tree anatomy.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4430], "author_name_tesi": "Graham, Michael William", "last_name_ssi": "Graham", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Evan Higgins", "David Jonathan Miller", "Nirmal K Bose", "Robert T Collins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Evan Higgins, Committee Chair", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Member", "Nirmal K Bose, Committee Member", "Robert T Collins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["medical imaging", "image segmentation", "image-guided therapy", "tree matching"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Genomic Instability-Indicated Mechanisms of Early Carcinogenesis Following Hepatocarcinogen Treatment\n", "id": "8935", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5612", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Carcinogenicity testing is perhaps one of the most challenging aspects in drug development.  Carcinogenicity tests not only provide the basis for human risk assessment and regulatory policy on synthetic drugs, but also for all compounds, including \u201cnatural\u201d compounds, that are carcinogenic. Current assays, both in vitro and in vivo, rely on the induction of tumors or the detection of DNA-based mutational events (such as the Ames test) to indicate the potential for the studied agent to cause cancer. These studies are often used in conjunction with one another to assess carcinogenicity of a particular compound. While providing a certain level of support for the carcinogenic potential of compounds, these studies prove inadequate for the assessment of non-mutagenic carcinogens and provide little to no data as to a compounds mechanism(s) of action.\nRegions of repetitive DNA sequence, known as microsatellites, and are particularly prone to genetic alteration, can serve as indicators of genomic instability, which has been implicated in the process of tumorigenesis. Recent studies of the sequenced genome have found many microsatellites in regions of DNA that do not directly code for proteins. Often they are found in untranslated regions (UTRs), namely the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 UTRs, which surround protein-coding sequences and convey regulatory function, but microsatellites have also been found within introns.

Assessment of the effects of compounds on these microsatellite regions may provide a better understanding about the underlying mechanistic process of carcinogenesis. \nIn this dissertation, I present the development of a novel dual-reporter model system aimed at detecting early genomic instability, using frameshift-prone microsatellites as indicators, to locate cells that are targets of non-mutagenic carcinogens.

They are\ncritical in tissue generation and homeostasis as well as for initiating innate and adaptive\nimmune responses. The importance of these cells is exemplified by the inability of mice\nto survive in the absence of both DC and macrophages.\n\nThe role of mononuclear phagocyte migration, particularly DC migration, to\ninitiate an immune response to a peripheral virus infection was previously unclear. We\nexamined the generation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (TCD8+) after immunization\nwith recombinant adenoviruses (rAd) that express antigen driven by skin-specific or\nubiquitous promoters. Following immunization with rAd expressing antigen only in the\nskin, DC show a brief migratory burst, lasting approximately 1-2 days. This lack of\nsustained DC migration limits the effector TCD8+ response, preventing the complete\nkilling of peptide pulsed cells. This is the first time a functional consequence is shown\ndue to a lack of DC migration.\n\nDC, in addition to being critical players in initiating the immune response to a\nperipheral virus infection, are also critical in extending antigen presentation to TCD8+ for\n40+ days following immunization with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVACV). The\npersistence of antigen presentation consists of 3 distinct phases. The first phase of\nantigen presentation persistence encompasses 12-14 days of ongoing virus replication.\nThe second phase, which is approximately 2 weeks, reflects the lifespan of virally\ninfected cells.

Experiments examined the effects of elevated carbon dioxide and drought during seed maturation on wild oat fecundity and seed quality (as measured by chemical composition, dormancy levels, and resistance to microbial decay and aging). It was hypothesized that elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide would mitigate drought-induced reductions in seed quality, increasing seed size and production, enhancing dormancy levels and conferring greater resistance to microbial attack and age-related deterioration.  A related goal was to determine the accuracy and specificity of spectrophotometric methods of determining phenolic concentrations, by comparison to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. It was hypothesized that the spectrophotometric assays would be less accurate in quantifying total phenolic concentration, depending on the specificity of the reagents.  In addition, it was hypothesized that the different extraction procedures used in conjunction with the spectrophotometric assays would lead to differential extraction and measurement of phenolic compounds.  For the methods comparison experiment, it was found that the spectrophotometric methods significantly overestimated phenolic concentrations compared with GC-MS analysis, with concentrations that were 0.005- 12% of the totals indicated by GC-MS.  In addition, the simpler extraction procedures recommended for the spectrophotometric analysis did not extract bound compounds, thereby missing a major portion (up to 98%) of the phenolic constituents.  Therefore, it was determined that GC-MS analysis and extraction of the bound phenolics was appropriate in order to study the chemical composition of seeds.  Analysis of the organic acid constituents of wild oat revealed that elevated carbon dioxide appeared to affect the concentrations of phenolic, aliphatic and long-chain fatty acids in the 2009 SH430 line, but drought and carbon dioxide appeared to have little affect on concentrations in the 2010 experiment. As expected, carbon dioxide did mitigate the effects of drought on reproductive output and dormancy to some extent, causing a 49% increase in seed biomass per plant regardless of drought treatment and increasing the percentage of dormant seeds by 10% after 12 weeks of after-ripening.  Contrary to the hypothesis, however, drought and elevated carbon dioxide did not appear to affect seedling vigor or susceptibility to aging.  Aging had a consistent impact on seedling vigor and resistance to microbial decay, increasing the number of days to emergence, decreasing seedling biomass per treatment, and enhancing microbial decay (up to 118%).  The results of these experiments show that elevated carbon dioxide and drought can have significant effects on seed quality characteristics and that future climatic conditions could allow weedy and invasive species to produce greater numbers of more dormant seeds, establishing more persistent seedbanks that could pose management issues for farmers.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7116], "author_name_tesi": "Granger, Kristen Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Granger", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Kristen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Paul Gallagher Iii", "Robert Paul Gallagher Iii", "Dawn S Luthe", "Jonathan Paul Lynch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Paul Gallagher Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Paul Gallagher Iii, Committee Chair", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["seed persistence", "dormancy", "microbial decay resistance", "seed aging", "climate change"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Dualities in Igor Stravinsky's Compositional Process as seen in \"The Nightingale\" (1908-1914) ", "id": "11933", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "25", "abstract_tesi": "Igor Stravinsky\u2019s opera The Nightingale (1908-1914), based on a fairy tale by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875), provides a unique example of the composer\u2019s evolving compositional process. Stravinsky finished the opera\u2019s first act in 1908, but the commission of The Firebird (1910) delayed The Nightingale\u2019s completion. Not until 1914, after the premiere of The Rite of Spring (1913), did Stravinsky complete his opera. The Nightingale is significant because in the opera Stravinsky attempted to find his own voice while striving to abandon the influences of Romanticism. With the exception of Richard Taruskin\u2019s analysis of selected musical sketches, the work has received limited in-depth scholarly attention. This may be due to the juxtaposition of Romantic and Modernist styles within the opera, resulting from the period of time separating the completion of the last two acts (1913-1914) from the first (1908). However, that abeyance in Stravinsky\u2019s compositional process provides an opportunity to observe, in a single work, Stravinsky\u2019s transition from Romanticism to Modernism.\n\n    This thesis provides an analysis of The Nightingale that examines passages that illustrate the duality between Stravinsky\u2019s compositional styles, such as the contrast between the Real and Mechanical Nightingales.

Although cognitive control has been acknowledged as an important component of language processing for many years, its conception in the language literature was largely as a top-down mechanism of inhibition. In two experiments I explore the role of a complementary type of cognitive control, bottom-up control, and how second language proficiency modulates its use. \nExperiment 1, a functional MRI study, investigated the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal correlates of bottom-up and top-down non-linguistic control, as well as semantic processing in the L1 and L2 by Spanish learners varying in proficiency. I found that high proficiency learners showed less activation in the caudate nucleus (CN), a crucial component of the top-down control network, and increased activation in the cerebellum and superior temporal gyrus, two areas associated with bottom-up control. I additionally observed that the multivariate activity patterns in regions associated with top-down control (including the CN and prefrontal cortex) were more similar in high proficiency learners, and that the connectivity between these regions was more efficient than in low proficiency learners. \nExperiment 2 considered how training on top-down and bottom-up control could affect acquisition of new foreign language vocabulary, and found that top-down control training significantly speeded responses compared to bottom-up training and a sham condition. Together, these experiments suggest that low proficiency learners rely more on top-down control during L2 processing, while high proficiency learners may transition to a more bottom-up control process mediated by more posterior regions associated with cue detection and selective attention. These findings provide empirical support for the relevance of the conceptual distinction between top-down and bottom-up control to language learning. Furthermore, applying this distinction allows for the reconciliation of current theories of language learning, which differ in their predictions concerning the role of proficiency in how language learners use cognitive control.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13892], "author_name_tesi": "Grant, Angela Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Grant", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Angela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ping Li", "Ping Li", "Janet Van Hell", "Nancy Dennis", "Carrie Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ping Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Ping Li, Committee Chair", "Janet Van Hell, Committee Member", "Nancy Dennis, Committee Member", "Carrie Jackson, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["language learning", "cognitive control", "inhibitory control", "language training", "control training"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Mercury bioaccumulation in aquatic ecosystems of forested streams in Pennsylvania", "id": "14510", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7094", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mercury (Hg) is a persistent element in the environment that has the ability to accumulate in organisms (e.g., plants, fish) and to biomagnify across trophic levels of food chains, with potentially harmful effects for human health and ecosystems.  In this study, Hg was characterized in aquatic ecosystems of 36 streams across Pennsylvania.  The streams are located in predominantly forested watersheds, within varying climatic and physiographic settings.  The status of Hg in streams was characterized by sampling several different types of media:  stream water, stream bed sediments, and submerged aquatic mosses (Fontinalis spp.) (in all 36 streams), and tissues of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) (in seven of the streams).  \nDetectable levels of Hg were found in all media sampled, and concentrations of mercury increased among compartments (stream water<< stream sediments < brook trout < aquatic mosses).  Concentrations of Hg in media were generally low and did not exceed guidelines for human consumption.  Stream water samples from all 36 streams were lower than the safe drinking water maximum contaminant level for Hg of 0.002 mg/L Hg as set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).  Further, fish tissues from the 7 streams where brook trout were sampled did not exceed the fish consumption advisory limit of 0.3 \u00b5g/g Hg as set by USEPA.  However, samples from six streams exceeded wildlife consumption advisory guidelines for Hg concentrations, in varying media.  In particular, three streams had Hg concentration levels in brook trout above the US Fish and Wildlife Service fish-eating bird and wildlife advisory of 0.10 \u00b5g/g wet weight, one stream had Hg levels in sediment above a Threshold Effect Concentration (TEC) level of 180ng/g, and two streams had Hg in stream water above US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s fish-eating wildlife level of 1.3ng/L.  \nUsing exploratory statistical analyses, wet atmospheric deposition of Hg, watershed elevation, watershed size, percent of watershed forested, quantity and quality of dissolved organic carbon, and percent organic matter in sediments were found to be significantly correlated with Hg concentration in at least one media (p<0.01).  Additionally, mercury concentrations in aquatic mosses were found to be highly correlated (Sr = 0.84, p < 0.01) with mercury in biopsies of brook trout muscle tissues, suggesting that aquatic mosses could be used as a proxy for Hg concentration in brook trout.  The use of aquatic mosses as indicators of Hg levels in brook trout is a novel finding of great utility because mosses are relatively easy and inexpensive to sample, and no fish need to be sampled, which is particularly important for small populations of brook trout.\nA large range of Hg concentrations were observed in all media among streams across the state, reflecting heterogeneity of environmental conditions and regional differences.  Importantly, variations of Hg concentrations were also observed within streams, in the multiple samples of sediments and brook trout that were collected in each reach.  A statistical analysis of these field replicate samples showed that as sample size increases, variability in the prediction of mean Hg concentration decreases.  This finding has implications for policy and management, and recommendations are made about adequate sample sizes with regard to assessing Hg accumulation in aquatic ecosystems. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7085], "author_name_tesi": "Grant, Christopher James", "last_name_ssi": "Grant", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Weeks Boyer", "David Russell Dewalle", "C Paola Ferreri", "Andrew Cole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Weeks Boyer, Dissertation Advisor", "David Russell Dewalle, Committee Member", "C Paola Ferreri, Committee Member", "Andrew Cole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mercury", "bioaccumulation", "bioconcentration", "fish", "brook trout", "aquatic mosses", "bed sediments", "stream water", "aquatic ecosystems"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Improving Nitrogen Management in Agriculture: Opportunities Gleaned from Organic Systems\n", "id": "26445", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11543", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Achieving sustainable intensification goals for agriculture hinges on two essential and seemingly contradictory improvements in nitrogen (N) management: reducing N losses while increasing crop productivity. Conventional agricultural systems have attained prolific productivity, built upon tremendous inputs of inorganic N fertilizer. But, these production increases have largely stalled, and much of the N fertilizer used to achieve these yields escapes, polluting air and water. Organic agriculture takes a different approach to N management and productivity. Built on the philosophical foundation of systemic design, organic agriculture aims to use biological processes to provide N and other services necessary to support crop productivity. This organic approach results in systems with a fundamentally different structure than their conventional counterparts. In organic systems, these contrasting structural elements include: perennials, rotation diversity/complexity, legumes, and manure; which we hypothesized impart improvements in N retention and/or provisioning. Goals of this research were to: (1) determine whether annual or perennial forage systems better mitigated potential greenhouse gas (GHG) losses related to grazing and extreme rainfall events, (2) assess efficacy of alternative organic N management strategies in providing inorganic N and supporting forage yields, (3) evaluate the availability of organic N in soils of organic systems and to the crop species grown in them. I relied on a 2012-2014 organic forage systems experiment to characterize effects of N management practices employed in these systems in terms of the N they provided in the soil during the growing season (soil NH4+, NO3-, amino acids and other free primary amines), as well as the N that escaped (N2O losses, NH3 volatization, NO3- leaching). While N management in both conventional and organic agriculture aims to provide N in inorganic forms, emerging evidence suggests organic forms of N may also be plant-available, however quantifying the contribution of N compounds, especially organic ones, to plant N nutrition is methodologically challenging. I used a large greenhouse experiment to indirectly test the ability of 3 N environments to support growth of four forage crop species, and then directly test the capacity of plants from each of these 12 growth phase treatments to take up labeled forms of inorganic N and amino acids using 2 alternative tracer methodologies. I found perennial organic forage systems exhibit multiple N management benefits over annual systems: lower N2O fluxes, lower soil NO3- leaching, and greater inorganic N use efficiency, although annual systems exhibited higher absolute yields. Among annual organic systems, those that relied on a legume N provisioning strategy, rather than a manure N provisioning strategy, displayed superior inorganic and organic N availability and yields. All forage species demonstrated amino acid N uptake abilities that increased when the plants were grown in the presence of amino acids. Thus, the greater use of perennial and legume crops may increase amino acid N availability and facilitate direct crop plant utilization of this previously unrecognized soil N resource, reducing N losses while maintaining or increasing crop productivity.

While the Edge 540 and Extra 300 were flown during first years of the competition, several pilots moved to the MXS-R as the competition progressed. The 2016 season opened with two pilots flying the MXS-R and twelve pilots flying two versions of the Edge 540. However, all of these airplanes are being used for an off-design purpose, allowing for improvements to be made. Several teams had made attempts to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of their airplane, as both of the MXS-R and two of the Edge 540 airplanes have been equipped with winglets.\nAs previous design work on the MXS-R has been conducted and is available for reference, this airplane serves as the base for this body of work. Several notable design changes on the MXS-R are investigated for their effect on flight performance. These alterations include: the addition of winglets to the airframe and changing the wing airfoil to an NACA 6-series laminar flow airfoil. For the former, the CG location is also examined for potential gains.\nThe design changes are analyzed for aerodynamic efficiency, quantified with the airplanes\u2019 lift-to-drag ratio. Winglets contribute to a significant drag reduction over the production MXS-R, as the maximum lift-to-drag ratio increases by 7.66%. By changing to a laminar flow airfoil, further gains can be made in drag reduction, particularly at high speeds. At the entry speed of 200 knots, the NACA 63(3)-012 and NACA 64A-012 yield increases of 9.91% and 9.04% in lift-to-drag ratio, respectively. Additionally, the aft-most CG location leads to the greatest gains for the MXS-R.\nAn optimized flight path is found to give the quickest flight time through a course for each airplane configuration, allowing for a quantitative analysis of the designs. The Dallas - Fort Worth course from the 2014 Championship season is used for this purpose. The production MXS-R posts a time of 56.67 seconds, the slowest when compared to the altered designs. The MXS-R with winglets is slightly faster with a time of 56.25 seconds, while the NACA 63(3)-012 and NACA 64A-012 airfoils stop the\niv\nclock at 55.32 seconds and 55.44 seconds, respectively.

Anthropogenic disturbance and natural stressors in the environment influence how fish behave on a daily basis. Changes in the brain can help fish adjust their behavior and so cope with stressors in the environment. The way that fish respond to stressors, however, is a dynamic process and there are multiple mechanisms that can lead to changes in physiology, neuromodulation and behavior. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of how different environmental stressors affect fish is needed if we are to make informed management decisions for both captive and wild populations.  \nThe research described in this dissertation has used a comparative approach to investigate various types of stressors and how they affect the relationship between brain and behavior in different species of fish. The first study explored the effects of a natural stressor, predation pressure, on the learning ability of the Panamanian bishop (Brachyrhaphis episcopi). Cognitive ability of Panamanian bishops on a maze task has previously been shown to vary with respect to predation pressure; fish exposed to low predation were faster and more accurate at learning the location of a foraging patch than fish exposed to high predation. The areas of the brain involved in spatial learning and processing emotions such as fear are located in the telencephalon (the forebrain) of teleost fish. Thus a link between spatial learning and emotion, such as fear of predators, could be expected. Associative learning where much simpler relationships are acquired through conditioning, however, occurs in the cerebellum (the hindbrain) and thus may not be under the same influences that affect spatial learning. Temperament, on the other hand, is known to influence general aspects of learning ability, such that some individuals learn faster and retain information for longer than others regardless of their experience. Thus, the effect of temperament on conditioning ability of the Panamanian bishop was also investigated.\nWithin a single population of Panamanian bishops there were differences in learning on a simple conditioning task; bolder individuals that explored more were faster to associate a light cue with a food reward (movement rate, lines/min; P < 0.001, R2 = 0.36, b1 = -0.20). The difference in learning was attributed to the fact that bolder individuals are more willing to take risks in novel situations. Across different Panamanian bishop populations, there were differences in conditioning ability; fish from low predation sites conditioned faster than high predation sites (P < 0.001; number of trials to condition: high predation = 18.85 \u00b1 1.08, low predation = 13.12 \u00b1 0.89) and there were differences between rivers (River Limbo fish were faster than River Quebrada Juan Grande fish). Thus, it is possible that predation pressure drives cognitive differences in tasks that are controlled by the forebrain (spatial learning) and by the hindbrain (delay conditioning). However, a number of alternative explanations also exist for the observed differences in conditioning ability such as behavioral flexibility, sensitivity to stress, habitat differences and temperament. Further research into conditioning ability of the Panamanian bishop is required to identify what underpins the observed behavioral differences.\nThe second study extended the research to a more applied setting and investigated the effects of environmental stress on a common aquaculture species, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Acid rain is caused by the mixing of harmful gases that have been released from industry with moisture in the air but when this acidified water percolates through the soil it can lead to the release of aluminum (Al) into aquatic habitats. Al toxicity has negative effects on the physiology of Atlantic salmon; the metal interferes with the normal osmoregulatory function of the gills. However, the effects of acidic water and Al toxicity on the neurobiology and behavior of Atlantic salmon have been less well studied. \nIn the current study, fish exposed to Al toxicity had increased Al accumulation on their gills and decreased Na+, K+-ATPase activity, an enzyme that is fundamental for proper osmoregulatory functioning of the gills and for somltification. Al exposed fish also showed signs of physiological stress, through increased cortisol and glucose levels. Moreover, when challenged in a learning task, Al exposed fish performed less well than control fish indicating that their cognition was impaired (P = 0.04; number of mistakes: acid-Al = 3.58 \u00b1 0.25, control = 2.87 \u00b1 0.24). This result was further supported by a decrease in NeuroD1 expression (needed for the differentiation of neurons) in the forebrains of Al exposed fish. Together these data show that exposure to acidic conditions and Al toxicity not only has a negative effect on the physiology of Atlantic salmon but it can also reduce neural plasticity and impair learning ability. \nThe final project investigated the effects of handling and housing conditions on the development of behavior and neural plasticity on a common laboratory species, the zebrafish (Danio rerio). The use of enrichment in captive environments is known to increase animal sensory and motor stimulation and also promotes the development of behavioral flexibility and neurogenesis. Information about the effect of housing conditions on brain development in laboratory fish is valuable for helping to improve husbandry procedures, but could also inform us about the cognitive capacities of fish reared in captivity. Thus, the effects of enrichment and mild repeated stress were investigated to determine whether these influenced the development of anxiety behavior, learning ability and the relative size of the telencephalon in zebrafish.\nIn a controlled setting, zebrafish exposed to a combination of both enrichment and mild handling stress exhibited decreased anxiety behavior and performed better in a spatial learning task. Using MRI and reconstructing a three dimensional image of the brain revealed that fish housed with enrichment but not exposed to daily stress had larger whole brain volumes (approximately 2-3% larger) compared to fish from other treatments. Thus, mild repeated stress seems to be playing a positive and negative role in the interaction between brain and behavior in zebrafish. Further research is needed to determine whether different sensory and motor cues lead to changes in other brain structures that were not measured, such as the cerebellum or optic tectum. \nBringing together all three biological systems, it can be seen that the physiological responses to stress that lead to changes in the brain and behavior are complex, and are dependent on a number of factors such as the type and magnitude of stress as well as the life history of the particular species involved. The comparative approach allows us to bridge the gap between brain and behavior research in fish, but the work presented here needs to be extended to other fish species and applied to other biological systems. In this way, we will be able to see how different stressors impact wild and captive fish species under a suite of different conditions, which will help towards implementing better management strategies for these fish in the future. \n \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8186], "author_name_tesi": "Grassie, Oonagh C", "last_name_ssi": "Grassie", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Oonagh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read", "C Paola Ferreri", "Tyler Wagner", "Tracy Lee Langkilde"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read, Dissertation Advisor", "C Paola Ferreri, Committee Member", "Tyler Wagner, Committee Member", "Tracy Lee Langkilde, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["animal behavior", "spatial learning", "brain plasticity", "behavioral ecology", "environmental enrichment"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Role of Governmental Organizational Form in Economic Growth\n\n", "id": "7335", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2046", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the economic growth literature there have been numerous theoretical and empirical studies that examined a multitude of potential factors and policies affecting economic growth, primarily public policies such as infrastructure, education, and taxes.  While we have some understanding of how these public policies affect economic growth prospects, we do not have a solid understanding of how different governmental organizational forms affect public policies and, ultimately, economic growth in the long run.  The philosophical debate on how to best organize government units to encourage economic growth, a centralized versus a decentralized form of government, is long standing.  More recently, the debate over the benefits and costs of a fragmented system of government has re-ignited this historical debate.  While there have been great theoretical arguments both in favor of and against government fragmentation, there have been no real sophisticated empirical tests on the effects of different governmental organizational forms on economic growth.  This dissertation seeks to address this shortcoming.  In particular, this dissertation seeks to provide answers on whether a governmental organizational form encouraging competition among government units is beneficial or detrimental to economic growth.  In order to accurately measure the multifaceted aspects of governmental organizational form a series of fragmentation indexes proposed and advanced in the literature are tested and expanded upon in a Carlino-Mills model on county economic growth over the period from 1992 to 2002.  To accomplish this task, data from the Census of Government was used to extract and identify state and local government expenditures and revenues to create fragmentation indexes at the county and state level.  How governmental organizational form is measured specifically has been shown to affect the regression results.  State organizational form has greater implications for economic growth than organizational form at the county level, but the interaction between state and county government units is shown to be the most significant.  Government units per capita, a common measure of government fragmentation, can bias the results in favor of more consolidation.  The results from the dissertation do not provide any support to the contention that government fragmentation is harmful to the economic growth prospects.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2028], "author_name_tesi": "Grassmueck, Georg Gunter", "last_name_ssi": "Grassmueck", "middle_name_ssi": "Gunter", "first_name_ssi": "Georg", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Michael Smith", "Dr Martin Shields", "Stephan J Goetz", "Timothy Wayne Kelsey", "Dr Amy Glasmeier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Michael Smith, Committee Chair", "Dr Martin Shields, Committee Member", "Stephan J Goetz, Committee Member", "Timothy Wayne Kelsey, Committee Member", "Dr Amy Glasmeier, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Reegional Economics", "Economic Growth", "Government Fragmentation", "Government Consolidation", "Competition", "Decentralization"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Modeling Radiation from the Atmosphere of Io with Monte Carlo Methods", "id": "9888", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5661", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conflicting observations regarding the dominance of either sublimation or volcanism as the source of the atmosphere on Io and disparate reports on the extent of its spatial distribution and the absolute column abundance invite the development of detailed computational models capable of improving our understanding of Io's unique atmospheric structure and origin. To validate a global numerical model of Io's atmosphere against astronomical observations requires a 3-D spherical-shell radiative transfer (RT) code to simulate disk-resolved images and disk-integrated spectra from the ultraviolet to the infrared spectral region. In addition, comparison of simulated and astronomical observations provides important information to improve existing atmospheric models.\n\nIn order to achieve this goal, a new 3-D spherical-shell forward/backward photon Monte Carlo code capable of simulating radiation from absorbing/emitting and scattering atmospheres with an underlying emitting and reflecting surface was developed. A new implementation of calculating atmospheric brightness in scattered sunlight is presented utilizing the notion of an ``effective emission source' function.  This allows for the accumulation of the scattered contribution along the entire path of a ray and the calculation of the atmospheric radiation when both scattered sunlight and thermal emission contribute to the observed radiation \u2013- which was not possible in previous models. A ``polychromatic' algorithm was developed for application with the backward Monte Carlo method and was implemented in the code. It allows one to calculate radiative intensity at several wavelengths simultaneously, even when the scattering properties of the atmosphere are a function of wavelength. The application of the ``polychromatic' method improves the computational efficiency because it reduces the number of photon bundles traced during the simulation.\n\nA 3-D gas dynamics model of Io's atmosphere, including both sublimation and volcanic sources of SO$_2$ gas, is analyzed by simulating spectra and images from the model corresponding to three important  observations: 1) simulations of the mid-IR disk-averaged observations of Io's sunlit hemisphere at 19 $mu$m, obtained with TEXES during 2001-2004; 2) simulations of disk-resolved images at Lyman-$alpha$ (1216 AA~or 0.1216 $mu$m) obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) during 1997-2001; and 3) disk-integrated simulations of emission line profiles in the millimeter wavelength range (1.2--1.4 mm) obtained with the IRAM-30 m telescope in Oct.-Nov. 1999.\n\nWe found that our atmospheric model generally reproduces the longitudinal variation in the strength of absorption band from the mid-IR data; however, the best match is obtained when the simulation results are shifted $sim 30^{circ}$ toward lower longitudes. The simulations of Lyman-$alpha$ images do not show the mid-to-high latitude bright patches seen in the observations, suggesting that the model atmosphere predicts column number densities that are too high at those latitudes. The simulations of emission line profiles in the millimeter spectral region support the hypothesis that the atmospheric dynamics favorably explain the observed line widths, which are too wide to be formed by Doppler broadening alone.\n\nThe computational modeling and simulation tools needed to study light scattering from volcanic plumes, which play a significant role in structuring the atmosphere on Io, is developed. The radiative transfer code is applied to the simulation of the brightness in scattered sunlight from a Prometheus-type plume on Io, as observed in limb-viewing geometry by the \textit{Galileo} Solid State Imager (SSI). The computations are performed utilizing the ``polychromatic' method, thus calculating the plume brightness for the entire filter bandpass in a single simulation. Such simulations account for multiple scattering and reflection of sunlight from the surface, not included in previous studies, and may serve as a powerful tool for simulating the plume observations necessary to understand the extent and composition of the plume atmospheres on Io.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5658], "author_name_tesi": "Gratiy, Sergey ", "last_name_ssi": "Gratiy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sergey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Deborah A Levin", "Deborah A Levin", "Robert Graham Melton", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux", "Michael F Modest", "David B Goldstein"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Deborah A Levin, Dissertation Advisor", "Deborah A Levin, Committee Chair", "Robert Graham Melton, Committee Member", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Committee Member", "Michael F Modest, Committee Member", "David B Goldstein, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Io", "radiative transfer", "spherical-shell atmospheres", "atmospheric dynamics", "spherical shell atmosphere"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Process-Structure-Property Relationships of Micron Thick Gadolinium Oxide Films Deposited by Reactive Electron Beam-Physical Vapor Deposition (EB-PVD)", "id": "23428", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10559", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) is an attractive material for solid state neutron detection due to gadolinium's high thermal neutron capture cross section.  Development of neutron detectors based on Gd2O3 requires sufficiently thick films to ensure neutron absorption.  In this dissertation work, the process-structure-property relationships of micron thick Gd2O3 films deposited by reactive electron-beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) were studied.   Through a systematic design of experiments, fundamental studies were conducted to determine the effects of processing conditions such as deposition temperature, oxygen flow rate, deposition rate, and substrate material on Gd2O3 film crystallographic phase, texture, morphology, grain size, density, and surface roughness.  Films deposited at high rates (> 5 \u00c5 / s) were examined via x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy.  Quantitative phase volume calculations were performed via a Rietveld refinement technique.  All films deposited at high rates were found to be fully monoclinic or mixed cubic / monoclinic phase.  Generally, increased deposition temperature and increased oxygen flow resulted in increased cubic phase volume.  As film thickness increased, monoclinic phase volume increased.  Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) depth profiling analysis showed that cubic phase was only present under large incidence angle (large penetration depth) measurements, and after a certain point, only monoclinic phase was grown.  This was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis with selected area diffraction (SAD).  \nDeposition of a pure cubic phase film was possible at high deposition rates for film thickness less than 50 nm under a deposition temperature of 250 \u00b0C and 200 sccm O2 flow. However, this film was shown to be under significant compressive stress of 1.7 GPa by XRD residual stress measurements.  Thick (1 \u03bcm) pure cubic phase films were deposited by lowering the deposition rate to < 1 \u00c5 / s, and increasing the deposition temperature to 650 \u00b0C.  This was attributed to both increased adatom mobility as well as reduction in compressive stress as measured by the wafer curvature technique. \nBased on this information, a large compressive stress was hypothesized to cause the formation of the monoclinic phase and this hypothesis was confirmed by demonstrating the existence of a stress induced phase transition.  An experiment was designed to introduce compressive stress into the Gd2O3 films via ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD).  This allowed for systematic increase in compressive stress while keeping a large adatom diffusion length on the film surface.  It was shown that the films could be completely transformed from the cubic to monoclinic phase with applied compressive stress of -777 MPa for the deposition conditions considered, confirming the existence of a stress-induced phase transition.  \nCrystallographic texture evolution in the Gd2O3 films was investigated for different substrate types.  At high rates, it was shown that films deposited on different substrates (quartz, silicon, sapphire, and GaN) all had similar \u03b8-2\u03b8 diffraction patterns, suggesting that films grew similarly on different substrates due to the low adatom mobility.  However, significant differences in texture were observed for films deposited at low rates (< 1 \u00c5 / s) and high temperature (650 \u00b0C) on different substrates. For evaluation of in-plane texture in the Gd2O3 films, pole figure analysis was performed.  Mixed phase films deposited at high rates and low temperature showed weak out-of-plane texture and random in-plane texture.  Mixed phase films deposited at high temperatures possessed a fiber texture (strong out-of-plane texture), but lacked the necessary adatom mobility to develop in-plane texture. For single phase cubic films grown under low rates of deposition, out-of-plane texture was observed on quartz substrates.  However, weak and strong in-plane textures were observed for sapphire and GaN substrates, respectively.  The use of ion bombardment resulted in the formation of moderate biaxial texture for films grown on quartz. For films grown on sapphire, a very strong biaxial texture was achieved with ion bombardment which adds additional energy to the system. \n The effects of processing on the structure, composition, and interfacial chemistry of the Gd2O3 films were investigated.  The results showed that films primarily adhered to the Structure-Zone models with a few exceptions. The deviation from the Structure-Zone model was explained by the combined effects of columnar growth, shadowing, and adatom mobility. At low deposition temperatures, decreasing oxygen flow resulted in increased film density due to higher adatom mobility. Films deposited at this temperature were characterized by small (10 \u2013 15 nm) nanocrystalline grains with some porous disordered regions.  As the deposition temperature was raised to 650 \u00b0C, a dense nucleation region was observed and the films were highly crystalline with larger grain size.  After the approximately 200 nm dense nucleation region, columnar growth was observed as the film grew thicker.  Porosity formed between the growing columns due to shadowing effects.  The effects of processing on the interfacial layer size of Gd2O3 films deposited on silicon were investigated.  The size and structure of the interfacial layer was dependent upon the deposition conditions. Generally, higher oxygen flow and higher deposition temperature led to larger interfacial layer size and a more undulating interface.  The interfacial reaction was determined to proceed as a result of intermixing of the SiOx layer with the Gd2O3 layer to form the Gd-Si-O interface during deposition.   Films deposited on GaN possessed excellent interfacial characteristics with near heteroepitaxial growth and no apparent interfacial layer.  Ion beam assisted deposition was shown to result in significant densification of the film structure and elimination of the columnar morphology.  Lastly, the O : Gd ratio of the Gd2O3 films was investigated using EDS and XPS, and showed that the processing conditions had significant effects on the film composition. Increasing temperature was found to decrease the O : Gd ratio.  Increasing oxygen flow was found to increase the O : Gd ratio for films deposited at low temperatures, but had little effect for films deposited at high temperature due to the fact that adatom mobility was significantly more affected by oxygen flow at lower temperatures.\nThe dielectric properties of Si(111) / Gd2O3 / Ti / Au MOS capacitors were investigated.  Moisture absorption in Gd2O3 films was found to result in both increased dielectric loss (10x) and inflated dielectric constant values (~40 %).  Heat treatment of the films at 100 \u00b0C resulted in outgassing of moisture, reduction in dielectric constant, and excellent frequency dispersion of the dielectric constant over a range of 10 kHz \u2013 1 MHz.  The effect of film processing on the dielectric constant was systematically investigated. Tuning of the dielectric constant from a value of 11 to a value of 24 was possible by manipulating the structure and crystallographic phase of the material via the processing conditions. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) and conductance-voltage (G-V) characteristics of GaN / AlGaN / Gd2O3 / Ti / Au MOS capacitors were investigated.  The effects of processing on fixed oxide charge, trapped oxide charge, and density of interface states were evaluated.  Single phase cubic films deposited at low rates with near heteroepitaxial growth were shown to have the lowest density of trapped charge.  Additionally, threshold instability in the C-V curve as well as a non-volatile charge trapping effect was observed.  Conduction mechanisms in Gd2O3 films were studied through current-voltage-temperature (I-V-T) measurements.  A number of mechanisms were found to govern conduction in Gd2O3 films across a wide measurement temperature and electric field range including ohmic conduction, Schottky Emission, Poole-Frenkel emission, and space charge limited conduction.  For Poole-Frenkel emission, the trap heights of 1.03 eV and 1.25 eV were found for the cases of gate and substrate injection, respectively.  Schottky barrier height at the Si (111) / Gd2O3 interface and Gd2O3 / Ti / Au interface was found to be 0.56 eV and 0.54 eV, significantly lower than the expected barrier height value.  For GaN / AlGaN / Gd2O3 / Ti / Au capacitors, the Schottky barrier height at the GaN / AlGaN / Gd2O3 interface was found to be 0.79 eV and the Poole Frenkel trap height was 0.46 eV.  The performance of GaN / AlGaN / Gd2O3 / Ti / Au high electron mobility transistors (MOS-HEMTs) was investigated with emphasis on necessary device performance for radiation detection.  Gd2O3 films deposited at 650 \u00b0C led to devices with good switching characteristics including an on/off ratio of ~109 and subthreshold swing as low as 88 mV.  However, significant hysteresis and threshold voltage instability was observed for the Gd2O3 MOS-HEMTs.  \nFinally, the response of GaN / AlGaN / Gd2O3 / MOS-HEMTs to gamma and neutron radiation was investigated.  The devices showed sensitivity to both types of radiation.  For devices with 1 \u03bcm thick Gd2O3 films, the neutron response was not improved over the control device.  Devices with 10 \u03bcm thick films showed significantly increased neutron detection. However, the neutron response was larger than the expected theory, suggesting that added signal due to \u03b3-radiation may have been collected.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10200], "author_name_tesi": "Grave, Daniel Aldo", "last_name_ssi": "Grave", "middle_name_ssi": "Aldo", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Edward Wolfe", "Joshua Alexander Robinson", "James Hansell Adair", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Edward Wolfe, Committee Chair", "Joshua Alexander Robinson, Dissertation Advisor", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thin film", "Gadolinium Oxide", "Gd2O3", "neutron detection", "residual stress", "phase transition"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "SENSORY ASPECTS OF TRAIL-FOLLOWING AND ASSOCIATED BEHAVIORS IN THE ASIAN LONGHORNED BEETLE, Anoplophora glabripennis", "id": "bc386j20b", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12901", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Asian longhorned beetle Anoplophora glabripennis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Lamiinae) is an invasive pest of hardwood trees, capable of severe damage to forests and urban and suburban areas across the United States, Europe and Canada.

Due to the important role this pheromone plays in mate-finding, it is crucial that we understand how males are detecting and behaving in response to the pheromone.\nIn this thesis, I evaluate the sensory capabilities of male A. glabripennis following removal of the terminal four antennal segments and/or the maxillary and labial palps of the mouthparts. A two-choice behavioral bioassay was used to determine successful trail following and related behaviors.  I also tested the ability of males to follow trail pheromone volatiles without physical contact with the pheromone. Results suggest that the palps are primarily responsible for sensing the pheromone, and no evidence was found for volatile detection. This suggests that the pheromone trail is detected by gustatory receptors. \nThrough SEM investigations, I found no chemosensilla on the forelegs or tarsi. However, images show dense setae on the ventral surface of the tarsi of the male A. glabripennis. These setae are likely attachment devices for walking up substrates, and possibly for holding onto females during copulation. Although this set of images is not directly related to trail following, it provides an interesting look at the insect\u2019s biology.\nThe findings in this thesis are important in elucidating the behaviors and sensory structures involved in the trail-following aspect of mate-finding, which can give researchers a more complete picture of the behavioral ecology of this species.

Changes in the focal monkey's social preferences may be due to the obstruction of the mate's view, suggesting the focal is sensitive to the knowledge state of others, or the obstruction of its own view, in which case the sensitivity to the knowledge state of others is undetermined. In this study, cotton-top tamarins explored a Y-maze in which their mate and an opposite sex unfamiliar monkey were placed at opposing ends of the maze. Visual access among the animals was manipulated across experiments such that all animals had full visual access to each other, visual access for all monkeys was occluded, or the focal monkey and its mate\u2019s visual access was differentially occluded.

The study examined the relation of cooperating teachers\u2019 beliefs about family involvement and cultural diversity to preservice teachers\u2019 beliefs about family involvement and cultural diversity. Additionally, the study explored the influence of cooperating teachers on preservice teachers\u2019 beliefs. Multiple sources, including open-ended interviews, field observations, and reflection and dialogue journals, were employed during data collection. Data analysis included single case analyses followed by a cross-case analysis.\n  \nSeven research questions guided the collective case study: (1) What is the relationship between cooperating teachers and preservice teachers during an early childhood practicum?; (2) What are cooperating teachers\u2019 beliefs, values, attitudes, and reported practices related to family involvement?; (3) What are cooperating teachers\u2019 beliefs, values, attitudes, and reported practices related to cultural diversity?; (4) What are preservice teachers\u2019 beliefs, values, and attitudes related to family involvement?; (5) What are preservice teachers\u2019 beliefs, values, and attitudes related to cultural diversity?; (6) In what ways do cooperating teachers influence preservice teachers\u2019 beliefs, values, and attitudes related to family involvement?; and (7) In what ways do cooperating teachers influence preservice teachers\u2019 beliefs, values, and attitudes related to cultural diversity?\n\nData revealed a number of findings. First, the relationship between cooperating teachers and preservice teachers was, in many ways, a mentoring relationship. However, the mentoring relationships varied among the dyads. Within the mentoring relationships, positive and negative experiences occurred, regardless of gender. Furthermore, clear, explicit expectations and ongoing communication appeared to be related to positive experiences within mentoring relationships. Second, cooperating teachers\u2019 beliefs, values, attitudes, and reported practices related to family involvement varied, but were similar in a number of ways. In general, the teachers believed that ongoing communication was essential to the relationship between teachers and families. Additionally, the teachers reported similar practices, such as soliciting parent volunteers for field trips and classroom activities, scheduling parent-teacher conferences, and keeping families informed through newsletters and verbal contact. Third, cooperating teachers\u2019 beliefs, values, attitudes, and reported practices related to cultural diversity varied. Overall, the teachers reported that they incorporated cultural diversity into their curriculum. Furthermore, they generally believed that it was necessary for teachers to address cultural diversity mainly because it serves as a valuable learning experience for young children.\n\nFourth, preservice teachers\u2019 beliefs, values, and attitudes related to family involvement varied. Generally, they believed that communication between teachers and families was critical. Similarly, they believed that teachers and parents were equally responsible for family involvement. Finally, they believed that families could be involved in several ways, such as attending school events and assisting in curriculum planning or classroom activities. Fifth, preservice teacher\u2019 beliefs, values, and attitudes related to cultural diversity varied. For the most part, they believed that an incorporation of cultural diversity into the classroom would serve as a learning experience for young children. Additionally, they believed that teachers needed to have an awareness of diversity issues in order to address cultural diversity in the classroom. Finally, preservice teachers reported that their beliefs in relation to family involvement and cultural diversity either changed somewhat, were reinforced, or remained stable. Influences on beliefs were attributed to cooperating teachers, the overall practicum experience, or both to some extent.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5657], "author_name_tesi": "Graves, Shanna L", "last_name_ssi": "Graves", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Shanna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson", "James F Nolan Jr.", "John Daniel Marshall", "Esther Susana Prins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson, Committee Chair", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Member", "Esther Susana Prins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mentoring", "teacher preparation", "teacher beliefs"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Windowed Embedding Dimension Selection of Nonstationary Dynamical Systems", "id": "14769axg5562", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14769", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Objectives: A key objective of modeling longitudinal change is to identify the characteristics of within person change before identifying mechanisms of within person change (Baltes & Nesselroade, 1979). Exploratory methods can provide insights to underlying patterns of change within any person or process. As more emphasis is placed on intensive longitudinal data collection, the need for flexible methods to explore such data also grows. Method: Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) reveals patterns of repeating sequences within a process, and it assumes a set embedding dimension that applies to the entire sequence. However, dimensionality can change over the course of a process (i.e. emotion regulation over the course of the lifespan). I present a novel method called Windowed embedding dimension selection (WEDS), which characterizes the dimensionality and complexity of a singular process at localized points in time. Results: Introducing a sliding window to the selection of embedding dimension creates a dynamic view of underlying dimensions in a longitudinal process. A simulated example will illustrate the method for didactic purposes. An empirical example will utilize data from a Speed Dating Study where participants repeatedly held conversations all while wearing physiological monitoring watches. Twenty minutes of heart rate data will be used to showcase the ability and need to track change in optimized embedding dimension over time. Discussion: In itself, windowed embedding dimension selection is a great assumption check. It offers an exploratory tour of any process before analyses. As a diagnostic method, researchers are better able to pick or check the assumptions of any analytical method once they know how the process of interest is changing over time.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15836], "author_name_tesi": "Gray, Allison Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Gray", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Allison", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy Raymond Brick", "Zita Oravecz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy Raymond Brick, Thesis Advisor", "Zita Oravecz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["time series analysisexploratory methods", "embedding dimension", "time delay embedding", "dynamical systems modeling", "time series analysis", "exploratory methods"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "High-glycemic meal responses affect fundamental components of metabolic regulation in growing Quarter Horse weanlings\n\n\n", "id": "12271", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5683", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary objective of this study was to investigate relationships between fundamental components of the somatotropic axis and concentrate meal responses in young, growing horses. Twelve Quarter Horse weanlings were utilized in a crossover design consisting of two 21-day periods, where treatments consisted of a twice-daily feeding of a high-glycemic (HG) or low-glycemic (LG) concentrate meal. On the final day of each period, blood samples were drawn every 15 minutes for a 24-hour period and analyzed for plasma glucose, insulin, non-esterified fatty acids and growth hormone concentrations. Growth hormone secretory patterns were estimated utilizing deconvolution analysis by AutoDecon software. Glucose and insulin peak concentrations and AUC were greater in HG than LG (P<0.05) in response to AM and PM meals. Growth hormone secretion following meals was inhibited for a longer time in HG horses as compared to LG horses, with a greater amount of GH secreted following this inhibition in HG. Nocturnal growth hormone secretion was greater in HG horses than LG. Elevated insulin responses to the two daily meals may potentially alter growth hormone secretion from the pituitary. This study provides insight into the mechanisms by which growth hormone may be altered by feeding strategies in the growing horse.

The main issue of study related to those elements in decision-making perceived to dictate organizational choices in the context of higher education and business.  The participants in this study rank as Fortune 500 companies and maintain membership on the National Technological University advisory board.  Eighteen individuals participated in the study: education and training managers, engineering training managers, a distance learning manager, an instructional media developer, a director of instructional resources, and other continuing education managers.    Additionally, this study investigated the involvement of CPEE professionals in the development and selection phases of the decision-making process and how their roles differ within the various corporate decision-making environments.\nOrganizationally relevant cost effective programs dominated program importance and involvement, with application of adult education theory ranking in the last position.  Conversely, responses indicated a high level of involvement championing adult education theory, particularly in all selection activities.  Participants practiced CPEE during a time when the high-technology industry stood on the cusp of technological evolution and innovation. Their companies all chose emerging satellite-based programs.  Meanwhile, the continued emergence of cutting-edge technologies and the waning economy brought about many changes affecting the process of choosing telecommunications media.\n Survey data was used to place each company into newly described categories: judicious, rational and pragmatic - resulting in several conclusions.  First, CPEE professionals seem more involved and achieve more in rational companies for all kinds of development activity.  Secondly, the judicious setting also offers many opportunities for CPEE professionals to engage in search and design.  Third, pragmatic corporate environments tend to limit CPEE professional involvement to consulting.  Fourth, CPEE professionals take part to an even greater degree in the selection phase, and achieve maximum involvement in judicious and rational environments.  Fifth, CPEE professionals have high participation in the final approval and authorization of delivery media decisions in judicious and rational environments.  Sixth, CPEE professionals also have the greatest potential to affect decisions in judicious and rational environments.  Finally, hierarchy typically tends to dominate the team and multiple-group decisions in a pragmatic setting.  Additionally, the study indicated that companies have shifted to a more judicious environment, which means that CPEEs might have a future of greater involvement in the development phase of decision-making.  \nCurrent in-house adult educators now view themselves as project managers and knowledge brokers rather than deliverers of education, and believe that serving as a project manager signals a new strategy for greater use of self-directed learning at the workstation, and increasing involvement in business decisions.  However, much discussion always returned to the present state of continuing education as affected by the economy and the technology.

The goal of this research was to develop descriptions of the process of generality-constructing among University students in mathematics-intending majors to provide new insights into how individuals approach the process.\nData consisted of responses from ten students to tasks of three types: Characterizing tasks, which request constructing a general property statement about a given domain; Populating tasks, which request constructing a domain of objects that satisfy a given general property; and Reconstructing tasks, which request revising a given generality to encompass a broader domain. Findings with respect to Characterizing type tasks are that individuals used superficial features to sort collections, peculiarized examples that did not fit the sorting criteria, and regularized collections by suggesting alternatives to peculiarized elements. Findings from Populating type tasks indicate that participants represented elements of the domain at various levels of generality, which had implications for the approaches through which they constructed domains to satisfy the given property statement.\nFindings from Reconstructing type tasks suggest some participants attempted to understand relationships between given information in order to scaffold construction of a\niii\niv generality by logical deduction.

My study sought to better understand the background distribution and prevalence of neoplasia in Brown Bullhead and the relationship between this disease and exposure to contaminated sediment.   I conducted surveys of Brown Bullhead populations in Lake Erie and inland northwestern Pennsylvania and found evidence of liver and/or orocutaneous neoplasms at every site.  When critical covariates such as age were accounted for via logistic regression, Lake Erie populations were found to have a significantly greater likelihood of both liver and orocutaneous neoplasms than were inland Pennsylvania populations.

One key recommendation to increase overall health and maintain a healthy weight is to increase fruit and vegetable intake; this recommendation is outlined in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  Yet, estimations of fruit and vegetable intakes among adolescents (ages 12-18y) have shown that less than one in ten is meeting the recommended intake.  There still exists a great need to translate these recommendations into practice.  In 2010, Americans spent $521 billion dollars in grocery stores.  Nutrition education interventions can capitalize on this environment to change purchasing behavior, and thus intake behavior.  Previous interventions that have taken place within grocery stores have included manipulations to food pricing and its placement in stores, and point-of-purchase information available to consumers.  The purpose of the current research was to explore the effectiveness and feasibility of a grocery store nutrition lesson for adolescents and their parents.  It was hypothesized that a lesson that integrated the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans with a change in purchasing power of consumers and increased self-efficacy to find, select and purchase healthy foods would be feasible to develop and implement in grocery stores.  Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the lesson would impact specific measures of self-efficacy in relation to shopping for and locating healthier options within stores. The lesson was developed and pilot tested three times at separate grocery stores and included process evaluation to determine feasibility of implementation.  A focus group and a grocery shopping self-efficacy survey of the participants was a measure dose received.  Content validity was assessed by submitting to eight experts for review.  Relevancy of the lesson to grocery shopping knowledge and skills was rated as 3.89\u00b10.56 (somewhat relevant) and perceived ability of activities to achieve the four learning objectives was marked as 4.38\u00b10.78 (some to high ability) by reviewers.  The lesson was delivered three separate times for a total of 15 adolescents (average age 11.6 years [10-13 years]) and adults (average age 42.3 years [31-53 years]).  Total time taken to deliver the lesson averaged 124.3 minutes [120-130 minutes].  Discussion 1 took an average of 16.6 minutes [12-19.5 minutes], Activity 1 took an average of 15.3 minutes [13-17 minutes], Discussion 2 took an average of 48.7 minutes [34-64 minutes] and Discussion 3 took an average of 36 minutes [26-43 minutes].  Common focus groups themes included a reported liking of the lesson, positive recommendation to friends, likelihood of parents including adolescents in future grocery-shopping trips, and adolescent interest in grocery shopping.  The qualitative responses of participants provide promising indications for continued research in this area.

It is important to note that these two questions are intimately related because infection is necessary to generate transmission and transmission is necessary for new infections.  The hypotheses I tested to address these questions build on previous evidence that male hosts are more heavily infected across most host and parasite taxa and also can drive transmission of several types of parasites.  I set out to test several hypotheses that explain male-biased transmission, 1) Male hosts have higher transmission rates because they have a greater infection rate and produce infectious stages in proportion to their parasite intensity, 2) Male hosts have higher transmission rates because the parasites they harbor are more fecund, thus producing more infectious stages per parasite, 3) Male hosts have higher transmission rates because their behaviors cause infectious stages to more efficiently infect susceptible hosts.  While maleness is a particular focus of my research, I believe that the mechanisms driving transmission can apply more generally.  I used field experiments to refine and test the hypotheses set out above in a replicated and randomized before-after-control-impact experimental framework.  A focus of these experiments was on the mechanisms of exposure that lead to transmission heterogeneities. Specifically, what is the contribution of behaviorally mediated exposure and between-host interactions to generating transmission heterogeneities?  To explicitly examine the role of exposure in transmission dynamics, I incorporated network theory into the design and analysis of several of my experiments.  The use of network theory provided unique insights into how the role of behaviorally-mediated exposure influences transmission.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1304], "author_name_tesi": "Grear, Daniel A", "last_name_ssi": "Grear", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter John Hudson", "Peter John Hudson", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read", "Isabella Cattadori", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter John Hudson, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Member", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read, Committee Chair", "Isabella Cattadori, Committee Member", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Peromyscus leucopus", "sex-biased transmission", "testosterone", "trophic interactions", "white-footed mouse", "transmission dynamics", "contact networks", "foraging behavior", "eastern chipmunk", "Tamias striatus", "Taylor\u2019s power law", "macroparasite dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Individual killer whale vocal variation during intra-group behavioral dynamics", "id": "10008", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1488", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The scientific goal of this dissertation was to carefully study the signal structure of killer whale communications and vocal complexity and link them to behavioral circumstances. The overall\nobjective of this research sought to provide insight into killer whale call content and usage which may be conveying information to conspecifics in order to maintain group cohesion. Data were collected in the summers of 2006 and 2007 in Johnstone Strait, British Columbia. For both individuals and small groups, vocalizations were isolated using a triangular hydrophone array\nand the behavioral movement patterns were captured by a theodolite and video camera positioned on a cliff overlooking the hyrophone\nlocations.\n\nThis dissertation is divided into four analysis chapters. In Chapter 3, discriminant analysis was used to validate the four N04 call subtypes which were originally parsed due to variations in slope segments. The first two functions of the discriminant analysis explained 97% of the variability. Most of the variability for the N04 call was found in the front convex and the\nterminal portions of the call, while very little variability was found in the center region of the call.  This research revealed that individual killer whales produced multiple subtypes of the\nN04 call.  No correlations of behaviors to acoustic parameters obtained were found. The aim of the Chapter 4 was to determine if killer whale calling behavior varied prior to and after the\nanimals had joined. Pulsed call rates were found to be greater pre- compared to post- joining events. Two-way vocal exchanges were more common occurring 74% of the time during pre-joining\nevents. In Chapter 5, initiated and first response to calls varied between age/sex class groups when mothers were separated from an\noffspring. Solo mothers and calves initiated pulsed calls more often than they responded. Most of the no vocal responses were due to mothers who were foraging. Finally, observations of the\nfrequency split in N04 calls discussed in Chapter 6 showed that the higher frequency component (HFC) was always associated with sideband 7 (SB7) of the lower frequency component (LFC).  Insight\ninto Northern Resident killer whale intra-group vocal dynamics would aid our understanding of vocal behaviors of many other marine mammal species that rely on vocal exchanges for prey\ncapture, group movement or survival. This is the first study to focus on killer whale vocal content and usage as it pertains to intra-group dynamics for 1) mother and offspring separations and 2) for all individuals prior to joining events, as well as 3) individual usage in a diverging pulsed call. It is also the first\ntime the N04 call has been parsed into subtypes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1473], "author_name_tesi": "Grebner, Dawn M", "last_name_ssi": "Grebner", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Dawn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Bradley", "David Bradley", "Dean Capone", "Susan E Parks", "Jennifer L Miksis Olds", "Timothy Joseph Kane"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Bradley, Dissertation Advisor", "David Bradley, Committee Chair", "Dean Capone, Committee Member", "Susan E Parks, Committee Member", "Jennifer L Miksis Olds, Committee Member", "Timothy Joseph Kane, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["killer whale acoustics", "individual vocal variation", "call divergence", "animal joinings", "mother and offspring separations", "vocal exchange behavior", "communication", "vocal production", "bioacoustics", "matched call types", "call initiation"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "MENTORING EXPATRIATES: THE MEDIATING EFFECT  OF AFFECTIVE COMMITMENT ON PROJECT SUCCESS", "id": "15091sag5378", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15091", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Organizations are globalizing more rapidly than ever.

Due to the limitations of traditional chemical batteries research is being conducted to develop new ways to produce power at the micro scale.  These micro power devices, often referred to as micro engines, attempt to utilize the favorable energy density of hydrocarbon fuel to improve the size, weight, and recharging time offered by traditional chemical batteries.  There are several approaches being researched. A few projects have attempted to scale down macro scale power devices, such as turbines and rotary engines, to produce micro scale power devices.  Other projects have developed novel approaches to producing power on the micro scale.  The research presented in this proposal falls into the second category.\nThe general premise of the proposed micro engine is to use pulsed catalytic combustion to periodically deform a piezoelectric material and generate an electrical output.  Initial experimental work focused on the use of pulsed catalytic combustion to produce periodic temperature fluctuations, which could be used to deform a piezoelectric material.  The experimental work was then simulated using FLUENT to gain a better understanding of the flow, combustion, and heat transfer processes in the combustor.  The numerical predictions were compared to the experimental measurements to validate the model.  \nThe experimental and modeling work led to an improved micro engine design. The new micro engine design consists of array of paired cantilever beams.  One beam, a bi-layered beam, periodically deflects due to pulsed catalytic combustion.  When the beam deflects it exerts a force on the second beam, a piezoelectric beam, causing it to bend and producing an electrical output.  Experimental work using a single pair of cantilever beams demonstrated successful operation of the piezoelectric micro engine.   In addition, the experimental work was used to characterize and evaluate the micro engine design.  After a discussion of ways to optimize the micro engine and other design challenges, the overall feasibility of the micro engine design was assessed.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1601], "author_name_tesi": "Green, Darren Vincent", "last_name_ssi": "Green", "middle_name_ssi": "Vincent", "first_name_ssi": "Darren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Kendra Sharp", "Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Richard A Yetter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca, Committee Chair", "Kendra Sharp, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey M Catchmark, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["micro engine", "piezoelectric", "catalytic combustion", "micro power"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "CHARATERIZING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SCHEMA FOR REPRESENTING AND SOLVING ALGEBRA WORD PROBLEMS BY PRE-ALGEBRAIC STUDENTS ENGAGED IN A STRUCTURED DIAGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENT", "id": "10348", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2510", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, the learning of algebra by all students has become a high national priority (Moses & Cobb, 2001; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000).

Using primarily folkloric sources, it examines how Mormon youth, primarily in the Mormon Cultural Region (MCR), negotiate the competing demands of being both Mormon and American while competing with being both insiders and outsiders in both of those communities during a time of life where peer affiliation and being \u201cin\u201d with one\u2019s peers is particularly important. While Mormon youth have greater demands on and expectations for growing up than many adolescents in America, many aspects of folklore have helped ease the many stresses as they come of age. This dissertation looks at official discourse from biannual church-wide meetings (General Conference), outdoor disaster legends, the practice of toilet papering and creative dating, and folk interpretations of scientific and archaeological evidence connected with the Book of Mormon and Japanese heritage to show the many ways that adolescents create traditions to help them build community and ways of coping with the stresses of growing up as both Americans and Mormons. Mormon adolescent folklore becomes a useful tool to help Mormon youth cohere as a group and successfully negotiate the tempestuous teen years despite high and competing expectations and value systems.

While we can measure the rates of channel migration and witness singular avulsion events in modern rivers, these studies fail to capture the long-term relationships between these processes and the preservation of sediment over geologic timescales. Here, I leveraged ancient fluvial deposits to reconstruct paleo-channel mobility, began to test the theory regarding the long- term behavior of river migration and avulsion and explored the sensitivity of river mobility to past cases of extreme climate change. I reconstructed the paleo-channel mobility from the fluvial deposits of the Willwood Formation (Bighorn Basin, Wyoming) and tested hypotheses regarding potential changes in channel mobility in response to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) global warming event. I identified avulsion-generated channel-belt deposits and made detailed maps of intra-channel-belt facies and architecture with a particular focus on constraining the scale, stacking, lateral continuity, and preservation of bar deposits. I also calculated hydraulic parameters such as paleo-discharge, paleo-slope, Parker stability criterion, and channel mobility number. My results suggest that the Willwood rivers were extremely laterally mobile meandering rivers, confirming previous interpretations, and that their lateral mobility remained insensitive to the PETM climate change. However, an apparent increase in avulsion reoccupation at the channel-belt scale through the peak of the PETM suggests either a change in floodplain accumulation rates, a change in avulsion dynamics or the presence of channel-belt clustering within the Bighorn Basin. This study introduces a framework that allows ancient rivers to be directly compared to modern river and can be used to make predictions about which river systems are most susceptible to future climate change.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15671], "author_name_tesi": "Greenberg, Evan Bennett", "last_name_ssi": "Greenberg", "middle_name_ssi": "Bennett", "first_name_ssi": "Evan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Hajek", "Mark Patzkowsky", "Roman DiBiase"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Hajek, Thesis Advisor", "Mark Patzkowsky, Committee Member", "Roman DiBiase, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Geology", "Sedimentology", "Fluvial", "Climate Change", "Stratigraphy", "Rivers"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "THE IMPACT OF CONCUSSION ON PROCESSING SPEED AND INDIVIDUAL REACTION TIME COMPONENTS", "id": "7s75dc36z", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13080", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is associated with an increased risk for neurocognitive and neurobehavioral deficits. Because these impairments can be difficult to detect using current neuroimaging methods, it is important to identify instruments that are brief and reliable assessments of neuropsychological functioning post injury. Slower reaction times (RTs) have been associated with mTBI. Because RT is comprised of several interactive processes including drift rate (v), boundary separation (a), and Ter, slower RTs may arise due to changes to any of these components. The goal of this study is to determine whether and which RT components are impacted by mTBI, and whether they relate to other neuropsychological variables.  Performance on a 25-trial forced choice response task (the Computerized Assessment of Response Bias; CARB) was used to extract Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) estimates of v, a, and Ter. At baseline, 214 college athletes were administered a neuropsychological evaluation and had useable diffusion variables.  166 of these sustained a sports-related concussion.  7 of these participants had useable diffusion variables at a post-concussion visit.  Additionally, 39 college athletes had useable diffusion variables at a post-concussion follow-up visit, irrespective of their baseline diffusion data.   Baseline analyses indicated associations between v and neuropsychological functioning.  However no significant relationships emerged between DDM variables and symptom severity.  RT components were generally unaffected by concussion.  DDM analyses did not differ among athletes who sustained a concussion versus others. This may be due primarily to the combination of the error rate demanded by the DDM and the typically low error rate of the CARB, as well as possible motivational influences in this particular population. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12849], "author_name_tesi": "Greenberg, Liora Shaw", "last_name_ssi": "Greenberg", "middle_name_ssi": "Shaw", "first_name_ssi": "Liora", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia L Huang-Pollock", "Peter Andrew Arnett", "Richard Alan Carlson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia L Huang-Pollock, Thesis Advisor", "Peter Andrew Arnett, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Carlson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["concussion", "mTBI", "mild traumatic brain injury", "sports concussion", "Neuropsychological testing", "Reaction time", "Drift Diffusion Model", "Head injury", "Executive function"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Influence of Familial Obligation and Social Support Motives in Decisions to Disclose Genetic Test Results ", "id": "21209", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9958", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Genetics differs from other branches of medicine because of the omnipresent and substantial role familial obligation plays throughout the entire genetic testing and disclosure decision-making process. Genetic information may be considered unique from other kinds of health information because it may reveal personal information about one\u2019s likelihood of certain medical conditions and information about one\u2019s genetic relatives (Annas, Glantz, & Roche, 1995). This thesis uses the disclosure decision-making model (DD-MM, Greene, 2009) as the framework to investigate the factors that predict young adults\u2019 decision to disclose genetic test results to a family member. Notably, the DD-MM has never been tested with genetic disclosures. Further, I challenge the assumptions in the DD-MM (and other existing models of decision disclosures) that disclosures are driven solely by self-interested motives, which is predominantly considered as the desire to seek social support. I propose that familial obligation also motivates disclosure, and investigate how a person\u2019s reason for disclosure\u2014wanting social support versus familial obligation due to risk relevance\u2014 affects the disclosure decision-making process.  One hundred seventy-three (N =173) young adults were recruited to report on their hypothetical disclosure experience regarding the genetic health condition, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). Participants were asked to imagine that they had undergone diagnostic testing and learned that they had a genetic mutation associated with AATD. They were then asked to specify a family member to refer to when completing the scales to measure DD-MM variables, which are used to predict their likelihood of sharing their results with a genetic relative. Participants were asked to report on the degree to which their disclosure decision is motivated by social support and familial obligation. Results indicate that the DD-MM translates to the genetic context and significantly predicts disclosure likelihood. Specific key mechanisms (i.e., a more serious prognosis and more anticipated instrumental support) were significant factors determining disclosure likelihood in the full model, but changed when sub-samples were created based on motive for disclosure. Results show familial obligation is present as a reason for disclosure and that social support does not fully explain the results of the DD-MM.
