Two studies were conducted.  The first study surveyed college students to investigate social norms regarding the labeling of and the advice to report criminal events to the police.  Specifically, two questions guided the research: (a) whether the nature of the victim-offender relationship (acquaintances, acquaintances in a long-standing dispute, acquaintances who were provoked, strangers), and (b) whether the subjects' county of origin (rural versus urban) affected the labeling of and the advise report the event to the police.  Results indicated that the severity of the assault, victim-offender relationship, and county-type affected the labeling of and the advice to report crimes.\nStudy 2 examined the combined effects of individual-level and county-level factors on actual sexual assault victims' decision to contact the police.  This study used victimization data collected by 48 rape crisis centers throughout Pennsylvania.  Because of the hierarchical nature of the data (victims nested within counties), and because the dependent variable was dichotomous, hierarchical logistic regression was used to examine victims' decisions to contact the police.  Individual-level factors, including the severity of the assault, and the victim's age, level of intoxication, and relationship to the offender were examined.  Contextual-level factors examined included county type, gender equality, victim services, and percentage of stranger assaults.\nResults demonstrated that both individual and county factors affect victims' decision to contact the police.  At the individual level, severity of the assault, offender type, and their interaction affected victims' decision.  That is, the odds of the victim contacting the police were greater when the assault was severe or was committed by a stranger.  The significant interaction term indicated that even when the assault was severe, victims assaulted by known offenders were unlikely to report to the police.  At the county level, indicators traditionally associated with crime (i.e., population density, population heterogeneity, poverty, and the proportion of males 15-24) reduced the odds of victims contacting the police.  In addition, county type moderated the effects of both gender equality and victim services on victims' decision to contact the police.  Specifically, increased gender equality and victim services decreased the odds of rural as compared to urban victims reported to the police, net of the other factors in the model.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3500], "author_name_tesi": "Menard, Kimberly Sue", "last_name_ssi": "Menard", "middle_name_ssi": "Sue", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback", "D Wayne Osgood", "Thomas J.

The educational reform comprises changes in the structure of the educational system, the period of mandatory education (extended to 10 years), the renewal of curricular contents, the assessment of the educational system, and teacher education and teacher training. \nThe implementation and results of the educational reform have already been analyzed in many studies. The focus of this study is on a different aspect of the reform: the values and subjectivities that the educational reform promotes. To address this question, the study analyzes texts that comprise three levels of the curriculum: the National Law of Education, the Basic Common Contents (BCC) standards for Ethics and Citizen Education in compulsory education, and textbooks for the general and basic (mandatory) education. \nThis study uses an integrative method that includes critical policy analysis, critical discourse analysis, critical analysis of characters, and analysis of the formal elements of illustrations. The results highlight three main points: 1) although the different levels of the curriculum share some values, the meanings of these values change in the different texts. Some values are emphasized by the National Law of Education, but lose strength, disappear, or acquire opposite meanings in the other levels of the curriculum analyzed in this work. Examples are the idea of the subject as agent of change and the concepts of discrimination and inclusion, 2) the National Law of Education depicts the individual or person as an enterprise self  - an individual searching for happiness, self-esteem, self-actualization, and self-fulfillment, an individual who constructs her own project and her own life. I define this emphasis on the self-made individual as a way in which the market discourse enters the arena of education, a process of marketization of the curriculum.  The BCC include the enterprise self, but take the construction of subjectivity to the arena of psychology, by emphasizing the individual as a psychological self. I define this emphasis on psychology within the curriculum as the process of psychologization of the curriculum. By the combination of the processes of marketization and psychologization of the curriculum, the subjectivity of the entrepreneur self emerges as the superseding subjectivity of the three levels of the curriculum, and 3) the entrepreneur self, as a form of neoliberal individualism, presents serious tensions with the idea of education of democratic citizens and the strengthening of democracy.\nFinally, the study drafts brief guidelines for teachers to analyze teaching material in ways that allow them to work against the neoliberal individualistic discourse, include the solidarity within and among groups, and reinsert the democratic individual that the National Law of Education names but fails to develop.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2003], "author_name_tesi": "Mendez, Gabriela ", "last_name_ssi": "Mendez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gabriela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick Willard Shannon", "Jacqueline Edmondson", "Marnina K Gonick", "Meredith Christine Doran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Chair", "Jacqueline Edmondson, Committee Member", "Marnina K Gonick, Committee Member", "Meredith Christine Doran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["EDUCATIONAL REFORM", "ARGENTINA", "DISCOURSE", "NEOLIBERALISM."]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Gastrocnemius Muscle Pennation Variation", "id": "23740", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10393", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Pennated muscles have their fibers attaching obliquely to their tendon forming an angle which is referred to as the pennation angle. Pennation angles change with muscle length, muscle force, and contractile velocity. The aim in this study was to further understand the function of pennation angle variations during different muscle actions of the gastrocnemius muscle in vivo. The direct action of the gastrocnemius muscle can cause ankle and knee motion. Both heads of the gastrocnemius were imaged in vivo using ultrasound during muscle actions in a dynamometer while ankle moments were recorded. These data were collected for twenty-four healthy subjects (age: 25.8 \u00b1 5.2 years; mass: 68.0 \u00b1 14.6 kg; height: 1.69 \u00b1 0.12 m). Ultrasound images were taken at nine different ankle angles for maximal static plantar-flexions, and for three different angular velocities for dynamic contractions. Both tests were performed with the knee extended and the knee flexed. The ultrasound images were used to measure pennation angles during the static and dynamic tests. Analyses were performed to assess differences in pennation angle between ankle angles and between gastrocnemius heads in the static test, and between the static and dynamic tests. Correlations were analyzed between pennation angle and the inertial parameters of the shank, and ankle moments. A muscle model which included pennation angle in the calculation of tendon force was evaluated based on the experimental data. There were no statistically significant correlations between pennation angle and the segmental inertial parameters, or with normalized peak ankle moment at the two knee angles. Differences in ankle moments between the two knee conditions were not statistically significantly different. The model presented similarities with the experimental data with the knee flexed but not with the knee extended. The predicted ankle moments were higher compared with the experimental data with knee extended, and with the knee flexed the predicted moments were higher than the experimental data in plantar-flexion and lower in dorsi-flexion. Coefficients of variation presented small variability in pennation angle between subjects. Pennation angles between the gastrocnemius heads were not statistically significantly different for both knee conditions. Pennation angles in static and dynamic contractions presented statistically significant differences where in general larger pennation angles were found for the static conditions for all ankle angles. In some cases the lateral head presented larger pennation angles for the dynamic condition compared with the static condition.

A well-selected set\nof suppliers makes a strategic difference to an organization's ability to reduce costs and\nimprove the quality of its end products. This realization drives the search for new and\nbetter ways to evaluate and select suppliers.\nFirst, this research presents a three-phase methodology that integrates the various\nsteps of the supplier selection process. This helps decision makers reduce a base of\npotential suppliers to a manageable number and make the final selection and order\nquantity allocation by means of multi-criteria techniques, such as the ideal solution\napproach, analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and goal programming. The first two,\nrespectively, are used to reduce a large number of potential suppliers. The last one\nis used to decide the final order allocation. For illustrative purposes this three-phase\nmethodology was applied to a manufacturing facility located in Tijuana, Mexico.\nSecond, this research considers the importance of inventory management in determining the optimal order quantity from selected suppliers. Two mixed integer nonlinear\nprogramming models are proposed to obtain optimal inventory policies that simultaneously determine how much, how often, and from which suppliers to order. They minimize\nthe setup, holding, and purchasing costs per time unit under suppliers' capacity and quality constraints. The first model allows independent order quantities for each supplier and\nmultiple orders from selected suppliers within an order cycle. This model outperforms\nan existing model in the literature. The second model restricts all order quantities to be\nof equal size, as required in a multi-stage [supply chain] inventory model. A closed-form\nsolution is derived for the second model to determine the optimal inventory policy for the\ncase when two potential suppliers are considered. Both proposed models allow the user\nto control the length of the order cycle time to streamline the inventory management\nprocess.\nNext, the two optimization models discussed in the previous paragraph are extended\nto consider transportation cost. This consideration is important because it has been\nrepeatedly overlooked in supplier selection literature. Since they are neither continuous\nnor convex, LTL transportation freight rates are approximated using either a linear or\na power function to obtain near-optimal inventory policies. To obtain optimal policies\nfor small to medium-size problems, actual LTL transportation costs are modeled with a\npiecewise linear function using binary variables. In the numerical example illustrated,\nthe total cost per time unit obtained using the power function to estimate actual freight\nrates was only 1.4% greater than the optimal total cost per time unit.\nFinally, given the prevalence of both supplier selection and inventory control problems\nin supply chain management, this research addresses these problems simultaneously by\ndeveloping a mathematical model for an N-stage serial system. The model determines\nan optimal inventory policy that coordinates the different stages of the system while\nallocating orders to selected suppliers in Stage 1. A lower bound on the optimal total cost\nper time unit is obtained and a 98% effective power-of-two inventory policy is derived.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [419], "author_name_tesi": "Mendoza, Abraham ", "last_name_ssi": "Mendoza", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Abraham", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Antonio Ventura", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "Tao Yao", "Terry Paul Harrison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Chair", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "Terry Paul Harrison, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vendor selection", "inventory management", "supply chain management", "order quantity allocation", "supplier selection"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Investigation of the Fracture Behavior of cBN-Glass Composites\n\n", "id": "8850", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "171", "abstract_tesi": "Samples of cBN-borosilicate composites were synthesized and mechanically failed to create fracture surfaces for characterization of the crack propagation.

Today, most AEMs employ quaternary ammonium cations functionalized onto polymers with benzylic moieties since these types of nitrogen-based cations are easy to attach to polymers and have shown promising conductivity and reasonable stability. \nVibrational spectroscopy was primarily used in this dissertation to probe the stability of a series of quaternary ammonium-based AEMs.  Research on the spectral assignments of the AEMs studied is not comprehensive and new assignments were needed for accurate spectral interpretation of the degradation processes of the materials.  Moieties such as C-N, CH2 and CH3 are present in many polymeric backbones and cationic groups.  Similar groups in different parts of the polymer structure leads to overlapping vibrational frequencies in the Raman and IR spectra. The Raman and IR spectra of quaternary ammonium based aliphatic and aromatic AEMs were systemically compared to determine their peak assignments and uncover key peaks that gave information on the degradation of these species. \nBased on the complete vibrational assignments of three key AEMs, two separate degradation experiments were employed to utilize the different strengths and advantages of IR and Raman spectroscopy.  The rates of degradation were measured by analyzing the vibrational spectra over time to quantify the relative stability of quaternary ammonium under the range of conditions tested. \nIn the IR spectra of each AEM, the asymmetric stretching of quaternary ammonium was present as three degenerate peaks in the 900 \u2013 980 cm-1 region and was used to compare the stability of the following AEMs: quaternary ammonium functionalized poly(vinylbenzyl chloride), Q-PVBC, quaternary ammonium functionalized poly(styrene)-b-poly(ethylene-r-butylene)-b-poly(styrene), Q-SEBS, and quaternary ammonium functionalized RADEL\u00ae-based poly(sulfone), Q-RADEL. Both Q-PVBC and Q-SEBS employ styrene-based moieties in the ionic phase and were expected to exhibit similar stabilities because of their similar chemical structures. The amount of quaternary ammonium remaining after 10 h of degradation at 135 \u00b0C was 80 % for Q-PVBC, 42 % for Q-RADEL, and 5 % for Q-SEBS. When examining the bicarbonate anion peaks over 10 h, its intensity was most stable in Q-PVBC, followed by Q-RADEL and Q-SEBS.  Additionally, the carbonyl moieties were present in the IR spectra of Q-RADEL and Q-SEBS.  It is suggested that Q-PVBC, the most hydrophilic of the three, remains hydrated throughout degradation contributing to the stability of quaternary ammonium.\n\tThe effect of temperature, humidity, and hydrogen oxidation reaction on Q-SEBS was studied using a modified channel flow double electrode (CFDE) cell, capable of in situ collection of Raman spectra. Key benzene vibrations characteristic of styrenes were used to analyze the in situ spectra.  The effect of temperature and hydration on the stability of quaternary ammonium in Q-SEBS showed that the material degraded faster at higher temperature and lower hydration.  The amount of quaternary ammonium functionalized styrene remaining was 20 % (Tcell = 135 \u00b0C, pH2O = 18.9 kPa), 43% (Tcell = 100 \u00b0C, pH2O = 13.9 kPa), 49 % (Tcell = 135 \u00b0C, pH2O = 79.8 kPa), and 85 % (Tcell = 135 \u00b0C, pH2O = 79.8 kPa, -0.8 V vs. RHE). Electrochemical degradation was not found to accelerate degradation due to water production in the cell which stabilized Q-SEBS.\nWhen the samples were degraded at high temperatures, the formation of carbonyl functionalized styrene residues in Q-SEBS and Q-RADEL were observed in both Raman and IR spectra. A degradation mechanism was presented where a benzyl alcohol group on styrene forms, by S2N substitution of hydroxide at the benzyl position of the quaternary ammonium, and subsequently attacks another quaternary ammonium moiety to form an ether linkage to yield carbonyl and methyl-functionalized styrene residues. \nLastly, Raman microspectroscopy was used to gather spatially resolved chemical information on the carbon and PTFE distribution of fuel cell gas diffusion layers.  GDLs with varying PTFE content were imaged over areas of 1000 x 1000 \u03bcm and it was found that PTFE morphology was readily observed on the surface of the GDLs having greater than 20 wt. % PTFE where the PTFE was more likely to be present at the intersection of multiple carbon fibers.  Spectroscopic measurements were performed on green and sintered gas diffusion layers having 1.8 to 44 wt. % PTFE with point-by-point resolution of 10 to 500 \u03bcm.  It was found that the average PTFE signal detected on the surface of the GDL increased monotonically for both green and sintered GDLs with increasing bulk PTFE loading.  Additionally, green GDLs had more PTFE on their surface compared to sintered GDLs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8199], "author_name_tesi": "Mendoza, Alfonso Julio", "last_name_ssi": "Mendoza", "middle_name_ssi": "Julio", "first_name_ssi": "Alfonso", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner", "Qing Wang", "James Patrick Runt", "Chao Yang Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Dissertation Advisor", "Qing Wang, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Chao Yang Wang, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["AEMs", "anion exchange membranes", "GDLs", "Raman spectroscopy", "IR spectroscopy", "Electrochemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Development of an Ice-penetrating Software-defined Radar", "id": "16319", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8088", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tAn ice-penetrating software-defined radar has been developed that operates with a chirp frequency of 140\u2013160 MHz and 20 W of output power.

The research in this dissertation focuses on state and parameter estimation for cells employing graphite negative electrodes and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) positive electrodes, but its fundamental contributions are broadly applicable to other chemistries. This research is motivated by two critical challenges: first, electrochemical battery models generally suffer from poor parameter identifiability, in the sense that it can be difficult to estimate their parameters accurately from input/output cycling data; and second, the phase changes that occur in LFP battery electrodes cause open-circuit battery voltage to be quite flat with respect to state of charge (SOC), thereby jeopardizing state observability.\n\nIn a broad sense, this dissertation is motivated by the growing need for model-based battery monitoring and control, particularly for lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries are quite attractive for many energy storage applications, thanks in part to their good power and energy densities. However, they are also vulnerable to aging/degradation/damage mechanisms such as lithium plating, dendrite formation, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer growth, current collector corrosion, the isolation/loss of active electrode materials, etc. Existing work in the literature supports the benefits of model-based battery control. Some of these benefits include:\n(1) improved battery power density without compromising battery life, (2) extended battery life, (3) optimized fast-charging current trajectories, (4) diminished battery degradation effects including solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer growth, (5) extended use of active material during charge/discharge cycles, (6) improved accuracy in state of charge and state of health estimation, and (7) optimized experimental protocols for model parameter identification. However, these benefits are subject to: accurate modeling of the (1) electrochemical and (2)  thermal dynamics, as well as the coupling between them, (3) identifying model parameters, and (4) developing battery state estimators.\n\nThe implementation of effective model-based control, requires: accurate modeling of the (1) electrochemical and (2) thermal dynamics, as well as the coupling between them, (3) identifying model parameters (e.g., capacity), and (4) developing battery state estimators (e.g., SOC). This dissertation provides evidence  supporting the hypothesis that battery state/parameter estimation accuracy improves significantly when battery experiments are optimized for information-theoretic objectives such as Fisher identifiability. These arguments are developed using five different studies.\nThis is an important conclusion because it makes it possible to optimize battery cycling for state/parameter estimation accuracy: a fact that has been explored in the literature, but mostly using theoretical/simulation studies. \n\nThe research in this dissertation contributes to the two challenges described above through the following novel contributions.  First, this dissertation presents an experimental method for estimating two lithium-ion battery cell parameters from experimental data: (i) the cell's reciprocal of the thermal time constant and (ii) its entropy coefficients for different states of charge (SOC). The experiment involves using an environmental chamber to apply a periodic ambient temperature profile to the given battery cell, measuring the resulting battery terminal voltage, and finally fitting the desired thermal parameters to experimental data using least squares estimation. Second, this dissertation extends thermal dynamic experiments and studies the problem of optimizing the experimental thermal cycle used for estimating the entropy coefficient of a battery cell. The goal is to maximize the Fisher identifiability of this entropy coefficient. Optimizing Fisher information enables improved estimation of battery entropy coefficients over the existing experimental protocols from the literature. This improvement is measured both by reducing lab time and by maintaining the variance of the identified entropy coefficients within the values obtained from two benchmark experiments. Third, this dissertation presents a study that derives and validates a current input trajectory to identify the parameters of a combined thermal and electrochemical lithium-ion battery model simultaneously. Specifically, the study optimizes a current input trajectory that maximizes the identifiability of the set of parameters for Fisher identifiability. The optimized current trajectory is validated in (i) simulation, and (ii) experimentally. Fourth, the dissertation presents an analysis of the effect of measurement uncertainty and model order mismatch on state of charge (SOC) estimation error in battery applications. Two different sources of measurement uncertainty are examined, namely, (i) uncertainty in voltage measurement (both noise and bias) and (ii) current measurement bias. Moreover, this research examines the SOC errors resulting from mismatch between the order of the battery model used for SOC estimation on the one hand, and the order of the true battery dynamics on the other. Analytic expressions for the SOC estimation (i) bias and (ii) variance induced by the above three sources of estimation error are derived. The analytic expressions are validated in simulation. The most valuable contribution of this research is to quantify the effect of measurement uncertainty and model order mismatch on SOC estimation. Fifth, the dissertation  examines the relative contributions of bias and noise from measurement uncertainty to the overall SOC estimation error in a lithium-ion battery. The error analysis developed in this research is based on the analytical framework in study No. 4 and extends it to a second-order equivalent-circuit model.

Under orders carried out by the U.S. military, Native children were forcibly removed from their families to be educated at residential schools, undergoing training similar to that of military and prison inductees.

The purpose of this study is threefold. First, to shed light on the process of neo-liberal globalization in general by focusing on the power dynamics surrounding global copyright governance, in which the complex \u201cantithesis-alliance\u201d relationship between the transnational corporate interest, the nation-state and local industries is played out. Second, to critique the dominant discourse on copyright that prioritizes private property rights over preservation of commons, commercial interest over public access, and production over diffusion. It emphasizes that copyright is neither exclusively a property right as defined by corporate copyright holders nor a trade policy issue as framed by dominant copyright exporters. It is instead a developmental strategy that can be utilized by the state to stimulate economic growth and also a communication policy that has critical ramifications on the flow of information and the basic human right to communicate. Third, this study aims to deepen the understanding of the Chinese copyright regime per se by taking into consideration the unique political, economic and cultural conditions in China. On one hand, a careful analysis of local factors reveals the injustice and impracticability of harmonizing copyright regulation at the global level. On the other hand, concerns are raised about how ever-tightening global copyright governance will adversely affect the public interest in China.\nAfter answering the research questions of why China adopted the current copyright regime and what are major characteristics as well as implications of the regime, I argue that a more inclusive and just information society needs a balance between private\ninterest and public interest, between production of knowledge products and the diffusion those products, and between regulation and open access. With this in mind, I make several propositions for guiding China\u2019s future copyright policy.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [885], "author_name_tesi": "Meng, Bingchun ", "last_name_ssi": "Meng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bingchun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Denny Taylor", "Matthew Jackson", "Krishna Prasad Jayakar", "James Mc Carthy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Denny Taylor, Committee Chair", "Matthew Jackson, Committee Member", "Krishna Prasad Jayakar, Committee Member", "James Mc Carthy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["China", "copyright", "globalization", "hegemony", "information access", "public interest"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Role Of The Probiotic Bifidobacterium Animalis Subsp. Lactis On Systemic Immune Function In Healthy Adults\n", "id": "26412", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11534", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Probiotic bacteria are functional ingredients that provide significant health benefits, including modulation of host immune function and attenuating the risk and severity of infections. Numerous studies have examined the influence of probiotic bacteria, either alone or combined, on innate and adaptive immune function in an effort to link probiotic use with changes in inflammatory mediators or risk of infection. However, observed results vary by genus, species and strain of organism studied. Furthermore, the use of mixtures of probiotic bacteria makes it difficult to determine the immunomodulatory properties of BB-12 or other probiotic species. Thus, careful analysis of the immune outcomes affected by each of the commonly used probiotic strains is necessary. \nBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 is a widely used strain in the genera Bifidobacterium. Evidence suggests that consumption of BB-12 combined with other probiotic species can modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses in human subjects. A limited number of studies have investigated the role of BB-12 alone on immunity and disparate effects of BB-12 on immune outcomes are reported. Therefore, the primary aim of this project was to evaluate the effect of oral consumption of one strain of probiotic bacteria, BB-12, at a dose of log 10 \u00b1 0.5 CFUs/day, on innate and adaptive immune responses in healthy adults in a randomized, partially blinded, 4-period cross-over free-living study. There is evidence that the matrix used to deliver probiotic bacteria may influence the performance and efficacy of probiotic interventions in vivo. BB-12 can be consumed either in dairy products, especially yogurt, or in capsule form. Furthermore, BB-12 can be added into yogurt either prior to or following the yogurt fermentation process, which varies among manufacturers. Thus, a secondary goal of this study was to determine if the delivery matrix (yogurt smoothies vs capsule), and timing of the addition of BB-12 to the yogurt smoothies (pre- or post-fermentation) impacted the immunological responses to BB-12 in humans. \nHealthy adults (n=30) aged 18-40 years old were recruited, and received 4 treatments for 4 weeks in a random order: A) yogurt smoothies alone; smoothies with BB-12 added B) before or C) after yogurt fermentation, or D) BB-12 given in capsule form. At baseline and after each 4-week treatment, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated, and functional immune outcomes and phenotypic marker expression on immune cells was assessed. Dietary intake of total calories and various nutrients were assessed via self-reported 3-day dietary recall. Physical activity status was evaluated via self-reported IPAQ questionnaire. Incidence and severity of cold or flu infection in the past month was assessed using established self-reported URTI questionnaire.\nThe goal of study 1 was to determine at baseline which endogenous and exogenous host factors contribute to the heterogeneity in innate and adaptive immune responses and cold or flu status among healthy subjects; and if these host factors also confound the relationship between phenotypic marker expression, immune function, and cold or flu status. We analyzed baseline immune function of participants. This included anti-CD3 induced T cell proliferation and secretion of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3, and LPS stimulated TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 secretion from PBMCs. We also examined dietary intake, physical activity level, and the incidence and severity of cold or flu symptoms in our participants. We demonstrated that host-related factors (including age, BMI, physical activity, and daily intake of total calorie and various dietary components) contributed significantly to heterogeneity in T cell effector function and cold or flu status, and confounded the association between activation marker expression on T cells and T cell effector function. These factors also impacted the association between innate and adaptive immune response and incidence and severity of cold or flu infection. We also found that individual lifestyle and dietary variables contribute a small amount to T cell effector function and cold or flu status. However, combinations of these variables significantly improved the predictive relationship between activation marker expression and T cell proliferation and IL-2 secretion, and also strengthened the associations between IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 secretion and the incidence and severity of cold or flu symptoms, respectively. In conclusion, these results suggest that lifestyle and dietary factors are important variables that contribute to immune responses and should be included in human clinical trials that assess immune endpoints. The analysis with baseline immune data has enabled us to understand the variability in human immune outcomes and has been insightful about how to analyze the treatment effects of BB-12 consumption on immune outcomes in our clinical trial. \nThe goal of study 2 was to evaluate the effect of BB-12 consumption on innate immune responses; and to determine if the innate immune response to BB-12 differed depending on the delivery matrix (yogurt smoothies vs capsule) of BB-12 and timing of addition of BB-12 to yogurt fermentation process (pre- or post-fermentation). We found that consumption of BB-12 delivered in yogurt smoothies post-fermentation significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-\u03b1) secretion from peripheral myeloid cells stimulated with heat-inactivated BB-12 (p=0.0490) or LPS (p=0.0387) compared to baseline in young healthy adults, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect of BB-12. We also found that BB-12 interacted with peripheral myeloid cells via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2), and consumption of yogurt smoothies with BB-12 added post-fermentation for 4 weeks significantly decreased TLR-2 expression on peripheral blood derived monocytes, which may contribute to the reduction in TNF-\u03b1 secretion in participants. These findings are not only the first to demonstrate anti-inflammatory properties of BB-12, but also indicate that the matrix of BB-12, and the timing of its addition to yogurt fermentation process influenced the immunological effects of BB-12. \nThe goal of study 3 was to evaluate the effect of BB-12 consumption on T cell and NK cell function and concurrently self-reported cold or flu incidence and severity. A sub-aim was to determine if delivery matrix (yogurt smoothies vs capsule) of BB-12 and timing of addition of BB-12 to yogurt fermentation process (pre- or post-fermentation) influenced immune responses and related cold or flu status. We found that participants who consumed yogurt smoothies alone, yogurt smoothies with BB-12 added pre-fermentation or BB-12 in capsule form increased T cell proliferation and cytokine (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2) secretion, and NK cell cytotoxicity, and concurrently reduced number of days with cold or flu by 2-3 days. However, consumption of yogurt smoothies with BB-12 added post-fermentation did not change T cell and NK cell function; and did not alter severity of cold or flu. These findings demonstrate that the timing of addition of BB-12 to yogurt smoothies influenced the immunomodulatory properties of BB-12.\nCombined, the results from our clinical trial demonstrate that diet and physical activity variables should be assessed in clinical trials to control for variability in immune outcomes. Furthermore, consumption of 109-1010 cfu/d of BB-12 for 4 weeks was effective in modulating responses of both innate (cytokine secretion from myeloid cells and NK cell cytotoxicity) and adaptive cells (T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion) in young adults. We also found that the delivery matrix of BB-12 (e.g. yogurt smoothies vs. capsule) and timing of BB-12 addition to yogurt influences the effect of BB-12 on immune responses, and inflammatory and infection-related outcomes. Specifically, the consumption of yogurt smoothies with BB-12 added post-fermentation results in blunted innate and adaptive immune responses, suggesting that this processing technique influences the probiotic activity of BB-12, and warrants further study. Lastly, we found strong correlation between changes in T cell and NK cell function and URTI severity suggesting that immune modulation may be one mechanism underlying the link between probiotic consumption and infection-related outcomes. Results from the current studies will contribute to our understanding that BB-12 alone modulates systemic immunity in humans and sheds light on potential mechanisms by which BB-12 is exerting its effects on immunity and infection risk.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11042], "author_name_tesi": "Meng, Huicui ", "last_name_ssi": "Meng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Huicui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Connie Jo Rogers", "Connie Jo Rogers", "A Catharine Ross", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Mary Jane De Souza"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Connie Jo Rogers, Dissertation Advisor", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Chair", "A Catharine Ross, Committee Member", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Committee Member", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Mary Jane De Souza, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["probiotics", "clinical trial", "upper respiratory tract infection", "Tumor necrosis factor alpha", "delivery matrix"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Where's that smell?

This thesis begins by discussing the results from a two summer field study in Harbin, China. In 2012, different release rates and ratios of the two-component male-produced pheromone released in combination with a 3-plant volatile blend were tested. In 2013, the effects of low and high release rates of 3 and 4-plant volatile blends with the male-produced pheromone on A. glabripennis was evaluated. Results indicated that 1 or 4 mg/day of male produced pheromone released in a 1:1 ratio with a high release rate of plant volatiles was most effective for capturing A. glabripennis. The 3-plant volatile mix without pheromone was most attractive to male beetles. \n\tThe second research chapter explores the sensory biology and neurophysiology of A. glabripennis. The scanning electron microscope was used to describe the morphological landscape of sensilla on the antennae, labial and maxillary palps. Lastly, electroantennogram responses from male and female beetles to the two-component male produced pheromone and the plant volatile, (-)-linalool are presented. Male beetles had significantly more basiconic sensilla compared to females on some antennal segments. Basiconic sensilla are typically broadly tuned to plant volatiles. This sexual dimorphism may explain why male beetles are highly attracted to traps baited with plant volatiles alone. Female beetles had significantly more chetiform-1 sensilla compared to males on some antennal segments. Chetiform sensilla are mechanoreceptive. This sexual dimorphism suggests females may have greater proprioceptive abilities compared to males. Female A. glabripennis are observed antennating substrates in search of nutrients and oviposition sites and males rub the female antennae while mating to make them receptive. These behaviors may explain the females\u2019 need for greater proprioceptive senses.\n\tFemale responses to the two-component male-produced pheromone have not been published. In the latter portion of the second research chapter, male and female electroantennogram responses to both components of the male-produced pheromone are presented. Antennae from both sexes responded to both components of the male-produced pheromone in a dosage-dependent manner. Repeated stimulation with pheromone or plant volatile components caused desensitization. \n\tTogether, the results from the neurophysiological, morphological and field trapping studies can be combined to advance our understanding of A. glabripennis behavior.

SI allows the pistil to distinguish between genetically related (self) and genetically unrelated (non-self) pollen; self-pollen is rejected, whereas non-self pollen is accepted for fertilization. In the simplest cases, discrimination between self/non-self pollen by the pistil is controlled by a highly polymorphic locus, named the S- locus. Variants of the S-locus are referred to as \u201chaplotypes\u201d. For the Solanaceae type SI, the SI phenotype of pollen is determined by its own S-haplotype; that is, pollen is recognized as self-pollen and rejected by the pistil if its S-haplotype matches one of the S-haplotypes of the pistil. My thesis research focuses on this SI mechanism, and I am using Petunia inflata, a member of the Solanaceae family, as the model plant. \n\nThe Kao lab has identified the S-RNase gene as the pistil specificity determinant and the PiSLF (P. inflata S-locus F-box) gene as the pollen specificity determinant. The overall goal of my Ph.D. thesis research is to understand how allelic variants of S-RNase and SLF function to elicit S-haplotype-specific inhibition of pollen tube growth in P. inflata. The protein degradation model proposed by the Kao lab suggests that, as a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, SLF preferentially interacts with its non-self S-RNases to mediate their ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome pathway in compatible pollen tubes. In the case of incompatible pollination, S-RNase cannot form stable interaction with its self SLF, thus remains intact and functions as a cytotoxin to inhibit pollen tube growth.\n\nInterestingly, many S-locus linked F-box genes have been found in all three families that possess S-RNase-based SI. The Kao lab has identified six such genes. They exhibit S-haplotype-specific RFLP; they are specifically expressed in pollen/pollen tubes; and their deduced amino acid sequences share 50 to 55% sequence identity with PiSLF. In Chapter 2, I describe the use of an in vivo functional assay to examine whether three PiSLF-like genes, PiSLFLb-S2, PiSLFLc-S1 and PiSLFLd-S2, function in SI. This assay is based on the prediction that if a PiSLF-like gene functions in SI, introducing a particular allele of this gene into transgenic plants should cause breakdown of SI function in transgenic pollen carrying a different allele of this gene. I introduced each of these PiSLF-like transgenes into an appropriate S-genotype of wild-type plants, and found that none of them caused breakdown of SI in S3 pollen (in the case of PiSLFLb-S2 and PiSLFLd-S2) or S2 pollen (in the case of PiSLFLc-S1) of the transgenic plants.\n\nAlthough S-RNase is taken up by pollen tubes in a non-S-haplotype-specific manner, it encounters different fates inside self and non-self pollen tubes, as it can exert its cytotoxic activity only in self pollen tubes. In Chapter 3, I describe the study of the fate of S-RNase inside pollen tubes by directly expressing S-RNases in self (incompatible) and non-self (compatible) pollen of transgenic plants. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused at the C-terminus of S-RNase, so that I could monitor the production and localization of S-RNase by examining the GFP fluorescence of in vitro germinated pollen tubes of the transgenic plants. The results suggest that the ectopically produced S-RNase:GFP was not toxic to either its self or non-self pollen. Based on GFP fluorescence of in vitro-germinated pollen tubes, S-RNase:GFP was sequestered in both self and non-self-pollen tubes. Moreover, the S-RNase-containing compartment was dynamic in living pollen tubes, with movement dependent on the actin\u2013myosin-based molecular motor system. I also ectopically expressed the non-glycosylated form of S3-RNase, S3-RNase(N29D), in its self and non-self-pollen in transgenic plants, and the results suggest that glycosylation is not required for sequestration of S-RNase expressed in pollen tubes, and that the cytosol of pollen is the site of the cytotoxic action of S-RNase in SI. \n\nIn Chapter 4, I describe functional studies of a truncated PiSLF2 protein, PiSLF2(CTD), which lacks the F-box domain. The transgenic plants expressing PiSLF2(CTD) did not exhibit the same SI behavior as the transgenic plants expressing the full-length PiSLF2, suggesting that the F-box domain is required for the function of PiSLF in SI. This truncated PiSLF2 did not have a dominant-negative effect on the function of the endogenous PiSLF2. In a canonical SCF complex, the F-box protein interacts with Skp1 through its F-box domain. A novel class of Skp1-like protein, named SSK1 (SLF-interacting SKP1-like1), was suggested to be the adaptor to interact with SLF in the SCFSLF complex. I identified the ortholog of SSK1 in P. inflata, named PiSSK1, and examined its interaction with PiSLF1, PiSLF2, and PiSLF3. The results showed that none of the three PiSLFs interacted with PiSSK1. \n\nIn Chapter 5, I describe several projects I carried out with the aim of using in vivo approaches to determine the roles of PiSBP1 (P. inflata S-RNase Binding Protein 1) and ubiquitination in SI. I tested the hypothesis that PiSBP1 is required for the pollen function in SI as a component of the PiSLF-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and/or as a single subunit E3.

To address those concerns, renewable energy and energy efficiency are the two fields that many countries are paying attention to, which are also my research focus. The dissertation consists of three papers, including the innovation behavior of renewable energy producers, the impact of renewable energy policy on renewable innovation, and the market feedback to energy efficient building benchmarking ordinance.\nHere are the main conclusions I have reached in this dissertation. First, through the study on foreign patenting intention with the case study of Chinese solar PV industry, I looked at the patenting behaviors of 15 non-Chinese solar PV producers in solar PV technologies in China, and pointed out that foreign firms may file patents in the home country or production base of their competitors in order to earn the competitive edge in the global market. The second study is about the \u201cInnovation by Generating\u201d process. I specifically focused on Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) in the United States and the innovation performance within each state, and found out that wind power generation in RPS states has developed rapidly after the adoption of RPS, while the \u201cInnovating by Generating\u201d effect is more significant in solar PV technologies. In general, the innovations of the two technology groups are not prominently encouraged by RPS. My last study is about the benchmarking law and market response in the scenario of Philadelphia Benchmarking Law. By comparing the rental rate of LEED/EnergyStar buildings and ordinary buildings in the city of Philadelphia before and after the adoption of the building energy efficiency benchmarking law, I believe that the passage of Philadelphia Benchmarking Law may be helpful in improving the public awareness and understanding of energy efficiency information of buildings.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10083], "author_name_tesi": "Meng, Yuxi ", "last_name_ssi": "Meng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuxi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhen Lei", "Seth Adam Blumsack", "Jeffery Brownson", "Karen Ann Fisher Vanden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhen Lei, Dissertation Advisor", "Seth Adam Blumsack, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffery Brownson, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Fisher Vanden, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Renewable energy", "Building energy efficiency", "Policy analysis", "Energy Economics", "Innovation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Prototype for X (PFX): A Prototyping Framework to Support Product Design", "id": "13760jdm5407", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13760", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Of the estimated 140 billion US dollars spent in new product development by large companies each year, around 40% is wasted on failed products.  The largest sunk cost in new product development occurs during prototyping activities.  We know prototyping activities are critical to the design process as they translate often fuzzy ideas into physical artefacts, support communication, enhance design development, and aid in decision-making.  Engineering design research has failed to provide designers and engineers\u2014practitioners as well as educators\u2014with formal methods or approaches for prototyping to help reduce these losses and increase the likelihood of product success.  Instead, designers and engineers must rely on experience, tacit knowledge, and individual judgment to navigate prototyping activities, often resulting in the inefficient use of resources and time.  An extensive literature review of prototyping research and a study of novice designers\u2019 perceptions of prototyping are used in this work to develop and validate a set of specifications for a holistic and structured prototyping framework.  A novel framework to help structure prototyping, Prototype for X (PFX), is proposed as an alternative to traditional prototyping approaches in engineering design.  The PFX framework is composed of three main phases: (1) Frame, (2) Build, and (3) Test.  The phases of PFX help designers optimize resources to build prototypes that test core assumptions and inform the design and development new products.  Similar to the \u201cillities\u201d in Design for X, PFX uses lenses to structure and scaffold the prototyping process to make improvements in specific areas.  In order to validate the PFX framework, in this work we study the effects of three lenses, namely, Prototype for Desirability, Prototype for Feasibility, and Prototype for Viability.  These lenses are based on Human-Centered Design and Design Thinking frameworks for innovation and innovative products. \nIn order to evaluate the effectiveness of PFX at improving technical quality, manufacturability, and user satisfaction of end designs, we assess functional prototypes developed in a junior-level mechanical engineering design course.  Results from a between-subjects analysis indicate that using PFX can help increase the desirability, feasibility, and viability of functional prototypes when those lenses are applied; specifically, student teams introduced to PFX produced prototypes that outperformed those from control teams with no formal prototyping methods on user satisfaction, perceived value, and manufacturability metrics.  This study confirms the impact that structured prototyping methods like PFX can have on the prototyping process and final designs. \nIn order to understand the effect of structured and holistic prototyping models on designers themselves, we evaluate the impact PFX has on designers\u2019 prototyping awareness.  The prototyping literature has typically evaluated the few prototyping methods, tools, and frameworks using design-based metrics, such as binary evaluations of completion of a design task. Based on a detailed literature review, we hypothesize that structured prototyping methods, specifically PFX, can increase novice designers\u2019 and engineering students\u2019 self-efficacy, leading to an increase in feelings of control throughout the prototyping process, which may lead to an increase in creative output, higher levels of motivation, and an increase in the quality of final designs.  As an initial step in the measurement of these outcomes, we sought to understand if PFX influences designers\u2019 prototyping awareness.  In order to measure prototyping awareness, a new measurement tool is proposed and validated, the Prototyping AWareness Scale (PAWS).  Results from this study partially support the notion that structured prototyping frameworks influence the prototyping awareness of novice engineering designers. \n\tFinally, the work concludes with a study exploring the effect that PFX might have on the prototyping process itself.  We sought to understand how the order or sequence of PFX lenses might affect the feasibility, viability, and desirability of an end design and the prototyping awareness of engineering designers.  The results of our findings indicate that the sequence of PFX lenses has some effect on product outcomes and prototyping awareness. The contributions from this research lie primarily in the field of engineering design, specifically in the area of prototyping during the new product design process. They include: 1) establishment of four specifications for a structured and holistic prototyping framework, 2) development of the Prototype for X framework, 3) creation of alternative metrics to evaluate prototypes, 4) creation of a scale to measure prototyping awareness and 5) validation of the effect of a structured prototyping framework on the many facets of a product. \n Future work will explore in more detail the full effect of lens sequencing on design and designer outcomes, but this initial work highlights the potential of PFX to be used in new product development to positively influence products and designers.  Future work will focus on validating the PFX framework in industry settings and studying the effects of PFX on the designers\u2019 understanding of prototyping, the decisions made during prototyping, and the artifact produced during prototyping.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14340], "author_name_tesi": "Menold, Jessica D",

diluted with nitrogen.\nThe data will be used for comparisons with simulations performed using well-established numerical codes.\nThis investigation is part of a bigger program, aimed at developing a complete chemical mechanism to describe soot formation from a JP-8 surrogate mixture consisting of ndodecane and m-xylene.\nThe soot volume fractions and qualitative fluorescence profiles of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in three sets of flames are measured using LII and broadband PLIF with excitation in the UV, at pressures between 1 and 5 atm.\nQuantitative soot volume fractions are obtained by calibrating the LII signal with radial laser extinction measurements at 3 atm. \n\nThree sets of flames are established with different concentration levels of m-xylene.\nThe first flame is established using ethylene as the fuel, diluted with a large quantity of nitrogen intended to lower soot loading. \nThe lower soot concentrations resulted in reduced optical densities for the flames enabling easier optical access for laser diagnostics. \nThe second set of measurements is made on a similar flame (Flame 2), but with 2.5% of the carbon flow rate in the fuel stream being provided by m-xylene.\nIn the third and final flame reported (Flame 3), the concentration level of m-xylene was doubled such that 5% of the carbon flowing to the flame being contributed by the m-xylene.\n\nThe flame heights are unchanged with increasing pressure, which is in agreement with laminar diffusion flame theory and previous studies. \nHowever, the flame heights are seen to increase with increasing levels of m-xylene and the distances from the fuel tube to the locations of maximum soot volume fraction are seen to vary inversely with pressure.\n\nFlame 1 had a peak soot volume fraction of approximately 1.9 ppm at 5 atm.\nThis doubled to 4 ppm when 2.5% of the fuel carbon atoms were substituted with m-xylene, and 4.4 ppm when the contribution was 5%.\n\nThe addition of m-xylene resulted in earlier detection of soot concentrations, possibly indicating an earlier onset of soot.\nThis is believed to be due to the introduction of an aromatic compound (m-xylene) which provides a faster route to the initial soot particle. \nThe peak soot volume fractions in the flame varied with the pressure following a relationship of the form fv_max proportional to P^n, where n varied between 3 and 1.88, decreasing with increasing values of pressure.\nThese n-values are higher than previously reported values in range of 1.0 and 1.2.\n\nThe PLIF measurements were made in the 320--380 nm and 420--480 nm wavelength  bands and were not corrected for quenching effects, which become important at higher pressures. \nThe LIF signals in the shorter wavelength band are representative of the small PAH (1--2 rings) and the LIF signal in the longer wavelength band (more than 2 rings), is representative of the large PAH. \nComparisons are drawn between the concentrations of the small and large PAH, assuming that the quenching rates are similar in the two wavelength regions. \n\nThe relative locations of the peak PAH and soot concentrations are consistent with previously reported measurements on diffusion flames.\nIn both radial and axial directions, the small PAH concentrations peak before the large PAH, which in turn peak ahead of the soot volume fractions.\n\nThe addition of m-xylene, which fluoresces strongly in the shorter wavelength band. \nresults in a bright region of fluorescence near the tip of the fuel tube, highlighting the dissipation of m-xylene in the flame. \nThe presence of m-xylene in the flame increases the concentration of both small and large PAH in the flame. \nDoubling the concentration of m-xylene in the fuel stream is seen to double to concentration of small PAH in the flame, but results in a comparatively smaller increase in the large PAH concentrations.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring",

human beings for treatment of anemia. Signals for erythroblast development are conducted via activation of JAK-2 and subsequently the cytoplasmic tyrosine sites in the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). However, steady-state erythropoiesis seems to be controlled effectively by EpoR alleles that are either completely lacking, or truncated in terms of distal cytoplasmic phosphotyrosine sites. Present studies ascribe specific stress erythropoietic roles to the phosphotyrosine PY343 linked STAT-5 pathway in the Erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). Knock-in mice expressing a phosphotyrosine-null Epo receptor allele (EpoR-HM) exhibit defects in recovery from anemia due to hemolysis (Phenylhydrazine) or bone marrow suppression (5-Fluorouracil). In short-term transplantation experiments, donor EpoR-HM bone marrow cells also failed to efficiently rescue recipient mice from irradiation induced bone marrow ablation. In addition, Epo induced reticulocyte formation was attenuated in EpoR-HM mice. In each context, stress erythropoiesis was restored to wild-type levels upon the selective restoration of EpoR PY343 STAT-5 binding site (EpoR-H allele). In a newly developed ex vivo erythroid expansion system (SP34-EX), EpoR-HM erythroblasts exhibited marked stage-specific losses in Epo-dependent growth and survival. However, this defect was not observed in EpoR-H derived erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs). In order to characterize the downstream pathways employed by EpoR-HM and EpoR-H forms, signaling studies in response to Epo were conducted in bone-marrow derived EPCs. As an initial step, uniformity of JAK2 signaling was confirmed amongst the three alleles. As expected, STAT-5 was found to be activated via EpoR-H and wt-EpoR but not via EpoR-HM. For both EpoR-HM and EpoR-H, AKT and p70S6-kinase activation was decreased significantly. For Map kinases, JNK activation was minimal in the truncated alleles. Interestingly, ERK was found to be hyperactivated uniquely via EpoR-HM allele. Also, in vitro studies with bone marrow derived EPCs demonstrate defects in EpoR-HM erythroblast differentiation (based on enucleation analysis, forward-angle light scatter profiles, and hemoglobinization) which were corrected upon MEK1,2 inhibition. These EpoR-HM\u2013specific differentiation defects were not observed in EpoR-H EPCs. In addition, Epo-induction of the STAT-5 target genes Pim-1 and oncostatin-M was found to be deficient in EpoR-HM derived erythroblasts.  However a previously reported STAT-5 target gene Bcl-x, was not found to be modulated by Epo at the transcript level via wt-EpoR, EpoR-HM or EpoR-H alleles. Renal Epo transcripts were found to be slightly elevated in EpoR-HM kidney during steady-state erythropoiesis but were several fold higher than wt-EpoR or EpoR-H during stress erythropoiesis. In maturing KitnegCD71pos erythroblasts, oncostatin-M exerted anti-apoptotic effects, which likewise depended upon EpoR-PY343- mediated events. Stress erythropoiesis therefore requires EpoR-PY343-STAT-5 mediated pathways, certain of which converge and synergize with that of SCF and oncostatin-M. In addition, predominant signals emanating from EpoR-HM allele seems to involve ERK but is independent of STAT-5, STAT-1, p70S6-kinase, and JNK. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4291], "author_name_tesi": "Menon, Madhu Parameswar", "last_name_ssi": "Menon", "middle_name_ssi": "Parameswar", "first_name_ssi": "Madhu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard John Frisque", "Don M Wojchowski", "Pamela Correll", "Robert Paulson", "Robert Bruce Mitchell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard John Frisque, Committee Chair", "Don M Wojchowski, Committee Chair", "Pamela Correll, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Robert Bruce Mitchell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stress erythropoiesis", "Epo", "EpoR", "erythropoietin receptor", "erythropoietin", "EpoR-H", "EpoR-HM"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Domestic violence in India: Identifying types of control and coping mechanisms in violent relationships \n\n", "id": "8475", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4799", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study is fueled by three primary questions: are there different kinds of domestic violence in India? Can differences in the types of domestic violence complicate our understanding of the relationship between violence and male dominance? Will the recognition of differences in domestic violence help us to closely examine women\u2019s actions in response to domestic violence? These questions arise partly from contested relationship between patriarchal ideology and domestic violence. One of the prominent \u201cparadigm shifts\u201d in how family scholars think about domestic violence came with Johnson\u2019s (1995) assertion that there are multiple forms of partner violence in families, some more rooted in patriarchal ideology than others (Thompson & Walker, 1996). Johnson (1995) differentiates among forms of violence on the basis of \u201cthe control context in which [acts of violence] are embedded,\u201d and identifies three major types of domestic violence. This attention to the control contexts of violent incidents as well as the interest in examining women\u2019s reactions to the violence led me to conceptualize the primary research questions. Paying close attention to the specific interpersonal and intra-familial dynamics of control and coping mechanisms in a marital relationship, this project will, answer four main research questions: (1)What are the different types of control that families exert over women in situations of domestic violence? (2) How do the different contexts of domestic violence influence the strategies used by families to control women's economic and social lives? (3) What are the different coping strategies that are used by women to deal with violence in these differing contexts? and (4) How are these coping strategies influenced by the interaction of particular cultural, social, and economic contexts? The answers to these questions will also speak to a critical finding in my previous research: while patriarchal control in families is central to the understanding of domestic violence, the relationship between patriarchal ideology and violence is complex and context-specific. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4776], "author_name_tesi": "Menon, Niveditha ", "last_name_ssi": "Menon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Niveditha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Paul Johnson", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa", "Dr Nancy Landale", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Paul Johnson, Committee Chair", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa, Committee Chair", "Dr Nancy Landale, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["agency", "domestic violence", "india", "feminist theory", "control"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Study on the Sooting Tendency of Jet Fuel Surrogates Using the Threshold Soot Index\n", "id": "9540", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "101", "abstract_tesi": "Currently, modeling the combustion of aviation turbine fuels is not feasible due to the complexity and variation of real fuels.  Surrogates, created out of a few pure hydrocarbon compounds, are a key step toward modeling new engines and new fuels.  For the surrogate to simulate the real fuel, the composition must be designed to reproduce certain pre-designated parameters.  In the present research, instead of attempting to match distillation curves or estimates of the composition of the real fuel, three combustion related parameters including hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio, cetane number, and sooting tendency are to be reproduced.  The objective of this thesis is to characterize the sooting tendency.  The tendency of a fuel to produce soot in the combustor is relevant because it affects flame radiation as well as emissions.  Parameters which characterize sooting tendency include hydrogen content, H/C ratio, smoke point, Threshold Soot Index (TSI), Yield Sooting Index (YSI), and others.  In this work, TSI, which is derived from the smoke point measurement, is used.  \nPrevious data on TSI had been scaled inconsistently, and widely differing values for some compounds had been reported.  In addition, the TSI for a key iso-alkane, iso-cetane, had not been measured.  Therefore this work sought to provide a complete and consistent set of TSI values for surrogate components.  Smoke point heights of sixteen compounds were measured according to ASTM D1322, and TSI values were derived from these measurements.  The soot threshold and soot yield (YSI) data from prior studies were rescaled with a correlation to the TSI values from the current study.  The magnitude of the correlation coefficient was used to determine whether the data set was used in the final average TSI values.  Results showed that the differences in TSI values were significantly reduced by scaling all the data sets in this manner.\nOnce individual TSI values are known, the resulting TSI when components are mixed together can be predicted.  Previous researchers tested a mixture rule, which was shown to hold for the mixtures investigated.  In this work, it was found that six additional binary mixtures and four multi-component mixtures follow the same mixture rule.  A method of calculating the TSI of a single component from the mixture TSI was used to obtain a TSI value for iso-cetane, which could not otherwise be measured, and to verify the TSI value for 1-methylnaphthalene.\nDue to the complex molecular structures of aromatics, it is one of the hydrocarbon classes for which developing chemical kinetic models is difficult.  Among the hydrocarbon families, aromatics also have the highest sooting tendencies, and their presence has the most effect on TSI.  Due to inadequate development of some chemical kinetic models, certain aromatic compounds may need to be replaced with others for which models exist.  The TSI values of three mixtures were tested to show that TSI can be replicated using different combinations of compounds for the aromatic fraction of the mixture.  \nThe methodology of designing surrogates based on TSI was applied to JP-8, the USAF jet fuel.  The smoke point height of JP-8 was measured, and the TSI was obtained using an estimated molecular weight.  A surrogate, created to match the JP-8 TSI, produced the same value within the estimated uncertainty.   The formation of a set of TSI values for individual compounds and the verification of a mixture rule showed that TSI can be used as a sooting tendency parameter for designing surrogate composition.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [102], "author_name_tesi": "Mensch, Amy ", "last_name_ssi": "Mensch", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert John Santoro", "Robert John Santoro", "Thomas Litzinger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert John Santoro, Thesis Advisor", "Robert John Santoro, Thesis Advisor", "Thomas Litzinger, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["surrogate", "smoke point", "TSI", "JP-8"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Using Conjugate Heat Transfer to Assess the Cooling Performance on a Turbine Endwall", "id": "24899", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11039", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Advancements in cooling for applications such as gas turbines components require improved understanding of the complex heat transfer mechanisms and the interactions between those mechanisms. Turbine designers often rely on multiple thermal protection techniques, including internal cooling, external film cooling, and thermal barrier coatings to efficiently cool components and limit the use of coolant. Traditionally, the effectiveness of such cooling technologies is quantified by considering the convection and conduction heat transfer mechanisms separately. The current research considers the combined effects of both internal and external cooling in a single experiment or simulation using a conjugate heat transfer approach.\nThe geometry used for this study is a turbine blade endwall, which is influenced by three-dimensional vortices generated by the passage flow. The experiments and computational simulations include impingement and film cooling as well as conduction through the endwall. Appropriate geometric and flow parameters are properly scaled to ensure engine relevant dimensionless temperatures are obtained. The overall effectiveness, which is a scaled wall temperature, is compared for multiple cases, including different cooling configurations and the implementation of endwall contouring, thermal barrier coatings, and contaminant deposition. The measurements showed that impingement cooling was a larger contributor to the combined overall effectiveness compared to film cooling. The area-averaged contoured endwall overall effectiveness was similar to the flat endwall despite local differences in film cooling effectiveness and impingement effectiveness. The thermal barrier coating significantly increased overall effectiveness by reducing the external heat transfer. Contaminant deposition increased surface roughness, which increased external heat transfer to the endwall.\nComputational simulations of conjugate heat transfer and time-resolved flowfield measurements helped to understand the complex mechanisms acting together to generate the overall cooling effectiveness. The predicted endwall temperature fields show the three-dimensional temperature gradients present in conjugate heat transfer. The flat and contoured endwall flowfield measurements show that film cooling jets and the passage vortex interact to generate the secondary flowfield impacting endwall heat transfer.

The loading at a radial station of a rotor blade can be computed using Blade Element Theory (BET). In this thesis, a new time-dependent actuator disk method is proposed where the loading from the BET is converted to an equivalent unsteady pressure jump which is converted into body force and introduced into the flow governing equations for the cell centers overlapped by the rotor blade. Unlike an actuator disk model, the pressure jump is not spread in the entire rotor disk but only in the region enclosed by the rotor blade boundaries. Moreover, the unsteady pressure jump is updated using BET at every CFD time step and it moves in the azimuthal direction along with the blade. A parallel Unstructured Finite Volume Compressible Euler Solver (UFVS) CFD code is developed and it is coupled with the time-dependent actuator disk model to compute the flow field of a helicopter rotor. The interface fluxes are computed using a 3rd order accurate Roe\u2019s Approximate Riemann Solver and the time integration is done using 4th order Runge-Kutta scheme. A uniformly loaded actuator disk model is implemented in UFVS for validation purpose and the results are found to be in good comparison with the momentum theory as well as the axisymmetric version of the same test problem implemented in ANSYS FLUENT with the same grid resolution.  An actuator line model was initially implemented in UFVS to model the individual rotor blades. In this method, the  loading at a radial station is computed using BET. This loading value is converted to equivalent body force terms using a Gaussian regularization kernel and then introduced into the flow governing equations. As an improvement to this method, the time-dependent actuator disk model is proposed. Since the loading at a blade element is a function of inflow velocity and the inflow angle, the interpolation of the inflow velocity is a crucial aspect in computing the correct loading value. Inconsistencies in the inflow interpolation method give rise to oscillations in the loading values, which are purely numerical in nature. For the purpose of noise prediction, it is very important that the numerical oscillations are minimized as much as possible.

However, in collaborative work, emotion expressions can play an important function in how each individual works as well as how the team works together. As work environments become increasingly computerized, the unintended consequence of the introduction of information systems on emotion awareness emerges. This can be a serious issue for certain highly coordinated, information intensive critical environments such as in the healthcare field.\nIn this dissertation, I investigate the occurrence of work-related emotion expressions in the real-world work environment of a hospital emergency room (ER). Effective communication and coordination between personnel in an ER can literally mean the difference between life and death. Due to the high rate of information sharing errors, hospitals are beginning to push for the integration of electronic patient records and other information systems in the hopes it will improve communication, and that this in turn will increase safety and efficiency. At the same time, there have been many examples of unintended consequences that have emerged as the result of the implementation of electronic patient records. A central premise of this dissertation is that the expression of emotion is one of these informal aspects of coordination that may be lost or mishandled in the move toward increased technology support. \nTo examine the occurrence and function of emotion expressions, I conducted a six-month field study of interaction in a large urban hospital in the Northeastern United States. This field study consisted of observations of ER personnel, formal and informal interviews, artifact analysis of formal ER patient records and administrative documents, and a reflexive diary to reflect on my own emotional reactions.\nThe first contribution of this dissertation is to explain why emotions are expressed in the ER. This includes uncovering the sources of work-related emotion in an ER, the functional roles of the expression of those emotions, and the consequence on the work of the ER. The second contribution of this dissertation is to explain how emotion expressions are modified in the ER. This contribution shows the effect of various stakeholders\u2019 constraining and enabling behaviors on the expression of emotions in the ER.

The study poses and answers the following questions: how do Leftists learn through social movement organizing activity? What activities constitute movement organizing? What are the contradictions and learning that occur within these activities?\nIn this critical ethnography, data was collected over a four-year period using participant observation, informal interview, and semi-formal interviews with twenty-seven Left organizers involved in working-class organizing projects. Audio-visual, and written documents also served as important sources of data. The use of field notes, and theoretical memos were instrumental in aiding in reflection and analysis of the data (Charmaz, 2014).\nAn important finding of this study is that social movement organizing consists of three concrete interconnected activities: base-building, leadership development, and mobilization. A second finding is that historic macro-level racialized class relations generate contradictions within micro-level activities of movement organizing. One important way this was expressed was through uneven opportunities for leadership development which resulted in predominantly middle class and white Left leadership of predominantly working-class Black and Brown organizations within Black and Brown working-class communities (leadership from without). This finding coincides with previous studies of movement composition (Croteau, 1995; Morris & Staggenborg, 2002; Zugman, 2013).\nThe third finding was that learning to lead/organize requires that people confront the specific contradictions of leadership. Consequently, those members of the base not tasked with executive level and/or directive participation are denied the opportunity for such development. This perpetuates the predominance of outside leadership, which is in contradiction with the self-emancipatory rule underpinning Left movement organizing, as articulated by the organizers in this study.\nThis study supports the notion that learning occurs within social movements. However, it suggests that learning is only a potential outcome of confronting contradictions within movement activity. Furthermore, this study suggests that the development of leadership capacity (a specific kind of social movement learning) occurs only when movement participants are confronted with the opportunity to grapple with contradictions associated with that mode of participation in movements.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15746], "author_name_tesi": "Mercedes-Liberato, Keon Tirek", "last_name_ssi": "Mercedes-Liberato", "middle_name_ssi": "Tirek", "first_name_ssi": "Keon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Lifelong Learning and Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Schied", "Fred Schied", "Adnan A Qayyum", "Mark Sebastian Anner", "Leland Luther Glenna"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Schied, Dissertation Advisor", "Fred Schied, Committee Chair", "Adnan A Qayyum, Committee Member", "Mark Sebastian Anner, Committee Member", "Leland Luther Glenna, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Social movements", "Marxism", "Social Movement Learning", "Social Movement Leadership"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "3,5-BISTRIFLUOROMETHYL PYRAZOLE (BTP) COMPOUNDS AND REGULATION OF STORE-OPERATED CALCIUM CHANNELS BY THE ACTIN-BINDING PROTEIN DREBRIN", "id": "6526", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2591", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Stimulation of tyrosine kinase coupled receptors, such as the T cell receptor in T lymphocytes, results in activation of phospholipase-C&#947; (PLC&#947;) which hydrolyzes phosphoinositol 4,5, bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate the second messengers inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).  Similarly, IP3 and DAG are generated by phospholipase-C&#946; (PLC&#946;) downstream of G-protein coupled receptors in other cell types.  This results in increased intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i due to the action of IP3 on IP3 receptors (IP3R) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane which, when activated, stimulate the release of ER calcium stores into the cytoplasm.  Emptying of the ER calcium stores stimulates entry of extracellular calcium through store-operated channels (SOCs), thus maintaining the higher concentration of intracellular Ca2+.

A recent model for activation of SOCS has been proposed wherein the signal between the ER and the plasma membrane that activates SOCs involves a secretion-like mechanism that is blocked by thick cortical actin. \n\n\nRecently, a class of compounds called BTPs (3,5-bistrifluoromethyl pyrazoles) was found to inhibit activation of the calcium regulated transcription factor Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells .

We demonstrate that drebrin expression is essential for activation of store-operated calcium entry in Jurkat T cells as reduction in drebrin expression by siRNA treatment results in a block in SOC mediated [Ca2+]i  increase but not ER Ca2+ release, similar to BTP treatment.  Additionally, we show that BTP is able to block drebrin dependent actin rearrangement.  Based on our findings, we propose that BTP blocks SOC activation by preventing drebrin mediated cytoskeletal changes that are necessary for activation of store-operated channels.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2584], "author_name_tesi": "Mercer, Jason Chance", "last_name_ssi": "Mercer", "middle_name_ssi": "Chance", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Avery August", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Richard John Frisque", "Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Blake R Peterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Avery August, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member", "Blake R Peterson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["calcium", "store-operated channel", "CRAC", "BTP", "actin", "cytoskeleton", "drug"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "BONE-METASTATIC BREAST CANCER CELLS INHIBIT OSTEOBLAST FUNCTION", "id": "6495", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5309", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\nBreast cancer frequently metastasizes to bone, resulting in osteolytic lesions.  These lesions, formed by stimulated osteoclasts, cause pain, an increased susceptibility to fractures, and hypercalcemia.  It has been shown that breast cancer cells communicate with osteoblasts and subsequently stimulate osteoclast activity; however, little research has focused on understanding the interaction between breast cancer cells and osteoblasts.   \nTo study how cancer cells affect osteoblasts, MC3T3-E1 cells, an immature osteoblast cell line that differentiates in vitro, were cultured with conditioned medium from MDA-MB-231 cells, a bone-metastatic breast cancer cell line.  We determined that alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization, two defining characteristics of a mature osteoblast, were blocked.  Moreover, mRNA expression for both bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin, two genes upregulated during osteoblast differentiation, were not expressed even after 25 days of culture.  Together, these data suggested that when cultured with MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium, MC3T3-E1 cells did not differentiate into mature osteoblasts.  We speculated that the conditioned medium factor causing this inhibition in differentiation was transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta).  To test this, MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium was pretreated with a neutralizing antibody to TGFbeta.  The neutralized conditioned medium was then added to MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts.  RNA expression of alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin were all restored in the presence of TGFbeta-neutralized conditioned medium.  \nWhile trying to understand how breast cancer conditioned medium affected osteoblast differentiation, we made another key observation:  MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium altered MC3T3-E1 morphology and adhesion.  Examination with interference reflection microscopy revealed that MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts had fewer focal adhesion plaques when cultured with MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium.  Further scrutiny revealed a substantial alteration in actin stress fibers.  Instead of forming normal stress fibers, cells cultured with MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium demonstrated thick cortical filaments, as well as areas of large, punctate staining.  \nMDA-MB-231 conditioned medium contains many factors, including platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and TGFbeta.  Because each of these factors are capable of reorganizing actin stress fibers and altering cell adhesion, MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium was treated with neutralizing antibodies to them.  MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were then cultured with the neutralized conditioned medium and assayed for changes in adhesion.  Only when all three cytokines were neutralized was there a restoration in actin stress fiber formation and in focal adhesion plaques.  \nTo date, research in the field has focused on finding ways to inhibit osteoclast activity in an effort to curb bone loss.  While this is an important approach, the information obtained from our study indicates that the osteoblast is also affected by breast cancer tumors.  A decrease in bone formation tethered with an increase in bone degradation will exacerbate bone loss associated with breast cancer metastasis.  Focusing solely on osteoclast activity will not cure bone loss.  Exploring the possibility of stimulating osteoblast activity is also needed and must be considered as an important step for therapeutic intervention. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5286], "author_name_tesi": "Mercer, Robyn R.", "last_name_ssi": "Mercer", "middle_name_ssi": "R.", "first_name_ssi": "Robyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrea Marie Mastro", "Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Richard John Frisque", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Carol V Gay"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Chair", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member", "Carol V Gay, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["breast cancer", "osteoblast", "metastasis", "bone"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Nicotine Content Description Effects on Subjective Responses to Smoking and Smoking Behaviors: Implications for Nicotine Reduction Strategies", "id": "25741", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11354", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "INTRODUCTION: A federal policy requiring a gradual reduction in cigarette nicotine content is a promising strategy for reducing tobacco-related morbidity and mortality within the US. However, research on consumer response to reduced nicotine cigarettes (RNCs) is needed prior to policy implementation. Extant studies have shown that smokers provide lower subjective ratings of RNCs, but it is unknown if these low ratings result from deficient nicotine levels within these products, or from smokers\u2019 biases about using cigarettes with less nicotine. As such, the primary aims of this dissertation were to examine the effects of nicotine content description \u2013 independent of the effect of actual cigarette nicotine content \u2013 on subjective responses (Aim 1) and smoking behaviors (Aim 2). Additionally, Aim 3 explored baseline RNC smoking outcome expectancies and willingness to use RNCs as moderators of nicotine content description effects.\n\nMETHODS: Participants (N = 33) were daily smokers (63.6% male, 69.7% White) aged 18-53 years old (M \u00b1 SD = 25.94 \u00b1 8.49) who reported smoking 5-32 cigarettes per day (12.91 \u00b1 7.03). After an initial baseline screening session, 12-h abstinent participants completed 3 laboratory sessions, during which they smoked a study-supplied cigarette and completed craving, withdrawal, and sensory effect assessments. When smoking, participants smoked a blinded version of their preferred brand cigarette, but were provided with deceptive descriptions regarding the cigarette's nicotine content, counterbalanced across participants. Cigarettes were described as containing (1) nicotine content similar to participants\u2019 usual brand [\u201cUBC\u201d], (2) low nicotine content [\u201cLNC\u201d], and (3) very low nicotine content [\u201cVLNC\u201d]. \n\nRESULTS: Greater reductions in global craving and craving due to anticipation of negative affect relief were reported after smoking the \u201cUBC\u201d compared to \u201cLNC\u201d and \u201cVLNC\u201d cigarettes. Participants also took shallower puffs of and rated the \u201cLNC\u201d and \u201cVLNC\u201d cigarettes as being weaker (in general), too mild, and having weaker smoke compared to the \u201cUBC.\u201d  Withdrawal suppression, reduction of craving due to desire to smoke, and other sensory effect and topography measures did not differ across nicotine content descriptions. Willingness to use RNCs did not moderate nicotine content description effects on subjective responses or smoking behaviors, but RNC outcome expectancies moderated effects on average puff volume; there was only an effect among those with negative (vs. positive/neutral) RNC outcome expectancies.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that low subjective ratings given to RNCs in extant trials may be at least partially due to negative bias about using a cigarette containing less nicotine content. Additionally, these effects may be influenced by participants' pre-existing outcome expectancies about these products. These biases and expectancies may need to be addressed prior to implementation of a nicotine reduction policy to promote positive consumer response to RNCs, and ensure the success of this strategy.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10887], "author_name_tesi": "Mercincavage, Melissa ", "last_name_ssi": "Mercincavage", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven A Branstetter", "Steven A Branstetter", "Robert James Turrisi", "David John Vandenbergh", "Joshua Ethan Muscat", "Stephen Jeffrey Wilson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven A Branstetter, Dissertation Advisor", "Steven A Branstetter, Committee Chair", "Robert James Turrisi, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Member", "Joshua Ethan Muscat, Special Member", "Stephen Jeffrey Wilson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nicotine reduction; low nicotine; VLNC; reduced nicotine cigaret"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The effects of the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) on hospital and nursing home use\n", "id": "8509", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3707", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study evaluates the effects of the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) on the use of hospital and nursing home services over two years. PACE integrates the financing and delivery of acute and long-term care for nursing home eligible older adults. Its goals are to maximize enrollees' functional independence and thereby reduce hospital use and avoid or delay institutionalization. PACE is funded through capitated payments from Medicare and Medicaid, or private sources if participants are not eligible for Medicaid.\nPACE is expected to reduce hospital and nursing home use for two reasons. First, PACE\u2019s capitated financing creates incentives to reduce the total cost of care. Second, PACE\u2019s emphasis on preventative care and regular monitoring by an interdisciplinary care team is expected to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and to avoid or delay nursing home use. The hypotheses are: (1) PACE enrollees will have lower use of hospital inpatient services than will comparison group members over a 2-year follow-up period, other factors held constant; and (2) PACE enrollees will have lower use of nursing home services than will comparison group members over a 2-year follow-up period, other factors held constant.\nThis quasi-experimental study compares service use by PACE enrollees, the treatment group, and use by a comparison group of frail, community-dwelling older adults selected from the Medicare Current Beneficiaries Survey. Propensity score matching is used to select the comparison group. Outcomes are estimated using regression adjustment with the two-part model.\nThis study supports the hypotheses that PACE reduces both hospital and nursing home use among community-dwelling frail elderly persons. The net effect is that on average, PACE subjects spend 0.6 days in the hospital per month alive and 2.7 days in the nursing home per month alive less than untreated subjects over the full two-year follow-up period. These results suggest that PACE effectively controls the use of hospital and nursing home services. These results have implications for long-term care policy makers, service providers, and frail elderly persons.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3688], "author_name_tesi": "Meret-Hanke, Louise Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Meret-Hanke", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Louise", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Kemper", "Dennis G Shea", "Pamela Farley Short", "Steven Howard Zarit"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Kemper, Committee Chair", "Dennis G Shea, Committee Member", "Pamela Farley Short, Committee Member", "Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["home health care", "long-term care"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Villages du livre: Local Identity, Cultural Politics, and Print Culture in Contemporary France", "id": "7612", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "230", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the past several decades, the cultural phenomenon of the villages du livre has exploded throughout the Hexagon. Taking their cue from the original book town, Hay-on-Wye, in Wales, rural French communities once in danger of disappearing have reclaimed their economic future and their heritage. Founded in 1961, Hay-on-Wye has served as a model for other towns to establish a used book trade, organize literary festivals, and promote the practice of traditional book arts that include calligraphy, binding, paper-making, and printing. In the French villages du livre of B\u00e9cherel (Bretagne), Montolieu (Languedoc), Fontenoy-la-Jo\u00fbte (Lorraine), Montmorillon (Poitou-Charentes), and La Charit\u00e9-sur-Loire (Bourgogne), ancillary enterprises such as museums, bookstores, caf\u00e9s, and small hotels now occupy buildings that had stood vacant for years. The economies of these towns have improved concurrent with government investment in them.  Residents now find it worthwhile to remain in the area instead of relocating to larger cities. As a result of these changes, the identity of these villages is evolving as well, as they become magnets for a new form of cultural tourism and de facto sites for preserving the memory of traditional print culture in France in an era of new technologies, such as the e-book. \nThe book town movement has become an international phenomenon with a strong European dimension. To date, the research conducted on these towns in their European context has focused largely on economic and demographic benefits of their creation as well as on the role of technology in developing communication systems within and between the towns. None of these studies focuses on the French villages, nor do they address cultural issues such as identity, print culture, or collective memory. My study analyzes each of these issues and considers book towns as objects revelatory of themes and tensions in contemporary French society. My approach situates itself at the juncture of several fields and disciplines: book history, a field whose goal is to examine print culture as an historical agent and which has seen an explosion of interest in the past twenty years, as evidenced by the pioneering work of Robert Darnton and Roger Chartier; cultural history; and contemporary history (what in France is often called histoire du temps pr\u00e9sent).\nRelying on these approaches, I address the following questions in my study: Why are there so many book towns in France? How are towns chosen to become book towns? What does the village du livre phenomenon reveal about the status of books and print culture in contemporary French society? Why does this phenomenon seem so important now, when new electronic technologies have challenged the form of the traditional codex? How do the identities of these villages change as a result of their new status as villages du livre? How do books and book arts profit from the existence of these villages and, conversely, what benefits do the villages du livre gain from adopting a new identity based on books? How and why do the villages create new collective memories? How are traditions, as the historian Eric Hobsbawm has asked, \u2018invented?\u2019 What is the role of the French state, through a cultural policy aimed at developing and sustaining these villages, in creating and perpetuating these traditions?\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [228], "author_name_tesi": "Merfeld-Langston, Audra Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Merfeld-Langston", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Audra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Willa Zahava Silverman", "Thomas Albert Hale", "Greg Eghigian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Willa Zahava Silverman, Committee Chair", "Thomas Albert Hale, Committee Member", "Greg Eghigian, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["France", "book towns", "print culture", "cultural tourism", "cultural politics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Responses to Religious Diversity in Nation and Community: Examining the Role of Beliefs and Inter-religious Contact\n", "id": "9589", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5696", "abstract_tesi": "Many scholars have argued that religious tolerance in the United States has become the norm and that boundaries between religious traditions have declined in salience.

Prior contact with Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus is associated with more positive views of religious diversity at the national and community levels. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5691], "author_name_tesi": "Merino, Stephen Miguel", "last_name_ssi": "Merino", "middle_name_ssi": "Miguel", "first_name_ssi": "Stephen", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger Kent Finke", "Roger Kent Finke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger Kent Finke, Thesis Advisor", "Roger Kent Finke, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["theological exclusivity", "religious diversity", "contact theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Social Resources and Influence in Religious Networks: Consequences for Social Support, Volunteering, and Intergroup Contact", "id": "13207", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7081", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Religion is an important organizing dimension of individuals\u2019 social networks. Moreover, religiously based network ties have wide-ranging effects in practitioners\u2019 lives. At the core of the sociology of religion is an assertion that religion is a product and expression of social interaction. One approach to understanding the effects of religion, then, is to study its role in the function of social networks. Yet, social scientific research on religion often fails to adequately measure or account for individuals\u2019 social contexts and social networks. The distinctiveness of religiously based ties has important consequences for the generation of both social resources and social influence within individuals\u2019 networks. Using a uniquely suited data set, the 2006 Portraits of American Life Study (PALS), this dissertation explores the influence of religion in Americans\u2019 core networks. It examines the role of religiously based close ties in three particular areas: 1) the receipt of informal social support, 2) volunteering for a nonprofit organization or community service project, and 3) moderating the effects of contact with gays and lesbians on same-sex marriage attitudes. Chapter 1 serves as an introduction to the dissertation and provides a brief overview of sociological research on religion and social networks. Chapter 2 describes the PALS in detail and introduces the survey\u2019s egocentric network module. Chapter 3 examines how the religious qualities of close, interpersonal ties affect the provision of emotional, informational, and financial support. Bivariate and multivariate analyses of respondent-alter dyads indicate that religious homophily and interpersonal religious salience are both associated with greater support. Chapter 4 investigates predictors of secular volunteering, with a focus on religious involvement and recruitment via close ties. It finds that religiously based ties are both more frequent and effective sources of volunteer requests compared with other ties. Results also suggest that individual and social resources matter differently for different types of volunteering. Chapter 5 examines how individuals\u2019 attitudes toward same-sex marriage are shaped both by their experiences with gays and lesbians and the composition of their core networks. Respondents with a higher proportion of college-educated individuals in their core networks display stronger support for same-sex marriage. Furthermore, while contact with gays or lesbians is strongly associated with greater support for same-sex marriage, the effect is attenuated for respondents with a higher proportion of religious conservatives in their core network. Finally, a concluding chapter discusses the findings of this body of research and proposes additional studies. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7073], "author_name_tesi": "Merino, Stephen Miguel", "last_name_ssi": "Merino", "middle_name_ssi": "Miguel", "first_name_ssi": "Stephen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger Kent Finke", "Roger Kent Finke", "Marylee Carmel Taylor", "Barrett Alan Lee", "Eric Plutzer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger Kent Finke, Dissertation Advisor", "Roger Kent Finke, Committee Chair", "Marylee Carmel Taylor, Committee Member", "Barrett Alan Lee, Committee Member", "Eric Plutzer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sociology of religion", "social networks", "social support", "volunteering", "intergroup contact"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Identification and mapping of new tomato late blight resistance genes in an accession of the wild tomato species, Solanum pimpinellifolium\n", "id": "11045", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2219", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Late blight (LB), caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary, is one of the most potentially destructive and devastating diseases of tomato. Previously, LB was relatively well-controlled through heavy fungicide application, cultural practices, and growing semi-resistant potato cultivars. However, there have never been tomato cultivars with adequate levels of resistance and newer, more aggressive isolates of P. infestans have been reported. To regain adequate control of LB, new sources of genetic resistance in wild species are being identified and characterized. An LB outbreak in summer 2004 in the northeastern U.S. with considerable impact on The Pennsylvania State University\u2019s tomato breeding program prompted research to identify new sources of LB resistance with the intent of transferring the resistance to breeding material to provide adequate protection against future infections. Previous field, high tunnel, greenhouse and growth chamber evaluations of approximately 70 S. pimpinellifolium accessions led to identification of several with LB resistance. One of these highly resistant accessions, PSLP153, was selected for further evaluation and genetic characterization as described in this Ph.D. thesis. PSLP153 was hybridized with NCEBR-2, a S. lycopersicum breeding line and F1 and F2 populations were previously developed. As an initial step in genetic characterization of the LB resistance, a large F2 population (n=986) was grown and evaluated for LB resistance. Heritability (h2) for LB resistance conferred by PSLP153 was estimated to be 0.68 and 0.76 based on disease severity scores of selected resistant and susceptible F2 individuals and their self (F3)  progeny using the parent-progeny method in two replicated experiments. The moderately-high h2 values indicate that reasonable selection progress for increasing LB resistance can be achieved. As a result, breeding efforts have been undertaken to introduce the LB resistance conferred by PSLP153 to material in The Pennsylvania State University tomato breeding program. Selected resistant and susceptible F2 individuals were genotyped with 153 molecular markers to develop a genetic map and for trait-based analysis (TBA) to identify regions of the tomato genome associated with LB resistance. Employing TBA, a 23.0 cM region on the long arm of chromosome 1 and a region at the distal end of chromosome 10 were identified as associated with LB resistance. This was the first research to identify LB resistance on chromosome 1. The LB resistance region on chromosome 10 may coincide with a previously identified tomato LB resistance gene, Ph-2. Two further filial populations (F3 and F4), four backcross populations (F4BC1, F4BC2, F4BC3, F4BC4) and an F4BC3S1 population were developed with objectives of confirming the resistance regions, estimating LB resistance gene effects, and making progress toward developing near isogenic lines to delineate and fine map the LB resistance genes. The chromosome 10 region was confirmed in F4BC4, and F4BC3S1 populations. QTL analysis in the F4BC3S1 generation indicated that the region on chromosome 10 explained 50.7% of the phenotypic variation of LB response. In addition, this region had additive genetic effects of 35.7% and dominant genetic effects of 5.2%. The large effect of this region suggests that it can be extremely useful for breeding purposes. To fully exploit the utility of this LB resistance for use in marker-assisted selection, the region must be further delineated in a large population containing additional DNA markers. Unfortunately, the region on chromosome 1 associated with LB resistance could not be confirmed. Further experiments need to be conducted to recover the resistance. The eventual fine-mapping and possible cloning of these LB resistance genes will be useful to plant breeders for developing commercial cultivars with improved levels of LB resistance. Efforts to pyramid these genes with other LB resistance genes may provide more durable resistance against LB, which is a continual threat to the tomato industry worldwide.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2200], "author_name_tesi": "Merk, Heather  Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Merk", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Heather ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Majid R Foolad", "Majid R Foolad", "Mark Guiltinan", "Surinder Chopra", "Beth Krueger Gugino", "David Robert Huff", "Seogchan Kang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Majid R Foolad, Dissertation Advisor", "Majid R Foolad, Committee Member", "Mark Guiltinan, Committee Chair", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Member", "Beth Krueger Gugino, Committee Member", "David Robert Huff, Committee Member", "Seogchan Kang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Phytophthora infestans", "late blight", "tomato", "plant breeding"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Australian analogs for an Eocene Patagonian Paleorainforest", "id": "22766", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10171", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The diverse Laguna del Hunco (LH) paleoflora from early Eocene Patagonia, Argentina, has striking similarities to subtropical and tropical Australian rainforests. Previous research recognized the Simple Notophyll Vine Forests (SNVFs) of montane New South Wales, Australia, as potential analogs for the paleoflora in terms of diversity, floristic composition, leaf size, and environment. In this study, I test this hypothesis by: (1) inferring the Laguna del Hunco rainforest type; (2) quantitatively comparing the paleoflora to 596 Australian rainforest plots; and (3) comparing these results to non-Australian regions in Australasia and Southeast Asia where Laguna del Hunco\u2019s nearest living relatives also occur.  \nFirst, I inferred rainforest type using paleofloristics and fossil dicot leaf area. Fossil leaf area was measured directly or estimated with the Cain and Castro formula, the Raunkiaer-Webb size classes, or vein scaling, a new method that has not yet been applied to fossils and uses a scaling relationship between leaf area and secondary vein density. By testing all three methods on 159 fossil leaves with intact areas, I found that vein scaling was as accurate at predicting leaf area as the Raunkiaer-Webb size classes, but more applicable to fragmentary leaves. When I used vein scaling to reconstruct the areas of 94 fragmented specimens from LH, the paleoflora\u2019s grand mean leaf area increased by ~360 mm2, recovering large leaf areas that were previously undetected. Across 1152 fossil leaves representing 154 dicot species, Laguna del Hunco\u2019s mean leaf size was 1755 mm2, or large microphyll. The paleoflora\u2019s leaf size index and floristic composition were found to support its similarity to an SNVF. Secondly, I found that subtropical rainforests with moderate, but not montane elevations, were the closest Australian analogs for LH both in terms of leaf size, family composition, and the generic occurrences of Laguna del Hunco\u2019s nearest living relatives (NLRs). Lastly, I found that Laguna del Hunco\u2019s NLRs occurred in three non-overlapping climate regions: cool-dry areas in subtropical Australia, hot-wet areas in tropical Australia, and cool-wet areas not found in Australia, but in montane Australasia and Southeast Asia. These results suggest that Australia no longer has the cool, wet montane environment needed to support some of the lineages from the paleoflora. This study uses a novel, quantitative method of fossil-modern comparison that can be applied to other paleofloras, allowing paleoecological interpretations to be more precisely based on both taxon-free and taxon-informed data. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9860], "author_name_tesi": "Merkhofer, Lisa Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Merkhofer", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Lisa", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Daniel Wilf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Daniel Wilf, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["leaf size", "paleoecology", "Laguna del Hunco", "paleorainforest"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "RHETORICS OF RAPE: \nFEMINIST RHETORICS AND POSTFEMINIST DISCOURSE OF RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT\n\n\n\n", "id": "10820", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1823", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis interrogates feminist rhetoric of rape.

The small pore size (4-5\u00c5) and its narrow distribution in these nanoporous carbons (NPC) gives rise to a molecular sieving property which allows them to discriminate gas molecules on the basis of their size and shape.  Relatively high selectivities can be obtained between gas molecules with sufficiently dissimilar features.  \nIn this work, the design of supported carbon membranes is engineered to maximize the properties of permeance and selectivity.  High throughput, asymmetric carbon membranes are fabricated on a novel support composed of porous stainless steel filled with nanoparticles.  The incorporation of nanofiller inside the steel support is shown to increase the single gas permeance by as much as 3 orders of magnitude over membranes fabricated on empty porous stainless steel supports.  Importantly, this increase in gas permeance is achieved without loss of ideal selectivity.  The increase in gas flux is attributed to a ~3 orders of magnitude decrease in the effective membrane thickness resulting from the smoother and more refined pore structure of the nanofiller modified support.  The design of the selective layer is also examined in terms of the effect of the polymeric precursor solution properties.  It is found that the properties of the coating solution such as the viscosity and surface tension can significantly influence the permeation properties of NPC membranes.  Efforts to increase viscosity and decrease surface tension resulted in membranes which had higher permeance values due to the reduction of carbon membrane penetration inside the porous stainless steel support.  Other design aspects of the separation layer such as the pyrolysis temperature and the effect of post-treatments and dopants are also explored.  Finally, the application of these carbon membranes in a number of mixture separations is examined.  Frequently, ideal (single) gas selectivities are reported for carbon membranes, however, the behavior of gas mixtures can significantly diverge from ideal values based on competitive adsorption effects and pore blocking.  The permeation characteristics of high performance NPC membranes in the separation of gas mixtures significant to the air separation and the hydrogen economy are studied.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [343], "author_name_tesi": "Merritt, Anna Roberta", "last_name_ssi": "Merritt", "middle_name_ssi": "Roberta", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry C Foley", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Andrew Zydney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry C Foley, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["carbon", "molecular sieving", "gas separation", "membrane", "nanoporous carbon", "inorganic membrane", "microporous", "carbon membrane"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Combined CT-Video Registration and Tracking for Endoscopic Guidance\n", "id": "7824", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5490", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current state-of-the-art workflow for endoscopic procedures consists of two steps.

Given that return to play decisions revolve around athletes\u2019 self-reported symptoms, it follows that having the ability to accurately predict the nature of post-concussion symptom reporting would greatly benefit the decision-making process. The purpose of the present study was to better characterize the symptoms athletes endorse, as well as to determine what impact pre-morbid and injury-specific characteristics have on the development and severity of post-concussion symptoms in the acute injury period following concussion.  Participants were comprised of two groups of athletes including baseline participants (N=702) and post-concussion participants (N=55).  Athletes were administered a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, consisting of both neurocognitive and neurobehavioral measures.  The main outcome measure was the Post-Concussion Symptoms Scale (PCSS).  A factor analysis was conducted on the participants\u2019 baseline PCSS data to determine the factor structure of the PCSS.  Four distinct symptom clusters emerged including cognitive, physical, affective, and sleep.  Additionally, the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised symptom characterization framework (e.g., the \u201cglobal indices of distress\u201d variables) was applied to the PCSS, and descriptive statistics were reported.  Finally, logistic regression analyses were conducted that examined the PCSS symptom clusters and global indices of distress variables, demographic/social variables, affective variables, neurocognitive variables, and injury-specific variables as predictors of dichotomized post-concussion PCSS total scores (e.g., low versus high symptom reporting). Results indicated that the physical and affective symptom clusters reliably predicted athletes\u2019 post-concussion symptom group.  Interestingly, physical symptoms were negatively associated with a high post-concussion symptom score while affective symptoms were positively associated with a high post-concussion symptom score.  Additionally, the neurocognitive composite score significantly predicted athletes\u2019 post-concussion symptom group in that those with higher cognitive scores at baseline were less likely to endorse high symptoms post-concussion.  When all three significant predictors were analyzed together, the physical symptom cluster and neurocognitive composite score were most significantly associated with post-concussion symptom reporting.  These findings suggest that future studies examining predictors of post-concussion symptoms are warranted.

Many studies have hypothesized a variety of possibilities to account for this observed heterogeneity, but few studies have addressed the role of genetics.  There is some evidence in the broader traumatic brain injury (TBI) literature to suggest that the \u03f54 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene may be linked to unfavorable outcome following brain injury, but this relationship has not been carefully explored in the context of sports concussion. The purpose of this dissertation was to examine whether the APOE gene influences neuropsychological outcomes following sports-related concussion in collegiate athletes. Having knowledge of potential risk factors that are associated with brain injury outcome has significant implications for athletes\u2019 safety and well-being and could facilitate the development of safer and more efficient return to play guidelines. Three empirical studies were conducted, each focusing on a unique aspect critical to the assessment and evaluation of sports-related concussion.  Paper 1 examined the relationship between the APOE \u03f54 allele and post-concussion symptom reporting.  Paper 2 evaluated the extent to which the \u03f54 allele is associated with the presence and severity of headache in concussed and non-concussed athletes.  Paper 3 studied neurocognitive functioning in concussed athletes to determine whether athletes with and without an \u03f54 allele differ in their neurocognitive profiles.

The purpose of this study was to contribute to the literature on the measurement of campus climate by offering an instrument empirically tested with scale development methodology. Several researchers have studied the climate in higher education.  This study focuses on one assessment tool that has been used for the last ten years.

Full implications are presented, including a discussion of elements of the climate that were eliminated from the analysis and suggestions for how the PCI can be used by institutions to examine their climate and identify areas for improvement, so that students can get the most out of their college education and continue on to be positive and effective citizens in our increasingly complicated and diverse world.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1553], "author_name_tesi": "Merson, Dan ", "last_name_ssi": "Merson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Ruth Rankin", "Susan Ruth Rankin", "Lisa R Lattuca", "Leticia Oseguera", "Hoi Kin Suen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Ruth Rankin, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Ruth Rankin, Committee Chair", "Lisa R Lattuca, Committee Member", "Leticia Oseguera, Committee Member", "Hoi Kin Suen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["campus climate", "college student", "psychometrics", "factor analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Alternate Revenue Stream Analysis for a Residential Battery Connected to a PV Rooftop", "id": "22789", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9982", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The market for emergency backup power for residential homes in the U.S. has been increasing ever since natural disasters like hurricane Irene, Katrina and Sandy have caused widespread, long durational blackouts. Lithium ion battery storage has a great potential to capture this market, but it has a high capital cost of investment that dissuades most homeowners from investing in it. However, recent advances in lithium-ion technology as well as policy changes have opened exciting avenues for research studies into the capabilities of these batteries for services like energy arbitrage and frequency regulation. These new business cases enable batteries to be a source of revenue, while also serving its primary purpose of providing emergency backup power. \nA lithium ion battery is a hefty investment of anywhere between 400-1000 $/kWh of storage at current market rates. Keeping this battery idle for only backup purposes in case of an emergency is underutilizing its potential and is too high an investment for most residential homeowners. What if this battery could provide backup in case of an emergency and also simultaneously provide a steady revenue stream by participating in market services like energy arbitrage and frequency regulation? This research looks to answer that question and simulate scenarios where the battery can become a revenue-generating asset.

I also investigated the effects of large sites\non small site location and looked at all these factors with respect to reinhabited sites versus\npristine sites.\nMy results suggest a method to determine which old surveys can be used, and which\ncannot. The site populations in the mesa surveys are similar but differ from the site populations of\nthe non-mesa surveys, indicating a possible difference in settlement pattern between mesas and\nother areas. Site population in general increased through time. Wetherill Mesa is the only location\nwhere Late Pueblo III site population dipped dramatically, probably due to movement into\naggregated cliff locations. Mesa-top sites remained the majority through time, but population\npressure caused people to move sites to the talus slopes. No large site influence pushes sites up or\ndown in elevation, but population pressure does expand the range of elevations inhabited.\nDistances to large sites from small sites do not change the appearance of large sites. Small sites\nmove away from or toward large sites without pattern.\nThe environment appears to influence small site locations far more than proximity to large\nsites. While large sites might have influenced the myriad small-site inhabitants by altering their\nsocial and political life, they did not seem to alter the locations people chose for their homes.\nPopulation pressure seems to be the largest influence on the settlement patterns in the Mesa\nVerde area.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [99], "author_name_tesi": "Messer, A'ndrea  Elyse", "last_name_ssi": "Messer", "middle_name_ssi": "Elyse", "first_name_ssi": "A'ndrea ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George Robert Milner", "George Robert Milner", "David Lee Webster", "Dean R.

Negative experiences that surround the delivery of the child can make this transition more difficult, and births resulting in cesarean sections (C-sections) have been associated with decreased satisfaction with the birth process itself.  Numerous studies have assessed the maternal experience, but there is a lack of knowledge about paternal experiences and how they may affect the transition to fatherhood.  This study examined the experiences of first time fathers and their transition to fatherhood in the perinatal and postpartum period after a cesarean section delivery.\nParticipants were recruited from a major university hospital.  Data were collected by audio-taped non-structured interviews which occurred approximately one month after delivery.  Data analysis was based on the interpretative phenomenological analysis method by Smith, Flowers, and Larkin (2009) which is grounded in the hermeneutic phenomenological work of Heidegger.  Findings included the following over-arching themes that dominated most of the fathers\u2019 experiences as they transitioned from stage to stage of the process:  Expecting a Natural Childbirth; Ongoing Communication Breakdowns; Riding an Emotional Roller Coaster; Moving to a Sense of Relief and Peace; Awakening to the Challenges of Being a Father; and Resolving the Memory and Moving On.  The comments shared with the most emotional and emphatic tones by the fathers related to reports of \u201ccommunication breakdowns\u201d during the pre-delivery period.  Overall, the positive or negative communication skills of the staff had a similarly polarizing effect on all the fathers\u2019 positive or negative perception of the birthing experience. \nThese findings are significant for the increased understanding they provide of the experience of fathers of children delivered by cesarean section.  Insights into the critical role of effective staff communication at key points of time clearly suggest areas for improvement in perinatal and post-partum nursing care, nursing education and research.   Recommendations based on findings include:  Enhance efforts to improve education of fathers to limit knowledge deficits and potential fears related to cesarean section delivery; redouble efforts to ensure that nursing educational programs support development of graduates prepared to approach perinatal and post-partum care holistically by including fathers as part of the care delivery team; and expanding nursing research to further define the needs of fathers at this early phase of transition to fatherhood.  The enhanced understanding of the cesarean delivery experiences of these fathers provides a base for similar studies that expand understanding of commonalities and differences of their birthing experience in other settings and under other conditions.  Findings also suggest the need for future research focused on the implementation and testing of quality improvement strategies designed to limit or eliminate the healthcare problem areas identified in this study.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1829], "author_name_tesi": "Messner, Eric Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Messner", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Carol Smith", "Carol A Smith", "Rita A Jablonski", "Kristen H Kjerulff", "James Truman Ziegenfuss Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Carol Smith, Dissertation Advisor", "Carol A Smith, Committee Chair", "Rita A Jablonski, Committee Member", "Kristen H Kjerulff, Committee Member", "James Truman Ziegenfuss Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fathers", "Cesarean Section", "Fatherhood"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Deviant Inheritances: Anxieties about Maternal Transmission in Nineteenth-century Fiction", "id": "22595", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10174", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores how the burgeoning nineteenth-century biomedical discourses surrounding mother-child transmission become sites of anxiety for Victorian fiction writers. Traditionally, the Victorians are viewed as celebrating the \u201ccult of motherhood,\u201d in which women\u2019s highest callings are giving birth and exerting moral influences on their children. However, my examination of nineteenth-century medical and fictional texts reveals profound anxieties about the possibility that maternal inheritance and influence could be pathological and depraved instead of healthful and enlightening. For the Victorians, biological inheritance signified not only the passage of traits from one generation to the next, but also the transmission of physical, moral, and affective qualities through pregnancy and birth, breastfeeding, and interpersonal contact. This dissertation argues that the nineteenth-century novel is particularly concerned with deviant mothers, those who problematize assumptions about the sanctity of motherhood because of their associations with illicit sexuality, prostitution, violence, crime, or disease. Victorian novelists were deeply interested in the threatening possibility that transgression, in both its literal manifestations (disease, madness, deformity) and figurative manifestation (morality), could be transferred interpersonally\u2014primarily between mother and child, but also potentially between the mother and the community and, moreover, the entire human species.

The US has long relied on private forests to provide clean air, protect watersheds and stream banks, the aesthetic backdrops to cities, towns, and communities, countless recreation opportunities, and habitat for myriad species of wildlife, plants, and fungi. Private forests have also provided the majority of US timber supply and economic opportunities for timber production. While research of this important population has been conducted for many years, little has been done to standardize sampling of PFLs and estimation of population parameters thus frustrating comparisons among studies and efforts to track changes over time. This dissertation challenges the presumptions with which PFL research has been previously conducted, lays a foundation for sound, future research, and begins exploring important aspects of private forest landowership. The research presented here focuses primarily on the approaches employed by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service to sample PFLs and estimate parameters of the PFL population and of private forestland across the nation. Issues revealed substantively challenge traditional approaches and long-held conclusions about the underpinnings of PFL research as well as how these PFLs have influenced the use and conversion of US forests. With a new foundation, this dissertation also explores decision making processes and the effects of PFL attitudes, values, and beliefs on timber utilization on private lands in the context of an increasingly parcelized forest.

The interaction of Discrepancy (both individual and family) and Adherence to Asian Values, in addition to generation status and the relationship to mental health were also examined.  \nHierarchical multiple regression analysis was chosen as the method for analysis because it allows the researcher to include main effect terms in the first model, and any other terms in the second model to explain the variance over and above that already explained by the main effect terms (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001).  Thus, Individual Discrepancy, Family Discrepancy, and Adherence to Asian Values were put in the first block, and the interactions and generation status were put in the second block.  As hypothesized, both Individual and Family Discrepancy were significant predictors of depression and anxiety. Only Individual Discrepancy was predictive of self-esteem.  Adherence to Asian Values did not predict self-esteem, anxiety, or depression. Generation status, and the interactions between Individual Discrepancy and Adherence to Asian Values, and Family Discrepancy and Adherence to Asian Values were not significant predictors of self-esteem, depression or anxiety.  \nThis study provided additional support for the Discrepancy scale of the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised and the Almost Perfect Scale-Family (APS-R, APS-F).  The results overall provided support for past studies which indicate that Individual Discrepancy is negatively related to mental health.  Moreover, the perception that participants were not meeting family expectations was also negatively related to mental health.

Before forest managers can implement courses of action for forest restoration and sustainability, they must understand the historical fire regime and forest structure which can serve as a reference target for forest management. Few studies have been conducted where the survey area was greater than 1 hectare (ha) and may not have captured spatial relationships at larger scales. To address this issue I sampled three, approximately 2 ha plots on Prospect Peak in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California. This study quantifies the pre-fire suppression fire regime (frequency, season, extent), the pre-suppression forest age and size structure with an emphasis on spatial relationships, and how the forest has changed since the onset of fire suppression. Fires were frequent before 1903, with a median composite fire return interval of 12.5 yrs. Densities of trees increased by an order of magnitude from 10s of stems ha-1 in 1903 to 100s of stems ha-1 in 2011. Changes in basal area varied; one plot exhibited an increase in total basal area from 38.3 m2 ha-1 to 60.8 m2 ha-1 but decreasing/increasing basal areas by species signifying a compositional change as more shade-tolerant, fire-intolerant white fir (Abies concolor) established and outcompeted ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi). Another plot showed an increase in total basal area, but with opposite decreases/increases for species. Decreases in quadratic mean diameter show that trees, although less dense in 1903, were larger in aggregate. Spatial patterns of the mixed-conifer forests exhibit positive autocorrelation for age and size at small scales (up to 7 m for pines) and negative autocorrelation at larger scales (up to 66 m for pines), indicating that the forest is comprised of even-aged groups of trees that are spatially separated from one another. Trees within small groups are similar in age, but tree age between groups differs. Spatial relationships differed by species as well; white fir occurs in statistically significant clumps at all scales (1 m to 70 m [0.12 ha]), whereas pines are clumped at much smaller scales (1 m to 7 m [0.003 ha]).", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7244], "author_name_tesi": "Metz, James Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Metz", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan H Taylor", "Erica A H Smithwick", "Robert P Brooks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan H Taylor, Thesis Advisor", "Erica A H Smithwick, Thesis Advisor", "Robert P Brooks, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["fire ecology", "Lassen Volcanic National Park", "forest reconstruction", "spatial autocorrelation"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Significance of Locus-of-Esteem Enhancements in Pride-Based Assessment of the Need for Achievement\n", "id": "7657", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2913", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Contemporary sport motivation research, which has frequently focused on achievement goals, may be enhanced by classic achievement motivation theory (Atkinson, 1957; Murray, 1938) provided that central constructs are adequately conceptualized and operationalized.

The first manuscript in this dissertation intended to reconceptualize nAch within the context of Lazarus\u2019 (1991; 1999) cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion and describe the potential value of bifurcating nAch into two forms of anticipatory pride based on the locus of esteem enhancement: intrapersonal (IaP; self-esteem enhancement) and interpersonal (IeP; social-esteem enhancement). The second manuscript reported the development and validation of the Need Achievement Pride Scale (NAPS), a measure of cognitive-motivational-relational beliefs associated with the nAch. College students (N = 595) completed the NAPS and a variety of other measures. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a structure of two correlated factors including IaP and IeP beliefs that demonstrated factorial invariance across randomly drawn halves of the sample. In general, NAPS scores were associated with (a) high levels of nAch, reward responsiveness, drive, self-esteem, happiness, state hope, alpha and beta pride, and approach achievement goals, and (b) low levels of depression, but were unrelated to behavioral inhibition, positive and negative affectivity, FF, and avoidance achievement goals.

Latent growth curve modeling revealed positive associations between IaP/FF and initial pride/shame, respectively. Analysis also exposed strong feedback-contingent changes in self-conscious affect.

At the same time, the decline of rural America, evidenced by aging farmers, rural outmigration, and weakened local economies, remains a concern.  Production of perennial agricultural feedstocks (such as switchgrass) for bioenergy has been framed as a way to achieve needed energy supplies, with possible contributions to rural revitalization and environmental protection.  However, most national policy and programmatic discourse focuses more on where biomass crops might be grown than on who will produce them or their concerns about such development.  Guided by ethical framings of agriculture and its relationship to the public good, this dissertation draws on documentary evidence and qualitative field research to examine social understandings of the potential impacts of agricultural bioenergy development in rural America.  Research questions address 1) the concerns and interests of actual local agricultural bioenergy project participants; 2) the links between local legacy and project participants\u2019 expectations and experiences of bioeconomy development; 3) the correspondences and divergences between project participants\u2019 views about bioeconomy development and more macro-scale visions and recommendations of policymakers and other less local bioeconomy actors.  An analysis of recent international, national, and state-specific policies and trends provides context for the field-based interviews with participants (local farmers and facilitators) of two current switchgrass-for-bioenergy projects \u2013 one in southern Iowa and the other in northeastern Kentucky. Situating the field research within this contextual narrative highlights how agrarian and industrial models of bioeconomy development are seen to create different tradeoffs across discrete scales.  It also illuminates how more macro-scale plans and policies largely neglect the concerns and interests of rural stakeholders.  Project participants\u2019 understandings of the process and implications of agricultural  bioeconomy development are shaped by local legacies derived from the biophysical characteristics of their regions, the socio-economic circumstances facing their communities, and the inherited social history associated with being a rural resident in that region.  While legacy effects help to interpret some differences in participants\u2019 perceptions across the Iowa and Kentucky cases, project participants in both regions generally express desire for a model of bioenergy production that supports rural revitalization and is locally-initiated, -integrated, and -controlled. Contributions of this research include its detailed accounting of how actors socially construct the trade-offs associated with agricultural resource development.   Given the premise that democratic deliberation is an essential component of the public good, the actor-centered approach in this research suggests that rural stakeholders should have a greater voice in bioeconomy planning and development.  Based on the findings of this research, macro-scale policy discourses on the bioeconomy should prioritize rural revitalization as much as energy security.  Policy discourses should also recognize and incorporate micro-scale concerns of farmers and other rural stakeholders, which offer valuable insights for sustainable bioeconomy development in specific places.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [231], "author_name_tesi": "Meyer, Alissa Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Meyer", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Alissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Clare Hinrichs", "C Clare Hinrichs", "Leland Luther Glenna", "Richard Stedman", "Thomas Lehman Richard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Clare Hinrichs, Dissertation Advisor", "C Clare Hinrichs, Committee Chair", "Leland Luther Glenna, Committee Member", "Richard Stedman, Committee Member", "Thomas Lehman Richard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["public good", "switchgrass", "rural sociology", "social impacts"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Surface Passivation Studies of AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors", "id": "8907", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1430", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "GaN based transistors have recently emerged as contenders for replacing existing Si and GaAs RF power devices. Wide bandgap group III-N materials exhibit the benefits of high electric field breakdown strength and high saturated carrier velocity, which allow for high power and high frequency device operation. While the theoretical advantages of the AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) are beginning to be realized, technological development is still inhibited by critical problems such as RF dispersion and off-state leakage current.\n     Electrical (pulsed and dc I-V, Hall Effect, and small signal RF) and materials (XPS, AES, FTIR, PL, and thin film stress measurements) characterization techniques were used to attain a comprehensive viewpoint of how the HEMT surface treatment and PECVD SiN<sub>x</sub> passivation procedure affects device characteristics. Based on experimental and modeling results, the potential mechanisms responsible for reducing device virtual gating and increasing isolation current were discussed. In general, the pulsed I-V performance of HEMTs can be improved by using one of several plasma treatments, such as C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, or O<sub>2</sub>, immediately prior to passivation. Isolation current degradation was found to be relatively independent of pre-passivation surface treatment, but instead showed five orders of magnitude variation when different SiN<sub>x</sub> passivation film types were used.\n     Organic surface contamination that is present in as-processed, unpassivated devices was found to impede the mechanism by which SiN<sub>x</sub> deposition reduces virtual gating. XPS results show that surface treatments that reduce carbon concentration also lead to improved pulsed I-V performance after passivation. The passivation mechanism that reduces virtual gating is suspected to be related to chemical modification of the HEMT surface that reduces populations of electron trapping centers, or changes their\ncharacteristics. Several arguments support the hypothesis that oxygen could be directly\ninvolved in the passivation mechanism.\n     Two-dimensional simulation of the isolation test structure suggested that the increase in isolation current could be explained by the incorporation of donors or donor type defects at the SiN<sub>x</sub>/HEMT interface.

Using the GENIE Earth system model, I investigated the physical and chemical factors that enhance euxinia in the geological record. Sustained global warmth, ocean circulation patterns replete with nutrient-trapping geographies, and elevated nutrient conditions initiate biological feedbacks that stimulate euxinia based on this numerical analysis. I then use the example of the end-Permian, an interval during which euxinia and mass extinction coincide, to further explore the biogeochemical controls on the buildup of sulfide in the global ocean. With the end-Permian configuration of GENIE, I examine the distribution of H2S accumulation in the ocean and quantify the impact of anoxygenic phototrophy in reducing surface-water [H2S] under a range of oceanic phosphate conditions. The modeled spatial predictions largely agree with the geological record of geochemical and biotic change across the Permian-Triassic boundary. Addition of a nitrogen cycle to GENIE results in further reduction of hydrogen sulfide buildup. The high productivity euxinic ocean is N-limited as evidenced by low N:P ratios in the deep ocean. This work serves as a quantitative basis for linking the fossil record of extinction to the geochemical record of carbon and sulfur cycle perturbation. \n\nThe geologically stable remnants of carotenoids from the anoxygenic green and purple sulfur bacteria are a powerful method of identifying photic zone euxinia in the rock record. I used pigment and clone library analyses from planktonic and benthic samples collected in a microbially dominated meromictic lake (Fayetteville Green Lake, New York) to test the hypothesis that the purple sulfur bacterial carotenoid, okenone, is only produced in planktonic settings.  We report evidence of okenone and purple sulfur bacteria in both benthic and planktonic environments of Fayetteville Green Lake. This finding highlights the need for continued study of modern environments and the physiology of carotenoid expression in modern microbes to aid interpretation of biomarkers for photic zone euxinia in the geological record. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3501], "author_name_tesi": "Meyer, Katja Maria", "last_name_ssi": "Meyer", "middle_name_ssi": "Maria", "first_name_ssi": "Katja", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lee Kump", "Lee Kump", "Katherine Haines Freeman", "Jennifer Macalady", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lee Kump, Dissertation Advisor", "Lee Kump, Committee Chair", "Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Chair", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["euxinia", "Earth system model", "Permian-Triassic boundary", "mass extinction", "hydrogen sulfide", "carotenoid", "biomarker"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "A STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE TWO-COMPONENT RECEIVER DOMAIN OF DCTD FROM SINORHIZOBIUM MELILOTI", "id": "5917", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4132", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To understand the structure/function of response regulator proteins of two-component signal transduction regulatory systems, the crystal structure of a fragment bearing the wild-type DctD receiver domain, as well as the structures for a number of single amino acid substitution variants, have been solved using MAD (Multiwavelength Anomalous Dispersion) and molecular replacement.\nTwo of these substitutions, E121K and K122E, constitutively activate full length DctD as an ATPase and transactivator of s54-dependent transcription from the dctA promoter.  The structures of these mutant proteins reveal inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding rearrangements; however, at room temperature the variant structures are essentially identical to wild-type.  \nN-terminal deletion analysis has shown that only the C-terminal portion of this fragment is necessary to keep DctD inactive.  The structures determined in this thesis reveal that this part of the molecule forms a homodimerization surface, and furthermore, mutations that perturb that surface result in constitutively active DctD.\nEquilibrium and velocity ultracentrifugation experiments confirm that the fragment (aa 2-143) forms a dimer in solution.  Calculated KDs of dimer dissociation increase 10-fold for E121K fragment over wild-type; however, phosphorylation of wild-type fragments shows no apparent dimer loosening.\nImportant hypotheses have been proposed as a result of further study of this novel structure by the Nixon lab. CD spectra suggest a conformational change when constitutive amino acid variant E121K is cooled from 30 \u00baC to 5 \u00baC.  CD spectra suggest a similar temperature-dependent conformational change for the WT 2-143 fragment, but only when it is phosphorylated.  Since removing Mg2+ from the phosphorylated E121K receiver domain decreased its dephosphorylation rate to a half-life of ~50 hours, crystallization conditions were developed for rapidly growing crystals from the mixture of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated protein. While this did not yield crystals of phosphorylated protein, the new conditions did reveal E121K crystal structures altered in a way previously not observed for two-component receiver domains, which involve altered contacts between subunits of the DctD receiver domain dimer. This second conformation is hypothesized to be involved in DctD's structural mechanism of activation, though per se it is not believed to represent the active state.\nFinally, crystals of wild-type and the E121K variant of the DctD receiver domain were soaked in conditions that in solution yield phosphorylated protein. Using protein from single crystals to provide material for mass spectrometry, evidence of carbamylation was obtained but no phosphorylation was detectable. Carbamylation was expected to occur more slowly than phosphorylation from the solution studies. New results from Park and Nixon using BeF3 suggest that a totally different dimer may represent the active state of DctD.\nIn summary, this work defines a novel dimeric structure for two component receiver domains that is used in DctD to maintain the full length protein in its 'off-state'. Together with the new results of others in the lab, this work provides a model for activation in which phosphorylation of the receiver domain dramatically alters partitioning between two distinctly different dimeric structures. Sequence analysis suggests that this mechanism may be relevant to 4.5% of all two component response regulators. This is a major accomplishment, because two-component signal transduction is the most prevalent form of signalling among cells living in the earth's biosphere.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4111], "author_name_tesi": "Meyer, Matthew Geoffrey", "last_name_ssi": "Meyer", "middle_name_ssi": "Geoffrey", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel J Cosgrove", "Ming Tien", "B Tracy Nixon", "Jean Elnora Brenchley", "Song Tan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel J Cosgrove, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Chair", "Jean Elnora Brenchley, Committee Member", "Song Tan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["x-ray crystallography", "transcription activation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "analyzing the state of lithospheric stress in greater thailand through finite element modeling", "id": "22674", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10242", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Thailand and its surrounding regions occupy an important, but often overlooked, setting in terms of plate tectonics and lithospheric deformation.

It is not solely about contemporary education finance issues, such as equity, equality or adequacy, but assumes that resources are a better way to measure the provision of equal opportunity rather than dollars alone. Non-monetary resources profoundly affect education, and knowing how they are distributed and used will effectively enhance learning and help understand how to best minimize gaps in opportunity. \nThe study findings reveal that there are opportunity gaps emanating from non-monetary resource allocations between Higher Socio-Economic Status (HSES) and Lower Socio Economic Status (LSES) cluster elementary schools within the district.

These materials, which are used in capacitors, are a critical component in many electrical systems.  Here, the development of dielectric energy storage materials for pulsed power applications, which require materials with the ability to accumulate a large amount of energy and then deliver it to the system rapidly, is explored.\nThe amount of electrostatic energy that can be stored by a material is a function of the induced polarization and the dielectric breakdown strength of the material.  An ideal energy storage dielectric would possess a high relative permittivity, high dielectric breakdown strength, and low loss tangent under high applied electric fields.  The bismuth pyrochlores are a compositionally tunable family of materials that meet these requirements.  \nThin films of cubic pyrochlore bismuth zinc niobate, bismuth zinc tantalate, and bismuth zinc niobate tantalate, were fabricated using a novel solution chemistry based upon the Pechini method.  This solution preparation is advantageous because it avoids the use of teratogenic solvents, such as 2-methoxyethanol.  Crystalline films fabricated using this solution chemistry had very small grains that were approximately 27 nm in lateral size and 35 nm through the film thickness.  Impedance measurements found that the resistivity of the grain boundaries was two orders of magnitude higher than the resistivity of the grain interior.  The presence of many resistive grain boundaries impeded conduction through the films, resulting in high breakdown strengths for these materials.   \nIn addition to high breakdown strengths, this family of materials exhibited moderate relative permittivities of between 55 \u00b1 2 and 145 \u00b1 5, for bismuth zinc tantalate and bismuth zinc niobate, respectively, and low loss tangents on the order of 0.0008 \u00b1 0.0001.  Increases in the concentration of the tantalum end member increased the dielectric breakdown strength.  For example, at 10 kHz, the room temperature breakdown strength of bismuth zinc niobate, Bi1.5Zn0.9Nb1.5O6.9, was 5.1 MV/cm, while the 10 kHz breakdown strength of bismuth zinc tantalate, Bi1.5Zn0.9Ta1.5O6.9, was 6.1 MV/cm.  This combination of a high breakdown strength and a moderate permittivity led to a high discharged energy storage density for all film compositions.  For example, at a measurement frequency of 10 kHz, bismuth zinc niobate exhibited a maximum recoverable energy storage density of 60.8 \u00b1 2.0 J/cm3, while bismuth zinc tantalate exhibited a recoverable energy storage density of 60.7 \u00b1 2.0 J/cm3.  Intermediate compositions of bismuth zinc niobate tantalate were explored to maximize the energy storage density of the substitutional solid solution.  At an optimized concentration of ten mole percent tantalum, the maximum recoverable 10 kHz energy storage density was ~66.9 \u00b1 2.4 J/cm3.  These films of bismuth zinc niobate tantalate (Bi1.5Zn0.9Nb1.35Ta0.15O6.9) sustained a maximum field of 5.5 MV/cm at 10 kHz, and demonstrated a relative permittivity of 122 \u00b1 4.  The films maintained a high energy storage density above 20 J/cm3 though temperatures of 200\u00b0C.\nThe second major objective of this work was to integrate complex oxides processed at temperatures below 350\u00b0C onto flexible polyimide substrates for potential use in flexible energy storage applications.  Nanocomposite films consisting of a nanocrystalline fluorite related to delta-bismuth oxide in an amorphous matrix were prepared by reducing the citric acid concentration of the precursor solution, relative to the crystalline films.  These solutions were batched with the composition Bi1.5Zn0.9Nb1.35Ta0.15O6.9.  The nanocomposite had a relative permittivity of 50 \u00b1 2 and dielectric losses on the order of 0.03 \u00b1 0.01.  For measurement frequencies of 1 kHz and 10 kHz, the nanocomposite demonstrated a breakdown strength of 3.8 MV/cm, and a room-temperature energy storage density of approximately 40.2 \u00b1 1.7 J/cm3.  To determine the suitability of the nanocomposite films for use in flexible applications, free-standing flexible nanocomposite films underwent repetitive compressive and tensile bending around a minimum bend diameter of 7 mm, which corresponded to a strain of 0.10%.  After bending the films 30,000 times, the energy storage density of the films was unchanged, indicating that nanocomposite bismuth zinc niobate tantalate films may be suitable for flexible energy storage applications.\nTo demonstrate the broader applicability of the nanocomposite approach to developing energy storage dielectrics at low processing temperatures, films of nanocomposite lead titanate, Pb1.1TiO3.1, were deposited using an inverted mixing order solution preparation, and annealed at a maximum temperature of 400\u00b0C.  X-ray diffraction indicated the presence of nanocrystalline ordering, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the nucleation of isolated nanocrystals of lead oxide in an amorphous lead titanate matrix.  The lead titanate nanocomposite demonstrated a relative permittivity of 33 \u00b1 1 and a low loss tangent of 0.0008 \u00b1 0.0001.  The 10 kHz breakdown strength of the material was 5.0 MV/cm, resulting in an energy storage density of 28.4 \u00b1 1.2 J/cm3.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11001], "author_name_tesi": "Michael, Elizabeth Kathleen", "last_name_ssi": "Michael", "middle_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Clive A Randall", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Thomas R Shrout", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Dissertation Advisor", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member", "Thomas R Shrout, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dielectric energy storage", "pyrochlore", "thin film", "bismuth zinc niobate", "nanocomposite", "flexible electronics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SOCIAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES UNDERLYING SENSATION-SEEKING AND BEHAVIORAL INHIBITION: POTENTIAL MECHANISMS LINKING PERSONALITY TO HEALTH", "id": "12157", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3366", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sensation-seeking and behavioral inhibition are two behavioral traits that have distinct biological profiles as well as distinct mental and physical health outcomes. These behavioral traits and health outcomes are also influenced by life experiences. This dissertation explores the hormonal, immune, and social underpinnings of sensation-seeking and behavioral inhibition in humans and in rats, to provide insight into how these traits might contribute to certain health outcomes, specifically depression. \nChapter 1 is a broad overview of sensation-seeking, behavioral inhibition, and the biological and sociological contributors to these traits. Chapter 2 is a review of temperamental traits in animals and the utility of animal models to study the relationship between personality and immune function and health, which provides the basis for the animal-human comparisons made in the following chapters.  \nChapter 3 describes a study based on an animal model, Sprague-Dawley rats, to investigate how innate and adaptive immune responses to antigen differ between exploratory versus inhibited rats. Results showed that inhibited animals had a greater innate response to lipopolysaccharide but a lower adaptive immune response as evidenced by lower delayed-type hypersensitivity in response to re-exposure to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. This evidence suggests a TH2 bias in the immune system of inhibited rats. \nChapter 4 examined the hormonal underpinnings of sensation-seeking in young women and assessed how these relationships were moderated by gender role identification. Results from this study showed that androstenedione, a hormone previously unexplored in regards to sensation-seeking, was associated with sensation-seeking in women. The direction of the association, however, was dependent on identification with gender role \u2013 positive in women who identified as more masculine or with no gender role, and negative in women who identified as more feminine. There was no association in women who identified as both masculine and feminine. \nChapter 5 uses a similar method to Chapter 4, but added C-reactive protein as a marker of inflammation, and men were recruited as participants as well as women. These additions allowed for a comparison between men and women, as well as examining one of the major physiological factors involved with depression \u2013 inflammation. Results showed that Thrill and Adventure Seeking was protective against depression in both men and women. Furthermore, CRP was associated with sensation-seeking, but again the direction of the association was dependent on gender role: positive in masculine women and negative in feminine women.

First, Yucatan Spanish has been in contact with an indigenous language, Yucatec Mayan, for 500 years. Second, Yucatan has been historically isolated from the linguistic trends of the rest of Mexico.\nAt present, this isolation is rapidly diminishing with the influx of immigrants from central Mexico; this environment has fostered a strong sense of local identity within the Yucatan. Importantly, Yucatan Spanish is currently at a crossroads, as an important demographic shift is accompanied by equally rapid linguistic changes.\nPrevious studies of the dialect have identified several phonetic variables as representative of the dialect. These include: final labialized nasals [m]; lack of the Spanish stop-fricative alternation in favor of stops [b d g]; the aspiration of voiceless stops (data from (k) is examined here); and the maintenance of hiatus across word boundaries via the insertion of glottal stops. Data was collected in the Yucatan with the goal of examining the correlation of these linguistic variables and social factors.\nUsing sociolinguistic interview techniques, the researcher interviewed 40 speakers of Yucatan Spanish balanced for gender, age, and social class. Knowledge of the Mayan language was also examined. Data analysis demonstrated two competing trends in Yucatan Spanish. All variables except one are decreasing in frequency as the dialect adopts pan-Hispanic norms. The remaining variable, [m], shows increased use among middle-aged and\nyounger speakers, as the regional variant [m] is adopted and extended as a marker of local identity in the face of increased immigration, especially for women who are obtaining more education and entering the workforce. Both gender and age are\nconsistently important factors in the use of Yucatan variants. Likewise, all of the typical\nYucatan variants correlated with knowledge of Mayan, lending weight to the argument that these variants are due to prolonged contact and linguistic convergence.

Primordial stars are likely to be very massive &#8805;30M&#8857;, form in isolation, and will\nlikely leave black holes as remnants in the centers of their host dark matter halos. We expect primordial stars to form in halos in the mass range 10^6 &#8722;10^10M&#8857;. Some of these early black holes, formed at redshifts z>10, could be the seed black hole for a significant fraction of the supermassive black holes found in galaxies in the local universe. If the black hole descendants of the primordial stars exist, their mergers with nearby supermassive black holes may be a prime candidate for long wavelength gravitational wave\ndetectors. We simulate formation and evolution of dark matter halos in LambdaCDM universe. We seed high-redshift dark matter halos with early black holes, and explore the merger history of the host halos and the implications of black hole\u2019s kick velocities arising from their coalescence. The central concentration of low mass early black holes in present day galaxies is reduced if they experience even moderate kicks of tens of kms&#8722;1. Even such modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their parent halo, which consequently leads\nto dynamical friction being less effective on the low mass black holes that were ejected, compared to those still embedded in their parent halos. Therefore, merger rates with central supermassive black holes in the largest halos may be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. Using analytical and illustrative cosmological N\u2013body simulations,\nwe quantify the role of kicks on the merger rates of black holes formed from massive metal free stars with supermassive black holes in present day galaxies. Most studies of the cosmological growth and merger history of black holes have used semianalytic models and have concentrated on SMBH growth in luminous galaxies. We have developed a \u201dhybrid method\u201d that combines high resolution cosmological Nbody simulations for the halos\u2019 merger history, with semi-analytical recipes for BH pair dynamics and BH gas accretion. We track the assembly of black holes over a large range of final masses \u2013 from seed black holes to SMBHs \u2013 over widely varying dynamical histories. We used the dynamics of dark matter halos to track the evolution of seed black holes in three different gas accretion scenarios. We have found that growth of a Sagittarius A* - size SMBH reaches its maximum mass MSMBH=10^6 M&#8857; at z&#8764;6 through early gaseous accretion episodes, after which it stays at near constant mass. At the same redshift, the duty-cycle of the host AGN ends, hence redshift z=6 marks the transition from an AGN to a starburst galaxy which eventually becomes the Milky Way. By tracking black hole growth as a function of time and mass, we estimate that\nthe IMBH merger rate reaches a maximum of Rmax=55 yr&#8722;1 at z=11. From IMBH merger rates we calculate the number density of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULX) to be NULX=7 per Milky Way type galaxy per redshift in redshift range 2<z<6. We model gravitational wave signatures for various SMBH growth scenarios and find that the future gravitational observatory LISA, will be able to detect mergers of massive black holes up to redshift z=5. We also analyse how the merger rate changes if various suppression mechanisms are implemented in merger rates and find that low seed\nformation rate will substantially decrease the overall merger rate to &#8764; 10 per year; low efficiency in dynamical friction will influence low redshift merger rates; and gravitational\nrecoil from the mergers will eject high redshift black holes from their host halos.

Two experiments investigated four possible mechanisms of this effect: Free will belief (this refers to the degree to which a person feels he or she is in full conscious control of their every thought and action), rational thought (a mode of processing that is deliberate and rational), experiential thought (a mode of processing that is  automatic and largely emotion-based), and locus of control (which  refers to the degree that one feels he or she is in control of their actions \u2013 internal locus \u2013 or that his or her actions are primarily controlled by external forces \u2013 external locus). These mechanisms were chosen to (a) test the possibility that the free will manipulations used in the past might be confounded with concepts related to rational and experiential thought, which have been related to moral decisions in other paradigms; and (b) to test the idea posed by other authors that reduction in free will belief leads to less moral behavior because feelings of control have been undermined. Additionally, this work sought to extend these findings to utilitarian moral dilemmas \u2013 an unexplored domain in the context of free will research.\n To manipulate free will belief, participants saw 15 sentences to prime either free will or deterministic beliefs. To assess mechanisms, participants rated their free will belief, rational-experiential thought, and locus of control. Then, participants completed two measures of morality: helping intentions and approval of utilitarian actions.  In Experiment 1, corroborating past work, undermining free will belief reduced helping behavior. Additionally, self-reported free will belief tended to mediate this effect, but not rational thought, experiential thought, or locus of control. Extending this work, in Study 2, priming determinism led to greater approval of utilitarian decisions relative to free will, but free will belief did not significantly mediate this effect. Furthermore, neither rational or experiential thought, nor locus of control were supported as mediators. These results indicate that deterministic beliefs promote utilitarian action, and that these effects are not due to differences in self-reported rational or experiential thought, or locus of control. Additionally, this work suggests that undermining free will belief may not always result in less moral outcomes, as utilitarian decisions involve a degree of moral ambiguity and require that one prioritize either individual morality or the well-being of a group.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9380], "author_name_tesi": "Middlewood, Brianna Lia", "last_name_ssi": "Middlewood", "middle_name_ssi": "Lia", "first_name_ssi": "Brianna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Gasper", "Reginald Adams Jr.", "Susan Mohammed"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Gasper, Thesis Advisor", "Reginald Adams Jr., Thesis Advisor", "Susan Mohammed, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Free Will", "Determinism", "Morality", "Decisions"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "IF YOU\u2019RE NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST US, THEN YOU\u2019RE AGAINST US: PERCEPTIONS OF INDIFFERENCE", "id": "13838blm266", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13838", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project examines how advocates perceive the indifference of others toward their cause.  Two experiments examine (1) how modifiability and norm-compatibility appraisals might influence whether indifference is a sign of rejection and therefore threatening and (2) how advocates respond to this rejection in terms of anger, sadness, distress, and interest.  Experiment 1 suggested that less norm-compatible indifference is more threatening (i.e. indicative of criticism) and evokes anger, sadness, and less interest. Experiment 2 attempts to address the confounded nature of norm-compatibility and modifiability revealed in Experiment 1, and while the confound remains, the data suggest that indifference that cannot be easily changed is also more threatening, and reveals links between anger, derogation, and confrontation, but also between interest and confrontation. \nAccording to the literature on rejection and appraisal theories of emotion, appraisals of norm-compatibility and modifiability are important for understanding situations that may signal rejection. When faced with an indifferent person, the extent to which advocates appraise indifference as norm-compatible will inform whether the indifference is also seen as criticism. Less norm-compatible indifference (i.e., not ok, unacceptable, and unreasonable) will be seen as more critical of the cause than more norm-compatible indifference (ok, acceptable, reasonable), though indifference in general is expected to be seen as more critical compared to support for the cause. To the extent advocates appraise modifiability as low (i.e., they are not able to change the person\u2019s mind), the advocate might feel threatened based on this lack of ability and thus be more likely to perceive indifference as a criticism.\nIn experiment 1, participants were screened and recruited based on their level of passion for a cause. Using a paradigm in which participants believed they were reading the opinion of a fellow participant,1 manipulated both the norm-compatibility of the indifference (or, in a third condition, showed the participant a fellow supporter) and modifiability of the participant to examine how these appraisals shape the perception of indifference as threatening.  The norm-compatibility of the indifference was manipulated by using more or less norm-compatible reasons for indifference, and had large effects on the degree to which indifference was seen as indicating criticism.  Less norm-compatible indifference evoked more anger and sadness, and less interest than more norm-compatible indifference.  Participants experienced self-doubt in their ability to persuade people about their cause in response to the modifiability manipulation, but this did not impact how they perceived indifference as a criticism.\nOne issue with Experiment 1 was a confound between norm-compatibility and modifiability.  Specifically, manipulation checks suggested that the reasons for being indifferent differed not only in how norm-compatible they were but also in how modifiable they were.  It is possible therefore that modifiability was manipulated in two ways: First by altering the participant\u2019s expectations about their ability to change their ostensible partner, and second by altering the indifferent partner\u2019s actual changeability.  To understand how the modifiability of the indifference affects the perception of indifference as a criticism (and ultimately a sign of rejection), Experiment 2 explicitly manipulated the modifiability of the indifferent partner, by making the partner more or less open to learning more about the cause.  As expected, the less modifiable partner was perceived to have more critical, negative views of the cause than the more modifiable partner, and evoked more sadness, anger, distress, and less interest.  This manipulation did not completely resolve the confound, however, suggesting that there may be a fundamental connection between seeing someone\u2019s opinion as more or less changeable and more or less acceptable.  \nBoth experiments indicate that indifference is a sign that someone has critical views of the cause, and is therefore threatening to those who support a cause.  Specifically, this work suggest that less norm-compatible and less modifiable indifferent people are seen as more critical of the cause. This evokes anger and sadness in advocates, and, in turn, the desire to confront, derogate, and assign negative tasks to partners. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13988], "author_name_tesi": "Middlewood, Brianna Lia", "last_name_ssi": "Middlewood", "middle_name_ssi": "Lia", "first_name_ssi": "Brianna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Gasper", "Karen Gasper", "Janet Swim", "Mel Mark", "Mary Beth Oliver"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Gasper, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Gasper, Committee Chair", "Janet Swim, Committee Member", "Mel Mark, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Oliver, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Indifference", "Appraisal Theory of Emotion", "Social Psychology", "Emotion-perception"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "THE COHOMOLOGICAL EQUATION AND REPRESENTATION THEORY", "id": "6947", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1431", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this thesis is to explore the use of representation theory to prove some new results concerning the solvability of the cohomological equation for certain homogeneous actions on G / H, where H is always a lattice.

Lynch, Thesis Advisor\n\nThe rapid increase of the global population, especially in the developing countries requires an increase in crop productivity to meet with current demands. However, in these countries several factors limit crop yields, especially low soil fertility and drought. In most of the countries in Latin America and Africa, more than half of the cultivated areas are affected by low phosphorus availability. Most of existing cultivars are not suitable for these unfavorable soils. The majority of the farmers in these regions cannot afford the application of chemical fertilizers to improve their soil fertility. Therefore, there is a need to identify root traits conferring phosphorus acquisition efficiency and to develop cultivars adapted to phosphorus stressed soils.\nRoot architectural phenes enhancing topsoil foraging are important for phosphorus acquisition. Here we describe the utility of a novel phene, basal root whorl number (BRWN), that has significant effects on topsoil foraging in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Whorls are defined as distinct tiers of basal roots that emerge in a tetrarch fashion along the base of the hypocotyl. In this study, wild and cultivated bean taxa as well as a Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) population were screened for BRWN and basal root number (BRN). A set of 6 RILs contrasting for BRWN was evaluated for performance under low phosphorus availability in the greenhouse and in the field. In the greenhouse, plants were grown in a sand-soil media with low or high phosphorus availability. In the field, plants were grown in an Oxisol in Mozambique under low and moderate phosphorus availability. Wild bean accessions tended to have one or two BRWN whereas cultivated accessions had BRWN reaching 4 and sometimes 5. BRWN and BRN did not vary with phosphorus availability, i.e. BRWN was not a plastic trait in these genotypes. Greater BRWN was beneficial for phosphorus acquisition in low phosphorus soils. Genotypes with greater BRWN had almost twice the shoot biomass, greater root length (90 cm vs. 50 cm length), and greater leaf area (1.7 m2 vs. 0.89 m2) than related genotypes with less BRWN. In low phosphorus soil, shoot phosphorus content was strongly correlated with BRWN (r2= 0.64 in the greenhouse and r2=0.88 in the field). Genotypes with three whorls had shallower root systems with a greater range of basal root growth angles  (from 10 to 45 degrees from horizontal) than genotypes with two whorls (which ranged from 60 to 85 degrees from horizontal). Our results indicate that BRWN is associated with increased phosphorus acquisition and that this trait may have value for selection of genotypes with better performance in low phosphorus soils.\nIn addition, we performed a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for BRWN using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from two populations. Basal Root Whorl Number (BRWN) is a root architectural trait in common bean that plays an important role in soil exploration and resource acquisition. BRWN varies from one to five among bean genotypes, and is an important determinant of basal root number (BRN), with each whorl typically forming four basal roots. The objective of this study was to perform a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for BRWN and BRN using two populations of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from the crosses DOR364 x G19833 and G2333 x G19839. Phenotypic data on the number of basal root whorls and number of basal roots was measured on seedlings 3 days after imbibition. QTL analysis for basal root whorl number and total basal root number was performed using composite interval mapping in these two populations using four phenotypic datasets. We found a total of 23 QTL associated with BRWN and BRN in the two populations. In the DOR364 x G19833 RIL population, we found 3 QTL in the first dataset with one QTL controlling 14.6% of the variation. For the fourth dataset, we found 7 QTL with one QTL controlling 23.8% of the variation in BRWN. For BRN, we detected 3 QTL in the 2005 dataset with one QTL controlling 13.7% of the variation. In the fouth dataset, we found 7 QTL on 5 linkage groups. One of the QTL on linkage group B7 controlled 25.9% of all the variation for BRN in that population. Variability in BRWN in the G2333 x G19839 RIL population was controlled by only one locus on linkage group B3. For basal root number in the DOR364 x G19833 RIL population, we detected 4 QTL on B3, B6 and B7 in the first trial, and two QTL on B2 in the second trial. No QTL was found in the third trial. For the fourth dataset we found one QTL in linkage group B3 controlling 19.3% of the variation in BRWN. This proportion of variation explained by relatively few loci suggests that the potential for genetic manipulation of these traits via these locus is very good. As we have observed in the results of QTL analysis of phenotypic data from four different data sets over the years, QTL were detected in different parts of the genome.  It appears that there are several regions which contain QTL or genes that can contribute to the development of basal roots.\nWe also tested the hypothesis of the existence of synergetic effect between root characteristics responsible for nutrient acquisition efficiency in Common bean. Multiple root traits affect phosphorus acquisition, including root hair length and density (RHLD), and basal root growth angle (BRGA). Shallow BRGA is an important trait for phosphorus acquisition efficiency by enhancing topsoil foraging, since in most soils, phosphorus is concentrated in the topsoil. Root hairs substantially increase phosphorus acquisition by expanding the soil volume subject to phosphorus depletion through diffusion. We hypothesized that shallow BRGA and long root hairs are synergetic for phosphorus acquisition, meaning their combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this hypothesis by quantifying the effect of root hairs and basal root growth angle alone and in combination among closely related genotypes. We established a set of field experiments with Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grouped in four distinct root phenotypes: long root hairs and shallow basal roots; long root hairs and deep basal roots; short root hairs and shallow basal roots; and short root hairs and deep basal roots. Results revealed substantial synergism between the two phenes. Long root hairs increased shoot biomass under phosphorus stress by 89.3% while shallow roots increased shoot biomass by 57.7%. Genotypes with both long root hairs and shallow roots had the greatest biomass accumulation, 298% greater than short-haired, deep-rooted phenotypes. Shoot biomass and phosphorus content of genotypes with long root hairs on deep roots and shoot biomass of genotypes with short root hairs on shallow roots did not differ, but were greater than those of genotypes with short root hairs on deep roots. We conclude that the morphological phene of longer root hairs and the architectural phene of shallower basal root growth are synergetic for phosphorus acquisition.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3944], "author_name_tesi": "Miguel, Magalhaes Amade", "last_name_ssi": "Miguel", "middle_name_ssi": "Amade", "first_name_ssi": "Magalhaes", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "Barbara Jane Christ"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch, Dissertation Advisor", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Chair", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Member", "Barbara Jane Christ, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["basal root whorls", "phosphorus", "common bean", "root architecture", "QTL analysis", "synergism."]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Gambling on Conflict: Foreign Direct Investors and Political Violence in Developing Countries\n", "id": "11594", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "373", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the past two decades foreign direct investment (FDI) has become as important as, if not more important than, international trade in the global economy.  FDI constitutes a major source of capital, particularly in developing countries, where FDI inflows as a share of GDP rose from only 10% in 1980 to approximately one third in 2005.  Scholars have found FDI to be important for the quality of democracy, political stability, economic growth, and various aspects of human welfare.  It is, therefore, important to understand the determinants of the global and within-country distribution of FDI flows, while continuing to study the effects of this distribution on development outcomes, individual wellbeing, and the political environment. \nIn conflict situations, even small shifts in the balance of power can change outcomes drastically.  Capital inflows through FDI likely affect this balance of power.  Yet, the within-country distribution of FDI flows during conflict episodes has so far been overlooked in scholarly work.  This lack of attention can be attributed to the conventional wisdom that foreign investors simply do not go to conflict countries.  Why would they?  The advantages they seek, ranging from inexpensive labor to friendly policies, are present in most developing countries.  \nIn my dissertation, I debunk this myth.  I first establish that sizable amounts of FDI continue to flow to developing countries throughout episodes of conflict.  Evidence shows that at least some investors stay on and rebuild in environments with high political violence risk, like Columbia, Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone.  Furthermore, FDI to conflict countries is not confined to the extractive sector, which, arguably, offers the fewest options when selecting foreign affiliate locations. This reality naturally raises the question: what differentiates foreign investors who withstand political violence from those who flee?  \nIn the first part of the dissertation, I offer a theory of investors\u2019 reactions to conflict and a set of empirical models that predict firm perceptions of threat from political violence, as well as location decisions. Starting with the premise that firms are heterogeneous, I identify two investment characteristics\u2014intensity of non-physical assets and location substitutability\u2014that reduce firms\u2019 sensitivity to conflict.  A set of empirical models using survey responses of foreign investors support my hypotheses.  I also develop an industry-level argument for FDI reactions to conflict, which I test on a new data set of industry-specific FDI flows.\nIn the second part of the dissertation, I explore the role of FDI in conflict processes, particularly the onset of civil conflict.  The argument and analyses here continue to account for differences among foreign direct investors: both the investors\u2019 socio-economic effects and their incentives and ability to overcome the collective action problem vary across types of FDI.  These effects and incentives, in turn, influence the dynamics of civil conflict.  Investment characteristics thus condition the impacts of FDI penetration on the initiation of civil conflict.   The accumulation of foreign production capital in the primary sector (mining and agriculture industries) tends to increase the probability of civil conflict, while services sector FDI tends to reduce it.  Manufacturing investments appear to have no significant effect on conflict.\nThis project offers the first theory and empirical test of foreign firms\u2019 reactions to political violence contingent on the attributes of their investment.  After establishing that investments do flow to conflict-affected countries, I explore the effect of industry-specific foreign capital on the onset of civil conflict.  For political scientists, this project opens new avenues for research, inviting further analyses of the role of foreign investors in conflict processes and in politics more broadly.  The project also offers an important lesson to political actors: the blanket approach to attracting FDI ought to be reconsidered.  Some investors need stronger incentives than others when faced with the risk of political violence; at the same time, some investors can help alleviate this risk, while others exacerbate it through their presence.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [368], "author_name_tesi": "Mihalache, Andreea Stefania", "last_name_ssi": "Mihalache", "middle_name_ssi": "Stefania", "first_name_ssi": "Andreea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["D Scott Bennett", "D Scott Bennett", "Quan Li", "Douglas William Lemke", "Subhanan Mukherjee", "Andres Rodriguez Clare"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["D Scott Bennett, Dissertation Advisor", "D Scott Bennett, Committee Chair", "Quan Li, Committee Member", "Douglas William Lemke, Committee Member", "Subhanan Mukherjee, Committee Member", "Andres Rodriguez Clare, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multinational corporations and conflict", "political risk management", "political risk", "industry-level FDI", "conflict", "political violence", "Foreign direct investment", "civil conflict", "location substitutability", "intensity of non-physical assets"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Essays On Russian Economic Geography: Measuring Spatial Inefficiency", "id": "6363", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6252", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Compared with other transition countries Russia faces the burden of extreme cold. This is not, however, strictly a function of geography. Soviet location policy directly affected the average (population weighted) temperature of the Russian economy. Soviet policy moved industry and population from the western part of the country to the east, effectively making Russia even colder than it was in the pre-Soviet era. Movements to the east have the significant impact on aggregate temperature because the isotherms on the Eurasian continent resemble lines of longitude, not latitude. Thus, the Russian economy entering transition faces not only the usual burden of an inhospitable Russian climate, but also suffers from the extra disadvantage due to the legacy of Soviet location policy. \n\nIn this thesis I estimate the cost to Russian economy of the inefficient spatial allocation of its productive resources. Spatial inefficiency can result not only in added production and distribution costs --- when regional comparative advantages are not exploited and unnecessary transportation and communication expenditures are incurred --- but also the wrong allocation of labor brings inefficiency in consumption: there are extra costs associated with people living in unsuitable places. In the Russian context, ``unsuitable\" usually means ``too far\" <i>and</i> ``too cold.\"  I focus on the ``cost of cold,\" or precisely, the cost of production being <i>wrongly</i> located in places with a climate too cold. \n\nThe first essay is a counterfactual exercise. To obtain a benchmark of spatial efficiency, I construct an allocation of industry and population that would result in Russia in the absence of Soviet location policy.\nTo design such an allocation, I impose Canadian behavior on Russian initial conditions. I estimate a spatial dynamic model on Canadian regional panel data in a multinomial logit framework. I then project the estimated relationship onto Russia. The result is a hypothetical allocation of population and industry, specific to Russia's endowment and initial conditions, but free of any disadvantages stemming from Russian historical circumstances. \n\nThis procedure, however, ignores the effect of WWII --- a major exogenous shock to Russian economy with no precedent in Canada. We should expect that war would have an impact on industry allocation irrespective of economic or political system. To account for the possible effects of WWII I conduct a separate simulation exercise, taking into account the fact that the war was fought primarily in the west. The results of this exercise show that the eastern part of Russia is still significantly overdeveloped --- in other words, WWII explains only a small part of the misallocation.\n\nI construct an index of Temperature Per Capita (TPC) to capture the effect of location on aggregate temperature. Unlike other temperature indicators widely used in empirical growth literature, TPC is obtained by aggregating the temperature readings not over the territory, but over the population distribution. Thus, it provides more informative measure of temperature-related comparative advantages or disadvantages of the economy, especially in short-run. I use the estimated allocation of population to construct the counterfactual TPC. The comparison with the actual TPC reveals that due to Soviet location policy Russia has become about 1.5 degrees Celsius ``colder.\"\n\nIn the second essay I estimate the cost of cold directly. The most profound consequences of cold are extra energy use, added construction costs, health effects and productivity loss. Using Russian regional data on energy use, health and production I estimate the elasticity of each of these factors with respect to temperature. I then use these elasticities together with the TPC indices of the actual and the projected allocation to estimate the extra burden of cold that resulted from the Soviet location policy. \n\nThe results show strong and significant effect of cold on all the factors examined. An increase in TPC of 1.5 degrees would have improved aggregate health indicators: average infant mortality rate would have been 1.5% lower, country-wide aggregate mortality rate --- at least 0.8% lower. The estimations for construction industry reveal a 3.5% productivity loss in the actual allocation compared to the counterfactual.\n\nThe most significant impact of cold is on energy consumption. Cross-sectional analysis reveals that consumption of various kinds of energy by manufacturing producers increases 2.5 to 4% when January temperature drops 1C. Thus, 1.5C TPC difference between the actual and counterfactual allocations translates into 3.5-6% industrial energy consumption increase country-wide. The similar results were obtained for the residential energy consumption: various estimates point on 6 to 9% total energy loss due to the misallocation of population. The cost of extra energy consumption and the loss of construction productivity amount to 1.2% to 2.1% of Russian GDP yearly.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6252], "author_name_tesi": "Mikhailova, Tatiana N.", "last_name_ssi": "Mikhailova", "middle_name_ssi": "N.", "first_name_ssi": "Tatiana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barry William Ickes", "N Edward Coulson", "Regina Smyth", "Eric Bond"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barry William Ickes, Committee Chair", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member", "Regina Smyth, Committee Member", "Eric Bond, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["russia", "industrial location", "migration", "cold"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF FOXO3A AS A SUPPRESSOR OF LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA\n", "id": "11586", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4820", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lung tumor development is believed to occur through a step-wise series of molecular changes that influence cell growth and survival. This process is facilitated by tobacco smoke which contains numerous carcinogens known to induce gene mutation and chromosomal instability (CIN). However, we have a poor understanding of the genes involved in lung cancer development. The FOXO family of transcription factors has been shown to elicit cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and resistance to various physiologic and pathologic stresses relevant to sporadic cancer, such as DNA damage and oxidative stress.  Although implicated as tumor suppressors, FOXO genetic inactivation has not been observed in human cancer.  In an investigation of the two major types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) we have identified the FOXO3a gene (FOXO3a) as a novel target of deletion in human lung adenocarcinoma (LAC). Bi-allelic or homozygous deletion (HD) of FOXO3a was detected in 8 out of 33 (24.2%) mostly early-stage LAC of smokers. Another 60.6% of these tumors had losses of FOXO3a not reaching the level of HD (hereafter referred to as sub-HD).  In contrast, no HD of FOXO3a was observed in 19 lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSqCC), but sub-HDs were evident. Consistent with the deletion of FOXO3a were corresponding decreases in its mRNA and protein levels in LAC. FOXO3a\u2019s ability to induce apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in response to carcinogens was also investigated in LAC cell lines. The carcinogen (+)-anti-7,8-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BPDE) is strongly implicated as a cause of human lung cancer. Here we have demonstrated that FOXO3a is functionally activated and augments caspase-dependent apoptosis in cells exposed to this DNA-damaging carcinogen. Consistent with this result was the FOXO3a-dependent upregulation of pro-apoptotic effectors BIM, BNIP3 and FASL with treatment. These results implicate FOXO3a in the elimination of carcinogen-damaged cells, a role consistent with the suppression of LAC carcinogenesis, and one frequently lost through gene deletion in LAC development. \nInefficient methods of treatment lie among the main causes for poor response rates among patients who undergo lung cancer therapy. Docetaxel and vinorelbine are common anti-mitotic drugs used in second line therapy of several cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma. These drugs include taxanes and vinca alkaloids, which induce mitotic arrest by disrupting mitotic spindle function. Previous studies in breast cancer and colon cancer cells have shown that FOXO3a stimulates apoptosis, a pro-therapeutic effect, in cells exposed to taxanes. Consequently, we investigated the role of FOXO3a in the cellular response to anti-mitotic agents in LAC cells, as this function would be lost in LAC as a consequence of gene deletion. MTS assays revealed that FOXO3a transfection causes a significant decrease in the number of viable LAC cells (both A549 and H460 cell lines) upon treatment with two different anti-mitotics, docetaxel and vinorelbine. Unlike treatment with BPDE, annexin-PE and western blot analysis of various caspases showed only a modest stimulation of apoptosis in response to anti-mitotics in LAC cells expressing exogenous FOXO3a. Consistent with this result, RT-PCR expression analysis of known pro-apoptotic effectors of FOXO3a (BIM, BNIP and FASL) showed no increase in mRNA levels following treatment. Interestingly, cell cycle analysis of A549 and H460 LAC cell lines treated with anti-mitotic agents showed a pronounced reduction in G2/M fraction in cells expressing FOXO3a exogenously compared with cells that did not express FOXO3a. RT-PCR analysis of known FOXO3a cell cycle effectors showed no change in  Cyclin-D2 or p27Kip1 expression levels in response to treatment. However, analysis of CDC14A mRNA levels in treated cells show evidence of a pronounced FOXO3a-dependent derepression of this gene\u2019s expression following treatment. CDC14A is known to stimulate exit from mitosis. This potentially accounts for the observed decrease in the G2/M fraction in FOXO3a transfectants treated with anti-mitotic agents. These results suggest a novel pro-therapeutic role for FOXO3a in LAC, which involves the stimulation of mitotic exit of tumor cells with therapeutically induced mitotic spindle defects. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4797], "author_name_tesi": "Mikse, Oliver ", "last_name_ssi": "Mikse", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Oliver", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chris Herzog", "Chris Herzog", "Tim Ritty", "Vincent Chau", "Leslie Joan Parent", "Lisa M Shantz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chris Herzog, Dissertation Advisor", "Chris Herzog, Committee Chair", "Tim Ritty, Committee Member", "Vincent Chau, Committee Member", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CDC14A", "Lung Cancer", "FOXO3A", "Tumor Suppressor"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Winglet Design for the Pipistrel Taurus Electro G2 and Twin-taurus G4 with Performance Comparison made Using Flight-path Optimization.", "id": "16350", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7823", "abstract_tesi": "Winglets have been accepted widely by the aviation community as a means of improving performance.

The Taurus G2 is simulated to experience optimal conditions (zero wind field) in order to predict the energy required to climb to cruising altitude and maximum range.

The first sample investigates the steel industry and its shock in 1990.  The second sample is the hotel industry after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  In the steel industry, the level of firm performance after the shock is strongly related to firm size and negatively related to the percentage of votes held by those affiliated with the firm.  To assess the firm\u2019s ability to mitigate losses when the industry is in a severe downturn, I calculate each firm\u2019s change in performance from prior to the shock to after the shock as compared to the median industry decrease.  Successful performance is positively related to the percentage of insiders on the board of directors.  In the hotel industry, the level of firm performance after the shock is positively related to boards of directors of fewer than nine members and negatively related to the percentage of inside directors.  When measuring the change in performance from before to after the shock, the magnitude of change is positively related to the percentage of inside directors and the existence of staggered terms for directors.  The results suggest that there is a relationship between corporate governance and firm performance in hard times, though in a period of economic shock, it appears that boards of directors with significant insider participation are more successful in adapting to the changing market.  These findings are consistent with prior research by Dallas (2003), suggesting the value of inside directors in enhancing the ability of the board of directors to perform its relational and strategic management roles.\n\nChapter II \u2013 Tracking Stock from Beginning to (almost) End\n        Tracking stock is an equity structure whereby a firm issues stock tied to the performance of a portion of the corporation rather than the entire corporate entity.  Tracking stock was first used in 1985, became more popular in the 1990\u2019s and all but disappeared by 2005.  This study extends prior research by lengthening the time horizon, investigating the market microstructure effects of the abnormal returns, and examining the effects of announcement of the elimination of the tracking stock structure.  The issuance of tracking stock has a positive wealth effect, with a magnitude for announcement of approximately 3% and significant over the three-day event window.  The wealth effects appear to be independent of market microstructure frictions.  The returns are significantly different among the types of tracking stock, which supports increased corporate focus and the reduction in asymmetric information as explanations for the abnormal return to shareholders.  The execution window effect is approximately 2% and significant for reorganization tracking stock.  Execution window returns are insignificant for merger tracking stock.  The announcement of the elimination of tracking stock structure by returning to a single common stock for the entire corporation is not a significant wealth event for the parent firms, but evidences significant excess returns of greater than 10% for the tracking stocks over the three-day event window. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3774], "author_name_tesi": "Miles, Linda L.", "last_name_ssi": "Miles", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Linda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis P Sheehan", "Laura B Field", "Chris Muscarella", "Jenny Xiaoe Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis P Sheehan, Committee Chair", "Laura B Field, Committee Member", "Chris Muscarella, Committee Member", "Jenny Xiaoe Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["board of directors", "exogenous economic shock", "corporate governance", "tracking stock"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "LEARNING THROUGH REFLECTIVE PRACTICE:\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF ADULT BASIC EDUCATION \nPROGRAM MANAGERS\n\n\n", "id": "9201", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3479", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reflective practice is a means towards professional development.

Study participants had at least one child in K-6th grade during the study. All participants resided in one of three communities. Each community was selected because of contrasting makeups in terms of resident levels of education, poverty concentrations, economic prosperity and employment opportunities. I used Lareau\u2019s (2003; 2011) theories related to a cultural logic of childrearing and I asked three guiding questions. First, what are mothers\u2019 perceptions of summer related to learning regression? How do education stakeholders prepare families? How did preparation affect childrearing strategies? I find that the fissure between the school and the home begins even prior to the close of the school year. This anticipation for summer months creates anxieties for mothers who aspire to provide their children with productive out of school experiences, but find them unattainable due to life constraints. I also find that though mothers have intentions for keeping up with school-like activities, these goals are rarely realized. I also asked, how do mothers of varying SES characterize the purpose of their child\u2019s summer vacation; and where does summer vacation \u201cfit\u201d into family life? Regardless of social class, I find that mothers appropriate their own memories from their own histories with summer vacations.

Finally, I asked how can Lareau\u2019s cultural logic of childrearing explain social class reproduction cycles? My findings were not entirely consistent with Lareau\u2019s theory of concerted cultivation and accomplishment of natural growth. As a result, I propose a reconceptualization of child-rearing practices during the summer called leveraged exploration and contingent exploration.

I begin with an examination of actualistic vertebrate faunal assemblages from diverse environments, and representing divergent taphonomic pathways.  Next, I employ these modern paradigms to inform interpretation of a late Pleistocene large mammal fossil assemblage.  I conclude my study by shifting to a more expansive analysis, exploring the relative influences of taphonomy and spatial scale on interpretations of paleoenvironments.  \nIn order to establish actualistic models for fossil assemblages, I studied modern bone assemblages from three different taphonomic pathways in varying environments (grassland/forest mosaic, deciduous forest, and tundra), representing two different ends of the taphonomic continuum.  These actualistic assemblages include scavenged modern bison and deer carcasses lying on the landscape, as well as bones of hunted prey, collected from modern wolf dens.  I utilize statistical comparisons of bone surface damage and skeletal element types to identify differences between these assemblages that can also be identified in fossil assemblages.  I then place the late Pleistocene Heinze Cave large mammal fossil assemblage within these models, quantitatively comparing the assemblage to divergent modern analogs in order to interpret its origins and taphonomic history.  Finally, I employ multivariate statistical techniques to investigate taphonomy\u2019s effect on Late Holocene assemblages at a greater spatial scale.  Specifically, I examine the influence of collection techniques on our ability to extract an environmental gradient, from single-state to multi-state scales.\n\tI find that quantifiable bone damage and element type variations do differentiate landscape and den assemblages, yielding a model that can aid in interpretation of North American late Pleistocene large mammal assemblages.  This model\u2019s application to the taphonomic features of the Heinze Cave assemblage indicate that while one level shares similarities with landscape assemblages and one with den assemblages, none is a perfect match to any actualistic paradigm, suggesting a more complex taphonomic history.  Last, ordination of Late Holocene sites reveals that at a smaller spatial scale (i.e. a single state), taphonomic histories of assemblages exercise a very heavy influence over analysis, concealing environmental differences among sites; at larger spatial scales, conversely, environmental shifts are strong enough to outweigh taphonomic factors, allowing the true gradient to emerge.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11267], "author_name_tesi": "Milideo, Lauren Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Milideo", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Russell W Graham", "Russell W Graham", "Richard B Alley", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY", "Eric S Post"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Russell W Graham, Dissertation Advisor", "Russell W Graham, Committee Chair", "Richard B Alley, Committee Member", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY, Committee Member", "Eric S Post, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vertebrate paleontology", "taphonomy", "paleoecology", "late Pleistocene", "late Holocene"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Evaluating controls on crevasse-splay growth in modern and ancient fluvial systems", "id": "16417", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8127", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Crevasse-splays and related facies are common in some avulsive fluvial systems, while being nearly absent in others. As such, the study of splay and other overbank deposits may be fundamental to understanding the processes of fluvial avulsion and basin-filling in terrestrial systems. Despite this importance, the primary controls on crevasse-splay growth and development are poorly understood and constrained. Within this study, the role of floodplain drainage and channel grain-size distribution on crevasse-splay growth is examined, as these variables influence the amount of sediment and water discharged through levee crevasses.\n\nTo evaluate the influence of floodplain drainage and channel grain-size distributions on crevasse-splay growth, three approaches were used. First, crevasse-splay extent, plan form, and frequency were documented using aerial photography from Google Earth in four modern, avulsive river systems including the Ovens (Victoria, Australia), Sandover (Northern Territory, Australia), Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan, Canada), and upper Columbia (British Columbia, Canada). Second, field observations and measurements from the Paleocene Fort Union Formation (Bighorn Basin, Wyoming), Paleocene-Eocene Willwood Formation (Bighorn Basin, Wyoming), and Late Cretaceous-Paleocene Ferris Formation (Hanna Basin, Wyoming) documented floodplain drainage and grain-size characteristics in these ancient systems. Finally, numerical modeling using Delft3D-FLOW was conducted to explore splay growth under different floodplain drainage and channel grain-size conditions.\n\nCollectively, modern observations, ancient deposits, and modeling results show that systems producing wide-spread, basin-filling crevasse-splay deposits are associated with well- drained floodplains with steep cross-floodplain water-surface gradients and abundant intermediate grain-sizes (i.e. coarse silt to fine sand, which is readily suspended in channel flows and also settles from suspension quickly as through-crevasse flows expand and decelerate on the floodplain). In contrast, splay production was limited in systems with poorly-drained floodplains and/or coarse grain sizes. Some of the systems featured little or no crevasse-splay deposition (e.g. Ovens River and Ferris Formation) or numerous splays with relatively little depositional volume (e.g. upper Columbia and Sandover Rivers). In these systems, splay deposition is limited because standing water on the floodplain reduced cross-floodplain water-surface slopes, suppressing sediment advection away from the channel margin, and/or these systems lacked intermediate sediment sizes that supply crevasse-splay sediment to the floodplain.\n\nUltimately, these results suggest that well-drained floodplains with steep, lateral water- surface gradients promote extensive crevasse-splay growth. The influence of channel grain-size distribution is less pronounced than floodplain-drainage conditions, although abundant \"intermediate\" sediment supply (i.e. coarse suspended sediment) promotes large crevasse-splay deposits.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8069], "author_name_tesi": "Millard, Craig Louis", "last_name_ssi": "Millard", "middle_name_ssi": "Louis", "first_name_ssi": "Craig", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Ann Hajek"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Ann Hajek, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Crevasse-splay", "Splay", "River", "Fluvial", "Avulsion", "Sedimentology"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Live, Struggle, and Die: A Study of Antique Forms in Late-Quattrocento Sculpted Reliefs", "id": "14583rsm5229", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14583", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\tA series of sculpted reliefs produced in late-15th-early-16th-century Florence and Padua \u2013 reliefs crafted by such artists as Bertoldo di Giovanni, Michelangelo Buonarroti, the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, and Andrea Riccio \u2013 display a number of conspicuously pagan motifs and subjects. The strangely provocative character of these motifs precludes a neatly allegorical method: in other words, these tropes cannot easily be dismissed as either harmless trifles or Christian allegories. I argue that these motifs represented modes of thought and emotional states which could not be conveniently reconciled with prevailing doctrines. \n\tTo this end, in the following pages, I examine the relation of the pagan-inflected sculpted relief in the period to the technical and ethical norms prescribed by the contemporary theorists of the visual arts, particularly Leon Battista Alberti. I also explore these sculpted reliefs within the larger context of the 15th-century revival of pagan antique culture, a revival which manifested itself through a renewed attention to both the physical (gems, statues, sarcophagi) and literary (surviving poetical works, philosophical treatises, etc.) evidence on the part of both collectors and humanists.\n\tTo this examination of primary sources and objects, I add a theoretical component inspired by the work of Aby Warburg and Edgar Wind. This component consists of the application of the concept of the pathosformel (a motif which uses implied movement to express emotion) to clarify the emotive meanings contained within each sculpted relief. Though some of these artworks \u2013 such as Michelangelo\u2019s Battle of the Centaurs \u2013 will be familiar to students of Art History, my approach yields new directions through which to explore the pagan-inflected sculptural reliefs of early modern Italy.

In particular, \nmotor learning, during which an animal learns a sequence of muscular movements,\noften requires precisely-timed coordination between muscles and becomes\nvery natural once ingrained.\nExperiments show that neurons in the motor cortex exhibit precisely-timed spike activity \nwhen performing a learned motor behavior, and \nconstituent stereotypical elements of the behavior can last several hundred milliseconds.\nThe subject of this manuscript concerns how \norganized synaptic structures that produce stereotypical spike sequences\nemerge from random, dynamical networks.\n\nAfter a brief introduction in Chapter 1, we begin Chapter 2 by \nintroducing a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule\nthat defines how the activity of the network drives changes in network topology.\nThe rule is then applied to \nidealized networks\nof leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (LIF). These neurons are not subjected to the \nvariability that typically characterize\nneurons \\emph{in vivo}. In noiseless networks, synapses develop closed loops of strong\nconnectivity that reproduce stereotypical, precisely-timed spike patterns\nfrom an initially random network. We demonstrate the characteristics\nof the asymptotic synaptic configuration are dependent on the statistics of the initial\nrandom network. \n\nThe spike timings of the neurons simulated in Chapter 2 are generated exactly\nby a computationally economical,\nnonlinear mapping which is extended to LIF neurons injected with fluctuating current in Chapter 3.\nDevelopment of an economical mapping that incorporates noise provides a practical solution to the long\nsimulation times required to \nproduce asymptotic synaptic topologies in networks with STDP in the presence of realistic neuronal variability.\nThe mapping relies on generating numerical solutions to the dynamics of a LIF neuron subjected to Gaussian\nwhite noise (GWN). The system reduces to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck first passage time\nproblem, the solution of which we build into the mapping method of Chapter 2.\nWe demonstrate that simulations using the stochastic mapping have reduced computation time \ncompared to traditional Runge-Kutta methods\nby more than a factor of\n150.\n\nIn Chapter 4, we use the stochastic mapping\nto study the dynamics of emerging synaptic topologies in noisy networks.\nWith the addition of membrane noise, networks with dynamical synapses can\nadmit states in which the distribution of the synaptic weights is static\nunder spontaneous activity, \nbut the random connectivity between neurons is dynamical. The widely cited problem of instabilities\nin networks with STDP is avoided with the implementation of a synaptic decay and \nan activation threshold on each synapse.\nWhen such networks are presented with stimulus modeled by a focused excitatory current,\nchain-like networks can emerge with the addition of an axon-remodeling plasticity rule, a topological constraint\non the connectivity modeling the finite resources available to each neuron.\nThe emergent topologies are the result of an iterative stochastic process.\n%Ensembles of asymptotic configurations that exhibit stereotypical spike patterns \n%are generated using the stochastic mapping\n%and characterized by the temporal length of the sequence they produce.\nThe dynamics of the growth process suggest a strong interplay between\nthe network topology and the spike sequences they produce during development.\nNamely, the existence of an embedded spike sequence alters the distribution\nof synaptic weights through the entire network.\nThe roles of model parameters that affect the interplay between network structure\nand activity are elucidated.\nFinally, we propose two mathematical growth models, which are complementary, that \ncapture the essence of the growth dynamics observed in simulations.\n\nIn Chapter 5, we present an extension of the stochastic mapping\nthat allows the possibility of neuronal cooperation.\nWe demonstrate that synaptic topologies admitting stereotypical sequences\ncan emerge in yet higher, biologically realistic levels of membrane potential\nvariability when neurons cooperate to innervate shared targets. \nThe structure that is most robust to the variability is that of a synfire chain.\nThe principles of growth dynamics detailed in Chapter 4 are the same\nthat sculpt the emergent synfire topologies.

Primary analyses were multiple regression and canonical correlation analysis.  Four hypotheses were tested with mixed results.  Hypothesis 1, which tested the relation between Black racial identity and the two types of discrimination, was partially supported in that youth with a self-hatred attitude perceived more discrimination, whereas the opposite was true of youth with an assimilation attitude.  Adolescents with an anti-White attitude were more perceptive only to racial discrimination in the schools versus in general.  Hypothesis 2 focused on coping and was not supported, but other findings emerged: Youth who rated themselves high on both Self-Hatred and Multiculturalist seemed to reflect racial identity confusion and were likely to respond to stressors with avoidance.  Hypothesis 3 was supported where Black racial identity was not related with academic self-concept.  Personal identity is not considered the same as Black racial identity, which is a representation of social identity.  The fourth hypothesis, which involved the proximal indicators of school performance, was not supported.  However, a positive relation was found between the multiculturalist attitude and performance in history class.  Finally, students with a pro-Black attitude reported receiving more encouragement from their parents and friends to do well in school.

The foremost finding for the study was how school counselor roles have shifted to excessive amounts of time spent with testing tasks, taking time from students, and creating role-pull for the counselors. Findings also included changes in counselor roles regarding student remediation, career advisement, teacher and student perceptions, and possible increases in counselor and administrator teaming. \nSchool counselors managed their roles by working extra hours, functioning with a sense of urgency, and altering their counseling styles to be more time efficient.

Harvest of orthotropic shoot material began two months after acclimation in the greenhouse and utilized periodic light pruning of orthotropic softwood shoots (chupons, suckers or water sprouts). This high-intensity propagation method yielded 70 stem cuttings per softwood stock plant per year, approximately 1,250 m-2\u2022year-1. Single and few node orthotropic stem cuttings were rooted under intermittent mist. The propagation efficiency (percentage of plants produced per stuck cutting) from softwood stock plants ranged from 66% to 81%. Under the specific conditions of the current study, the estimated production of orthotropic rooted cuttings from softwood stock plants maintained as a bench top clonal garden was estimated to range between 825 and 1,012 rooted cuttings m-2\u2022year-1.\n\tThe second orthotropic shoot production method involved the bending to horizontal of the main trunk of semi-hardwood stock plants from 9 to 12 months after acclimation, release of axillary and adventitious orthotropic meristems from the bent trunk, and repeated harvest by periodic light pruning of orthotropic shoots for rooting material. Using the bending method, semi-hardwood stock plants yielded on average over 300 single and few node orthotropic stem cuttings per year, or approximately 500 m-2\u2022year-1 at the stock plant density tested. Single and few node orthotropic stem cuttings were rooted under intermittent fog. The propagation efficiency of rooted cuttings from semi-hardwood stock plants ranged from 68% to 74%. The estimated production of orthotropic rooted cuttings from bent semi-hardwood stock plants was estimated to range between 340 and 370 rooted cuttings m-2\u2022year-1.\n\tOverall, the softwood orthotropic stock plants produced 1.5 times more plants per given unit of space and time than the bent semi-hardwood stock plants. Softwood stock plants are compact and have shorter chupons and leaf laminae, as well as smaller stem diameters in comparison to bent semi-hardwood stock plants. Production of softwood stock plants requires a higher level of cultural management and propagation technique than those for bent semi-hardwood stock plants. Utilization of softwood stock plants in the current study significantly shortened the time necessary for greenhouse multiplication of vegetatively propagated orthotropic cacao plants compared to the utilization of bent semi-hardwood stock plants.\nComparison of development at the juvenile stage in a climate controlled greenhouse demonstrated that primary somatic embryos (1\u00b0SE) and secondary somatic embryos (2\u00b0SE) grew true to type as compared to seedlings. As well, orthotropic rooted cuttings from softwood stock plants (RC-SW) and orthotropic rooted cuttings from bent semi-hardwood stock plants (RC-SHW) grew true to type. All four orthotropic vegetatively propagated trees had the characteristic jorquette (whorl of plagiotropic fan branches) at the phase change from the juvenile orthotropic trunk to the mature plagiotropic canopy morphology. RC-SW had a relatively longer juvenile phase, while RC-SHW had a more rapid transition to mature phase that was demonstrated by earlier and lower formation of the jorquette. All orthotropic cacao trees had one or more tap roots (seedlings and SE plants) or their analog, orthogeotropic framework roots, (from an adventitiously -derived root system of rooted cuttings). SE plants and orthotropic rooted cuttings had lower leaf area (LA) per gram of dry weight (DW) of root and higher root to shoot ratio than seedlings, although LA per stem DW did not differ among plants. Photosynthesis measurements at 12 months in the greenhouse showed no difference between 2\u00b0SE and seedlings. \nThese orthotropic clonal propagation methods may be adopted by germplasm banks, international cacao research centers, universities, private laboratories, as well as regional and local extension services and nurseries for use in international, regional, and local distribution schemes for elite or other newly developed clonal varieties of cacao or other instances where original stock plant material is limited or the orthotropic seminal tree architecture is desired. The use of the bending technique for semi-hardwood stock plants may be of particular utility to nurseries and growers interested in robust, on-farm propagation of clonal varieties that have orthotropic tree architecture and an orthogeotropic adventitious framework root system similar to that of a seminal tree.\nA single line of somatic embryo plants that were genetically transformed by cocultivation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1 and containing the EGFP and NPTII genes were acclimated to the greenhouse. Non-destructive growth measurements were taken to compare the transgenic line and non-transgenic 2\u00b0SE plants during 18 months. Growth analysis of plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves and leaf area, as well as photosynthesis and excised root respiration measurements did not indicate any differences in these parameters between transgenic and non-transgenic SE-derived plants. EGFP expression was analyzed in seeds from two genetic crosses. One to one segregation of EGFP expression in the seeds indicated that the T-DNA was inserted at a single locus in this line.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1116], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Carter Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Carter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Guiltinan", "Mark Guiltinan", "Siela Maximova", "David Eissenstat", "Robert Michael Crassweller", "Roy Edward Young"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Guiltinan, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Guiltinan, Committee Chair", "Siela Maximova, Committee Member", "David Eissenstat, Committee Member", "Robert Michael Crassweller, Committee Member", "Roy Edward Young, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tissue culture", "rooted cutting", "vegetative propagation", "cocoa"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Intergenerational Housing: A Vernacular Perspective", "id": "21811", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9706", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Demographic studies and trends indicate that multigenerational households are becoming increasingly common in the United States.  This thesis examines design strategies that can improve the quality of intergenerational home architecture through the study of successful vernacular examples.  These vernacular case studies offer lessons about intergenerational design validated by years of architectural evolution and experience.  \n\nStudies of development and aging attribute a variety of mental and physical benefits to living in an intergenerational environment.  The design of homes that encourage and facilitate interaction between generations can truly foster healthier living for all ages.  There is, however, scarce research conducted on the subject in the architectural realm; consequently, no universal insights for effective intergenerational design have been developed.  This research explores the vernacular houses of three different American subcultures that embraced an intergenerational existence in order to illuminate architectural design concepts and approaches that can be implemented in future designs. \n\nThe three vernacular case studies selected for this research\u2014the Amish farmhouse, the Spanish-Colonial hacienda, and the industrial alley house\u2014were visually documented through drawings, photographs, and historical research.  Identification of potential intergenerational design issues, distilled from existing research, formed the framework for subsequent architectural analysis.  Examination of each vernacular case study determined how each issue manifests itself in the existing architecture.  The analysis of the three distinct structures, condensed and combined to identify commonalities and differences, designated significant architectural lessons.  Through this process of vernacular analysis, a number of architectural ideas that could be implemented in future design and investigated through further research became demonstrably clear.  These ideas are centered on the design of variable hybrid spaces, the inclusion of space for productive activities, designing for flexibility, and the connection to a larger community.  These design concepts, when considered together, should lead to the creation of more effective intergenerational architecture.\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9460], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Daniel John", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jawaid Haider", "Darla V Lindberg", "Deryck William Holdsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jawaid Haider, Thesis Advisor", "Darla V Lindberg, Thesis Advisor", "Deryck William Holdsworth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["architecture", "intergenerational", "multigenerational", "retroit", "vernacular", "housing", "elderly"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "AN INVESTIGATION OF LIGHT ACTIVATED ADHESIVES FOR UNDERWATER STRUCTURAL ASSEMBLY\n", "id": "8424", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1495", "abstract_tesi": "        The vast use of polymeric substances in marine applications has spawned many caulks, paints, adhesives, and composite materials capable of resisting a wide range of extreme environmental conditions.  Many of the underwater caulks and sealants are not intended for load bearing, as they are extremely elastic and inherently weak and therefore would not suitable as an underwater structural adhesive.  These materials are commonly cured by adding a secondary chemical component that acts a polymerization catalyst, such as in a two-part marine epoxy paint system or two-part epoxy adhesive, but they can take days to fully cure and must be applied to dry-docked vessels.  Another method of curing a specific type of polymer is the use of light in the ultraviolet and/or lower visible light region of the electromagnetic spectrum.  This is known as photocuring, and the most profound advantage for use of this cure mechanism is the ability to create an optimally cured adhesive joint in approximately 30-60 seconds.  Photocurable acrylic adhesives contain organic or inorganic photoinitiators that split into free-radicals that polymerize methacrylate monomers.    \nDeveloped as a novel approach to workholding and an alternative to mechanical, pneumatic, or hydraulic fixturing mechanisms, Light Activated Adhesive Gripper (LAAG) utilizes a photocurable acrylic adhesive as the main component of the system.  The preferred adhesive for bonding to ferrous materials is CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2.  The patented concept employs sapphire pins imbedded in a structural housing to allow for the transmission of UV light into the adhesive that subsequently adheres to the work-piece.  The number of discrete adhesive joints, the size of the sapphire pins, and the orientation of the pins can be optimally designed using specialized Finite Element Analysis software.  The preferred light source is a metal halide UV spot curing lamp.  LAAG fixtures have been proven to exhibit maximum dynamic rigidity and high holding strengths, and the system allows for maximum tool access to the work-piece.  Previous testing has confirmed tensile strengths approaching 55 MPa which makes the hardware and concepts of LAAG technology a viable candidate for underwater structural repair.     \n\tMuch characterization work has been performed with CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 pertaining to LAAG technology, including the characterization of optimal cure rates and critical irradiance values, but there has been no investigation of its ability to adhere to submerged substrates or the resistance to extreme environmental conditions.  To begin this investigation, the performance of the adhesive when bonded to dry substrates (dry assembly) was evaluated.  This investigation revealed that CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 adequately wets both smooth (ground) and rough (bead blasted) when dry assembled.  The means and the variations were barely statistically equal at 95% confidence level with a F-test p-value of 0.126 and a T-test p-value of 0.067, respectively.  Also, the sensitivity of dry assembled CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 to temperature was characterized.  The means of the axial load strength of the adhesive joints at various temperatures were as follows: 3141N at ~0\u00ba F, 2225N at ~38\u00ba F, 1535N at ~70\u00ba F, 1171N at ~96\u00ba F, and 763N at ~120\u00ba F.  It is evident that increasing temperatures resulted in lower strengths of the adhesive joints, resulting from a decreased dynamic modulus.  The inverse linear relationship was confirmed by regression analysis using Minitab\u00ae and the model fit the data quite well with a R2 value of 91.5%.  \n\tThe sensitivity of the strength of CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 to thermal excursion was evaluated.  The samples were allowed to thermally soak to either 0 \u00baF or 120 \u00baF for eight hours and then thermally soak back to room temperature.  The statistical analysis confirmed that the 0 \u00baF or 120 \u00baF excursions resulted in more variation when compared to a room temperature control sample.  The F-test p-values were 0.000 and 0.012, respectively.  In both cases the estimates for variance was double the variance of data without an excursion.  It was also statistically proven (T-test p-value of 0.004) that the very hot (120 \u00baF) excursion sample was taken from a distribution with a higher mean (estimated at 231N) with respect to the very cold excursion and the room control means.  The means of the very cold excursion and the room control were concluded to be equal (T-test p-value of 0.127).  This phenomenon is believed to be attributed to the interaction between dark polymerization (continued polymerization after the UV light source has been removed) and the thermal excursions.   \n\tThe ability of CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 to wet and adhere to submerged substrates (wet assembly) was evaluated.  This investigation revealed that wet assembled CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 joints are inherently (estimated 400 N) weaker than dry assembled joints when bonded to smooth (ground) substrates (T-test p-value of 0.009).  The joints were further reduced when wet assembling to rough (bead blasted) substrates (T-test p-value of 0.000).  These results were attributed to inadequate wetting of the substrate due to entrapped water in the random depressions left by bead blasting.  \nThe effect of saltwater exposure on uncured adhesive at various temperatures was also studied.  An ANOVA was performed using the experimental data.  It was concluded that exposure time was a significant factor (F-test p-value of 0.013).  Temperature and the interaction were not significant (F-test p-values of 0.948 and 0.514, respectively).  The longer that the uncured adhesive was exposed to saltwater the lower the subsequent axial load strength was.  \n\tAn investigation revealed that temperature and time were significant factors with respect to de-lamination (hydrolysis) of CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 adhesive joints under saltwater submersion.  Increasing ambient saltwater temperatures resulted in faster hydrolysis rates.  Hydrolysis occured first at the sapphire/adhesive interface, as CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 continued to adhere to the steel substrates.  Statistical comparison of means were conducted to aid in the determination of when the adhesive joint significantly decreased in strength.  When there was at least 95% confidence that the mean was reduced from the initial immediate pull strength, it was concluded that there was a significant drop in strength.  Wet assembled joint strengths in hot (96 \u00baF) water were significantly reduced after three days, while dry assembled joint strengths took six days to reduce.  Recall that wet assembled joints are inherently weaker than dry assembled joints.  In room temperature saltwater, the joint strengths were not reduced until twelve days of submersion.  The reduction in joint strength was attributed to hydrolysis in all cases.  In cold temperature saltwater, hydrolysis was stymied for at least forty-eight days.     \n\tFive chemical components were believed to affect hydrolysis rate: impact modifier, reinforcing agent, acid #1, acid #2, and acid #3.  The exact chemical details of these chemical components are intentionally forgone due to proprietary reasons.  A fractional experimental design was conducted with assistance from CTECH\u00ae.  An initial round of experiments led to valuable insight on what chemical components were needed for immediate pull strength.  An ANOVA was conducted on the experimental data.  It was concluded that the impact modifier and the reinforcing agent have the most profound affect on the immediate pull tensile strength.  The impact modifier and reinforcing agent had F-test p-values of 0.000 implying a strong significance.  The acids #1, #2, and #3 also proved to be significant with confidence levels of 0.016, 0.013, and 0.031, respectively.  The main effects and interaction plots showed that the impact modifier and reinforcing agent must be at high levels for the maximum immediate pull strength.  The second round of experiments led to valuable insight on the chemical component\u2019s affect on the rate of hydrolysis.  It was found that acid #1 and acid #3 should be removed from the formulation to attain the best resistance to hydrolysis (F-test p-values of 0.000).   \n\tOf the sixteen test adhesives that were formulated, several had immediate pull strengths similar to that of the current CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 formulation.  Several adhesives also have shown an increase in resistance to hydrolysis in hot water conditions, but CTECH\u00ae Test Adhesive #3 proved to have the best results.  CTECH\u00ae Test Adhesive #3 had an average dry assembly, immediate pull strength of 1478N, and after twelve days of hot water storage the residual strength was 908N.  Although hydrolysis is still present when using CTECH&#61650; Test Adhesive #3, the detrimental impact has been reduced when compared to the 198N average when the current CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 formulation underwent the same submersion experiment.  This was attributed to the absence of acid#1 and acid #3 in CTECH\u00ae Test Adhesive #3.  \n\tCTECH\u00ae Test Adhesive #8 was chemically opposite to CTECH\u00ae Test Adhesive #3 with respect to acid#1 and acid #3.  CTECH\u00ae Test Adhesive #8 completely hydrolyzed after twelve days of submersion in hot saltwater.  It averaged an immediate pull strength 1183N.  An investigation of the use of silane primer coated on both substrates led to the conclusion that silane coated substrates will result in higher wet assembly strengths, but silane did not cause any resistance to hydrolysis.\n\tAfter extended investigations, CTECH\u00ae Test Adhesive #3 proved to have the best resistance to hydrolysis and was adequate for underwater construction in hot temperature (96\u00b0F) saltwater conditions for at least twelve days, assuming that an average of 800 N is adequate.  The same was true for underwater construction in cold temperature (38\u00b0F) and room temperature (70\u00b0F) for at least forty-eight days.  An ad-hoc experiment was performed to test whether CTECH\u00ae Test Adhesive #3 would adhere to polymeric epoxy based marine anti-corrosion paint.  CTECH\u00ae Test Adhesive #3 averaged 777N under hot water conditions for twelve days, but most importantly the adhesive tore away paint when destroyed after the test duration expired, proving that the adhesive and the interfaces were stronger than the paint.  Also, CTECH\u00ae Test Adhesive #3 performed equal to the current CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 formulation when wet assembled.  It had an average value of 1096N when wet assembled and immediately pulled.  When wet assembling and stored in hot temperature salt water for twelve days, CTECH\u00ae Test Adhesive #3 averaged a value of 417N when the current formulation of CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 averaged 12N.  \n\tSeveral chassis were fabricated using a plexi-glass pin instead of a sapphire pin. These were bonded to plexi-glass anvils with CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 and were stored for twelve days in hot saltwater (96\u00b0F).  Although some samples exhibited no hydrolysis when destroyed, others had significant hydrolysis.  The results were very erratic and this was the major cause for caution when using plexi-glass pins.  This was attributed to the fact that the output light level was 50% that of all previous experiments, so that the plexi-glass did not melt.  It was possible that the joints were not receiving the proper dosage of light to cure the adhesive.  CTECH\u00ae #3 was bonded to plexi-glass and there was also rapid hydrolysis.  Lastly, CTECH\u00ae #8 is chemically opposite to CTECH\u00ae #3 with respect to acid #1 and acid #3 so it was suspected that rapid hydrolysis would occur.  Rapid hydrolysis was confirmed after only twelve hours.  The hydrolysis was mainly evident on the sapphire pin, but not on the steel substrate.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1480], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, David Matthew", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Matthew", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Demeter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Demeter, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["underwater structural adhesives", "photocurable acrylic adhesives", "adhesive aging"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Application of Image-processing Techniques for Determining Convective Boundary-layer Depth from Aerosol-lidar Measurements", "id": "19850", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9542", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The convective boundary layer (CBL) plays a fundamental role in the exchange of momentum, moisture, and sensible heat between the surface and the troposphere.

Aerosol backscatter lidar is a valuable tool in the study of the CBL specifically in the determination of the CBL depth.

Several image processing techniques are capable of identifying gradients and features in medical imagery and computer vision applications and by including temporal in addition to spatial information, it is found that these image processing techniques can also be used to identify the transition zone in lidar data. A process of matching the filter iterations to each estimator is developed and the results are merged improving the robustness of the estimates.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9314], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, David Owen", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Owen", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy Joseph Kane", "Timothy Joseph Kane", "George Young", "Sue Ellen Haupt", "Jack W Langelaan", "William Henry Brune"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy Joseph Kane, Dissertation Advisor", "Timothy Joseph Kane, Committee Chair", "George Young, Committee Member", "Sue Ellen Haupt, Committee Member", "Jack W Langelaan, Committee Member", "William Henry Brune, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["convective boundary layer", "entrainment zone", "transition zone", "image segmentation", "lidar"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Human Response to Low-amplitude Sonic Booms", "id": "11175", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1497", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aim of this research was to investigate human response to low-amplitude sonic booms, specifically looking at the effects of listening environment, the type of sonic boom signature (indoor vs. outdoor), and subjective test methods.

The presence of B. cereus in pasteurized milk is of concern to the dairy industry because this microorganism can influence the quality and safety of the product.  During growth in milk, B. cereus can produce proteinases and lipases which cause quality defects in milk and limit shelf life.  In addition, the presence of B. cereus in pasteurized milk may pose a health hazard to the consumer because B. cereus is a human pathogen and has been shown to cause emetic and diarrheal illnesses.  \nNumerous international studies have been conducted to determine the incidence and level of B. cereus in pasteurized milk, but recent research in the U.S. is limited.  The objectives of the first portion of this work were to evaluate the microbiological quality of commercial milk from four manufacturers and to determine the level and incidence of B. cereus.  Microbiological analysis was conducted on whole, 2% milk fat, 1% milk fat, and skim milks stored at 4 and 7\u00a1\u00c6C and included aerobic plate counts, mesophilic and psychrotrophic spore counts, and B. cereus counts.  Analysis was conducted on the sell-by date (day 0), 12 days before the sell-by date (-12), 7 days before the sell-by date (-7), and 7 days after the sell-by date (+7).\nOn the sell-by-date, milks stored at 4 and 7\u00a2\u00aaC, yielded aerobic plate counts ranging from \u00a1\u00c21.0 to 8.5 log10 CFU/mL and \u00a1\u00c21.0 to 8.6 log10 CFU/mL, respectively.  Seven (25%) milk samples stored at 4\u00a2\u00aaC had aerobic plate counts \u00a1\u00c34.3 log10 CFU/mL (20,000 CFU/mL), the limit outlined in the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, while 23 (82%) milk samples stored at 7\u00a2\u00aaC exceeded the limit.  Mesophilic and psychrotrophic spore counts of milks stored at 4 and 7\u00a2\u00aaC were low and ranged from \u00a1\u00c21.0 to 2.2 log10 CFU/mL and \u00a1\u00c21.0 to 1.7 log10 CFU/mL, respectively.  The growth of B. cereus during refrigerated storage appeared to be influenced by storage temperature.  On the sell-by date, B. cereus was detected in 2 of 28 (7%) cartons stored at 4\u00a2\u00aaC, and counts of milks ranged from \u00a1\u00c21.0 to 4.2 log10 CFU/mL.  However, B. cereus was detected in 16 (57%) milk samples at 7\u00a1\u00c6C, and counts ranged from \u00a1\u00c21.0 to 8.9 log10 CFU/mL.  On the sell-by date, 9 (32%) of the milk samples stored at 7\u00a1\u00c6C yielded B. cereus counts exceeding the minimum infectious dose for the diarrheal illness.  \nThe data from the first portion of the research suggested further work needed to be conducted to improve the microbiological quality of pasteurized milk.  Such work would include tracking studies to identify contamination sites in milk production and processing.\nThe second objective of this work was to develop a sequence-based subtyping method for B. cereus dairy isolates.  Currently, the RAPD-PCR method developed by Nilsson et al. (1998) is the subtyping method used most extensively for tracking B. cereus in milk production and in the processing environment.  This method is well-suited for large-scale typing studies because it is highly discriminatory and is relatively simple and inexpensive compared to other subtyping methods; however, this method has several disadvantages associated with fragment-based methods including difficulties in standardization and interpretation of the results and low portability of the data.\nThe focus of the second portion of this work was to develop a two- or three-gene MLST scheme for tracking B. cereus dairy isolates using housekeeping and virulence gene sequences.  Bacillus cereus possesses a number of virulence genes that could potentially be included in a MLST scheme, but in order for these genes to be included in a MLST scheme, the genes would need to be widely distributed among B. cereus isolates.  The incidence of nine virulence genes was evaluated among 13 B. cereus reference strains and milk isolates, and two virulence genes, entFM and nheC were detected in all of the strains.\nThe next part of the work involved comparison of the number of allelic types obtained with housekeeping gene sequences in the MLST scheme of Helgason et al. (2004) with sequences of virulence genes, entFM and nheC.  It was expected that the virulence gene sequences would have a greater number of polymorphic sites and yield a greater number of allelic types than the housekeeping genes.  \nThe number of allelic types obtained with sequences of housekeeping genes in the MLST scheme of Helgason et al. (2004) ranged from four (adk, recF, and sucC) to seven (ftsA and glpT).  The percentage of polymorphic sites among these genes ranged from 1.7% (ftsA) to 7.3% (glpT).  Virulence genes entFM and nheC yielded seven and six allelic types, respectively, and these genes exhibited a higher percentage of polymorphic sites (10.2 and 12.1%) than the housekeeping genes. \nFinally, various combinations of housekeeping and virulence gene (entFM and nheC) sequences were evaluated in the development of a two- or three-gene MLST scheme for B. cereus.  The number of sequence types obtained with the two-gene MLST schemes ranged from five (ccpA and pyrE, adk or recF and sucC) to eight (any housekeeping gene and nheC, or entFM and nheC).  The addition of a third gene to the MLST scheme did not increase the number of sequence types.  The seven-gene MLST scheme described by Helgason et al. (2004) yielded seven sequence types, and the combination of the seven housekeeping genes and two virulence genes yielded eight sequence types.  \nThe two-gene MLST schemes could be used for large-scale tracking studies to identify sources of B. cereus contamination.  Such tracking studies could lead to a reduction in the level and incidence of B. cereus in pasteurized milk and result in improvements in the quality and shelf life of the product.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1472], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Donna Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Donna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert F Roberts", "Stephanie Doores", "Robert F Roberts", "Edward G Dudley", "Chitrita Debroy", "Stephen John Knabel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert F Roberts, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephanie Doores, Committee Chair", "Robert F Roberts, Committee Chair", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Member", "Chitrita Debroy, Committee Member", "Stephen John Knabel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bacillus cereus", "milk", "multilocus sequence typing", "subtyping", "dairy"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Single-phase And Two-phase Grid-enhancement Heat Transfer In The Reflood Stage Of A Loss Of Coolant Accident", "id": "14539", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1429", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The single-phase and two-phase heat transfer enhancement associated with flow through a nuclear fuel assembly grid spacer, which is of important concern on the cooling of fuel rods in nuclear power plants under abnormal conditions, is investigated.  Grid spacers are present within reactor fuel assemblies to maintain the structural spacing of the fuel rods.  These grid spacers also provide a flow blockage such that the flow within the assembly is disrupted, which causes the flow to redevelop and provides an enhancement in the local heat transfer.  However, as the flow continues to evolve downstream of the grid, the heat transfer enhancement will decrease as the flow becomes fully developed.   In the first part of the present work, single-phase steam cooling experiments conducted at the Rod Bundle Heat Transfer (RBHT) Test Facility located at The Pennsylvania State University are utilized to develop an upgraded correlation which models the single-phase local heat transfer enhancement.  The improvement of the upgraded correlation over the models currently in use is then demonstrated.\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University and the United State Nuclear Regulatory Commission joined in creating a Rod Bundle Heat Transfer Test Facility to obtain experimental data that can be used to assess and improve the computer code model predictions.  The facility is well suited for various experiments, including reflood heat-transfer, two-phase level swell, single-phase steam cooling, and steam cooling experiments with droplet injection.  The RBHT facility is well instrumented with sensitive differential pressure cells, traversing steam probe rakes, and over 500 different channels of instrumentation for monitoring fuel rod temperatures, spacer grid temperatures, housing temperatures, and fluid temperatures and pressures.  The rod bundle was constructed to model a portion of a pressurized water reactor fuel assembly, with similar pitch, rod diameter, mixing vane grids, and full assembly length. \n\n\tIn addition to the heat transfer enhancement observed in a single-phase flow environment, the grid spacers provide additional enhancements in a droplet two-phase flow environment.  For the second part of the present work, the droplet breakup phenomenon associated with flow through a grid spacer under two-phase flow conditions is investigated.  By considering that a grid spacer undergoes three environmental changes dependent on the flow and heating conditions (i.e. \u2013 dry, wet, and intermittent wetting), a correlation can be obtained that will enable prediction of a third flow field (a droplet field) for incorporation within thermal-hydraulic computer codes such as TRACE that utilizes two fields for vapor and liquid.\n\nThe environmental condition of a grid spacer has been observed to play an intricate part in the droplet breakup and liquid re-entrainment processes.  A dry grid versus a wet grid results in significantly different droplet fields and dispersed flows downstream of the grid location.  Dry grid spacers have consistently been studied as a means of breaking a large drop into two or more smaller drops.  For the same liquid mass flow rate, this results in a drastic increase in the interfacial heat transfer area which in turn greatly promotes the cooling of fuel rods.  The reduction in droplet size is known to be dependent upon the Weber number of the incoming droplets, the blockage ratio of the grid spacer, and the volume fraction of the droplets in the dispersed phase.  Wet grid spacers, however, appear to act as a potential source of droplet production.  When wet, a liquid film exists on the grid spacer which when impacted upon by an incoming droplet can result in the re-entrainment of liquid leading to potentially larger drops downstream, as evidenced by the experimental data obtained from the RBHT facility.\n\nData from the steam cooling experiments with droplet injection conducted in the RBHT facility provide very detailed insight to the temperature distribution and heat transfer characteristics of dispersed flow film boiling regime during the reflood phase of the emergency response to a large break loss of coolant accident.  The information and data required to effectively analyze this regime include: the entrained liquid droplet sizes and velocity, vapor temperature, steam flow rate, and the interfacial heat and mass transfer.  The droplet sizes are measured with the aid of a high speed camera system using an infrared laser as the lighting source and specially designed computer software, known as VisiSizer, which is capable of analyzing droplet data in real time.  Droplet diameter and droplet distribution data were measured at a series of elevations in order to obtain detailed information on the evaporation and breakup of the droplets as they travel upwards through the bundle and pass through the spacer grids.\n\nThe experimental data are compared with the predictions of Best-Estimate computer codes, such as TRACE and COBRA-TF.  The droplet diameters and distribution provide a good data set for future model development.  However, the data can be made more complete by determining the droplet velocity and Weber number, which are missing in the measured data but are key parameters for modeling both droplet breakup and spacer grid effects.  The droplet velocities can be predicted with the aid of the current computer codes to obtain an approximate value that can be used as a basis for modeling.  The detailed data sets obtained from the RBHT experiments gathered in this study along with the droplet velocities calculated from COBRA-TF in the present work provide useful insight into the two-phase heat transfer phenomena that occur during the reflood period of loss of coolant accident.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1417], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Douglas Jacob", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Jacob", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung", "Seungjin Kim", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Renata S Engel", "Stephen Bajorek"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung, Dissertation Advisor", "Seungjin Kim, Committee Member", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Renata S Engel, Committee Member", "Stephen Bajorek, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Single-phase", "Two-Phase", "Spacer Grid", "Heat Transfer", "Reflood", "Rod Bundle", "Droplet Breakup", "Disspersed Flow", "DFFB", "LOCA"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Sexual abuse and substance use disorders in female adolescents aging out of foster care", "id": "19883", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9412", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Youth aging out of foster care are at high risk for developing substance use disorders (SUDs), and females with histories of sexual abuse may be especially at risk.

Using an existing longitudinal dataset of youth aging out of foster care and transitioning to adulthood, this study compared SUD prevalence in females with histories of sexual abuse and females without maltreatment histories, and examined whether perceptions of the world as dangerous and emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between sexual abuse and SUDs. Consistent with prior research, females with histories of sexual abuse had higher rates of lifetime SUDs at age 17 than females without maltreatment histories, although differences were reduced after considering whether females lived with family members. However, at ages 18 and 19 there were no significant differences in past year SUDs. When the hypothesized mediators, perceptions of the world as dangerous and emotion dysregulation, were examined at age 17, the groups differed only on emotion dysregulation, with females with sexual abuse histories showing greater emotion dysregulation than the comparison females. Neither factor was found to mediate between sexual abuse and lifetime SUDs at age 17, nor did they predict emergence and persistence of SUDs from age 17 to ages 18 and 19. This study was unable to establish mechanisms linking sexual abuse and SUDs, but group differences found in emotion dysregulation at age 17 suggest that emotion dysregulation may still be an important factor to consider.

Its simplicity and proven performance makes it easy to use and reliable.  However, design scenarios for increasingly larger aircraft have revealed a significant design shortfall at these extremely heavy and multi-wheeled loading conditions.  This has driven a redevelopment of the CBR method to underpin it with a mechanistic load response of vertical stress at the subgrade surface instead of an equivalent single wheel load at the surface of the pavement.  This response is correlated to an empirical failure model of pavement life developed from full-scale test data.  This new design method has eliminated limitations in the original procedure that resulted in overdesigned pavements for large aircraft.  However, any new method always leaves room for improvement.  This thesis explored the development of the current failure model and identified an opportunity to refine it.  The primary target of this modification was the concentration factor, an empirical modification to the Boussinesq stress distribution theory used in calculating the load response.  The test data used to develop the current failure model was previously analyzed with a constant concentration factor for all test points.  However, a more representative relationship of the concentration factor as a function of the subgrade CBR was available to better model soil behavior.  After collecting additional test data beyond that used to develop the current failure model, a new failure model was developed that included the concentration factor as a function of CBR.  In addition, it was shown, through comparison of nonlinear regression statistics, that a failure model developed using the concentration factor as a function of CBR provided failure model with a better fit to the test data than a model developed with a constant concentration factor.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8113], "author_name_tesi": "Miller, Eric Jordan", "last_name_ssi": "Miller", "middle_name_ssi": "Jordan", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shelley Marie Stoffels", "Dr Prasenjit Basu", "Mansour Solaimanian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shelley Marie Stoffels, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Prasenjit Basu, Thesis Advisor", "Mansour Solaimanian, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CBR", "california bearing ratio", "airfield", "flexible", "pavement", "asphalt", "HMA", "ACC", "structural design"]}]
