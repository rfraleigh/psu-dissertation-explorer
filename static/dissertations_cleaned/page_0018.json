Only a small portion of these children actually receive a transplant.  As a result, there is a need for a pediatric left ventricular assist device (PVAD) as an alternative treatment.  Penn State has designed their own PVAD; however, like all ventricular assist devices, thrombus formation is a major concern that may lead to device failure or life-threatening events in the patient.  One explanation for the thrombus formation is that it occurs in areas of low shear rate, but the blood contact surface of the polymer sac also plays a role in thrombus formation.  The surface of explanted PVAD blood sacs from animal trials carried out at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center is to be analyzed to determine if surface topography plays a role in thrombus formation.  To do this, a protocol is developed that allows for the analysis of the same sac sample using multiple microscopy techniques.  The samples are first analyzed using confocal microscopy to determine if platelets and/or fibrin, components of thrombi, are present.  Then using environmental scanning electron microscopy, the surface of the sample is analyzed.  Finally, after degradation of any biological deposits, optical profilometry is used to obtain quantitative data on the surface roughness.  In future studies, this protocol will result in surface data than can be correlated with flow data to further understand the cause of the thrombus formation.  The correlation can lead to better designed devices and blood sacs that are less likely to induce thrombosis.

This communication between the well and the formation is typically established by the implementation of a perforation completion strategy.\nUse of artificial neural network (ANN) technology in petroleum engineering applications has gained increasingly more attention during the recent years. The principal purpose of these applications is to come up with forecasts for various scenarios under which field is operating.  \nIn this study, an ANN based tool is designed and developed to predict the production profiles resulting from vertical wells with various perforation designs. The proposed ANN tool is capable of forecasting the production profiles from single-phase gas reservoir for periods of up to four years. In this forward-looking ANN, the input parameters are reservoir characteristics and perforation design specifics with an output file pertaining to production rates as a function of time. The inverse of the aforementioned tool is the second ANN developed in this study. There are two inverse ANN models that are presented in this study. The first inverse tool receives reservoir characteristics and desired production profiles as input and suggest the specific design parameters for perforations so that the expected production profile can be realized. The second inverse tool receives reservoir characteristics (except permeability, porosity and thickness), perforation design parameters and the observed production profiles as input to forecast the permeability, porosity and thickness values for that reservoir. \nIn vertical wells with perforations, besides reservoir properties, productivity of the well is controlled by the perforation design characteristics including penetration length, shot density, perforation diameter and phase-angle. A numerical model, which is capable of accommodating these characteristics, has also been developed as a part of this study. This numerical model is verified against a commercial model and used to generate the data that is used in training the forward and inverse ANN tools.  \nThe ANN tools developed in this study are brought together on a graphical- user- interface (GUI) to ease the practical implementation of the software package developed in this study.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7598], "author_name_tesi": "Cengiz, Ugur ", "last_name_ssi": "Cengiz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ugur", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ugur", "Cengiz", "perforation parameters", "artificial expert system"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Policy Innovation and Public Leadership: The Clinton Administration's Counterproliferation Policy Initiative\n\n", "id": "7435", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2959", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the Clinton Administration\u2019s attempts to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons of mass destruction through the Counterproliferation Policy Initiative.  This study of policy innovation and public leadership includes an analytical framework with elements drawn from transformational, transactional, and participative leadership concepts (Bass 1990; Burns 1979; Kaufman 1981; Kotter 1995; Selznick 1984; Terry 2003; Wilson 1989; Van de Ven 2000; Van Wart 2005).  \n\nCalls for both policy innovation and new public management placed significant demands on leaders during the 1990s.  Throughout the Clinton era there were demands for major public management reforms in government (Gore 1993; Osborne and Gaebler 1993; Cohen and Eimicke 1995; Roberts and King 1996).  Reforming, reinventing, and transforming public organizations remain popular political and academic approaches to enhancing government efficiency and effectiveness (Thompson and Jones 1994; Kettl and DiIulio 1995; Altshuler and Behn 1997; Light 1997, 1998, 2005; Lynn 1996, 1998; Ingraham, Thompson, and Sanders 1998; Kellerman 1999; Heinrich and Lynn 2000; Barzelay 2001; Ingraham, Joyce and Donahue 2003; Kamensky 2004; Bertelli and Lynn 2006).  \n\nThis dissertation uses a qualitative, case study research methodology (Allison and Zelikow 1999; Bates 1998; Eckstein 1992; Elman and Elman 2001; George 1993, 1979; George and Bennett 2005; King, Keohane and Verba 1994; Polsby 1984; Van Evera 1997; and Yin 1994).

U.S. interagency coordination and alignment are indispensable to the creative design and effective implementation of national security policy and strategy.  Interagency coordination and long-range planning by the U.S. government, including the national security council and defense, state and other cabinet departments remain major shortcomings, as suggested in each of these cases.  \n\nThis study also reinforces the importance of a public administration framework of public leadership and management, in terms of setting strategic direction, aligning and integrating the efforts of various domestic and international stakeholders, and emphasizing performance measures \u2013 both for scholarly research and policymaking.  \n\nFinally, the reform of the U.N. and the international arms control regime remains an important research agenda for the fields of international relations and public administration.

The opening chapter examines what I call the \u201cintellectual property discourse\u201d as it appears in both a broader cultural context and within composition studies itself. I argue that composition studies imports an activist stance related to copyright, a stance which, I suggest, obscures the forms of power that circulate in peer production environments. These forms of power are better understood through an examination of the concept of crowds. Chapter 2 thus works through the history and concepts of crowds that developed in modernity in order to show why crowds have become the key topos for action in networked space. By tracing a history of categories used to describe crowds, I argue that crowds have taken on a new discursive value because the features traditionally associated with them have begun to create economic value through networks. Chapter 3 continues this investigation of crowds as productive units, focusing on the rhetorical positioning of free and open source software as a novel form of labor. Drawing on Michel Foucault\u2019s concept of the diagram, the chapter attempts to read free and open source software rhetoric not merely as an oppositional force in copyright arguments, but as a form of labor and power that increasingly spreads throughout economic practice. Chapter 4 will turn back from the free and open source method of software production to an instantiation of similar forces in the new writing technologies, and particularly in wikis. This chapter argues that both wikis and social networking technologies produce not only a public transparency, but rather a distinct form of temporality. Because wikis both produce and work on pure potentials for encounters, they can be read as an element of what Marxist critic Paolo Virno calls a \u201cuniversal opportunism,\u201d or what is described in the chapter\u2014drawing on the rhetorical concept of kairos\u2014as \u201ckairotic ecologies.\u201d I close by suggesting that attention to such ecologies provides a distinct framework for understanding the training that occurs in networked writing classrooms when they deploy peer production technologies.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [479], "author_name_tesi": "Ceraso, Antonio ", "last_name_ssi": "Ceraso", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Antonio", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Doyle", "Richard Doyle", "Jeffrey Nealon", "Ryan Andrew Stark", "Stephen Howard Browne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Doyle, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Doyle, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Nealon, Committee Member", "Ryan Andrew Stark, Committee Member", "Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["composition", "copyright", "rhetoric", "writing", "kairos"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "An Examination of Career Guidance Programming on Elementary School Students' Vocational Development", "id": "19050", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9083", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The process of career development is life-long (Super, 1980).

With this public safety in mind, it is of the utmost importance, to properly repair bridge decks that have deteriorated over time.\nWhen deterioration is beyond repair, a full deck replacement is warranted, but if the deterioration only occurs in some portions of the deck, there is another option.  The deteriorated concrete in those areas can be removed, and rapid setting patching materials can be placed in its stead.  These rapid setting patching materials set quickly and achieve high early strength, allowing the bridges to reopen quickly after repair.\nUnfortunately, many of these patching materials have proven themselves to be ineffective in the long run, due to heavy traffic loadings and vibration issues.  Therefore, it is necessary to test a variety of these patching materials that are on the market to determine their overall effectiveness.\nBy testing six of these materials with standard ASTM tests, material properties such as compressive strength, shrinkage, coefficient of thermal expansion, bond strength, resistance to freeze-thaw deterioration, and time of setting can be determined.

My main interest concerns the question of women\u2019s agency over marriage in honor-based cultures, which I investigate through the examination of criminal and ecclesiastical cases for \u201craptus,\u201d a legal term revived from Roman law. While \u201craptus\u201d was assimilated into common law with the primary meaning of forcible intercourse, in civil law (ius commune), the legal system in use across a large part of continental Europe, it retained the primary meaning of abduction.  In the cases examined in this research \u201craptus\u201d refers to the separation of a woman from her father or other party possessing authority over her either without or with her consent. In practice, abductions were usually done for the purpose of marriage and \u201craptus\u201d provided fathers with a legal tool for protecting or censoring their daughters. I am interested in the way in which both forcible and voluntary abductions, despite their apparent difference, reveal the importance of female and family honor, and their interdependent relation, a common feature of Mediterranean cultures: whether a woman loses her sexual honor forcibly or willingly, (usually sexual intercourse follows an abduction), the result is usually that marriage follows in order to restore her and her family\u2019s honor unless the social gap between the abductor and the abducted is too wide.  Despite the many constraints imposed on women within early modern Venetian families, I argue that because of the reparable and negotiable nature of female and family honor women were able to exercise some degree of agency over their fates. \nMoreover, against the backdrop of a broad Mediterranean cultural pattern, I have identified significant differences between the two regions under investigation, the so-called Terraferma or Venetian mainland, and the ethno-linguistically diverse Venetian Istria, in present-day Slovenia and Croatia. Significantly, I have discovered that abductions were more customary in the Venetian Istria than on the Terraferma, and particularly in the areas of the Istrian countryside that were subject to immigration from the southern Balkans.  In both Terraferma and Istria  the greater assertion of state and church power over time resulted in the decline of some forms of violence, particularly aristocratic violence targeting daughters of wealthy families. The latter was deemed by the Venetian state to be  publicly defiant of public order, and was subjected to greater state control. Similarly, I have noticed the decline of violent group abductions from early seventeenth-century Istria.  I also noticed a more accepting view of those abductions that were willingly initiated by the young couple, often against the wishes of parents or other family members.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7645], "author_name_tesi": "Cesco, Valentina ", "last_name_ssi": "Cesco", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Valentina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Landes", "Joan Landes", "Ronnie Po Chia Hsia", "Matthew Bennett Restall", "Melissa Wright"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Landes, Dissertation Advisor", "Joan Landes, Committee Chair", "Ronnie Po Chia Hsia, Committee Member", "Matthew Bennett Restall, Committee Member", "Melissa Wright, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Venice", "Istria", "abduction"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF AN ION TIME-OF-FLIGHT SPECTROMETER FOR NEUTRON DEPTH PROFILING\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "8241", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4348", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ion time-of-flight spectrometry techniques are investigated for applicability to neutron depth profiling. Time-of-flight techniques are used extensively in a wide range of scientific and technological applications including energy and mass spectroscopy.\n\nNeutron depth profiling is a near-surface analysis technique that gives concentration distribution versus depth for certain technologically important light elements. The technique uses thermal or sub-thermal neutrons to initiate (n,p) or (n,alpha) reactions. Concentration versus depth distribution is obtained by the transformation of the energy spectrum into depth distribution by using stopping force tables of the projectiles in the substrate, and by converting the number of counts into concentration using a standard sample of known dose value.\n\nConventionally, neutron depth profiling measurements are based on charged particle spectrometry, which employs semiconductor detectors such as a surface barrier detector (SBD) and the associated electronics. Measurements with semiconductor detectors are affected by a number of broadening mechanisms, which result from the interactions between the projectile ion and the detector material as well as fluctuations in the signal generation process. These are inherent features of the detection mechanism that involve the semiconductor detectors and cannot be avoided.\n\nIon time-of-flight spectrometry offers highly precise measurement capabilities, particularly for slow particles. For high-energy low-mass particles, measurement resolution tends to degrade with all other parameters fixed. The threshold for more precise ion energy measurements with respect to conventional techniques, such as direct energy measurement by a surface barrier detector, is directly related to the design and operating parameters of the device.\n\nTime-of-flight spectrometry involves correlated detection of two signals by a coincidence unit. In ion time-of-flight spectroscopy, the ion generates the primary input signal. Without loss of generality, the secondary signal is obtained by the passage of the ion through a thin carbon foil, which produces ion-induced secondary electron emission (IISEE). The time-of-flight spectrometer physically acts as an ion/electron separator. The electrons that enter the active volume of the spectrometer are transported onto the microchannel plate detector to generate the secondary signal. The electron optics can be designed in variety of ways depending on the nature of the measurement and physical requirements.\n\nTwo ion time-of-flight spectrometer designs are introduced: the parallel electric and magnetic (PEM) field spectrometer and the cross electric and magnetic (CEM) field spectrometer. The CEM field spectrometers have been extensively used in a wide range of applications where precise mass differentiation is required. The PEM field spectrometers have lately found interest in mass spectroscopy applications. The application of the PEM field spectrometer for energy measurements is a novel approach.\n\nThe PEM field spectrometer used in the measurements employs axial electric and magnetic fields along the nominal direction of the incident ion. The secondary electrons are created by a thin carbon foil on the entrance disk and transported on the microchannel plate that faces the carbon foil. The initial angular distribution of the secondary electrons has virtually no effect on the transport time of the secondary electrons from the surface of the carbon foil to the electron microchannel plate detector. Therefore, the PEM field spectrometer can offer high-resolution energy measurement for relatively lower electric fields. The measurements with the PEM field spectrometer were made with with the Tandem linear particle accelerator at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center at Yorktown Heights, NY.\n\nThe CEM field spectrometer developed for the thesis employs axial electric field along the nominal direction of the ion, and has perpendicular magnetic field. As the electric field accelerates and then decelerates the emitted secondary electron beam, the magnetic field steers the beam away from the source and focuses it onto the electron microchannel plate detector. The initial momentum distribution of the electron beam is observed to have profound effect on the electron transport time. Hence, the CEM field spectrometer measurements suffer more from spectral broadening at similar operating parameters. The CEM field spectrometer measurements were obtained with a Po-210 alpha source at the Penn State Radiation Science and Engineering Center, University Park, PA.\n\nAlthough the PEM field spectrometer suffers less from electron transport time dispersion, the CEM field spectrometer is more suited for application to neutron depth profiling. The multiple small-diameter apertures used in the PEM field configuration considerably reduces the geometric efficiency of the spectrometer. Most of the neutron depth profiling measurements, where isotropic emission of charged particles is observed, have relatively low count rates; hence, high detection efficiency is essential.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4320], "author_name_tesi": "Cetiner, Mustafa Sacit", "last_name_ssi": "Cetiner", "middle_name_ssi": "Sacit", "first_name_ssi": "Mustafa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "R Gregory Downing", "Tim Z Hossain", "Michael S Gordon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu, Committee Chair", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Member", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "R Gregory Downing, Committee Member", "Tim Z Hossain, Committee Member", "Michael S Gordon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["time-of-flight", "ion time-of-flight spectrometry", "neutron depth profiling", "coincidence spectrometry"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FRAGMENTATION OF COAL AND IMPROVED DISPERSION OF LIQUEFACTION CATALYSTS USING IONIC LIQUIDS\n", "id": "11553", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5439", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Coal has been utilized for coal-to-liquid fuels and coal-to-chemical industries both historically in South Africa and recently in China. Abundant bituminous and low-rank coal reserves in the US make them potential sources of an alternative to the oil derived petrochemical industry. Consequently, it is desirable to evaluate new processes for conversion of solid coal-to-clean liquid fuels. One such approach may utilize ionic liquids, a relatively new addition to industrial processing. Ionic liquids can engage in a wide range of intermolecular interactions with coal that may result in alternative approaches to fragment, disperse, and dissolve coal. They have negligible vapor pressure, are non-flammable, and would be easier to handle than traditional solvent approaches.\n\nThe goal of this work was to explore the ability of certain ionic liquids (ILs) to fragment, disperse and partially dissolve coals in order to allow a better contact with micron size catalyst particles prior to direct coal liquefaction. Attention was focused primarily on the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [bmim][Cl] and the coals studied were Illinois No.6 bituminous coal and Power River Basin subbituminous coal. Coal was mixed with ILs in a ratio of 10% by weight at 100 \u00baC in an oil bath without agitation. Fragmentation was evaluated by optical microscopy.\n\nIt was found that the IL [bmim][Cl] fragmented and dispersed Illinois No. 6 coal to a remarkable extent. Optical microscopy demonstrated that the -100 mesh particles were reduced in size to <10 microns. Other solvents are also known to fragment coal but none are capable of such a large particle size reduction. PRB subbituminous coal tested also fragmented extensively, but to a lesser degree than Illinois No. 6 coal. Fragmentation was probably a result of ability of ILs to fragment, dissolve and disrupt intermolecular interactions in these coals. Such dispersion is likely beneficial for liquefaction where coal and catalyst interactions are important for both yield and quality.\n\nThe ability of [bmim][Cl] to fragment the coal was then used to obtain good contact with commercially obtained 2 \u00b5m MoS2 catalyst. Single-staged liquefaction was performed at 425 (or 400) \u00b0C for 30 min. and tetralin was used as hydrogen-donor solvent. As a result of close contact, a subsequent liquefaction under standard conditions resulted in a product that was almost completely soluble (99%, dmmf) in pyridine. The yields of soluble material obtained for two subbituminous coals were less, but were comparable to those obtained in work reported in the literature that used soluble catalyst precursors. Surprisingly, in some experiments, oil yields were very high (50%). The oils are most desirable products in liquefaction. Thus use of ILs can improve the yield and or the quality of liquefaction products. Also it was shown that IL recovery is possible and it was concluded that this approach should be explored as a direct coal liquefaction method.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5431], "author_name_tesi": "Cetiner, Ruveyda ", "last_name_ssi": "Cetiner", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ruveyda", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan P Mathews", "Jonathan P Mathews", "Paul C Painter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan P Mathews, Thesis Advisor", "Jonathan P Mathews, Thesis Advisor", "Paul C Painter, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["dispersion of liquefaction catalysts", "Fragmentation of coal", "ionic liquids"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF NANOSTRUCTURED POLY(P-XYLYLENE) FILMS", "id": "8398", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4405", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nanostructured polymeric films are deposited with oblique angle polymerization of poly-p-xylylene (PPX) derivatives.

Nanostructured PPX films are simulated with a two dimensional Monte Carlo model. Simulation results emphasize the significance of polymerization among deposited particles. Computed values of the power-law scaling parameters are in good agreement with the experimental results for nanostructured PPX films. This study aimed to provide an understanding of ways to control the growth of nanostructured polymers deposited with vapor phase polymerization. Nanostructured PPX films are versatile platforms for developing inexpensive, high throughput manufacturing techniques to create a new generation of antifouling materials for naval and biomedical applications.

Yet, in teleost fish, one of the most diverse vertebrate groups, the consequences of sex-specific life history demands on spatial cognition remain unclear. Many evolutionary hypotheses have been proposed to explain why sex differences in spatial cognition arise, and several of these discuss the natural spatial behavior of the two sexes. Given that remarkably varied life history strategies are present in fish, determining whether sex differences in spatial cognition are present in teleosts may help identify which of the current hypotheses that address sex differences in spatial cognition have the greatest explanatory power. This thesis focuses on understanding sex differences in spatial cognition in a commonly studied teleost fish, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). This species was selected because previous work has described the natural history of the guppy and demonstrated sex differences in mating and dispersal patterns, as well as in regions of the brain responsible for spatial cognition. I first evaluated whether adult male and female guppies show sex-specific patterns in spatial learning or preference for strategy of spatial navigation (the first set of experiments). I found that male and female guppies that were given the opportunity to solve a spatial task using either a landmark or turn-based navigation strategy solved the task in the same number of trials, indicating analogous spatial learning ability. However, when the sexes were tested for their preference of spatial navigation strategy, male guppies, similar to male polygynous mammals, exhibited a preference for a turn-based (egocentric) spatial strategy while female guppies exhibited equal preference for either a turn-based or landmark-based (allocentric) strategy. This suggests that either spatial navigation preference is highly conserved or selective forces have reprised similar sex differences in multiple taxa through convergent evolution. In order to address how these sex differences in spatial cognition might arise, I ran a further experiment in which male guppies were exposed to a sex steroid hormone that typically produces feminizing effects in male teleosts, 17B-estradiol. Unexpectedly both the estradiol and vehicle-exposed males exhibited an equal preference for both turn-based and landmark-based navigational strategies. This result is discussed in terms of the possible effects of all male housing (used in experiment 2), compared to mixed sex housing (used in experiment 1), and potential experiments that would address the relative effects of housing and exogenous estradiol exposure are proposed. Although estradiol has been demonstrated to have feminizing effects on somatic traits, it may be that the effects of estradiol on cognition are more complex and cannot be described as feminizing because of sex-specific responses to sex steroids.

Chapter 1 summarizes and reviews current hypotheses addressing the effects of developmental stress, including models formulated by primarily human or biomedical researchers (i.e. the differential susceptibility and biological sensitivity to context theories) and hypotheses proposed by researchers spanning the fields of ecology, biology, and neurophysiology (i.e. the mismatch hypothesis, and allostasis and reactive scope models). Subsequent chapters (2-6) empirically assess the long-term effects of exposure to chronic unpredictable stress during adolescence (e.g. isolation, crowding, damp bedding) on adult phenotype in laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus). These adolescent-stressed rats were compared to unstressed, control animals that were maintained in standard, predictable conditions throughout development. Chapter 2 investigates the lasting effects of exposure to chronic unpredictable stress in adolescence on adult decision making, coping response, cognitive bias, and exploratory behavior in rats. The results showed that exposure to adolescent-stress can have long-term impacts on behavior and cognition by shaping the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli, behavioral response to adverse events, and how animals make decisions. It was also found that adolescent-stress can induce short-term changes in the way animals interact with novel stimuli and explore an environment. Chapter 3 examines the effects of adolescent-stress on learning (both associative and reversal) and memory (both reference and working) starting 110 days after completion of the adolescent-stress treatment. Adolescent-stressed rats exhibited enhanced reversal learning, an indicator of behavioral flexibility, but showed no change in associative learning and reference memory abilities compared to rats reared without stress. Chapter 4 assesses the lasting effects of adolescent-stress on anxiety in a novelty suppressed feeding test and found elevated anxiety levels 6.5 months after exposure to stress ceased, which is after the median lifespan of wild Norway rats. In Chapter 5, I test the mismatch hypothesis, described in Chapter 1, by quantifying the effect of adolescent-stress on foraging behavior and performance in adulthood, under both low and high-threat conditions. The results suggest that adolescent-stress exposure enabled rats to forage more effectively under novel threat in adulthood and that phenotypic changes resulting from stressful experiences during adolescence may enhance function in future high-threat conditions, supporting the mismatch hypothesis. Chapter 6 investigates whether adolescent-stress alters the allocation of time between foraging and vigilance behaviors in low and high-threat conditions in adulthood. I found no evidence of a tradeoff between foraging and vigilance, but under low-threat conditions adolescent-stressed rats spent more time foraging and being vigilant than unstressed rats, suggesting that adolescent-stress may enhance anticipation of threat in adulthood. Finally, Chapter 7 integrates the prior chapters by contextualizing the findings of this thesis in modern theories of developmental stress and introducing the arousal-shift hypothesis to explain the lasting effects of developmental stress on cognition. Together the results described in this thesis suggest that stress in adolescence can cause lasting changes in phenotype that persist into adulthood and serve some functional role that is dependent upon the environmental conditions an animal experiences later in life. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11329], "author_name_tesi": "Chaby, Lauren Evelyn", "last_name_ssi": "Chaby", "middle_name_ssi": "Evelyn", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli", "David John Vandenbergh", "Charles Geier", "David Peter Hughes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read, Dissertation Advisor", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read, Committee Chair", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Member", "Charles Geier, Committee Member", "David Peter Hughes, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adolescence", "cognitive bias", "coping", "decision making", "chronic unpredictable stress", "Rattus norvegicus", "developmental stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Characteristic Behavior of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells during Cold Start\n\n\n", "id": "8431", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "950", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this study, experimental constant-current cold starts were performed on a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) from -10\u00b0C in order to characterize high frequency resistance behavior (HFR), water motion, and ice accumulation before, during, and after cold start.  A new diagnostic method for rapid and repeatable cold starts was developed and verified.  HFR is shown to be a key diagnostic for cold start behavior and performance.  Cold start performance, as measured by the amount of water produced during the cold start, is found to be optimized when cell resistance is increasing prior to startup, which is indicative of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) dehydration.  During cold start, cell resistance initially decreases due to PEM hydration by the product water.  Interestingly, after a certain water uptake capacity of the PEM is reached, resistance increases due to ice formation in and around the cathode catalyst layer (CL) with evidence of super-cooled water flow at low currents.  Utilizing lower startup currents apparently does not increase the PEM water storage capability, but does increase the total volume of ice in and around the CL before freeze-out.  Lower startup currents were found to produce more total heat, but at a reduced rate compared to high current densities.  Therefore, an acceptable current density range exists for a given stack design which ensures sufficient heat is produced to raise cell temperature above 0\u00b0C before freezing out occurs, which is the overall design goal.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [942], "author_name_tesi": "Chacko, Charles Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Chacko", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Charles", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew M Mench"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew M Mench, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cold start", "polymer electrolyte fuel cells", "high frequency resistance"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "CONTROLLED RELEASE OF NISIN FROM A BIOPOLYMER BASED FILM \nFOR FOOD PACKAGING APPLICATIONS\n", "id": "8190", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3053", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nisin is a bacteriocin that is permitted to be used in food as a natural food preservative and is approved &#8215;generally recognized as safe\u2018 (GRAS) by both Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and World Health Organization (WHO). Nisin is commercially available as Nisaplin\u00ae. Pure nisin has an activity of 40 x 106 IU/g and Nisaplin\u00ae has an activity of 1 x 106 IU/g. In some food systems, especially meat, it has been observed that nisin loses its activity over time because it binds to protein, fat etc. Several researchers have reported that the direct addition of antimicrobials to food leads to a loss of activity. However, this loss can be prevented to a great extent by controlled release of antimicrobials to food. This work was undertaken to develop a biopolymer-based film for the controlled release of nisin into food systems for inhibiting pathogenic organisms. The first phase of the research identified potential biopolymers for the film matrix and evaluated their stability in an aqueous system. In the second phase, nisin was entrapped within seven biopolymer-based films and the antimicrobial activity of the films was evaluated by the agar diffusion method using Micrococcus luteus. The third phase of the research consisted of modeling the nisin release kinetics via a mechanistic diffusion model, as well as an empirical Weibull model. These models were validated by experiments in the final phase. In the final experiments with corn zein, nisin release was quantified using a high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) technique.\nUsing the agar diffusion method, it was found that xanthan films and locust bean films collapsed or dissolved on the agar surface without producing a distinguishable\niv\ninhibition zone. Kappa and iota carrageenan films did not collapse on the agar surface, but failed to inhibit M. luteus. It was hypothesized that nisin was not released from kappa and iota carrageenan due to the physical entrapment of nisin in the gel network. Blended films made with kappa and non-gelling lamda carrageenan exhibited inhibition against M. luteus. The amount of nisin released in the agar diffusion method increased as the concentration of lamda carrageenan in the film increased. Blended films made with kappa carrageenan and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) also exhibited nisin release. Nisin release increased as the concentration of HPMC in the film increased. Corn zein films containing Nisaplin\u00ae formed clear inhibition zones using the agar diffusion method. The nisin released from these films into citrate buffer was further quantified using a HPLC technique. The profile of released nisin demonstrated that as the corn zein concentration in the film increased, nisin release decreased. The diffusivity of nisin decreased from 38 x 10-11 to 8 x 10-11 cm2/s (a fourfold decrease), as the corn zein concentration in the film increased from 4 to 10% (w/v). This observation may be attributed to increased tortuosity in the film. Other researchers also have reported that the release of active compounds from a matrix decreases as the biopolymer concentration increases. Mathematical analysis of the early portion of the nisin release profile indicated that nisin release from corn zein films exhibits a pseudo-Fickian behavior. An empirical Weibull model was developed and tested. It demonstrated excellent prediction (R2 > 0.95), power, and described the kinetics of nisin release well.\nCorn zein films can be used to develop a matrix for controlled release of nisin in food system, thereby maintaining a constant microbial inhibitory effect. Also, release can\nv\nbe controlled by varying the concentration of biopolymer in the matrix. Corn zein films can be used as coating within a package or as an edible coating for the product for controlled release of antimicrobials and other active compounds. Since corn zein is hydrophobic, it can also be successfully used for delivery of active compounds within aqueous food systems such as beverages, meat and other high moisture foods.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3042], "author_name_tesi": "Chacko, Jino ", "last_name_ssi": "Chacko", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jino", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr John D Floros", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr John D Floros, Thesis Advisor", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nisin", "Nisaplin", "Controlled release", "Food packaging", "pseudo-Fickian"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PERSUASIVE HOPE THEORY AND HOPE APPEALS IN MESSAGES ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND SEASONAL INFLUENZA PREVENTION\n\n", "id": "10950", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "87", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Climate change is an important challenge that has numerous implications for our health and well-being. Communicators have many significant roles to play in addressing this challenge. One role is to use persuasive communication to change or reinforce the public\u2019s attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to support climate protection. Messages designed to evoke hope have the potential to be an effective strategy for influencing behavior and behavioral antecedents related to climate protection. A review of extant literature indicated that no theories existed to elucidate the role of hope in persuasion or to guide the development of hope appeals. Therefore, I developed persuasive hope theory (PHT) based on appraisal theory, a discrete model of emotions, and message design theories. PHT defines hope as a discrete emotion that involves appraisals of a future or unknown event as important, goal congruent, consistent with a better future, and possible. The theory also advances a framework of hope appeals as messages that induce hope by presenting an opportunity and that identifies ways to take advantage of the opportunity. I conducted qualitative and quantitative formative research to guide the development of hope appeal messages based on PHT. The messages focused on climate protection and, for comparison, seasonal influenza prevention. I used these messages to test PHT via two quasi-experimental studies. These studies examined relationships between subjective feelings of hope and appraisals, explored relationships between subjective feelings of hope and behavioral antecedents, assessed the effects of hope appeals, and identified individual characteristics that affect the above relationships and effects. The behavioral antecedents included self-efficacy, response efficacy, attitudes toward the recommended behaviors, and behavior intentions. The individual characteristics included perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, subjective knowledge, and environmental identity. The findings from the empirical studies predominantly support the relationships predicted by persuasive hope theory. Most significantly, the findings indicate that communicators can design messages that create hope and that increase appraisals of importance, goal congruence, future expectation, and possibility. These appraisals and feelings of hope both have implications for antecedents to behavior. Thus, this research offers several theoretical as well as practical implications for communication and persuasion scholarship and practice. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [88], "author_name_tesi": "Chadwick, Amy Elaine", "last_name_ssi": "Chadwick", "middle_name_ssi": "Elaine", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roxanne Louise Parrott", "Roxanne Louise Parrott", "Michael L Hecht", "James Hogan", "Brenton Yarnal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roxanne Louise Parrott, Dissertation Advisor", "Roxanne Louise Parrott, Committee Chair", "Michael L Hecht, Committee Member", "James Hogan, Committee Member", "Brenton Yarnal, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["theory development", "affect", "hope", "flu", "seasonal influenza", "global warming", "climate change", "message development", "environmental communication", "health communication", "social influence", "message design", "persuasion", "emotion", "persuasive hope theory", "focus groups", "online survey", "college students"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Optimizing LNG Procurement Strategy via Portfolio Theory:\nApplication to the South Korean Import Portfolio in the Context of US Supply\n", "id": "18921", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8900", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current main criteria for Korean LNG supplier selection are import price reductions and increases in supply stability.

By conducting the MBS simulations, the dynamic and steady-state responses of the sprung mass can be shortly predicted when the vehicle runs on an irregular road surface such as step curb or pothole. A multi-body vehicle model consists of a sprung mass, simplified tire model, and suspension system to connect them. For the simplified tire model, a rigid ring tire model is mostly used due to its efficiency. \n\nThe rigid ring tire model consists of a rigid ring representing the tread and the belt, elastic sidewalls, and rigid rim. Several in-plane and out-of-plane parameters need to be determined through tire tests to represent a real pneumatic tire. Physical tire tests are costly and difficult in operations. Thus, the parameters for the rigid ring tire model are alternatively predicted by conducting virtual tire tests using a finite element analysis (FEA) tire model. \n\nA nonlinear three-dimensional FEA tire model representing a truck tire, 295/75R22.5, is constructed by implementing three-layered membrane elements, hyperelastic solid elements, and beam elements. Then, the FEA tire model is validated by comparing its in-plane and out-of-plane responses with physical measurements. The virtual and physical responses show good agreements. After successful validations of the FEA tire model, virtual tire tests are conducted to predict the in-plane and out-of-plane parameters for the rigid ring tire models. \n\nThe predicted parameters are implemented in the rigid ring tire model, and the model undergoes water drainage ditches 90\u00a1\u00c6 and 45\u00a1\u00c6 to the tire running direction to predict dynamic in-plane and out-of-plane tire responses at various tire loads. Vertical displacement of the tire spindle, tire contact forces, and moments are plotted and compared with those of the FEA tire model. The in-plane tire responses show good agreements between the results of the two models. On the other hand, the out-of-plane tire responses are relatively not in good agreements due to the significantly different tire contact area geometries of the two tire models on the 45\u00a1\u00c6 ditch. \n\nIn the simulations of the FEA and rigid ring tire models, only constant vertical tire load is applied to the tire models. Additional tire load due to the vertical acceleration of the sprung mass during tire operations is not considered. Thus, a sprung mass and suspension system is assembled with the tire models to include the effect of the vertical sprung mass motion, which represents a quarter-vehicle model and a closer model to real vehicle applications. Then, the models undergo a 90\u00a1\u00c6 ditch at various running speeds. The vertical accelerations of the tire spindles are predicted during the ditch runs and compared with measurements to check whether or not the rigid ring tire model in the quarter-vehicle environment predicts acceptable responses.\n\nModern high computational capability enables to establish a reliable virtual tire and quarter-vehicle model test environments. The developed quarter-vehicle model predicts not only dynamic tire responses but also sprung mass responses to irregular road surface inputs. Thus, a trustworthy quarter-vehicle model can replace the conventional field durability tests, which saves product development cost and time. In addition, virtual tests under similar conditions can be easily repeated. Higher quality products at lower cost are undoubtedly promising.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5920], "author_name_tesi": "Chae, Seokyong ", "last_name_ssi": "Chae", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seokyong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Moustafa El Gindy", "James Patrick Runt", "Charles E Bakis", "Ashok D Belegundu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Moustafa El Gindy, Committee Chair", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Chair", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member", "Ashok D Belegundu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Truck Tire Model", "FEA", "Rigid Ring Tire Model", "Quarter Vehicle Model", "Durability Test"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "A Theoretical Investigation of Hydrostatic and Geostrophic Adjustment in a Compressible Atmosphere", "id": "6144", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2841", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The adjustment of a compressible, stably stratified atmosphere to sources of\nhydrostatic and geostrophic imbalance is investigated using a linear model.

Estimates of Earth structure and earthquake parameters can help us attacking important scientific questions such as how the surface geology features relates to subsurface structure, what the relationship between the seismicity and subsurface structure changes, what is the crustal structure beneath polar ice, how reliable are our estimates of subsurface structure parameters, and how does earthquake rupture in a complex fault system. For Earth structure imaging, increasing station coverage provide large quantities of seismic observations. These observations are not free of noise and some suffered from scattering noise. We developed techniques to reduce scattering noise by incorporating observations from adjacent stations and to extract signals from deeper structure using better-determined shallow prior information. Multi-objective 3D inversions using the noise-reduced signals and complementary geophysical observations were conducted to produce reliable subsurface images beneath the western United States and the eastern United States. Stochastic inversions in the polar regions estimated both the first-order subsurface structural variations and associated uncertainties. Additionally, we applied a recently developed technique to relocate earthquakes in the off-Sumatra region. Reliably estimated Earth structure and earthquake parameters can advance our understanding of the correlation between seismicity and subsurface structure. In the meantime, earthquake hazard assessment can benefit from these newly calculated models and parameters. We also made efforts on improving the accessibility of our results. In the first chapter, I introduce the scope of the dissertation, challenges and opportunities in related study areas, and summaries of individual chapter. Future directions that may be approached based on studies in this dissertation are summarized in the last chapter. \n\nIn the second chapter, we use P wave receiver functions from the western U.S. and adjacent regions to construct a receiver function wavefield interpolation scheme that helps to equalize the lateral sampling of the receiver functions and the surface wave dispersion and to greatly simplify the receiver functions. Spatial interpolation and smoothing suppress poorly sampled and difficult to interpret back azimuthal variations and allow the extraction of the first-order features in the receiver function wavefield, including observations from several ray parameter ranges. We combine the interpolated receiver functions with Rayleigh wave dispersion estimates and surface gravity observations to estimate the 3-D shear wave speed beneath the region. Speed variations in the 3-D model correlate strongly with expected geologic variations and illuminate broad-scale features of the western U.S. crust and upper mantle. The model is smooth, self-consistent, and demonstrates the compatibility of the interpolated receiver functions and dispersion observations.\n\nIn the third chapter, we simultaneously invert smoothed P-wave receiver functions, Rayleigh wave phase and group velocity measurements, and Bouguer gravity observations for the 3D shear wave speed beneath the eastern U.S. and the northern Mississippi Embayment regions. Using period-coverage-broadened (3-250 s) surface-wave observations and spatially smoothed receiver functions, our velocity models are robust, reliable and rich in detail. Our shear-wave velocity models fit all three types of observations well. The resulting velocity model in for the broad region of the eastern U.S. shows thinner crust beneath New England, the east coast and the Mississippi embayment. Relatively thicker crust was found beneath the stable North America craton. Relatively slower upper mantle was imaged beneath New England, the east coast and western Mississippi embayment. We also explored the relationship between the subsurface structure and seismicity in the eastern U.S. We found earthquakes often locate near regions with seismic velocity variations, but not universally. Not all regions of significant subsurface wave speed changes are loci of seismicity. Eastern U.S. thrust faulting weakly correlates with slower upper mantle speed along the coast and within New England and southeastern Canada. In the northern Mississippi Embayment, the region of the large earthquakes in 1811-12, we imaged a relatively fast lower crust and a relatively slower uppermost mantle. \n\n\nReverberations of teleseismic compressional (P-) waves within a glacier or ice sheet may mask signals associated with crustal structure beneath the ice. In the fourth chapter, we remove the signal associated with the ice from teleseismic P-waves using a wavefield downward continuation and decomposition technique that depends on known ice layer properties such as ice thickness, velocity, and attenuation. We test the method using data from nine stations in Antarctica and one station in Greenland. We deconvolve the downward-continued seismic wave vectors to create P-wave receiver functions that minimize the ice-layer reverberations in order to better measure signals from deeper structures. The subsurface P-wave receiver functions have similar sensitivities to crustal structure as those calculated from stations installed on bedrock. Synthetic experiments indicate subsurface P-wave receiver functions can constrain crustal structure more tightly than surface P-wave receiver functions when ice layer properties are known. We model the subsurface P-wave receiver functions using a Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion and constrain the product of crustal thickness and the column-average crustal-slowness beneath the stations. Our subglacial shear-speed and thickness estimates are consistent with previous investigations at most stations. At station SUMG in south-central Greenland, our results suggest a thicker crust than from previous estimates. \n\nIn the fifth chapter, we analyze aftershocks of the 2012 Off-Coast of Sumatra Earthquake Sequence. The aftershocks were relocated using surface-wave cross-correlations to improve relative location precision. Unlike observed patterns along mature transform faults in other regions, the relocated aftershocks seldom align along simple linear trends that are compatible with the strikes of the faults as estimated by the GCMT catalog. The relocation of roughly 60 moderate-earthquake epicentroids suggests that the faulting involved in the 2012 earthquake sequence occurred in a region populated with many short fault segments. The inferred complex fault system agrees with a recent bathymetry survey. Statistical analysis and temporal variations of aftershocks show a relatively low number of aftershocks but possibly a relatively slow decay of the aftershocks. The patterns in the aftershocks suggest that the formation of the boundary and eventual localization of deformation between the Indian and Australian plate is a complicated process. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14120], "author_name_tesi": "Chai, Chengping ", "last_name_ssi": "Chai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chengping", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles J.

The survey instrument used to assess this relationship was the Dimensions of the Learning Organization Questionnaire along with both perceptual and objective performance measurements.\n\tThe seven learning organization dimensions under investigation included: 1) create continuous learning opportunities, 2) promote inquiry and dialogue, 3) promote collaboration and team learning, 4) empower people toward a collective vision, 5) establish systems to capture and share learning, 6) connect the organization to its community and environment, and 7) provide strategic leadership for learning.\n\tSimple and stepwise multiple regression equations were used to examine the relationship between the learning organization dimensions and each of the following performance categories:  operational, knowledge, financial, and organizational.   Organizational performance is defined as the weighted combination of both perceived (operational and knowledge) and objective (hard financial) performance information.  Hard financial performance metrics included gross profit margin, return-on-asset, and return-on-equity results for each target company over a period of 9 months preceding survey distribution.\n\tSix research questions yielded various levels of results.  The most frequently observed learning dimensions included continuous learning, community connections, and strategic leadership.  One-way ANOVA indicated significant differences based on both company size and industry sector.  Higher levels of team learning were recorded in smaller companies compared to larger companies.  Higher levels of continuous learning were recorded in utility companies; higher levels of team learning and embedded learning systems were found in chemical producers; and higher levels of strategic leadership were found in the entertainment industry.  \n\tStepwise regression of the learning dimensions indicated variance explanations of 28 percent for operational performance; 32 percent for knowledge performance; 6 percent for hard financial performance; and 18 percent for multi-dimensional organization performance.

The lemniscal system, which contains the thalamic nucleus VPM, has neurons with sharply-tuned receptive fields, whereas the paralemniscal system, which contains the nucleus POm, has large multi-whisker receptive fields. In layer IV of the SI whisker representation, cellular aggregates called barrels are separated from each other by zones known as septa. Barrels receive thalamic information from the lemniscal VPM, whereas the septa receive input from the paralemniscal POm. In view of their segregated thalamic inputs, the barrel and septal compartments are thought to represent the cortical extensions of the lemniscal and paralemniscal processing streams, respectively.\t\nIn the first project, we used a retrograde tracing paradigm to characterize SI projections to MI and SII, with respect to the barrel and septal compartments. Following MI tracer injections, the labeled neurons in SI were predominantly aligned with the layer IV septa. By contrast, tracer injections in SII revealed neurons that were aligned with both barrel and septal compartments. Therefore, MI receives information mainly from the paralemniscal system, whereas SII receives information from both lemniscal and paralemniscal pathways.\nIn the second project, single unit activity was recorded from neurons in the layer IV barrel and septal compartments. During multi-whisker stimulation at progressively higher frequencies, septal neurons showed increasing latencies as a function of stimulus frequency, but the response latencies of the barrel neurons remained constant. \nIn the third project, we recorded simultaneously from SI and MI neurons during multi-whisker stimulation. A laminar analysis of MI revealed the strongest and fastest sensory responses occurred in the deeper layers of cortex. These responses always occurred after SI discharges and also showed increasing latencies as a function of stimulus frequency. Furthermore, MI sensory responses decreased by 80% upon reversible inactivation of SI. Finally, cross-correlation analysis revealed dynamic shifts in SI-MI correlations as a function of stimulation frequency. These results show that sensory responses in MI are elicited by projections from the paralemniscal pathway. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5801], "author_name_tesi": "Chakrabarti, Shubhodeep ", "last_name_ssi": "Chakrabarti", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shubhodeep", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin Douglas Alloway", "Robert J Milner", "Matthew D Mc Echron", "John E Hoover", "John Ellis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin Douglas Alloway, Committee Chair", "Robert J Milner, Committee Member", "Matthew D Mc Echron, Committee Member", "John E Hoover, Committee Member", "John Ellis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["TRACER", "CROSS-CORRELATION ANALYSIS", "BARREL CORTEX", "SI", "MI"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FLIGHT PATH PLANNING OF UAV BASED ON ATMOSPHERIC ENERGY HARVESTING", "id": "11226", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "407", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents an approach to planning long distance soaring trajectories which exploit atmospheric energy to enable long distance, long duration flights by small and micro unmanned aerial vehicles.

The energy map provides the path to the goal as a sequence of way points, the optimal speeds to fly for each segment between way points and the heading required to \nfly along a segment.

While small autonomous vehicles can perform missions that are too risky (or infeasible) for larger vehicles, the missions are limited by the amount of energy that can be carried on board the vehicle. Path planning techniques that either minimize energy consumption or exploit energy available in the environment can thus increase range and endurance. Path planning is complicated by significant spatial (and potentially temporal) variations in the environment. While the main focus is on autonomous aircraft, this research also addresses autonomous ground vehicles.  \n\nRange and endurance of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be greatly improved by utilizing energy from the atmosphere. Wind can be exploited to minimize energy consumption of a small UAV. But wind, like any other atmospheric component, is a space and time varying phenomenon. To effectively use wind for long range missions, both exploration and exploitation of wind is critical.\n\nThis research presents a kinematics based tree algorithm which efficiently handles the four dimensional (three spatial and time) path planning problem. The Kinematic Tree algorithm provides a sequence of waypoints, airspeeds, heading and bank angle commands for each segment of the path.  The planner is shown to be resolution complete and computationally efficient. Global optimality of the cost function cannot be claimed, as energy is gained from the atmosphere, making the cost function $inadmissible$. However the Kinematic Tree is  shown to be optimal up to resolution if the cost function is admissible. Simulation results show the efficacy of this planning method for a glider in complex real wind data. Simulation results verify that the planner is able to extract energy from the atmosphere enabling long range missions.  \n\nThe Kinematic Tree planning framework, developed to minimize energy consumption of UAVs, is applied for path planning in ground robots.  In traditional path planning problem the focus is on obstacle avoidance and navigation. The optimal Kinematic Tree algorithm named Kinematic Tree* is shown to find optimal paths to reach the destination while avoiding obstacles.  A more challenging path planning scenario arises for planning in complex terrain. This research shows how the Kinematic Tree* algorithm can be extended to find minimum energy paths for a ground vehicle in difficult mountainous terrain.

Applications of classical concepts to these unconventional materials are proving to be insufficient and there is a need to generate data on the fundamental processes of fluid transport through nano-porosity networks. This work attempts to address this issue through an array of flow and materials characterization experiments. The context of this integrated petrophysical analysis is the examination of the impact of fluid leakoff and post stimulation shut-in or \u201csoaking time\u201d on effective gas permeability. Past research on fluid leakoff and soaking time has been predominantly conducted with relatively high permeability rocks and for short durations of up to 15 days. We present data on shales with nano-Darcy (10-6 md) permeability and have run experiments for up to 30 days. A pulse-decay permeability apparatus has been custom designed to accurately measure gas permeabilities down to 1nD and the results have been scrutinized in conjunction with X-Ray CT, SEM imaging, Mercury Porosimetry and XRD analysis. Results indicate that laminations and micro-fractures play an important role in fluid transport properties in these ultra-tight shales. There appears to be very little connected porosity at scales longer than a few millimeters, making clastic permeability virtually non-existent. The consequences of fluid leakoff are severe and the introduction of relatively small quantities of liquid into the rock matrix leads to orders of magnitude reductions in effective permeability. The impact of this leakoff fluid then evolves significantly as it is spontaneously redistributed through the rock matrix due to capillary imbibition. Base permeability or the initial absolute (single phase) permeability of dry sample is found to be key to understanding the consequences of soaking time \u2013 high permeability samples experience relatively minor permeability impairment due to leakoff and permeability recovery with soaking time while tighter samples experience permeability damage greater than 90% due to leakoff which continues to decline with soaking time.

Each nucleosome contains ~150 bp of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 called the nucleosome core. Multiple repeats of the nucleosome cores connected by extended stretches of DNA called the nucleosome linkers form nucleosome arrays. The nucleosome arrays are folded into compact higher-order structures that are essential for the vital processes such as chromosome segregation, DNA transcription, replication, recombination and repair. Gene transcription occurs in the context of structurally distinct chromosomal domains. Chromosomal domains containing structurally open and transcriptionally active genes and those containing compact chromatin and mostly repressed genes are defined as \u201ceuchromatin\u201d and \u201cheterochromatin\u201d, respectively. The DNA sequences in euchromatin are selectively accessible to the transcriptional machinery establishing the first level of gene regulation. Chromatin boundary elements that separate the chromatin domains serve as cis-acting regulatory DNA signals required to protect genes from the effects of the neighboring heterochromatin. In the yeast genome, boundary elements act by establishing barriers for heterochromatin spreading and are sufficient to protect a reporter gene from transcriptional silencing when inserted between the silencer and the reporter gene. Chromatin boundaries have been successfully used in vectors for gene therapy. Understanding their mechanism will make gene delivery and gene therapy more efficient in remedying inherited genetic disorders.\n\nHere we dissected the functional topography of silencers and boundary elements within circular minichromosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the two well-characterized yeast silencers, HML-E and HML-I, can efficiently repress the URA3 reporter on a multi-copy yeast minichromosome and we further showed that two distinct heterochromatin boundary elements STAR and TEF2-UASrpg are able to limit the heterochromatin spreading in circular minichromosomes. In contrast to what had been observed in the yeast genome, we found that in minichromosomes the heterochromatin boundary elements inhibit silencing of the reporter gene even when just one boundary element is positioned at the distal end of the URA3 reporter or upstream of the silencer elements. Thus the STAR and TEF2-UASrpg boundary elements inhibit chromatin silencing through an antisilencing activity independently of their position or orientation in minichromosomes rather than by creating a position-specific barrier as seen in the genome. We propose that the circular DNA topology facilitates interactions between the boundary and silencing elements in the minichromosomes.\n\nWe have also examined spreading of the gene silencing through an array of nucleosomes with high DNA-histone affinity placed between the silencer and the reporter in S. cerevisiae minichromosomes. Spreading of gene silencing was observed through an array of up to eight nucleosomes. We have examined the structure and function of nucleosome arrays with long repeats typical of heterochromatin in higher eukaryotes and with shorter repeats predominantly found in S. cerevisiae chromatin. We observed that while both long and short repeats were able to conduct silencing in minichromosomes, the short nucleosomal repeats were more efficient in conducting silencing in vivo compared to the longer repeats. High-resolution chromatin mapping with micrococcal nuclease showed that the nucleosomal positioning is not significantly altered by chromatin silencing. We suggest that the shorter nucleosomal repeats found in yeast are more suitable for conducting silencing than the longer repeats due to their higher propensity to support interactions between the silencer and the promoter along the chromatin fiber.

The inherent complexity and uncertainty in complex systems pose a challenging problem to health monitoring, since first principle models of these systems, are usually oversimplified, inaccurate, or may not be available at all. Human-engineered multi-component systems are usually interconnected physically as well as through the use of feedback control loops. Therefore, the degradation of a single component may affect the input streams to the remaining components. Furthermore, in most practical situations, the underlying system might need to operate in different operating regimes and under diverse input conditions.\n\nThe purpose of the work reported in this dissertation is to develop a robust and computationally inexpensive system identification technique based on a formal language-theoretic formulation from the input/output characteristics. The objective here is to make the identification algorithm invariant with the input conditions, but it should be sensitive to changes in the parameters of the actual dynamical system.\n\nThe proposed method involves abstraction of a qualitative description from a general dynamical system structure, using state space embedding of the output and input data-stream and discretization of the resultant pseudo-state and input spaces. The system identification is achieved through grammatical inference techniques, and the information is extracted in a compressed form as statistical patterns of evolving anomaly through usage of symbolic dynamic filtering (SDF) serving as the feature extractor. Support vector machines (SVM) have been used for classification between nominal and faulty cases with a rigorous mathematical framework of detection rates.\n\nConditions for monotonicity of the symmetric Kullback-Leibler relative entropy with deteriorating fault conditions have been derived and a bound on the model likelihood has been proposed based on Lyapunov exponents.\n\nThe proposed theory has been validated on several experimental and simulation test-beds. The first of these test-beds is a permanent magnet synchronous motor undergoing a gradual degradation of the magnetic flux linkage under diverse loading conditions. This concept has also been used for fault detection on a commercial-scale two-spool turbofan engine simulation model, provided by NASA. Another experiment involves development of an integrated computer simulation model of a generic entrained-bed slagging gasifier for real-time degradation monitoring and condition-based maintenance of refractory walls. The integrated simulation model yields: (a) quasi-steady-state spatial temperature profiles at any cross-section of the gasification system, and (b) dynamic response of the refractory wall temperature that is measured by an array of sensors installed at specified locations on the external surface of the gasifier wall. The information from dynamic response of refractory temperature is processed to characterize the health status of refractory walls in the gasification system.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6047], "author_name_tesi": "Chakraborty, Subhadeep ", "last_name_ssi": "Chakraborty", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Subhadeep", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Asok Ray", "Asok Ray", "Matthew M Mench", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Shashi Phoha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Asok Ray, Dissertation Advisor", "Asok Ray, Committee Chair", "Matthew M Mench, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member", "Shashi Phoha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fault Detection and Isolation", "Symbolic Dynamics", "System Identification", "Time Series Data Analysis", "PMSM", "C-MAPSS", "Refractory Failure in Slagging Gasifiers"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Territorial Self-fashioning: Place-making in Late 19th and Early 20th Century Colonial India", "id": "18944", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "9072", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My project, \"Territorial Self-Fashioning: Place-Making in Late 19th and Early 20th Century Colonial India,\" focuses on the province of Bihar and the emergence of a specifically place-based Bihari regional identity. For the provincial literati, emphasizing Bihar as an \u201corganic\u201d entity cultivated a sense of common belonging that was remarkably novel for the period, particularly because it implied that an administrative region had transformed into a cohesive cultural unit. The transformation is particularly revealing because the claims to a \u201cnatural\u201d Bihar was not based upon a distinctive language, ethnicity or religion. Instead this regional assertion was partially instigated by British colonial politics and in part shaped by an emergent Indian national imagination. The emergence of a place-based Bihari identity therefore can only be explained by situating it in the context of 19th century colonial politics and nationalist sentiments. Indian national imagination is so integral to the construction of an \u201corganic\u201d Bihar, that without it not only does the region emerge fragmented, but it also becomes a landscape of contradictions. Bihar, situated on the eastern end of the Gangetic plain, often appears as two distinct cultural landscapes divided by the river, with Mithila in the north and Magadha to the south. Today, Bihar has become little less than a metonym for crime-infested anarchy where poverty and economic backwardness prevail. The idea of Bihar acquires cache only in the context of an Indian national imagination wherein it is accorded an originary national status. Indian national history embraces Bihar as the fount of India\u2019s \u201cglorious\u201d national past as home to the ancient Mauryan and Gupta Empires and the birthplace of Buddhism. The Bihari literati adopted precisely these cultural markers, integral to a generic conception of Indian national identity, as the basis for a \u201cBihariness\u201d. The conception of a Bihari regional identity, therefore, was coeval with that of the emergence of an Indian nationalist imagination. The formation of a distinctively regional identity, in this instance of territorial self-fashioning, was not in opposition to colonial politics or nationalist sentiments; rather it was the unmistakable product of 19th century colonial and national imaginings.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8900], "author_name_tesi": "Chakravartty, Aryendra ", "last_name_ssi": "Chakravartty", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aryendra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Giguette Atwill", "David Giguette Atwill", "Joan Landes", "Michael Edward Kulikowski", "Madhuri Shrikant Desai", "Mrinalini Sinha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Giguette Atwill, Dissertation Advisor", "David Giguette Atwill, Committee Chair", "Joan Landes, Committee Member", "Michael Edward Kulikowski, Committee Member", "Madhuri Shrikant Desai, Committee Member", "Mrinalini Sinha, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Colonial South Asia", "Bihar", "Regionalism", "Nationalism", "Identity", "Place-Making"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Stock Market's Influence on Marketing and R&D Budgets: Implications for Short Term and Long Term Firm Performance\n", "id": "10953", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "568", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Marketing and R&D investments create intangible assets whose financial value is appropriated over time in the form of accelerated cash flows and persistent revenue streams.

My thesis is inspired by marketing and R&D budget allocation behavior that seems to deviate from theoretical rational expectations models in the following manner. Public firms have to convince investors of their potential for generating shareholder value in the form of earnings growth at short term intervals of a fiscal quarter or year. Consequently, in order to show earnings growth at short term intervals, managers may reduce spending on marketing and R&D activities or re-shuffle budgets between marketing and R&D activities in a manner that inflates short term earnings. Managers are able to justify such budgetary changes because the metrics for capturing the immediate and long term penalties for such changes are not clear. In the context of high technology industries, my first dissertation essay provides theoretical predictions and empirical evidence that historic stock price behavior influences firms to shift budget allocation emphasis from R&D to marketing activities such as sales promotions. In the process, even though organizations inflate yearend earnings, they incur opportunity costs in the form of foregone profits. In the context of manufacturing firms, my second dissertation essay provides theoretical predictions and empirical evidence that organizations make unscheduled cuts in marketing and R&D budgets in order to meet or beat analyst earnings forecasts towards the end of a fiscal year. Even though there are no immediate penalties, such budgetary reductions gradually increase stock return volatility over time and weaken organizational defense against stock market downturns.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [565], "author_name_tesi": "Chakravarty, Anindita ", "last_name_ssi": "Chakravarty", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anindita", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rajdeep Grewal", "Rajdeep Grewal", "Gary L Lilien", "Min Ding", "Timothy Grant Pollock", "Kalyan Chatterjee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rajdeep Grewal, Dissertation Advisor", "Rajdeep Grewal, Committee Chair", "Gary L Lilien, Committee Member", "Min Ding, Committee Member", "Timothy Grant Pollock, Committee Member", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Firm Risk", "Marketing -Finance", "Marketing-R&D"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "HYBRID QUANTUM/CLASSICAL MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS OF\nHYDROGEN TRANSFER REACTIONS IN ENZYMES\n", "id": "10699", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1450", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes the study of hydrogen transfer reactions in enzymes.

The umbrella integration method is based on the derivative of the PMF with respect to the reaction coordinate.  An analytical expression for this derivative applicable to certain types of EVB potentials is presented.  The umbrella integration method reduces the statistical errors, converges efficiently, and does not require significantly overlapping windows compared to the Weighted Histogram Analysis method.  A modified version of the weighted histogram analysis method that shares these advantages is also proposed and implemented.\n\tThe second part of this thesis presents the study of proton transfer reactions in ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) using hybrid quantum/classical methodologies. The reaction requires two proton transfer reactions. Tyr14 and Asp99 form catalytically important hydrogen bonds that help stabilize the dienolate intermediate in these reactions. Chapter 3 describes the study of these proton transfer reactions in wild-type KSI. Chapter 4 extends this analysis to the Tyr14Phe, Asp99Leu and Tyr14Phe/Asp99Leu mutant varieties of KSI. Our simulations suggest a pre-organized active site in which relatively small changes occur to strengthen the hydrogen bonds that stabilize the intermediate, thereby facilitating the proton transfer reactions.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1435], "author_name_tesi": "Chakravorty, Dhruva Kumar", "last_name_ssi": "Chakravorty", "middle_name_ssi": "Kumar", "first_name_ssi": "Dhruva", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Sharon Hammes Schiffer", "Prof Sharon Hammes Schiffer", "James Bernhard Anderson", "Philip C.

India has made significant progress in improving child health outcomes in recent decades. The country has also experienced considerable economic change since the early 1990s. However, while average prosperity increased, it did not benefit all sections of society equally. Further, the economic reforms of the 1990s with their emphasis on privatization resulted in a change in the role of the state. The increases in economic inequality and the declines in public investment during this period motivate the questions in this dissertation.\n\nTo the extent that the production of health is a function of economic variables, the increase in economic inequality should have been paralleled by increases in health inequality. Data from three Demographic and Health Surveys (1992-93, 1998-99, and 2005-06) are used to examine levels and trends in economic inequalities in child health. Using bivariate inequality measures that capture the concentration of ill health among poorer children, I analyze inequalities in seven child mortality and malnutrition outcomes - neonatal, postneonatal, child, and under-five mortality; stunting, wasting, and underweight. Analyses are conducted at the national, urban/rural, and regional levels. To the extent that health is a function of public as well as private inputs, a decline in the role of the state should have resulted in a strengthening of the role of the household in improving health outcomes. The second set of analyses thus use the same data as above to examine how the relationship between household wealth and child health may have changed in the years between 1992 and 2005. The main predictor is an innovative measure of household wealth \u2013 derived from the widely-used relative wealth index \u2013 that can capture changes in wealth over time. I examine this changing relationship between wealth and child health in a multivariate regression framework.  Finally, I conduct a decomposition analysis to identify the extent to which wealth-based inequalities in the determinants of child health contribute to inequalities in child health. A second kind of decomposition attempts to understand the sources of differential gains in child health by the poor and non-poor. \n\nResults indicate the presence of strong inequalities in both child mortality and malnutrition, particularly in mortality at older ages and underweight. There was a very slight decline in overall mortality inequality but there was a large increase in malnutrition inequality over time. Household wealth is a strong predictor of mortality at all ages and of malnutrition of different forms but most strongly predicts mortality at older ages and underweight. Wealth became a weaker predictor of mortality but a stronger predictor of malnutrition over time. My hypotheses of increased inequalities and strengthening wealth effects were thus validated only for less extreme outcomes like malnutrition but not for more extreme outcomes like mortality. Child health inequalities can be explained in large part by inequalities in household wealth and maternal education. The role of wealth inequality in explaining mortality inequality decreased over time but its role in explaining malnutrition inequality increased. Poor children experienced greater declines in the probability of mortality, but non-poor children experienced greater declines in the probability of malnutrition. The greater success of public programs aimed at mortality reduction \u2013 compared to those aimed at reducing malnutrition \u2013 is put forth as a potential reason why malnutrition \u2013 but not mortality \u2013 became more intimately related to and dependent on private wealth over time.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5925], "author_name_tesi": "Chalasani, Satvika ", "last_name_ssi": "Chalasani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Satvika", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Glenn A Firebaugh", "Glenn A Firebaugh", "Nancy Landale", "David Shapiro", "Shannon Stokes", "John Casterline"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Glenn A Firebaugh, Dissertation Advisor", "Glenn A Firebaugh, Committee Chair", "Nancy Landale, Committee Member", "David Shapiro, Committee Member", "Shannon Stokes, Committee Member", "John Casterline, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Health inequalities", "Determinants of child health", "India", "Child health", "Child malnutrition", "Child mortality"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Managing Midwives in Early Modern Literature\n", "id": "9382", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1465", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation traces the development of the textual midwife in a variety of English works printed in the 16th and 17th centuries.

In eukaryotes a special case of tinkering is the acquisition of domain(s) after gene duplication. Domain acquisition results in the formation of multigene families that code for multidomain proteins. These families often diverge extensively, acquire new functions, and follow different modes of evolution. To understand the mode of evolution of such families, I studied the evolutionary relationships of three different gene families: the FORMIN, the BTK/TEC, and the DANGER.\nFORMIN proteins promote the assembly and elongation of actin filaments. My study showed that the FORMIN gene apparently originated at the advent of eukaryotes and probably was duplicated before the divergence of plants and animals. The FORMIN gene family followed the birth-and-death model of evolution and experienced multiple lineage-specific genomic rearrangements which led to acquisition of various different domains. On the basis of their domain organization, FORMIN proteins can be classified into three different types, A, B, and C. Type A FORMIN proteins have the typical Formin Homology 2 domain but lack any other known domain in their N- and C-terminal regions. Type B FORMIN proteins have N-and C-terminal domains, which interact in an intramolecular manner and inactivate the FORMIN function. Type C FORMIN proteins have various non-homologous N- and/or C- terminal domains. Type B FORMIN appeared in the common ancestor of unikonts. The presence of type B FORMIN genes in two parasitic bikonts is explained by either parallel evolution or horizontal gene transfer. This study provides insights into the diversification process of a eukaryote-specific regulator of the cytoskeleton. The lineage-specific diversification of FORMIN genes probably points to unique adaptations. \nThe BTK/TEC genes code for multidomain proteins that phosphorylate tyrosine residues. In mammals the BTK/TEC proteins play a key role in signal transduction in cells involved in adaptive immunity. My study showed that the BTK/TEC gene appeared before the divergence of animals and choanoflagellates. This gene was duplicated at least three times before the emergence of bony fish. In mammals the N- and C-terminal domains of these kinases\u2014 PH and SH1 respectively\u2014are conserved. In contrast, the SH3 and SH2 domains and their flanking linker sequences (denoted as the SSL region) are highly diverged. Because the SSL region of paralogous BTK/TEC proteins has not differentiated with respect to its protein ligands, I hypothesized that this region binds to lipids and has differentiated with respect to this function. I determined that the SSL region has the capacity to bind to lipids. I also verified the functional differentiation hypothesis by showing that the SSL region of paralogous BTK/TEC genes has different lipid-binding profiles. Natural mutations in the SSL region of the BTK gene, which cause a hereditary immunodeficiency in mice and humans, alter the lipid-binding profile of the BTK protein. My study revealed a new function for the BTK/TEC kinases. It also suggested a link between the lipid-binding function and the regulation/function of B-cells.\nThe DANGER gene family is a highly divergent multigene family that appeared before the origin of animals. Early during animal evolution the DANGER gene duplicated multiple times and diversified extensively. Protostomes lost many DANGER genes, whereas deuterostomes kept them and further increased their numbers. The DANGER proteins are probably involved in cell development and differentiation. DANGER proteins are comprised of micro-domains which show different levels of sequence divergence. The N-terminal micro-domain was probably acquired by exon shuffling and enabled some DANGER proteins to function in different cellular compartments or to be secreted. Other mechanisms of sequence divergence of DANGER proteins include amino acid replacement, intron gain/and loss, and recombination. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1575], "author_name_tesi": "Chalkia, Dimitra ", "last_name_ssi": "Chalkia", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dimitra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener", "Masatoshi Nei", "Jan Klein", "Bernhard Luscher", "Ross Cameron Hardison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener, Committee Chair", "Masatoshi Nei, Committee Member", "Jan Klein, Committee Member", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["evolution", "protein domain", "functional divergence", "formin"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Perception of college adjustment and institutional attachment among student-athletes of color at a predominantly white institution and its relation to academic motivation", "id": "14144cdc216", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14144", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between college adjustment, self-efficacy, academic buoyancy and academic motivation among student-athletes of color at a predominantly White institution (PWI) that participate in Division I sports.

These problems can be addressed, respectively, by either switching the catalyst from platinum to a less expensive metal, or by reducing the polymer exchange membrane\u2019s reliance upon water for proton conduction.  This work focuses on understanding the chemistry and physics that limit cation stability in alkaline environments and that enable high proton conductivity in anhydrous polymer exchange membranes.\nPolystyrenic 1H-azoles (including 1H-tetrazole, 1H-1,2,3-triazole, and 1H-imidazoline) were synthesized to investigate whether pKa and pKb of an amophoteric, proton-conductive group have a systematic effect on anhydrous proton conductivity.  It was discovered that the 1H-tetrazole (PS-Tet) exhibited distinct phase separation not seen in its carboxylic acid analog (PS-HA) or reported for other 1H-azole\u2013containing homopolymers in literature.  The resulting microstructured polymer, hypothesized to be the result of regions of high and low clustering of azoles, analogous to the multiplet-cluster model of ionomer microstructure, resulted in proton conductivity coupled with simultaneous rubbery behavior of the polymer well above its glass transition (Tg).  Phase separation was similarly observed in PS-Tri and PS-ImH2 (the triazole- and imidazoline-containing polymers); soft phases with similar Tgs and hard phases with varying Tgs lend support to this hypothesis of aggregation-driven phase separation.\nElectrode polarization exhibited in the impedance spectra of PS-Tet and PS-HA was modeled to determine the extent of proton dissociation in undoped 1H-tetrazoles and carboxylic acids.  Dry polymers (0% relative humidity) retained ~1% by weight residual water, which was observed to act as the proton acceptor in both cases.  Despite doping by residual water molecules, the extent of 1H-tetrazole dissociation in PS-Tet (~0.02\u20130.08%) was found to be the primary factor limiting proton conductivity, suggesting that further doping should substantially increase proton conductivity.  Although small molecules can provide this doping, polymer\u2013polymer doped blends were investigated to prevent evaporation and leeching of dopant over time.\nIt was found that the pKa and pKb of the 1H-azoles do not directly have an effect on proton conductivity, but instead play a large role with respect to dopants.  Polymers containing low pKa or pKb azoles (e.g. 1H-tetrazole, 1H-imidazoline) were more easily doped by residual acceptors / donors (e.g. water, acetic acid), leading to high conductivity compared to counterparts with high pKa and pKb (e.g. triazole).  Doping PS-Tet with poly(styrenesulfonic acid) lead to conductivities higher by an order of magnitude than those in undoped PS-Tet, but which originated from water of hydration associated with the strong acid.  Although acidic PS-Tet and alkaline PS-ImH2 might represent an ideal combination of 1H-azoles to improve mobile proton density, the presence of strongly interacting, residual small molecules (e.g. water, acetic acid) prevented full association of tetrazole and imidazoline moieties in their blends.\nFinally, N,N\u2019-symmetrically disubstituted imidazoliums with bulky alkyl substitutents were synthesized to determine how substituents and substitution patterns improve alkaline stability of these species.  Although literature often cite rates of reaction (and thus stability) as being trivially linked to orbital energies, it was found that stability in practice was more strongly correlated with steric bulk of the imidazolium substituents, consistent with traditional chemical intuition.  Both isopropyl and neopentyl groups significantly slowed degradation compared to benzyltrimethylammonium (a control compound), with substitution at the N and N\u2019 positions improving stability more significantly than substitution at the 2-position in their absence.  1,2,3-Triisopropylimidazolium and N,N\u2019-bis(neopentyl)-2-isopropylimidazolium were found exclusively to be more stable than benzyltrimethylammonium in ex situ, high temperature alkaline degradation experiments.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9980], "author_name_tesi": "Chaloux, Brian Leonard", "last_name_ssi": "Chaloux", "middle_name_ssi": "Leonard", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner", "Ralph H Colby", "James Patrick Runt", "Harry R Allcock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Dissertation Advisor", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["azoles", "imidazolium", "anhydrous proton conduction", "impedance spectroscopy", "polymers", "polymer chemistry", "chemical stability"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "URBAN CONSUMERS\u2019 PERSPECTIVES ON MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR MID-ATLANTIC SPECIALTY CROPS", "id": "11856", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "154", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Consumer attitudes and behaviors pertaining to fresh produce and value-added processed products impact firms in the fruit and vegetable industries as they try to understand and meet demand.

The methodology for this research included administering four Internet surveys to primary food shoppers, age 21 and older, residing in five metropolitan areas of the mid-Atlantic region (Richmond, VA; Baltimore, MD; Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia, PA; and New York City, NY) with the goal of examining their knowledge of, and attitudes and behavior towards fresh and value-added specialty crop products. These topics were investigated by examining purchasing behavior, including outlet of choice (e.g. farmers\u2019 market), and preferences for locally grown and certified organic produce.  Additionally, consumers were tested on their knowledge and purchasing behavior of mid-Atlantic grown produce and state promotional programs.  Results indicate a strong preference for locally grown produce and value-added processed products, with an average of 71% (across two surveys) of research participants reporting that they purchase locally grown produce.  Consumers also exhibited preferences for certified organic produce, preferring both locally grown and certified organic produce over one or neither of these options.  Additionally, while consumers indicated purchasing a variety of produce that can be grown within the mid-Atlantic region, the majority could not correctly identify what types of fruits and vegetables can be grown in this region and when these items are harvested.  Lastly, consumers as a whole exhibited low awareness of state promotional programs.  However, the few that did indicate they were aware of these programs and purchased products branded with these programs showed preferences for these items over products not branded by state promotional programs.  Results presented here indicate many opportunities for mid-Atlantic produce industry stakeholders.  Knowing consumer demand and preferences for locally grown and certified organic produce can assist stakeholders with meeting this demand.  Results can also help stakeholders with deciding what consumer segments to target and developing marketing materials that best appeal to consumers.  As the results also indicate a general lack of awareness for mid-Atlantic produced specialty crops and value-added processed products, stakeholders may choose to incorporate educational efforts using the results as a guideline.  Informing consumers interested in specialty crops and products about when and what is available to purchase within this region may encourage them to purchase.

A combination of sedimentary basin dynamics and terrestrial landscape processes control alluvial architecture, particularly accommodation-creation, sediment supply, and river avulsion (the rapid relocation of a channel to a new spot on its floodplain), but deconvolving these processes from alluvial architecture is difficult. In this dissertation, I use field studies of ancient deposits and numerical modeling to identify characteristic signatures of avulsion processes in fluvial stratigraphy, and I propose novel metrics of alluvial architecture that give insight into paleo-avulsion pattern, relative sedimentation and accommodation-creation rates, and the grain size of paleo-sediment supply. \n    Part of this dissertation specifically addresses how avulsion-generated channel deposits and different avulsion patterns can be identified in the stratigraphic record and over what spatiotemporal scales. To this end, I analyzed published literature and mapped channel sand bodies in the Williams Fork Formation (Cretaceous, Colorado) to show that avulsions generate characteristic multistory sand bodies with irregular bounding surfaces, vertical story stacking, and stories that correlate with distinct floodplain horizons. Results from an object-based model of basin filling suggest that in mud-dominated deposits, different avulsion patterns generate sand bodies with unique number of stories per sand body. Statistical analysis of outcrop-scale sand body distributions in the same lower Williams Fork deposits is also consistent with a random paleo-avulsion pattern, and I use object-based modeling to understand the sensitivity of statistical analyses for detecting avulsion patterns in a given dataset.\n   In addition, this dissertation uses novel alluvial architecture measurements to deconvolve avulsion and basin-scale controls on sand-dominated fluvial deposits, which are traditionally interpreted as generated during times when the space to deposit sediment (accommodation-creation rates) is low relative to the sediment supply, causing the deposits to be poorly preserved, or \u201creworked\u201d. Here I use fluvial bar geometry and lithofacies as a proxy for deposit reworking, and I use this method to show that some sand-dominated successions (such as the Castlegate Sandstone (Cretaceous, UT) have well-preserved bars and no evidence for rapid reworking. Finally, I use a new method to explore relative changes in sandiness of paleo-sediment supply using the grain size distribution of paleo-bed-material and paleo-slackwater deposits in the Blackhawk and Castlegate formations. Results suggest that a decrease in the supply of fine-grained sediment may be driving the increase in deposit sandiness at the Blackhawk-Castlegate boundary, rather than an increase in reworking.\n   Overall, these novel approaches to alluvial architecture analysis show that paleo-avulsion patterns can be uniquely interpreted from both mud- and sand-dominated deposits, and we can estimate the relative influence of avulsion, accommodation-limited reworking, and sediment-supply grain size for given patterns in alluvial architecture.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12366], "author_name_tesi": "Chamberlin, Ellen Putnam", "last_name_ssi": "Chamberlin", "middle_name_ssi": "Putnam", "first_name_ssi": "Ellen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Ann Hajek", "Elizabeth Ann Hajek", "Rudy Slingerland", "Mark E Patzkowsky", "Zuleima T Karpyn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Ann Hajek, Dissertation Advisor", "Elizabeth Ann Hajek, Committee Chair", "Rudy Slingerland, Committee Member", "Mark E Patzkowsky, Committee Member", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fluvial stratigraphy", "rivers", "Cretaceous", "avulsions", "autogenic"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "AFTER THE PLANNING\u2019S OVER: \nIMPLEMENTING MULTI-MUNICIPAL COMPREHENSIVE PLANS IN PENNSYLVANIA\n\n", "id": "9464", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2960", "abstract_tesi": "Pennsylvania\u2019s efforts to promote smart growth principles through multi-municipal planning have not produced significant changes in local land use planning practices.

However, tillage is still necessary for weed control and incorporation of nutrient amendments. One strategy for reducing tillage revolves around cover crop-based, organic rotational no-till, which employs cover crop mulches and no-till cash crop planting. Primary tillage occurs in the fall at cover crop establishment, and in-season weed control relies on suppression by the cover crop mulch along with supplemental inter-row cultivation. We initiated a cropping systems experiment to study several strategies for reducing tillage frequency and intensity within an organic grain/silage rotation in the Mid-Atlantic. Four cropping systems (S1-S4) were examined before soybean and corn crops.  For soybean, either a cover crop mixture interseeded into corn harvested for grain or fall sown cereal rye after corn silage and before soybean was terminated via tillage or roller-crimper, respectively. Soybean were either seeded into the tilled cover crop mixture (S2 and S4) or no-till planted into the cereal rye mulch (S1 and S3).  Cover crops preceding corn included two systems of hairy vetch/triticale sown after spelt harvest (S1 and S2) and primary tillage, and two systems of red clover/timothy frost-seeded into spelt in late winter (S3 and S4). One hairy vetch system was terminated via roller-crimping (S1), while the other three systems relied on spring tillage to incorporate the cover crop and livestock manure. One hairy vetch and red clover system were grown for corn silage (S1 and S3), while the other two were harvested as grain corn. The results showed that for the soybean crop, while the interseeded mix generally produced around 2,000 kg ha-1 biomass, cereal rye typically produced about 5,000 kg ha-1, with upwards of 8,000 kg ha-1. Weed suppression varied from year to year based on environmental conditions which sometimes hindered in-season cultivation. Weed control was good and subsequent biomass production was as low as 95 kg ha-1 in 2015, but reached upwards of 2,000 kg ha-1 in 2016, when weather conditions prevented effective mechanical weed control. Despite differences in both soybean stand and weed biomass, yields were comparable between the no-till and tilled soybean systems, ranging from 1,800-3,000 kg ha-1 across years. For the corn crop, red clover/timothy produced 3,300-4,500 kg ha-1 cover crop biomass, while hairy vetch/triticale was more variable, producing 3,600-7,500 kg ha-1 biomass over the three years. Although weed biomass at the time of corn planting was below 78 kg ha-1, in-season weed control varied by both treatment and year depending on the effectiveness of in-season cultivation. Late-summer weed biomass levels ranged from 300 kg ha-1 up to 2,700 kg ha-1, with less effective weed control resulting when environmental conditions prevented timely blind tillage and inter-row cultivation. Corn grain yields were not different from year to year; however, corn silage yields were different between systems every year likely due to later planted corn and a reduced nutrient supply. Finally, the weed seedbanks were measured to the plow layer each March preceding the cash crop growing season. Our results show that poor in-season weed control greatly drives the density of the weed seedbank, with seeds m-2 increasing after a droughty 2016 which hindered in-season cultivation efforts. Foxtail species dominated the seedbank in all three cash crops (corn, soybean, spelt), comprising at least 40% of the germinable seedbank. Other prevalent species included purslane speedwell, yellow woodsorrel, Eastern black nightshade, common lambsquarters, and redroot pigweed, among others. Seedbank trends showed that seed density increased after the corn and soybean phases, but decreased after the spelt phase. No-till corn and soybean systems tended to have lower seed density relative to tilled systems, but this was dependent on successful in-season weed control. Our results also show that interseeding a cover crop in corn can help reduce returns to the seedbank, with seed density being lower than corn systems which did not employ interseeding.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16054], "author_name_tesi": "Champagne, Rebecca Joan", "last_name_ssi": "Champagne", "middle_name_ssi": "Joan", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Curran", "David A Mortensen", "John Wallace", "Mary Ellen Barbercheck", "Gregory Wayne Roth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Curran, Thesis Advisor", "David A Mortensen, Committee Member", "John Wallace, Committee Member", "Mary Ellen Barbercheck, Committee Member", "Gregory Wayne Roth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Organic", "reduced-tillage", "weed management", "organic soybean", "organic corn", "weed seedbank", "cover crop-based organic rotational no-till"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "First- and second-person singular subject pronoun expression in Dominican Spanish: The structure and acquisition of variable forms", "id": "14350cmc5294", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14350", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present dissertation analyzes first- and second-person singular subject pronoun expression in Dominican Spanish in adult-to-adult, caregiver, and child speech. Overall, despite the high rates of subject pronoun expression seen in this variety, the conditioning factors that govern subject pronoun expression in all dialects are found to be operative in Dominican Spanish. In addition, children were found to have acquired several of the constraints that govern first- and second-person singular subject pronoun expression in adult-to-adult speech. However, caregivers\u2019 pronoun expression was shown to not be constrained by certain factors while others showed different patterns in comparison to adult-to-adult speech.\nFirst, adult-to-adult Dominican Spanish displays many of the same constraints on subject pronoun expression found in other varieties. However, the well-known effect of verb class operates differently in this variety. Nevertheless, when analyzing the most frequent verbs found in each category, several verb-particular constructions showing distinct patterns are revealed. Additionally, turn position in first-person singular pronoun expression shows more broad effects than what has been found for other varieties such that it is operative with all verb classes. Moreover, certain factors found to condition first-person singular pronoun expression do not extend to second-person singular pronoun expression, which suggests that pronouns of different grammatical person/number pattern in distinct ways. Nevertheless, Dominican Spanish does show slight differences in how and in which contexts certain conditioning factors operate, which are thought to be more revealing in determining dialectal differences than overall rates.\nWith respect to child speech, the children showed to have already acquired many of the adult-like factors that constrain pronoun use in adult-to-adult speech. However, the well-known switch referent constraint was found to be inoperative in first-person singular pronoun expression in child speech. Despite this, a second measure of switch reference, that of intervening human subjects, did contribute to children\u2019s first-person singular pronoun expression. Thus, the data presented here suggest this well-known constraint is acquired on the basis of the presence or absence of intervening human subjects between coreferential mentions. Outside of the result for switch reference, children showed to closely follow the patterns seen in caregivers, showing they are sensitive to the frequency and distributional patterns found in their input. Similarly, children produced adult-like usage patterns with certain lexically-specific constructions found in their input, demonstrating that these community-based items are an important locus of children\u2019s acquisition of the dialect to which they are exposed.\nFinally, caregivers showed some differences with respect to which constraints are operative in their use of first-person singular subject pronouns in comparison to adult-to-adult speech. In particular, the constraint of turn position, while operative in adult-to-adult speech, does not significantly constrain caregivers\u2019 first-person singular subject pronoun expression. Further analysis revealed this is due to the nature of child-caregiver interaction such that caregivers frequently refer to their children in order to hand the floor over to them and develop subsequent discourse. In fact, caregivers\u2019 use of second person singular forms in child-caregiver interaction greatly exceeded their use of the same forms in their adult-to-adult interactions. This, together with their infrequent use of first-person singular forms, impedes a turn-position effect from emerging. Caregivers\u2019 also showed to favor second-person singular pronoun expression with Wh-questions in the speech to their children, which differs from the pattern found in adult-to-adult speech with these same elements. Overall, the results show that caregivers adjust certain aspects of their speech when interacting with their children while at the same time they provide adult-like usage patterns for certain community-based lexically-specific constructions.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15169], "author_name_tesi": "Champi, Christopher ", "last_name_ssi": "Champi", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Miller", "Karen Miller", "Rena Torres Cacoullos", "Matthew Carlson", "Michael Putnam"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Miller, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Miller, Committee Chair", "Rena Torres Cacoullos, Committee Member", "Matthew Carlson, Committee Member", "Michael Putnam, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Subject Pronoun Expression", "Variation", "Acquisition of Variation", "Dominican Spanish"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION AND APPLICATION OF A CARBON-LOADED LIQUID CRYSTAL POLYMER FOR INTERCONNECT DESIGN", "id": "13541bac5278", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13541", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is a need for the use of electromagnetic absorbing materials within interconnect designs to eliminate resonances in the throughput and noise parameters, however, a learning curve exists for using these materials in close proximity to high-speed differential pairs commonly used in interconnect applications.  This study successfully reduces the Integrated Crosstalk Noise (ICN) of an interconnect by 42% and Insertion Loss Deviation (ILD) by 44% by utilizing a carbon-loaded LCP acting as a dielectric absorber within the interconnect.  Current literature characterizes carbon nanotube and carbon black composites acting as dielectric absorbers, however, these studies focus mainly on shielding applications far away from high-speed differential signaling.  These studies also did not offer a desirable electrical model conducive for 3D Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling.

To maintain the homeostasis and the necessary growth of the cell, machinery related to energy and metabolism has to be regulated extensively. One of the metabolic pathway is de novo purine biosynthesis which involves the synthesis of purine from six enzymes in ten, highly conserved steps. De novo purine biosynthesis is also an important, validated target for cancer chemotherapeutics. With the discovery of metabolon \u2013 the purinosome in this metabolic pathway, a paradigm shift of understanding the regulation of metabolism emerges. While pioneer works on this non-membrane bound enzyme complex have been carried out, the complete understanding of function and mechanism of purinosome is not yet revealed. In this dissertation, we conduct a comprehensive study of the spatiotemporal aspects of the purinosome by multidisciplinary approaches across different fields. With our unique approaches, we believe that the study of its spatiotemporal aspects can provide significant and novel insights for cancer biology.\nCharacterization of the purinosome is first performed with various biochemical assays. The average size and number distribution of purinosomes are measured in the cells by conventional fluorescence microscopy. With the morphological definition of purinosomes, we demonstrates that purinosome formation in cell is in accordance with the cell cycle phases. The results are further supported by the fact that purinosome formation is not a function of the enzyme protein expression. Using the biochemical approach, we establish that purinosome is a cellular biomarker in response to cellular purine requirements.\nNext, we seek to understand the spatial organization of purinosomes with other subcellular components in the cell. To obtain the highest spatial resolution possible, we employ Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) to visualize and define their interaction at submicron level. Our results indicate that there is high probability of purinosomes dual-colocalized with both microtubules and mitochondria, suggestive the possible interplay among the three cellular components.\nThe observation of purinosomes spatially organized with microtubules and mitochondria by STORM posts an intriguing question of how the interplay of the three cellular components would be. To parse the interaction among the three, the motion of the purinosome is temporally resolved by super-resolution confocal imaging. In general, purinosomes are found to have a high tendency to be actively transported by microtubules towards and away from mitochondria. Microtubules also provide stability for the spatial organization between purinosomes and mitochondria. Their high colocalization percentage could indicate a bioenergetics advantage between the two cellular components. \nFinally, the understanding of the purinosome in cell metabolism at the cell-cell interaction level is explored. To control the microenvironment and precisely position the cells of interest, we develop polystyrene-based microfluidic device and standing surface acoustic wave (SSAW) tweezers. We validate both systems for cell culture and purinosome study. SSAW powers are optimized and their effect in instantaneous cell viability and long term cell proliferation are investigated. Using the optimized SSAW power, we confirm that optimal SSAW is suitable for the study of purinosome formation during cell-cell interaction.\nTaken together, multidisciplinary approach is essential for the study of spatiotemporal aspects of purinosome. With the advantages and capabilities in different approaches, the regulation and function of purinosome is further elucidated. The notions presented in this dissertation offer significant foundation for the future study of similar enzyme complex system in the cell.

During this one-year qualitative research, I conducted ethnographic interviews to analyze individuals\u2019 histories and their personal stories.

This study also reveals how social empowerment and acquisition of the English language reshaped these women\u2019s relationships with their husbands, children and mothers. All of these women transformed from primarily dependent beings into not only independent but empowered women due to English language learning. This research analyzes how power, both gained and lost in the process of learning English as well as maintaining Mandarin, becomes a central feature of these women as they encounter challenges and gain independence and confidence.

These three material properties are encompassed in a dimensionless material figure of merit, zT. Commercial thermoelectrics which use materials with zTs ~ 1 are usually either expensive or non-sustainable. The formulation of an oxide thermoelectric would facilitate achieving sustainability and cost-effectiveness. Currently, there are only a handful of high performance thermoelectric oxides, especially of the n-type variety. The n-type oxide, strontium barium niobate (SBN), had previously been reported to have a figure of merit of 0.5 to 1.0 at 550 K. The higher thermopower is correlated with the precipitation of an NbO2-x secondary phase within the parent material after reaching a particular degree of oxygen-deficiency. The process was found to be reversible, leading to the hypothesis that A-site occupancy within the structure is directly linked to the thermoelectric properties.\nIn this work, A-site filled strontium barium niobate (SrxBa6-xNb10O30-\u03b4) ceramics prepared by conventional solid-state sintering were explored. The barium end member, Ba6Nb10O30-\u03b4, served as a model system of study with respect to synthesis and electrical properties.

Quantitative EDS showed that the 60-40 SBN sample had an A-site cation content of 6.21 +/- 0.33 and 5.07 +/- 0.25 for the filled and unfilled compositions, respectively. These numbers were within error of the ideal values of 6.00 and 5.00, proving the difference in site occupancy of the filled and unfilled bronze, respectively. \nThe electrical conductivities of phase pure, non-oxidized filled SBN reached values of at least 120 S/cm. Kinetics were demonstrated to affect the final conductivities such that 30 hour anneals at 1300\u00b0C were required for 2.75 mm thick samples.  For thin samples (1.38 mm) a 5 hour sinter was enough to achieve high conductivities. The largest conductivities and room temperature conductivities were demonstrated by the 40-60 samples; the values were 700 S/cm at 600 K and 400 S/cm, respectively. The high conductivity was consistent with A-site filling. However, measuring electrical conductivities on samples annealed at 10-14 atm pO2 at 1300\u00b0C showed one to two orders of magnitude decrease in the conductivity, despite being phase pure. The carrier concentrations in the filled and unfilled 60-40 composition were on the order of 1019 carriers/cm3 to 1021 carriers/cm3, respectively, implying a different defect compensation between the filled and unfilled bronzes. These two results suggest that the A-site filling plays a part in the high thermoelectric performance, but may not be solely responsible.\nSeebeck coefficients were taken to compare the power factors of the filled SBN to those of the unfilled SBNs. The largest power factor was demonstrated in the 60-40 composition with a value of 2.7 \u03bcW/(m-K^2 ) for samples processed under 2.5% H2 (10-16 atm pO2). Hall measurements were conducted to assess the carrier concentration of the filled and unfilled SBNs. It was found that the carrier concentration was on the order of 1021 carriers/cm3 for these heavily reduced samples, which was consistent with the A-site model hypothesis. This suggests that for the filled SBNs heat-treated at 10-16 atm pO2 are over-reduced and optimization of the power factor would require a higher partial pressure of oxygen during processing.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11565], "author_name_tesi": "Chan, Jason Hl", "last_name_ssi": "Chan", "middle_name_ssi": "Hl", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clive A Randall", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clive A Randall, Thesis Advisor", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermoelectric", "SBN", "strontium barium niobate", "defect", "nonstoichiometry", "filled bronze"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Functional Regulation and Protein Structural Dynamics of Poliovirus 3c Protease", "id": "26301", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11437", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tViruses employ numerous strategies to maximize the use of their compact genomes. These strategies include the generation of multifunctional proteins, and post-translational processing to produce various protein products that are functionally distinct. Poliovirus (PV) 3C protease (3C) serves as an excellent example of how viruses utilize these strategies. 3C is a multifunctional protein with RNA binding and protease activities. Because of its essential role in viral replication, 3C has long been a pharmacological target for viral inhibition. The studies presented in this dissertation provide a novel understanding of the functional regulation and protein structural dynamics of PV 3C protease. \n         We have performed a comprehensive study on the conformational dynamics of 3C across multiple timescales. Using numclear magnetic resonance (NMR) R2 relaxation dispersion studies of 3C reveal that the cleft around the protease active site is highly dynamic in the \u00b5s to ms timescale, possibly to accommodate for substrate binding and release. In the ps to ns timescale, NMR spin relaxation studies revealed that the majority of the backbone amide bond vectors are well-ordered. Binding of RNA did not alter the overall dynamics in either timescale, but there are structural differences induced by RNA near the protease active site. Analyses of dynamic chemical shifts from relaxation dispersion studies revealed that binding of RNA induces a different selection of conformations that may impact peptide binding. Interestingly, NMR chemical shift perturbation (CSP) analyses and fluorescent-based assays revealed that binding of RNA may have an effect on the peptide binding site and peptide binding may have an effect on RNA binding. These effects appear to be RNA and peptide dependent. There are also differences in the ternary complexes (protein: RNA: peptide) based on the order of ligand addition. The interplay between RNA and peptide binding may have radical implications in the regulation of protein functions essential for the different steps in viral replication. \n\tViruses are intracellular parasites that utilize the subcellular machinery of their host cell for their own replication by remodeling the host\u2019s intracellular membranes. Lipids with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) head groups have been found to be crucial for the formation of these replication organelles in numerous positive sense RNA viruses, such as PV. Lipid binding assays show that the PV protease 3C specifically binds to PI4P. Using NMR spectroscopy, we have identified a novel PI4P binding pocket on PV 3C using chemical shift perturbation analysis. Other phosphoinositides (PI) also appear to interact with this site or nearby sites on 3C. Protein variants with amino acid substitutions in the proposed binding site exhibit ten-fold higher dissociation constants compared to wild type protein as seen in fluorescent polarization studies. These data suggest that a new class of PIP binding domains has been identified. Furthermore, our NMR data suggest that the PIP binding site may be allosterically regulated with the RNA binding site.\n          We have made the exciting discovery that the addition of just a few amino acid residues to the C-terminus of 3C dramatically alters PIP and RNA binding, and we propose that this finding has radical implications for the regulation of PIP binding, RNA binding, and viral polyprotein function. In PV, the 3C and 3D proteins can also exist as part of the 3CD polyprotein, which is functionally different from the mature 3C and 3D forms. Additional domain-domain contacts between 3C and 3D were not observed in existing crystal structures of 3CD. Efficient PIP and RNA binding to 3C only occurs when the C-terminal tail has been extended either through a hexahistidine tag (3C-CHis) or through the addition of the first few amino acids corresponding to the N-terminal residues of 3D (3C-D6 or 3C-D10). Proteolytic cleavage of 3C then serves as a switch for PIP and RNA binding; 3C in the context of 3CD can tightly bind PIP lipids and RNA, but mature 3C cannot. This C-terminal switch is both sequence and length dependent. NMR relaxation dispersion (\u00b5s to ms) and spin relaxation (ps to ns) studies revealed that the C-terminal residues do not lead to substantial changes in the overall structural dynamics of 3C. We proposed that there is an allosteric network connecting the C-terminus with the N-terminal helix, which is important for PIP and RNA binding. \n\tThe studies presented in this dissertation are central for the understanding of the allosteric regulation and structural dynamics of the multifunctional 3C protease, and provide indispensable knowledge for understanding the 3C protease for drug and vaccine design purposes. This knowledge may have crucial implications for the understanding of both the regulation of post-translational processing pathways and the function of viral replication organelles. Furthermore, we have shown that the effects on one end of the protein can be relayed to long distance sites, providing important information that can aid in protein engineering efforts.

However, such proxy-based reconstructions are often challenged by marine diagenesis as carbonates are highly susceptible to diagenetic alteration, especially to partial dissolution and calcite recrystallization. Thus, quantifying diagenetic effects is a prerequisite for the development of any carbonate-based geochemical proxy. Among the metal isotopes, Mg isotopic composition (\u03b426Mg) of foraminiferal carbonates is a promising proxy to reconstruct secular seawater \u03b426Mg variability, which is useful in understanding long-term changes in the Mg geochemical cycle. However, Mg in marine carbonates is particularly susceptible to diagenetic alterations due to its low abundance in carbonates compared to pore fluids. Hence, the development of \u03b426Mg of marine carbonates as a proxy demands a thorough understanding of the isotopic systematics of Mg in marine sedimentary systems, which to date has not been accomplished.\nThe primary goal of this dissertation is to quantify the effect of diagenesis on metal isotopes, in particular, the \u03b426Mg of marine carbonates from various depositional settings. Multiple marine sites are investigated to evaluate the effect of advection, diffusion, and lithological variation within the sedimentary column on the extent of calcite diagenesis. The first two chapters are focused on comparing the extent of diagenetic alteration among various marine sites and quantifying the impact of such diagenetic reactions on carbonate-based proxies.\nIn the first study, the effect of diagenetic recrystallization on bulk carbonate \u03b426Mg is quantified from an open marine site (ODP Site 1171, Hole A), which is influenced by upward advection. Trace elemental (e.g., Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca) and isotopic compositions (\u03b426Mg and 87Sr/86Sr) of pore fluids and bulk carbonates are analyzed from Hole 1171A using an ICP-AES and a Neptune Plus MC-ICP-MS, respectively. A systematic decrease in bulk carbonate \u03b426Mg (-0.8 to -2.0 \u2030) with depth is observed, which was not entirely explained by the changes in nannofossil and foraminiferal assemblages in the bulk sediments documented by smear slide observations. Application of a 1-D depositional reactive transport model to the pore fluid and bulk carbonate chemistry demonstrates that calcite recrystallization can account for the observed downcore shift in carbonate \u03b426Mg. Additionally, downcore trends in 87Sr/86Sr, Mg/Ca, and Sr/Ca ratios of bulk carbonates also correlate well with the inferred diagenetic shift in the carbonate \u03b426Mg. \nIn the second chapter, the \u03b426Mg, \u03b444/40Ca, and 87Sr/86Sr ratios of pore fluids and bulk carbonates are analyzed from three marine carbonate-rich sites (ODP Holes 762B, 806B, and 807A) of comparable age that are not influenced by advection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a diffusive lower boundary and intracolumn lithological variability on the extent of carbonate diagenesis and its impact on the preservation of geochemical proxies such as carbonate \u03b426Mg. Two adjacent holes (Hole 807A and 806B) are studied to evaluate the impact of a variable diffusive lower boundary on the calcite recrystallization rate and its influence on carbonate \u03b426Mg. Numerical modeling of Ca and Sr geochemistry suggest that the carbonates from Hole 806B have experienced higher recrystallization rates (~5%/Ma) compared to the Hole 807A (~2%/Ma). The diagenetic shift in bulk carbonate \u03b426Mg at both sites is - 0.5 to -1.0\u2030 over the 800 meters. The investigation of Hole 762B demonstrates the potential of pore fluid \u03b426Mg to diagnose the increasing abundance of clays in the carbonate-rich sediments. An increase in bulk carbonate \u03b426Mg by ~ 0.6 \u2030, along with increase in Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, and Na/Ca ratios within the clay-rich layer indicate that the presence of clay enhances the preservation of proxy archives. Therefore, this study significantly contributes towards the understanding of the major controls on marine pore fluids from carbonate-rich sediments.\nIn the final chapter, the exchange rates of foraminiferal calcite recovered from the Cariaco Basin sediment traps and from deep marine sediment cores (ODP Hole 807A) are quantified through a series of batch exchange experiments using a radioactive 45Ca tracer technique. As foraminiferal calcites are extensively utilized in geochemical proxy-based reconstruction, quantifying the exchange rates helps to evaluate the extent of recrystallization on foraminferal geochemical proxies. The exchange experiments suggest the modern foraminiferal tests exchange faster (6.50 \u221910-4 to 0.30 \u221910-4 mol/m2/d) than the fossil foraminferal tests (2.50 \u221910-4 to 0.40 \u221910-4 mol/m2/d). The increase in [Ca2+], [Mg2+], and [Sr2+] in the fluid of a set of parallel non-tracer experiments indicates that dissolution-precipitation is the dominant mechanism of the atom exchange in foraminiferal calcite. Interestingly, in the presence of aqueous silica in some of the reactors the exchange rate of modern foraminifera decreases (3.70\u221910-4 to 0.13\u221910-4 mol/m2/d). This observation indicates that the presence of dissolved silica in the system can inhibit calcite-fluid exchange, which enhances the preservation of foraminiferal tests and minimizes the extent of alteration of foraminiferal proxies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12698], "author_name_tesi": "Chanda, Piyali ", "last_name_ssi": "Chanda", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Piyali", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Scott Fantle", "Matthew Scott Fantle", "Timothy Bralower", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Christopher Aaron Gorski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Scott Fantle, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Scott Fantle, Committee Chair", "Timothy Bralower, Committee Member", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member", "Christopher Aaron Gorski, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mg isotopes", "diagenesis", "marine carbonates", "Ca isotopes", "Sr isotopes", "geochemical proxy"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "In Vitro Interactions Among Breast Cancer Cells, Osteoblasts and Megakaryocytes", "id": "18771", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8753", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Approximately 80% of women with advanced breast cancer will experience metastasis to bone. Bone metastases often result in skeletal fractures, spinal compression, hypercalcemia, aplastic anemia and greatly decreased quality of life. The significance of breast cancer metastasis to bone is further highlighted by the fact that 90% of cancer-related deaths occur after metastasis. One of the leading causes of death in the metastatic stage of any cancer is thromboembolism, due to the overproduction of platelets. \nPreviously, data from this laboratory indicated that the femurs of mice bearing human metastatic breast cancer cells, a model which promotes bone metastases, contained large numbers of megakaryocytes (MKs). MKs normally comprise about 0.1% of nucleated bone marrow cells and are the progenitors of platelets. We hypothesized that when cancer cells metastasize to bone, they directly interact with MK progenitors to cause an increase in the proliferation and subsequent maturation of MKs.\nThe objective of this study was to understand the basic interactions among breast cancer cells, osteoblasts and MKs in an in vitro system. The three aims developed to test this hypothesis are: (1) To determine the effects cancer cells have on proliferation, migration and differentiation of MKs; (2) To determine the effects that osteoblasts and cancer cells together have on MK proliferation, migration and differentiation; (3) To determine the effects that MKs have on cancer cell morphology, proliferation and migration. In order to evaluate these specific aims, MEG-01 cells (human megakaryoblastic cell line), MDA-MB-231 cells (human metastatic breast cancer cell line), MDA-MB-231BRMS1 cells (metastasis suppressed human breast cancer cell line), and NHOst cells (primary human osteoblasts) were used to make conditioned medium (CM). Conditioned medium was then used at two concentrations (10 or 50%) to observe any effects on proliferation, migration or differentiation of MEG-01 cells or MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231BRMS1 cells. \t\nCancer cell CM, from either MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-231BRMS1, decreased MEG-01 proliferation and increased MEG-01 multi-nucleation but had no significant effect on migration. CM from NHOst increased the proliferation and multi-nucleation of MKs but had no effect on migration. Osteoblast/cancer cell CM also increased MEG-01 proliferation and multi-nucleation but had little effect on migration. MEG-01 CM did not cause any change in the proliferation, morphology or migration of the MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-231BRMS1 cells. These data suggested that there may be factors secreted by both cancer cells and osteoblasts, which work to increase megakaryopoiesis and may increase malignancy. MKs do not appear to directly affect the cancer cells. By identifying how cancer cells up-regulate MKs, it may be possible to reduce megakaryopoiesis or thrombopoiesis, thereby improving quality of life after metastasis has occurred.\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8609], "author_name_tesi": "Chandler, Paige Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Chandler", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Paige", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrea Marie Mastro", "Connie Jo Rogers", "Robert Paulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrea Marie Mastro, Thesis Advisor", "Connie Jo Rogers, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Paulson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["breast cancer", "metastasis", "megakaryocytes", "osteoblasts", "cytokines"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Proteasomal regulation of rDNA transcription and skeletal muscle hypertrophy", "id": "15209pxc268", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15209", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Muscle growth is advantageous not only because of its roles in mobility and breathing, but because increases in muscle mass increase physical strength, reduces the risk of injury, increases bone strength, and promotes immune function. Given the various roles of skeletal muscle, it is clear that inadequately maintaining muscle mass and function is a threat to an individual\u2019s quality of life and health.\n\tMuscle atrophy is a debilitating condition that commonly occurs in conjunction with disuse due to injury, aging, and chronic illness. In 2012, more than 54% of US adults suffered from a musculoskeletal disorder (MSDs), the vast majority of which are caused by traumatic illness.  As a result, MSDs represent the second highest cause of disability. As for the aging population, the US Census Bureau has predicted that 20% (80 million) of the population will be > 65 years of age by 2050. The economic burden of age-related muscle loss is so great that a 10% reduction in age-related muscle loss would save the US $1 billion in health costs per year. Finally, 60% of US adults are living with one chronic illness while 42% are living with two. Given the alarming incidence of conditions which promote muscle atrophy, it is imperative to fully understand the biological underpinnings of muscle growth. \n\tSkeletal muscle hypertrophy occurs when rates of protein synthesis exceed rates of protein degradation. Most studies centered on the regulation of muscle mass emphasize the role of protein synthesis while there is less emphasis placed on the role of protein degradation. However, protein degradation is required for the quick and efficient removal of not only damaged proteins, but ~20% of the cellular proteome. Indeed, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), one of the predominant proteolytic systems in muscle, controls the expression of regulatory factors like cell cycle proteins, transcription factors, and signaling molecules. This means that the UPS can selectively control gene expression, and signal transduction. Unfortunately, because one of the hallmarks of muscle atrophy is hyperactive proteolysis by the UPS, proteolysis generally has a negative connotation in muscle. Nonetheless, the UPS is necessary for muscle hypertrophy because inhibition of the UPS in various rodent and human models causes defects in muscle growth, architecture, and function. Therefore, we propose that the UPS is crucially involved in skeletal muscle growth. \n\tThe goal of my dissertation research was to identify a precise role for the UPS during hypertrophy. We hypothesized that UPS inhibition would impair growth by blocking ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription and ribosome production. In order to study the role of the proteasome in skeletal muscle growth, we used the reversible but potent 26S proteasome inhibitor MG-132. We found that inhibition of the proteasome, but not other prominent proteolytic systems, blocked hypertrophy by impairing rDNA transcription and ribosome production. We further hypothesized that proteasome inhibition would lead to the accumulation of p53, a negative regulatory factor of rDNA transcription. Indeed, p53 accumulated upon proteasome inhibition, which impaired rDNA transcription by reducing RNA Pol I recruitment to the rDNA promoter. \nCollectively, my dissertation work highlights the role of the UPS in the transcriptional regulation of muscle hypertrophy. Specifically, this work demonstrates that the UPS is not a passive participant in growth but has precise molecular roles in the regulation of muscle mass. Furthermore, this study is important for the development of therapeutics for those individuals suffering from chronic muscle loss. We can conclude that inhibition of the UPS may not be the best target for those individuals suffering from muscle atrophy as UPS inhibition might exacerbate muscle loss.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16737], "author_name_tesi": "Chandler, Paige Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Chandler", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Paige", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gustavo Alberto Nader", "Gustavo Alberto Nader", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "Kenneth Charles Keiler", "Rudolf Johannes Schilder", "Leonard Jefferson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gustavo Alberto Nader, Dissertation Advisor", "Gustavo Alberto Nader, Committee Chair", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Committee Member", "Kenneth Charles Keiler, Committee Member", "Rudolf Johannes Schilder, Outside Member", "Leonard Jefferson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["proteasome", "ribosome", "rDNA transcription", "hypertrophy"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Parasitic castration by a stinking smut regulates sex determination and inflorescence architecture in dioecious buffalograss\n", "id": "7932", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "403", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Buffalograss is a dioecious grass with male and female inflorescences separated onto two different individuals.  Buffalograss presumably evolved its present day dioecious breeding system from hermaphroditic ancestors. Pistil smut infection phenotypically alters unisexual florets of dimorphic male and female buffalograss making them hermaphrodites which are morphologically indistinguishable from one another.  In this way, pistil smut infection allows the phenotypic expression of a hermaphroditic ancestor, which existed back in time, in the form of a retrospective phenotype or simply a retrophenotype.  Underdeveloped stamens (male sex organs) and fungal sporulation within ovaries of male and female plants renders hermaphroditic florets of infected buffalograss reproductively sterile, i.e. parasitically castrated.  Parasitic castration is a disease affecting animals, mollusks, insects, and plants where host gonads are sterilized preventing evolution of host resistance and redirecting resource allocation. How and why fungi induce hermaphroditism and cause parasitic castration in their hosts is unknown. Here I show that pistil smut induces hermaphroditism in male buffalograss by down-regulating a female suppressor gene homologous to Tasselseed2 (Ts2). This molecular mechanism is supported by temporal and spatial expression analyses performed using quantitative real time PCR and in situ hybridization, respectively, on a cloned full length buffalograss Ts2 homolog.  In addition to inducing hermaphroditism, pistil smut infection enhances overall sexual reproductive allocation (SRA) in both male and female sex forms of buffalograss. In female plants, the fungus induces a 12.6-fold increase in ovary production while in male plants the fungus induces a 2.3-fold increase in floret number. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of morphology and nuclear 28s large subunit of ribosomal DNA (nLSU-rDNA) sequences show that pistil smut is clearly distinct from any other species of Tilletia suggesting that it may not even be a species of Tilletia. The unusually large genetic distance of pistil smut from Tilletia clade indicates an accelerated rate of evolution possibly due to pistil smut\u2019s long term coevolutionary struggle with its host culminating in induced hermaphroditism.

The impact of a)specialized functional units b)local memories optimized\nfor specific memory access pattern c) optimization of data transfer from external\nmemories into local memories, and from local memories into functional unit\nregisters is studied in detail. This analysis leads us to develop a framework\nconsisting of low-power multi-cores and an array of configurable micro-accelerator\nfunctional units, performing the best for the chosen domain of computer vision\nworkloads. Using this platform, this dissertation illustrates data flow and control\nprocessing optimizations that provide for performance gains similar to custom\nASICs for vision benchmarks.\nThe scaling of such systems with multi core processors to larger and larger number\nof cores and integration with a large number of optimized accelerators substantially\nincreases both computation and data transfers. A comprehensive design-space\nexploration of multi core architectures and accelerators with shared memories using\ncycle-accurate full-chip simulators or design and synthesis is becoming impractical\ndue to prohibitive simulation times. In order to study the impact of sharing\nmemories and data flow between local memories in CPUs and local memories in\naccelerators, there is a need for fast, accurate and scalable models that aid in system\narchitecture design space exploration. Therefore, this dissertation presents an\nanalytical model that abstracts the processing unit, and characterizes it in terms of\nmemory interaction alone. The presented model, Performance Estimation through\nContention ANalysis (PECAN), is a tool that models various uncore components,\nand estimates per-core performance in multi core architectures and accelerators.\nUsing the developed framework, this dissertation carries out a fast uncore design space exploration of multi core processors with accelerators.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13730], "author_name_tesi": "Chandramoorthy, Nandhini ", "last_name_ssi": "Chandramoorthy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nandhini", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "John Morgan Sampson", "Chitaranjan Das", "Mary Beth Rosson", "Kevin Irick", "Luca Benini"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Dissertation Advisor", "John Morgan Sampson, Committee Chair", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Rosson, Committee Member", "Kevin Irick, Outside Member", "Luca Benini, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["heterogeneous architectures", "processor modeling", "accelerator-rich architectures"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Release kinetics of nisin from chitosan-alginate films and microparticles\n", "id": "26302", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11387", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Antimicrobials are being used to inhibit the growth of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, thereby enhancing safety and extending the shelf-life of processed foods. Nisin is a bacteriocin that has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status, and is effective against Gram positive bacteria. Studies have shown that when nisin is directly applied to the surface of foods, it loses its biological activity over time. This loss is due to binding interactions with proteins and fats, and degradation by proteolytic enzymes, as well as due to diffusion into the bulk of the food. Delivery systems with sustained release properties of nisin have the potential to improve its stability and biological functionality in foods.  Chitosan-alginate polyelectric complexes are an effective drug delivery tool used in the pharmaceutical industry for controlled release of antimicrobials. These materials can be used for controlled release of nisin as a film or microparticle system. The goal of this research was to develop and characterize chitosan-alginate films and microparticles containing nisin, and understand the release kinetics of nisin in an aqueous system. The specific objectives were (1) to determine the factors affecting release of nisin from chitosan-alginate films, (2) to determine the release kinetics of nisin from chitosan-alginate films and study component interactions, and (3) to evaluate the release kinetics of nisin from chitosan-alginate microparticles.\nThe effects of polymer concentration (0.5 and 1.0%), chitosan molecular weight (low and high) and ratio of chitosan to alginate (expressed as 33, 50 and 66% alginate fraction) were investigated on the release of nisin from chitosan-alginate films. The polymer concentration and alginate fraction were found to have a significant effect (p<0.05) on nisin release. Highest nisin release was obtained for films prepared using 0.5% polymer concentration and 33% alginate fraction. SEM images indicated that the ratio of chitosan to alginate influenced the film microstructure. \nThe release kinetics of nisin from chitosan-alginate films prepared using various alginate fractions (33, 50 and 66%) was investigated using a two-temperature agar diffusion bioassay. The total amount of nisin released from films into an aqueous system decreased significantly (p<0.05) with an increase in alginate concentration. The mechanism of diffusion of nisin from all films was found to be Fickian, and the diffusion coefficients varied from 0.87 x 10-9 to 8.03 x 10-9 cm2/s. Strong complexation was confirmed between chitosan and alginate polymers within the films, particularly at high alginate fractions. Binding between nisin and alginate was also confirmed, resulting in reduction of freely available nisin within films.\nChitosan-alginate microparticles containing nisin, were produced by preparing a calcium-alginate pre-gel, followed by chitosan complexation. Calcium concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2 mM were found to be effective in inducing the formation of a coiled alginate nucleus. Particles obtained were in the micrometer range. Calcium concentration had a significant effect (p<0.05) on particle size and zeta potential of microparticles. Burst release of nisin was observed from these particles into water. A diffusion-based model was developed to predict the nisin release from microparticles, and good agreement (R2 = 0.91) was obtained between model predicted data and experimentally measured nisin release. SEM images indicated that the microparticles were predominantly spherical or ellipsoidal in shape, with a tendency for particles to aggregate. Findings from this research will be useful for the development of efficient nisin delivery systems for food safety applications.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10910], "author_name_tesi": "Chandrasekar, Vaishnavi ", "last_name_ssi": "Chandrasekar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vaishnavi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "John Neil Coupland", "Catherine Nettles Cutter", "Ali Demirci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Dissertation Advisor", "John Neil Coupland, Committee Member", "Catherine Nettles Cutter, Committee Member", "Ali Demirci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nisin", "release", "diffusion", "chitosan-alginate", "films", "microparticles"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Retrofit Optimization for Resilience Enhancement of Bridges \nmultihazard Scenario \n", "id": "22635", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10454", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bridge performance is often controlled by the strength of its critical sub-structural components (Teng et. al 2000). The seismic response of highway bridges is governed significantly by the axial strength and ductility of its columns.  Prior to 1971, bridge failures were often characterized by column failures at the plastic hinge zones due to poor detailing and insufficient confinement (Ramanathan 2012). The Caltrans Seismic Retrofit Program adopted the technique of column jacketing to provide the additional confinement required to restrict the lateral disintegration of column concrete. Steel jackets have been established as a means to increase the deformation capacity of concrete beyond its unconfined compressive strength and consequently improve the column rotational ductility under lateral loading. However, fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) is growing as a preferred alternative owing to its high strength to weight ratio, resistance to corrosion and superior confinement through hoop action coming from the orientation of its constituent fibers (Hajsadeghi et. al 2010).  FRPs also provide the advantage of easy and economical installation, although their manufacturing costs are much higher in comparison to steel. The inherent disparity in the mechanical properties and the associated costs of these different materials gives rise to a trade-off between cost and performance when it comes to retrofit operations. This study explores the aforesaid trade-off and aims to optimize bridge retrofit design configurations with respect to cost and resilience.\nThe study is a two-objective optimization problem that aims to minimize column jacket retrofit cost and simultaneously maximize the retrofitted performance measured in terms of bridge resilience. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II is used to carry out the optimization owing to its implicit elitism and simplicity in use.  The variables in the parameter space include the choice of material for the retrofit, the choice of column in the bridge to be retrofitted and the thickness of the retrofit material for each bridge column. Three different materials, steel, carbon fiber and glass fiber composites are investigated, each associated with different values of strength and unit cost. Required thickness of jacket and unit cost of jacketing differ for each material for the same target resilience.  The algorithm hence, searches the domain to arrive at parameter values which are most favorable in terms of cost as well the resulting resilience of the retrofitted structure. Results from the optimization, called Pareto-optimal set, include solutions that are distinct from each other in terms of the associated cost, contribution to resilience enhancement, and values of design parameters.  The user is offered a wide range of superior solutions to choose from, based on more specific preferences.\nIt is of interest to investigate seismic resilience enhancement due to column retrofit under the multi-hazard effect of earthquake and flood-induced scour in continuation to previous study by Prasad and Banerjee (2013). Hence the example bridge is evaluated for its seismic resilience for various retrofit configurations taking into account the bridge columns being exposed to pre-existing scour resulting in reduced structural stiffness.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10109], "author_name_tesi": "Chandrasekaran, Sandhya ", "last_name_ssi": "Chandrasekaran", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sandhya", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Swagata Banerjee Basu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Swagata Banerjee Basu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Optimization", "seismic retrofit", "resilience"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Essays in Development Economics", "id": "6349", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5927", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In September 2000, at the United Nations Millennium Summit, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were enunciated and adopted as part of the Summit\u2019s Millennium Declaration.  Among the eight goals included the following objectives: achieve universal primary education and ensure environmental sustainability.  In the Indian context, it would mean that 95 per cent of its children would be in school.  It is envisaged that boys and girls would complete a full course of primary schooling and girls would not be discriminated vis a vis boys.  The Indian government is also expected to work towards achieving a 50 per cent reduction the number of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water.\nIn this dissertation, we look at the above issues using household level cross section data from India.  \nIn the first chapter we examine issues relating to willingness to contribute to public projects and focus on the water and sanitation sector.  Public projects in the realm of water supply and sanitation projects in India are partially funded by the state governments with the users expected to cover the difference by contributing cash, labor or a mix of both.  We develop a stylized model to study an individual household's decision problem on the form of contribution to a sanitation project.  The model is taken to the data, using the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), India, (Round 54) data set covering over 76,000 rural and 30,000 urban households.  After controlling for existing access to water and sanitation, the results of the multinomial logit model suggest that richer households are more likely to contribute money.  In both urban and rural India, primary occupation of the household and ownership of assets explain the form of contribution.  A worsening of the state of the environment increases the likelihood of contribution.  The minority groups, in particular the scheduled castes, are more likely to contribute labor rather then money.  As expected, in rural India, if minorities are barred from accessing common property resources they are less likely to contribute.  Also, if households participate in existing programs then this has a positive influence on willingness to contribute.  Closely related to willingness to contribute is sustainability of projects.  The analysis suggests that occupation profile, asset ownership, rights of minorities would provide clues on sustainability of projects across the geographical regions of India.  The need for recognizing community and minority differences while decentralizing projects is also addressed.\nIn the second chapter we examine factors affecting primary school attendance and in particular focus on whether direct costs of schooling adversely affect the probability of children attending school.\n\tUsing the 52nd round (1995-96) data of the National Sample Survey Organization, India, we undertake an empirical exercise in order to understand the factors affecting schooling decisions of rural children in the age group 5-12.  Our analyses show that free primary education is a myth and that for most children direct costs of education matter and can adversely affect the probability of going to school.  A unit change in the logarithm of basic cost (Rs 190) of primary schooling reduces the likelihood of going to school by 3 percentage points.  This result is robust to different measures of cost at the village level.  We find a stark difference between the two minority groups; scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.  While financial factors like cost of education and the economic status of the household play an important role in schooling decisions made in scheduled caste households, human capital as measured by the presence of literate household head is the single most important factor for scheduled tribe households.  We also find that different factors affect schooling decisions of girls vis a vis boys.  In particular, the dependency ratio, as measured by the number of children in the family under the age of 5, adversely affects the school attendance of girls.  Our analyses bring out the need for community and gender specific education policies.  In particular it brings out the need for further subsidization of cost in order to achieve universal primary education.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5921], "author_name_tesi": "Chandrasekhar, S ", "last_name_ssi": "Chandrasekhar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "S", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts", "Priyanka Pandey", "David Shapiro", "Jill Leslie Findeis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts, Committee Chair", "Priyanka Pandey, Committee Chair", "David Shapiro, Committee Member", "Jill Leslie Findeis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Public Projects", "Water", "Sanitation", "Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Numerical Modeling of Tin-based Absorber Devices for Cost-effective Solar Photovoltaics", "id": "13171", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5388", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-01-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Due to the pressures of decreasing the electricity generation costs from solar photovoltaic (PV) modules, there is a need for novel light absorbing materials that can promise comparable conversion efficiencies at lower manufacturing costs than the incumbent technologies based on crystalline Si or thin films (CdTe or Cu-In-Ga-S). This research evaluates the tin-suite of absorber materials (based on tin monosulfide; SnS, and Cu-Zn-Sn-S; CZTS) as the next generation of PV cells that can yield the desired performance in the long term. Numerical models have been developed using Analysis of Microelectronic and Photonic Structures (AMPS-1D) to reveal efficiencies of cells under AM1.5 illumination based on three n-p heterojunctions: CdS|CdTe, CdS|SnS and ZnO|SnS, and identify avenues for further efficiency improvements in SnS PV. It has been predicted that PV devices based on the SnS (absorber)-ZnO (oxide) configuration yield higher conversion efficiencies (\u03b7=20.3%) compared to the inverted configuration oxide-absorber, with respect to the incidence of light. The difference has been attributed to variations in open-circuit voltages for the two situations, and suggests the adoption of the absorber-oxide design for further device development. The other approach to increasing open-circuit voltages in tin-based cells by using the wider band gap CZTS revealed upto 17.6% efficiency limits in FTO (F-doped SnO2)-oxide (ZnO)-sulfide(CdS)-absorber(CZTS) baseline cells, lower than the absorber-oxide configuration in SnS-based PV. Modeling of the CZTS cells under inverted configuration showed remarkably poor efficiencies (~3%) due to high hole affinities in the absorber that promoted surface recombination at the absorber-metal ohmic contact. This observation suggests the requirement of smaller hole affinities and indicates optimal absorber band gaps of 1.2-1.3 eV for high-efficiency PV conversion. The optimal value should be achieved by cationic substitution of the tin sublattice with copper and/or zinc atoms rather than substituting sulfur with selenium in CZTS. It is concluded that future research efforts in device development should utilize the absorber-oxide design wherein the absorbers have the optimal band gaps as stated. The role of simulation tools such as AMPS will be crucial in aiding critical decision making on tin-based materials as solar PV continues to become an affordable source of electricity.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5381], "author_name_tesi": "Chandrasekharan, Ramprasad ", "last_name_ssi": "Chandrasekharan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ramprasad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Brownson", "Semih Eser", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Joan Marie Redwing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Brownson, Dissertation Advisor", "Semih Eser, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tin sulfide", "numerical modeling", "thin film", "photovoltaics", "solar cells"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A fine-grained dataflow library for reconfigurable streaming accelerators\n", "id": "12324", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "406", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, a library of basic operators for accelerating complex algorithms on an Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is proposed.

Such an approach facilitates the use of dataflow programming at the application level for mapping an algorithm to the hardware components. This framework is highly modular and configurable in terms of hardware resources, bit-width allocation, and accuracy. In addition, the hierarchical nature of this framework allows recursive definitions of custom operators. This allows complex operators to be built using the library operators. The framework is well-suited to image processing tasks since it takes into account the streaming requirements of such applications. The initial architecture of this framework and the associated drawbacks are discussed and a new improved architecture which overcomes these drawbacks is also presented.

Penetration of renewable energy resources into the power system seems to magnify these challenges, and requires tremendous efforts to develop new control and protection methodologies, and market policies. Various interest groups including the government, electric utilities, academic and research institutions, as well as consumers are actively working towards the goal of a new intelligent grid \u2013 \u2018smart grid\u2019. This research focuses on the development of an operation and control scheme for a laboratory-scale hardware-in-the-loop microgrid system. The main features of this microgrid system include integrated renewable energy systems, battery storage, smart loads to realize demand-side energy management for various load patterns, advanced digital relays, as well as smart energy metering devices interfaced through various communication channels and protocols. Conventional generating units synchronized to an AC bus are coupled to the energy storage and the PV system through a DC bus. In real-life microgrid systems, various synchronous, asynchronous and static sources of power generation are dispersed geographically but relatively close to the demand side. An implementation of conventional power grid control and operation methods would presumably demand very high speed central processing platforms to perform extensive computations required for such a dispersed system. On the other hand, distributed control methods allocate these number crunching operations to asynchronous and autonomous control platforms, which operate in harmony to provide reliability, flexibility and resiliency in the microgrid environment. Therefore, the distributed approach for control using Multi-Agent System (MAS) concepts becomes the primary focus of this research. Various agents in the MAS platform offer advantages of being autonomous or self-organized, social, and pro-active as opposed to the existing distributed control systems. The framework for MAS is designed using Java Agent DEvelopment (JADE), a FIPA-standard compliant and open source java based platform.

The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which compacts and forms higher order structures. Chromatin structure affects transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair. For gene expression, chromatin is dynamically modulated by chromatin modifying complexes and chromatin remodeling complexes. The histone code hypothesis predicts that modifications not only dictate the inheritance of chromatin states, but also that combinations of modifications recognized by protein-interaction domains are important for recruiting cofactors that alter chromatin structure. For over 40 years, histone acetylation has been associated with gene activation. Moreover, the discovery of histone acetyl transferase (HAT) complexes has implicated acetylation in transcription, DNA repair and even silencing. The SAGA complex is a 1.8 MDa multisubunit HAT complex that is recruited by activator at promoters. As the catalytic subunit of SAGA, Gcn5 acetylates promoter nucleosomes and produces a peaked acetylation profile upon gene induction. Moreover, the Gcn5 bromodomain is required for retention on acetylated nucleosomes. We test the importance of the Gcn5 bromodomain in restricting SAGA acetylation to the promoter using the scanning in vitro chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The Gcn5 bromodomain does not significantly affect the nucleosomal acetylation profile of SAGA, even when the activator is removed from the array. While the Spt7 bromodomain does not retain SAGA on acetylated nucleosomes in vitro, its evolutionary conservation in yeast suggests that it may help retain SAGA on acetylated nucleosomes in vivo. When tested on phenotypic screens, the Spt7 bromodomain mutant and the Spt7 and Gcn5 double bromodomain mutant have a slight phenotype.\nThe accumulation of acetylated histones at the promoter signals for the recruitment of other cofactors. SAGA and the ATP dependent chromatin remodeler, SWI/SNF functioned cooperatively in the activation of several genes in budding yeast. At the PHO5 promoter, both SAGA and SWI/SNF are important for timely removal of nucleosomes from the promoter. The loss of SWI/SNF results in the accumulation of H3K9 acetylated histones at this promoter, which is also an acetylation site for SAGA. Thus, SAGA acetylation at the promoter may recruit SWI/SNF and promote the displacement of acetylated nucleosomes. We directly test the influence of SAGA acetylation on SWI/SNF nucleosome displacement using several assays on the immobilized nucleosome array in vitro.

Many-particle physics is challenging in that many of the usual tools for quantitative calculation are not applicable, and new concepts and techniques are usually required. Theoretical breakthrough in many-body physics is usually accompanied by the identification an emergent particle derived from the original interacting system. A good illustration is provided by the composite fermion (CF) theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). The composite fermion theory of FQHE transcends any other theory in the field of FQHE. It provides a mapping between the strongly interacting electrons and a system of weakly interacting composite fermions. The CF theory unifies the FQHE with the well understood integral quantum Hall effect, allowing a single particle description to be utilized.\n\nThe non-interacting CF theory has successfully explained the physics of FHQE at the fillings $\nu=n/(2pnpm 1)$ where $p$ and $n$ are integers. However, new physics can occur due to the weak interaction between CFs, which is the primary concern of this thesis. (i) Recently, experiments show signatures of new FQHE states, for example 4/11 and 5/13, which cannot be understood in a model of non-interacting composite fermions. By including the residual interaction of CFs, these new fractions are understood as the fractional quantum Hall effect of composite fermions. (ii) An extremely accurate description \nof few electrons in a semiconductor quantum dot at high magnetic field is developed based on correlated basis of the CF theory. (iii) At low filling factors, we show, by directly comparing with exact eigenstates, that the crystal state, resulting from the interacting between particles, is a topological quantum crystal of composite fermions. (iv) Motivated by the CF theory for electrons, we study the mapping of interacting bosons in a rapidly rotating trap at filling factors $n/(n+1)$ onto non-interacting fermions at fillings $n$. This mapping provides a good account of the behavior of bosons for small $n$.\n(v) The competition between the CF-crystal and CF-liquid orders at filling factor 1/5 is investigated. In the thermodynamic limit, the liquid state prevails. A variational combination of the crystal and liquid states provides an extremely accurate description\nfor small systems.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1212], "author_name_tesi": "Chang, Chia-Chen ", "last_name_ssi": "Chang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chia-Chen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain", "Gerald Dennis Mahan", "Stephane Coutu", "James Bernhard Anderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain, Committee Chair", "Gerald Dennis Mahan, Committee Member", "Stephane Coutu, Committee Member", "James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fractional quantum Hall effect", "two dimensional electron system", "condensed matter physics", "composite fermion"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "EVALUATION OF MOISTURE DAMAGE IN HOT-MIX ASPHALT WITH PENNDOT DISTRICT 1 LOCAL AGGREGATES\n", "id": "10073", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1291", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The sources delivering quality aggregate for use in hot-mix asphalt concrete have been depleting in PennDOT District 1, which has currently resulted in shortage of quality Type A aggregate in this district.

Furthermore, stripping and moisture damage in these gravel aggregates are of concern even though most of these aggregates exhibit excellent skid resistance and durability.  As a result of this situation, research was conducted to evaluate resistance of moisture damage of hot-mix asphalt concrete using District 1-0 aggregates.  Research included modifications that could be applied to asphalt mixtures to improve moisture resistance of such aggregates in hot-mix asphalt.  Four Type C aggregates and one Type A aggregate, all sources located in District 1-0, were selected for evaluation.  Mixes were prepared as control, with liquid anti-stripping agent, with lime, and with a gravel-limestone blend for the #8 material at equal proportions.  The tests included PennDOT\u2019s modified version of AASHTO test method T283 (Tensile Strength Ratio), one-third scale model mobile load simulator (MMLS3), and dynamic modulus test with repeated freeze-thaw cycles.  Overall, it was concluded that two of the five aggregate sources without any treatment could pass the requirement on moisture damage resistance based on the PennDOT version of the AASHTO T283 test method.  It was also found that the specific liquid anti-stripping agent used with these mixes improved the moisture damage resistance significantly.  The study indicated improvement of moisture damage resistance using the limestone-gravel blend to a much lesser degree compared to the improvement gained through the usage of liquid anti-stripping agent.  In testing with the MMLS3, only three control mixes were included, and testing was conducted under both dry and wet conditions.  A higher rutting level was found in wet tested specimens compared to dry specimens.  Only two of the five mixes were chosen for evaluation using dynamic modulus testing due to limited resources and time.  Each specimen was planned to be tested four times: unconditioned, after it was conditioned once, conditioned twice, and conditioned three times.  However, a few specimens failed after second cycle of conditioning and therefore dynamic modulus could not be obtained for all conditions.

Odor emitted from agricultural production, especially from livestock operations, creates a potential nuisance and in some cases can make people feel uncomfortable, anxious and fretful. Identification and classification of malodor emitted from agricultural animal operations is vital. In some states, agricultural odors are regulated by state and local governments. Human assessments for such odors can be highly subjective. In addition, using humans is costly and time-consuming. More recently, electronic sensor technology has been used instead of the human nose to classify odors emitted from different materials. However, human responses have not been specifically predicted by using the instrument measurements. In this work, a prediction system, consisting of targets, inputs, and prediction models, was designed and built to predict human assessments of odor emitted from dairy operations using instrument measurements, and specific data reduction and sensor fusion techniques were applied to improve the predictive accuracy.  \nOdor emitted from dairy operations is the sample source in this study. Solid samples were randomly collected in jars from dairy farms on five separate occasions, and evaluated by a human panel. There were five trained people in the panel, and the human assessments were recorded on a generic pleasantness scale ranging from -11 to +11, in which -11 represents extremely unpleasant, 0 means neutral, and +11 represents extremely pleasant. The average of the pleasantness responses across five assessors per observation was defined as one target. In total, 141 targets were summarized, in which 114 were used in training, and the remaining 27 were used in separate validation. The experimental results showed that the panelists can give individually consistent responses for the same sample. The samples were shown to represent a relatively wide range of odors, although primarily within the negative (unpleasant) range of the hedonic scale. The human assessment experiment is accurate, reliable and stable.\nUse of instruments instead of human panels to assess odors can save money and make the collection process more efficient. A Cyranose 320TM (eNose) system consisting of an array of 32 internal polymer sensors, and a fast Gas Chromatograph (GC) analyzerTM (zNose) based on surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor were used to measure the headspace odor of samples. The sensor readings are complex, but still showed differences between the odor components (either volume or mass). In addition, \u201cnoise\u201d is unavoidable due to instrument sensitivity. Three Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Levenberg-Marquardt Back-propagation Neural Network (LMBNN), Scaled Conjugate Gradient back-propagation neural network (CGBNN), and Resilient back-propagation neural network (RPBNN), were applied as the tools for the connection between complex sensor measurements and subjective human assessments. The two instruments were separately trained using ANNs models on the basis of targets. Four criteria were applied to do model selection, namely, Mean Square Error (MSE), Correlation Coefficient (R), probability within 10% range to target (P_10 for training, P1_10 for separate validation), and probability within 5% range to target (P_5 for training, P1_5 for separate validation). The optimal models for eNose and zNose were determined as eNose-LMBNN model with five hidden neurons (P1_10=74%, P1_5=41%), and zNose-LMBNN model with seven hidden neurons (P1_10=59%, P1_5=19%). The model results showed that it is possible to use instruments to predict human assessments of odor emitted from dairy operations, and both instruments performed well using LMBNN models.\nIn order to get higher predictive accuracy, three feature selection methods (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Forward Selection (FS), and Gamma Test (GT)), were used to reduce the noise of the measurements. The eNose with 28 features was modified to improve the LMBNN model performance. For 28 input candidates, eight variables were selected using GT, and nine variables were selected using both FS and PCA. Using the same network structure as the original eNose LMBNN model, all LMBNN-PCA (P1_10=78%), LMBNN-FS (P1_10=81%), and LMBNN-GT (P1_10=89%) models could predict more than half of human response within 10% range to targets on the scale. In separate validation, all modified models outperformed or matched the LMBNN-original data model. Without considering the consistency of network structure, the optimal LMBNN-PCA (four neurons), LMBNN-FS (six neurons), and LMBNN-GT (five neurons) models were determined and compared. The optimal LMBNN-GT outperformed the other models in the separate validation with lowest MSE (0.81), highest R value (0.45), and highest P1_10 (89%).\nMulti-sensor data fusion technology was another method applied to improve the model accuracy. Both measurement fusion and information fusion were developed and applied to integrate the eNose and zNose readings. The LMBNN was used as the modeling tool for fusion. With fusion, the new dataset consisted of 114 observations with 35 variables for training, and 27 observations with 35 variables for separate validation. The fusion model showed superiority in all criteria (MSE=0.85, P1_10=81%, P1_5=52%) except the R value (0.37) in separate validation. PCA and GT were applied to reduce the data feature number. Unlike the single instrument models, the predictive accuracy did not improve. These results showed that the methods available in single instrument models may be not suitable in measurement fusion models. In information fusion, the instrument outputs were represented by the odor information. In separate validation, all models (eNose-PCA+zNose, eNose-FS+zNose, and eNose-GT+zNose) showed significantly better results. The model based on eNose-PCA and zNose models showed superiority in stability (good balance between training and separate validation results), and the model based on eNose-GT and zNose models showed the best convergence (P-value(\u03c32)=0.37). The information fusion models provided the highest predictive accuracy among all models. \nIn this study, measurements from two different instruments, eNose and zNose, were individually applied to predict human odor assessments though building ANN models, and the predictive accuracy was successfully improved by utilizing feature selection and multi-sensor data fusion methods on the input dataset. The eNose models generally have better performance criteria and the measurements were more adaptable to different learning algorithms, but the zNose measurements were better for the simulation of targets values (error variance = 0.188). The modified models can predict as high as 93% of the human assessments within the 10% range based on the GT feature selection (eNose) and multi-sensor information fusion (eNose and zNose).\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12710], "author_name_tesi": "Chang, Fangle ", "last_name_ssi": "Chang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fangle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Herschel Adams Elliott", "Robin C Brandt", "Eileen Eilzabeth Fabian", "Soundar Kumara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Heinz Heinemann, Dissertation Advisor", "Herschel Adams Elliott, Committee Member", "Robin C Brandt, Special Member", "Eileen Eilzabeth Fabian, Committee Member", "Soundar Kumara, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hedonic tone", "electronic nose", "zNose", "ANNs", "feature selection", "PCA", "gamma test", "forward selection", "multi-sensor data fusion", "prediction"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Integrated Genomics Approach To Uncovering Gene Regulation and Epigenetics Across Eukaryotes", "id": "17432", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8333", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "How is gene expression controlled in eukaryotic organisms? Recently, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (or ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regulatory protein-DNA interactions including transcription-associated factors, epigenetic modifications, and 3D chromosome conformation. This research has uncovered unprecedented details on eukaryotic gene control, and these high-throughput genomic data have led to many challenges in genomics and bioinformatics. This dissertation presents an integrative genome-wide approach to understand transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes, by utilizing massively parallel sequencing and bioinformatics. In order to achieve this research goal, we performed functional, comparative, and statistical genomics analyses with high-throughput genomic data.\n\nGene and nucleosome organization in the Dictyostelium genome\n\nGenome-wide mapping of nucleosomes has significantly expanded our understanding of chromatin structure and function in eukaryotic transcriptional initiation and regulation. We present the first high-resolution maps of in vivo nucleosome locations for the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Its exceptional A/T-richness (78%) enabled us to study the role of the extreme nucleotide usage in organizing nucleosomes, genes, and promoters across the genome. Our functional and comparative genomics analysis revealed a variety of functionally distinct polymeric A/T elements in the Dictyostelium genome. These tracts established the boundary of Dictyostelium genes, associated with nucleosome-free regions and precisely positioned TATA boxes in the promoter. Dictyostelium utilized polymeric-A/T elements for nucleosome placement. Moreover as situated in an earliest branch from the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes, the exceptional ability of D. discoideum in alternating unicellular and multicellular form provided us with an ideal system to understand which principle governs the evolution of the chromatin structure across eukaryotes by emphasizing multicellular development. Surprisingly, Dictyostelium chromatin was organized as in higher multicellular eukaryotes. The phylogenetic linkage in the NELF homology and position of the first genic nucleosome across major eukaryotes implies that transcriptional regulation imposed on multicellularity has interplayed with eukaryotic chromatin over evolutionary time.\n\nComprehensive and high resolution genome-wide response of p53 to UV-damage\n\nTP53 has been found the most frequently mutated among human cancers ( 50%) and intensively studied because of its tumor suppressive function. p53 transactivates a variety of genes in response to cellular signals and environmental stimuli. This activity requires DNA sequence-specific binding, which is notably degenerate in sequence requirement. Thus, a major challenge has been genome-wide characterization of interaction between p53 and its response elements (or REs). We employed ChIP-exo as a high-resolution genome-wide mapping assay, and comprehensively identified ~2,000 p53-bound REs across the human genome in response to UV-induced stress. Strikingly a characteristic 6-peak ChIP-exo pattern was associated with p53/RE binding, and a half-site overlapping spatial relationship was commonly found between REs. p53 regulates a subset of genes in each stress response, and how p53 achieves such specificity has been a long-standing question. Our systematic motif analysis revealed a stereotyped spatial arrangement of p53 REs with other nearby stress-response elements, such as AP1, NRF2, FOXO3. This result may provide a mechanistic basis for p53-mediated response specificity. p53 usually binds to distant REs for target gene activation, which leads to a challenge in identifying target genes. Our ChIP-exo mapping of the transcription preinitiation complex components, TFIIB and Pol II, provided not only a reliable way to identify transcription factor target genes, but also a genome-wide insight into p53-dependent transactivation mechanism. 154 genes activated by p53 in UV-stress response were identified (80% novel), which were involved in various functions such as cell growth and death control, and DNA repair. This high-confidence target gene set greatly expanded our understanding of p53-regulated DNA repair and cell proliferation network. Recent GWAS evidence indicates that sequence variations in non-coding DNA can be a significant risk factor for disease, but their catalogue remains a challenge. Our comprehensive search for single nucleotide polymorphism (or SNP) present at p53-bound REs showed a strong association between a SNP at the UV-inducible p53 RE for the POLH gene and Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (or XPV). This result may exemplify how non-coding regulatory variants contribute to gene expression and human disease.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8248, 8249], "author_name_tesi": "Chang, Gue Su", "last_name_ssi": "Chang", "middle_name_ssi": "Su", "first_name_ssi": "Gue", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Istvan Albert", "Yu Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Dissertation Advisor", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Istvan Albert, Committee Member", "Yu Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["genomics", "eukaryote transcriptional regulation", "epigenetics", "bioinformatics", "high throughput sequencing"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Improving Prediction, Recommendation, and Classification using User-generated Content and Relationships", "id": "26545", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11096", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the dominance of social networks era, vast information is created and shared across the world each day.

Halide ions influence multiple elementary steps in the formation of metal nanoparticles such as reduction of precursor, nucleation, and particle growth. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) enables the oxidation of state of platinum precursor to be measured. We measured the oxidation states of platinum precursor via in-situ XAS and determined the rate of reduction quantitatively. We elucidated that enthalpy of formation of precursor has a linear relationship with reduction kinetics of platinum precursors. We used transmission electron microscopy to elucidate the role of halide ions in the nucleation and growth of platinum nanoparticles. We revealed the halide ion plays an important role in dermining particle size distribution because halide ions influence the rate of nucleation, surface growth, and coalescent growth of platinum nanoparticle in colloidal synthesis. \n\tThe next study on the formation of NP is a diffusion-driven formation of hollow Ni-Zn NPs. Intermetallic Ni-Zn NPs were synthesized via the chemical conversion of nickel NPs using a zerovalent organometallic zinc precursor. After the injection of a diethylzinc solution, metal NPs progressively transformed from a solid to a hollow Ni-Zn intermetallic structure with time.  During the transformation of Ni NPs to intermetallic structures, they retained their overall spherical morphology.  The growth mechanism for the solid to hollow nanoparticle transformation is ascribed to the nanoscale Kirkendall effect due to unequal diffusion rates of Ni and Zn. We developed a diffusion model for non-reactive, homogeneous, diffusion-controlled intermetallic hollow NP formation including moving boundaries at the interfaces of void-solid and solid-bulk solutions.  Apparent diffusion coefficients for both metals and vacancies were evaluated from modeling the time-dependent growth of the void.  The apparent diffusion coefficients obtained in this system compared favorably with results from measurement at grain boundaries in bulk Ni-Zn. This study represents the first combined experimental-modeling of the formation of hollow nanostructures by the nanoscale Kirkendall effect.\n\tFinally, in a separate study, we developed analytical solutions to probe in detail the competitive binding site model and the two independent binding sites model for isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) with respect to the total concentration of injected ligand. Initially this study developed the analytical solution in differential form for determination of the thermodynamic binding parameters; heat of binding, binding stoichiometry, and binding equilibrium constant utilizing a continuous rather than incremental injection mode. The continuous injection mode reduces operation time in comparison to the incremental titration mode where equilibration periods are required between injections. Uncertainty in the determined thermodynamic binding parameters obtained using the continuous titration method is less compared to the incremental titration method. This is because of the greater number of data points taken in the continuous titration method. A general form of the equation for the binding isotherm formulated for any binding stoichiometry is provided which enables the application of the differential analytical solution based on the total concentration of injecting ligand. For the experiments conducted in the continuous injection mode, we present a method which enables the real-time evaluation of thermodynamic binding parameters for single independent binding site, competitive binding site, and two independent binding sites model. From the binding isotherm obtained by the continuous injection method, thermodynamic binding parameters can be calculated by solving a system of algebraic equations in real-time using values at the inflection point(s). We have demonstrated a method to determine dissociation constants (KD) for high affinity ligand-receptor binding directly by a continuous injection method with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Although ITC is a method to determine the major thermodynamic values (\u0394G, \u0394H, and \u0394S), it is difficult to directly determine dissociation constants with an incremental titration method at nanomolar levels. We show label-free, surface modification-free and direct determination of the complete binding thermodynamics of a ligand with sub-nanomolar KD binding systems can be achieved through a continuous titration method. We conducted experiments involving the binding of EDTA with Ca2+ and desthiobiotin binding with avidin to demonstrate binding systems with a nanomolar and a picomolar dissociation constants, respectively. We also present the criteria of concentrations of ligand and receptor, and flow rate for obtaining true equilibrium constants.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10032], "author_name_tesi": "Chang, Ji Woong", "last_name_ssi": "Chang", "middle_name_ssi": "Woong", "first_name_ssi": "Ji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Martin Rioux Jr.", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr.", "Themis Matsoukas", "Darrell Velegol", "Raymond Edward Schaak"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Chair", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanoparticle synthesis", "Anion", "Hollow nanoparticle", "Kirkendall effect", "Isothermal Titration Calorimetry", "Continuous method"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Biomechanical Analysis of the Index Finger Motion for Optimal Trigger Design Using Cadaver Experiments.

However, operating the trigger excessively and repeatedly may let workers be exposed to work related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) such as trigger finger or carpal tunnel syndrome. Thus, the proper design of a trigger to reduce excessive and repetitive finger motions is required to prevent these WRMSDs. Although there have been a variety of related biomechanical analyses on the index finger or a trigger design, little research focusing on biomechanical interaction between index finger motions and trigger mechanism exists. However, they even have limits to show detailed biomechanical interaction between the index finger and triggers. Therefore, more specific and detailed biomechanical analyses focusing on the index finger mechanism during triggering are required.\n\tThe present study aims to conduct a biomechanical analysis on the index finger mechanism during triggering action using cadaver experiments. The specific objectives of the study include 1) developing a two-dimensional biomechanical static model for the index finger which accounts for index finger force mechanism while operating a trigger, 2) building an index finger motion simulator to support and control a cadaver hand, 3) conducting cadaver experiments to observe the relationship of external trigger forces to the internal tendon forces depending on different external force contact locations, trigger grip spans, FDP to FDS tendon force ratios, and handle grip spans, 4) validating the proposed biomechanical model, and 5) recommending optimal trigger grip span, optimal contact location for finger triggering, and optimal handle grip span for trigger and pistol designs in terms of force efficiency between externally generated trigger forces and internal tendon forces.\n\tThe index finger motion simulator was developed for cadaver experiments. The primary purpose of this simulator was to support and control a cadaver hand for observing relationship between internal tendon forces and external trigger forces, during triggering. The simulator was comprised of five essential parts: 1) the support frame to secure the specimens, 2) the motion delivery unit to control FDP and FDS tendons in the specimens 3) the data acquisition system to measure internal tendon forces and external triggering forces, 4) the vision system to obtain joint flexion angles on the index finger, and 5) the operation program to control the simulator and save the results of the experiments.\t \n\tThe cadaver experiments for index finger\u2019s triggering motion was conducted with the index finger motion simulator. Five fresh-frozen right human cadaveric hand specimens (average age = 46; SD = 5.7) without apparent musculoskeletal disorders and anatomical abnormalities were employed in the study. And the experiments consisting of two phases investigated triggering forces by the index finger as function of 1) total internal tendon forces (FDP + FDS; 40, 70, and 100 N), 2) FDP to FDS tendon force ratios (1 to 1, 1.5 to 1, 2 to 1, and 3 to 1), 3) trigger grip spans (40, 50, and 60 mm), 4) three different contact locations (F1 = the middle of the distal phalange; F2 = the distal edge of the medial phalange; F3 = the middle of the medial phalange) between a trigger and the index finger, and 5) handle grip spans (40, 50, and 60 mm) for the middle, ring, and little fingers; Phase I observed effects of 1), 2), 3), and 4), while Phase II investigated effect of 5). Also, force efficiencies were computed based on their internal tendon force to external triggering force ratios. As a result, the following key findings were found from the experiments: 1) FDP to FDS tendon force ratios didn't affect triggering forces by the index finger, 2) triggering forces increased significantly while total internal tendon force increased from 40 to 100 N, 3) The maximum triggering forces were found at 50 mm trigger grip span and the triggering forces at 60 and 40 mm trigger grip spans followed it in turn, 4) triggering forces increased significantly while external force contact location moved proximally from F1 to F3, and 5) 50 mm handle grip span showed the maximum triggering forces and 40 and 60 mm handle grip spans followed it in turn. Also, force efficiencies found the following important features: 1) approximately 10 to 30% of internal tendon forces could be converted into external triggering forces while triggering and 2) force efficiencies declined gradually while total internal tendon force increased from 40 to 100 N. \n\tA biomechanical index finger model for triggering was developed to observe relationships between internal tendon forces and externally generated triggering forces, based upon the index finger anatomy; three mathematical models on the three external force contact locations, F1, F2, and F3, were developed based on biomechanical assumptions and conditions of static equilibrium. Also, the models were simulated mathematically based on the unknown variables determined by the experimental conditions, in order to evaluate the validity of the models. Consequently, the simulation results showed high similarities to the results of the experiments: 1) the estimated triggering forces increased significantly while total internal tendon force increased from 40 to 100 N, 2) The maximum estimated triggering forces were found at 50 mm trigger grip span and the triggering forces at 60 and 40 mm trigger grip spans followed it in turn, and 3) the estimated triggering forces increased gradually while external force contact location moved proximally from F1 to F3. In sum, the models predicted similar triggering force patterns to the triggering forces measured in the experiments. However, overall, triggering forces were over-estimated by the models, except for at F1 contact location; relatively accurate triggering forces were estimated at F1 contact location, but the models predicted triggering forces two and three times higher than the measured triggering forces at F2 and F3 contact locations, respectively.\n\tFinally, the present study provided design recommendations for an optimal one-finger trigger design. The following four design guidelines were defined based on the results of the cadaver experiments: 1) a force requirement to activate a trigger should be set as low as possible, 2) a trigger grip may afford users to use the medial phalange, 3) 50 mm trigger grip span is generally recommended as the optimal trigger grip span to accommodate most people, and 4) 50 mm is recommended as the trigger handle grip span.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9919], "author_name_tesi": "Chang, Joonho ", "last_name_ssi": "Chang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Joonho", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds", "Neil Sharkey", "Andris Freivalds", "Neil Sharkey", "David J Cannon", "Ling Rothrock", "Hyun Min Mike Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds, Dissertation Advisor", "Neil Sharkey, Dissertation Advisor", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Chair", "Neil Sharkey, Committee Chair", "David J Cannon, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Hyun Min Mike Kim, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cadaver study", "Trigger grip design", "Triggering force", "Trigger grip span", "Handle grip span", "and FDP to FDS tendon force ratio"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A Study of Benford's Law, With Applications to the Analysis of Corporate Financial Statements", "id": "13947jzc243", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13947", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We consider in this thesis the numerical phenomenon, known as Benford's Law, which asserts numerical values for the empirical probabilities of first digits appearing in many lists of numbers.

In mammalian systems, the NF-kappaB family includes five members, NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, RelA, RelB and c-Rel, characterized by their structural homology in an evolutionary conserved domain, the Rel homology domain. The different NF-kappaB members form homo- or heterodimers that mediate transactivation of specific target genes.  The NF-kappaB complexes are normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by a family of inhibitory proteins, IkappaBs, with IkappaBalpha being the prototypical IkappaB member that controls a so-called canononical pathway of NF-kappaB activation.  Various stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines, antigens, and TLR agonists, activate an IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, which phosphorylates IkappaBalpha at specific serines.  Phosphorylated IkappaBalpha is rapidly ubiquitinated and targeted to the 26S proteasome for degradation.  These sequential signaling events lead to the liberation of NF-kappaB complexes, which concurrently move to the nucleus to regulate target gene expression by binding specific kappaB enhancers. \nDespite the extensive studies of the canonical NF-kappaB signaling pathway, many missing links exist for a comprehensive understanding of NF-kappaB activation.  This thesis research focuses on the function of the nfkappaB1 gene that encodes two major proteins, the precursor protein p105 and its processing product, the mature NF-kappaB1 subunit p50.  In addition to generating p50, p105 functions as an IkappaB-like molecule, although how p105 regulates NF-kappaB function is not well understood.  At least in some cells, nfkappaB1 also produces a splicing variant mRNA that encodes the C-terminal portion of p105, known as IkappaBgamma based on its sequence homology to IkappaBalpha. The in vivo function of IkappaBgamma is also unclear, although it is generally thought to act similarly to p105. \nStudies in this dissertation were directed towards to elucidating the physiological role of the nfkappaB1 gene products, including p105, p50 and IkappaBgamma, in immune and inflammatory responses. To obtain genetic evidence, I utilized three mouse models, the nfkappaB1 knockout (-/-) mice that lack all of the nfkappaB1 gene products, the p50 knockin (KI) mice that express only p50, and the IkappaBgamma transgenic (Tg) mice that specifically express IkappaBgamma. The major findings are summarized below: \n\n1.\tAberrant activation of p50 causes T-cell dependent inflammation. Prior studies suggest that p50 is constitutively expressed in the nucleus of immune cells of the p50KI mice.  This mouse model is thus useful for the study of the pathological consequences of deregulated p50 activation.  Interestingly, the p50KI mice were found to spontaneously develop intestinal inflammation with typical features of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This inflammatory disorder is mediated by T cells, since it can be induced by adoptive transfer of p50KI T cells into Rag1-/- recipients lacking lymphocytes.  Furthermore, the IBD-like symptoms were also rescued when p50KI mice were crossed with the Rag1-/- mice. Thus, deregulated p50 activation leads to T-cell dependent intestinal inflammation.\n\n2. \tNF-kappaB1 regulates the development of inflammatory Th17 cells. Recent studies have identified a subset of CD4+ T cells, Th17 cells, which produce proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-17, and mediate autoimmunity and inflammation.  Interestingly, we found that the p50KI mice contain elevated frequency of Th17 cells in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes.  High levels \u00a3eof Th17-specific cytokines were detected in the colons of p50KI mice, suggesting the infiltration of these inflammatory T cells to the site of inflamed tissues.  Parallel biochemical analyses revealed that activation of CD4+ T cells under Th17 differentiation conditions leads to preferential activation of p50 homodimers. Interestingly, p50 synergizes with a known Th17-regulatory transcription factor, RORgammat, in the activation of IL-17 promoter.  Consistently, p50 is recruited to the IL-17 promoter along with the induction of Th17 differentiation. Taken together, these findings suggest that NF-kappaB1 is involved in Th17 cell differentiation, which provides an important insight into the role of NF-kappaB in the development of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.\n\n3. \tIkappaBgamma is a specific inhibitor of p50 homodimer. To understand the physiological function of IkappaBgamma, we generated IkappaBgamma Tg mice and examined the role of IkappaBgamma in the regulation of different NF-kappaB members.  In sharp contrast to IkappaBalpha, IkappaBgamma played a minimal role in regulating the inducible activation of typical NF-kappaB complexes, such as RelA- and c-Rel-containing dimers.  Interestingly, we found that IkappaBgamma is essential for restricting the nuclear translocation of p50 homodimers. This finding is consistent with the constitutive nuclear translocation of p50 in p50KI cells, which lack IkappaBgamma or p105.  We further demonstrated that the aberrant p50 activation in p50KI macrophages leads to either enhancement or repression of LPS-stimulated expression of pro-inflammatory genes. The induction of IL-12 and iNOS was greatly upregulated, whereas the induction of TNFalpha was suppressed in LPS-treated p50KI macrophages.  These findings are in line with the findings that p50 associates with the co-activator protein Bcl3 in some, but not all, gene promoters.  More importantly, these abnormal gene induction events were largely rescued by expression of IkappaBgamma.  Similarly, IkappaBgamma also reverses the B-cell hyper-responsive phenotype of the p50KI mice.  These results suggest that IkappaBgamma, and likely p105, functions as a specific inhibitor of p50 and regulates specific aspects of NF-kappaB function in the immune system.\n\n4. \tRegulation of oncoprotein kinase Tpl2 by p105 and I\u0192\u00dbB\u0192\u00d7. Recent studies demonstrate that p105 regulates the stability and function of the oncoprotein kinase Tpl2, thereby mediating an interesting crosstalk with the ERK MAP kinase signaling pathway. In vitro studies suggest that the C-terminal portion of p105, equivalent to IkappaBgamma, is both required and sufficient for stabilizing Tpl2. Surprisingly, our studies using the IkappaBgamma Tg mice revealed that IkappaBgamma is insufficient for stabilizing Tpl2 or regulating ERK signaling in macrophages in vivo.  These findings suggest that stabilization of Tpl2 by p105 may also require N-terminal sequences of p105.  Moreover, since IkappaBgamma does not rescue the Tpl2 deficiency in p50KI mice, the phenotype of the IkappaBgammaTg/p50KI mice is mainly due to the regulation of NF-kappaB.  \nIn summary, the results presented in this dissertation demonstrate a novel function of NF-kappaB1 p50 in regulating T-cell differentiation and T-cell mediated inflammation and establish IkappaBgamma and NF-kappaB1 p105 as specific inhibitors of the p50 homodimers.  These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of NF-kappaB regulation and highlight the complexity of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.  Based on these findings, it is tempting to propose that different IkappaB proteins may play a specific role in the regulation of distinct aspects of NF-kappaB function. This information is important for rational design of anti-inflammatory therapies based on inhibition of specific axis of NF-kappaB signaling.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4448], "author_name_tesi": "Chang, Mikyoung ", "last_name_ssi": "Chang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mikyoung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shao Cong Sun", "Sarah Bronson", "David Joseph Spector", "Christopher Charles Norbury", "Jong Kak Yun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shao Cong Sun, Committee Chair", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Chair", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Christopher Charles Norbury, Committee Member", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["T cells", "inflammation", "macrophage", "p105", "IkappaBgamma", "NFkappaB"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Modeling of Proppant Transport through Hydraulic Fracture Network", "id": "19864", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9087", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hydraulic fracturing is one of the most efficient and effective methods to enable economic oil and gas production in shale gas plays. Hydraulic fracturing creates a fracture network system instead of a planar fracture in real cases. As a matter of fact, proppant transport in the fracture network is extremely important to long-term fracture conductivity. Several models are developed to simulate proppant placement in fracture networks. The models are coupled to a finite-difference based fracture network pressure propagation model developed by Chong Hyun Ahn (Ahn, Wang, 2012) which is able to simulate the propagation of fracture networks. Once the fracture geometry and pressure profile is obtained from the model, the proppant distribution can be generated from the proppant transport models. The four different models are linked to the fracture propagation model with an increasing degree of coupling. With more criteria added on and assumptions taken off, the models are able to generate accurate and trustable proppant distribution in fracture networks. \nScreen out, one of the most common problem encountered in fields, can also be predicted by these models and engineers can utilize the models to monitor proppant distribution in the network and prevent screen out. Models in this thesis simulate different screen out behaviors and mechanisms, and also identify locations of high screen out potential during the treatment under different scenarios. In general, pressure gradient is a key factor during proppant transport in fracture network. With higher pressure gradient, proppant particles have enough energy to be carried further into the network. As a matter of fact, to maintain a smooth flow field, the pad stage of the treatment is very critical that a larger pad zone ensures higher pressure gradient that the fluid has enough energy to transport proppant with higher velocity and to a further distance. Combined with the pressure fracture propagation model, several controlling factors that affect proppant transport can be obtained from the proppant distribution models. With the models, engineers can design treatments along with the logic and new findings to improve proppant displacement.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8913], "author_name_tesi": "Chang, Oliver Chih-young", "last_name_ssi": "Chang", "middle_name_ssi": "Chih-young", "first_name_ssi": "Oliver", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yilin Wang", "Turgay Ertekin", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yilin Wang, Thesis Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor", "Derek Elsworth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Proppant", "Hydraulic fracture network"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "INTEGRATED 3-DIMENSIONAL MODELING OF PROPPANT TRANSPORT THROUGH HYDRAULIC FRACTURE NETWORK IN SHALE GAS RESERVOIR", "id": "pz50gw084", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12897", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " Hydraulic fracturing is one of the most successful and widely applied techniques that ensure economic recovery from unconventional reservoirs.

Distinct fracture propagational behavior and operational variation both affect the entire hydraulic fracturing treatment. Proppant transport and fracture network conductivity are the most significant factors determining the effectiveness of a treatment. The concept of stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) is used to characterize the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing treatment. However, the unpropped fracture will close after the well starts to produce without contributing hydrocarbon recovery. Only the propped open section of fracture contributes to the hydrocarbon recovery. Therefore, the concept of propped open stimulated reservoir volume (PSRV) is proposed to characterize the effectiveness of the treatment.\n                   Physics of proppant transport in a complex fracture network is unclear to the engineers. Most of the model simulates using simplified physics. In this work, we first identified the patterns of proppant transport and we developed equations to quantify the governing physics in each pattern, in order to capture the proppant transport process accurately. To quantify the PSRV, a dynamic 3-D, finite-difference, proppant transport model is developed and linked to a hydraulic fracture propagation model to simulate the process of proppant transport through the hydraulic fracture network. The actual propped open stimulated reservoir volume (PSRV) and fracture network conductivity can be quantified by utilizing the model. The goal of this study is to generate guidelines to maximize the effectiveness of the hydraulic fracturing treatment. Hence, a systematic parametric study was conducted to investigate the relation among engineering factors, geomechanical and reservoir properties. The effect of each parameter on PSRV, PSRV/SRV efficiency ratio, and average fracture conductivity during pressure pumping, flowback and shut-in is evaluate and quantified. Guidelines to optimize the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing treatment for different scenarios are established based on the systematic parametric study.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12124], "author_name_tesi": "Chang, Oliver Chih-young", "last_name_ssi": "Chang", "middle_name_ssi": "Chih-young", "first_name_ssi": "Oliver", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Yilin Wang", "John Yilin Wang", "Turgay Ertekin", "Eugene C Morgan", "Virendra Puri"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Yilin Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "John Yilin Wang, Committee Chair", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Eugene C Morgan, Committee Member", "Virendra Puri, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["proppant transport", "hydraulic fracturing", "shale gas", "fracture network", "unconventional reservoir"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "longitudinal associations between playfulness and resilience for older women in a leisure-based context: a study of the red hat society", "id": "19721", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9307", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "According to the broaden-and-build theory, older adult playfulness may have an important role in contributing to enduring positive resources (e.g., social connections, coping strategies).

Furthermore, mental health, the average level of older adult playfulness, and RHS identity moderated the association between older adult playfulness and resilience.\nThe findings of this study added to the previous playfulness literature and connected the leisure and positive psychology fields by confirming that older adult playfulness facilitates resilience growth according to the broaden-and-build framework in a leisure-based context. Moreover, the findings provided additional evidence that resilience is a state-characteristic that can be changed by frequent positive leisure-based experiences. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9111], "author_name_tesi": "Chang, Po-ju ", "last_name_ssi": "Chang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Po-ju", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Careen M Yarnal", "Careen M Yarnal", "Garry Chick", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Linda Ann Wray"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Careen M Yarnal, Dissertation Advisor", "Careen M Yarnal, Committee Chair", "Garry Chick, Committee Member", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Member", "Linda Ann Wray, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["playfulness", "resilience", "older women", "leisure", "multilevel modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Genomic Organization and Gene Repertoire of the Male-specific Region of the Bovine Y Chromosome", "id": "13159", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7033", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The male-specific region of the mammalian Y chromosome (MSY) was evolved as a consequence of the progressive differentiation of sex chromosomes. During evolution, different lineages acquired and retained distinct sets of lineage-specific Y genes in the MSY due to the independent Y chromosome decay and chromosome rearrangements. However, the knowledge about the gene content and genomic organization of the Y chromosome is still limited. The major reason is the enrichment of repetitive sequences in the Y chromosome that has impeded Y chromosome sequencing and further characterization of Y-linked genes. Therefore, this dissertation targeted at expanding our knowledge on mammalian Y chromosome through identifying and characterizing the bovine (Bos taurus) MSY transcriptome and investigating the genomic organization of the bovine MSY. The bovine MSY contains three major regions: X-degenerate (Xd), Y-ampliconic (Ya), and Y-transitional (Yt). Xd splits into two regions (Xd1& Xd2) located at either end of MSY, spanning 2.4 Mb. Xd1 comprises ten single-copy genes (EIF1AY, AMELY, OFD1Y, USP9Y, ZRSR2Y, UTY, DDX3Y, RPL23AY, ZFY, and EIF2S3Y), two of which (ZRSR2Y & RPL23Y) are bovid-specific; Xd2 harbors two genes (SRY and RBMY). Ya spans 34.8 Mb, a majority of which (68.6%) shares intra-chromosomal similarities \u226599%. Distinct from the human ampliconic region, the bovine Ya is organized into a higher ordered repeat structure with an array of inverted repeats containing four major gene families (ZNF280BY, ZNF280AY, TSPY-M2, and HSFY) with copy numbers ranging from ~80 to 230. ZNF280BY and ZNF280AY are bovid-specific. Each inverted repeat (~420 Kb) represents a repeat unit, which is repeated up to ~80 times. Yt (~3.3 Mb) is located between Xd1 and Ya, with a transitional sequence feature between Xd and Ya, where a bovid-specific gene family (PRAMEY, 10 copies) are present. In addition, ~400 novel transcription units (TUs) were identified. The majority of the examined ampliconic gene families (12/14) are predominantly expressed in testis, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis. Furthermore, antisense transcription of ZNF280BY and PRAMEY was detected in spermatids, indicating that the antisense RNA may participate in coordinated gene regulations in testis. The ampliconic ZNF280BY, ZNF280AY and PRAMEY gene families were derived from the transposition of a gene block on the bovine chromosome 17. At least two major genomic expansions of the ampliconic region have been observed, which are likely associated with adaptation and speciation of the bovid lineages. Further analyses were performed for two X-degenerate genes, DDX3Y and OFD1Y. The DDX3Y gene, comprising a DEAD motif, belongs to the DEAD-box polypeptide 3 (DDX3) subfamily with a main role in RNA metabolism. In addition to the sex chromosome-linked DDX3X and DDX3Y, autosomal homologs, named PL10, were present in mammals. Pseudogenized homologs are also present on the autosomes and mammalian X Chr, which were derived from lineage-specific retropositions. The autosomal retroposed homologs may still be active transcriptionally as demonstrated in the bovine. The OFD1Y gene is another X-degenerate gene in the bovine MSY. The ortholog of this gene on the human X chromosome has been implicated in several developmental disorders. The bovine OFD1Y was identified from the MSY transcriptome and expressed differentially from the bovine OFD1X. Comparison of OFD1Y and neighboring genes against their X-linked paralogs indicated that the expansion of the ampliconic region may initiate from the X-degenerated sequence. Furthermore, different regions of OFD1/OFD1X/OFD1Y are subject to differential selection pressures, which appears to be associated with diverse syndromes derived from the OFD1 mutations. The identified bovine MSY transcriptome serves as an important resource for studying Y-linked genetic factors involved in male-specific function. Further understandings of how these genes function in bovine will offer insights into their roles or related biological processes in the other species.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7028], "author_name_tesi": "Chang, Ti-Cheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Chang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ti-Cheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wansheng Liu", "Wansheng Liu", "Cooduvalli S Shashikant", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wansheng Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Wansheng Liu, Committee Chair", "Cooduvalli S Shashikant, Committee Member", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Member", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Y chromosome", "Gene transposition", "Transcriptome", "Natural selection", "Spermatogenesis", "Lineage-specific gene family"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "ELASTO-PLASTIC ANALYSIS OF CORRUGATED SANDWICH STEEL PANELS", "id": "6301", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6541", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-05-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this study, the elasto-plastic analysis of a corrugated-core sandwich plate has been developed.

Through the interpretative lens of Self-determination Theory (SDT), I analyzed in-depth multiple interviews conducted over a five-year period with three women in the midst of successful careers in the animation industry. They discussed their educational experiences and careers in the animation industry. Throughout the journey of this narrative inquiry, my own deep-seated beliefs and values were challenged regarding conditions in the animation industry for women.\n\nThe narratives from these three women about what motivated them to pursue and achieve successful careers in the animation industry included influences from early role models. All had attended schools that had flexible/experimental programs, which built their capacity for autonomy and competence. However, each had unique reasons for being drawn to animation careers, and how they learned animation. All three felt they had support from their spouse or their peers. They also perceived that they were trusted and needed within their profession. \n\nIt is my hope that this study will encourage further research by disabilities studies scholars, critical race theorists, and other researchers to provide different perspectives from their examinations of the socio-cultural contexts in the animation industry that have led to underrepresentation of women, people of color, and people experiencing disabilities. Art educators also need to develop interdisciplinary animation curricula that facilitate autonomy, competence, and relatedness to not only generate individual motivation but also to model a supportive learning environment for transfer into the animation industry\u2019s work environments. The most significant implication is the need to improve working conditions and environments in the animation industry in order to support those who work there and enable them to have families and take medical leaves without jeopardizing their careers.

This work is motivated by important research problems in climate science where such computer models are frequently used. Climate models play a central role in generating projections of future climate.  An important source of uncertainty about future projections from these models is due to uncertainty  about input parameters that are key drivers of the resulting hindcasts and projections. Climate model calibration is a statistical framework for inferring the input parameters by combining information from climate model runs and observational data. When the data are in the form of high-dimensional spatial fields, climate model emulation (approximation) and calibration can pose significant modeling and computational challenges. The goal of this research is to develop new approaches to computer model calibration that are computationally efficient, accurate, and carefully account for uncertainties. The main contributions of this thesis are three-fold: (1) to develop a highly efficient reduced-dimensional climate model calibration approach that enables the use of high-dimensional spatial data; (2) to formulate a novel calibration method based on block composite likelihood and study the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimates for input parameters; and (3) to introduce a calibration framework that generalizes the existing method to the one-dimensional exponential family and formulate a reduced-dimensional approach that can efficiently handle the high-dimensional non-Gaussian spatial data. Our methods provide insights about current and future climate. In our first application we make projections of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), an ocean circulation that  transports heat from low- to high-latitude areas in the Atlantic and contributes to the mild climate in Northern and Western Europe. AMOC changes are projected to impact human and natural systems. We demonstrate that utilizing information from high-dimensional spatial data reduces parametric uncertainty and thus results in an AMOC projection with reduced uncertainties. In the second case study, we demonstrate an application of our approach for non-Gaussian spatial data to calibration of a Greenland ice sheet model and show that our approach can improve upon current methods for projections of sea level rise contributed by the Greenland ice sheet.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10051], "author_name_tesi": "Chang, Won ", "last_name_ssi": "Chang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Won", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Murali Haran", "Murali Haran", "Klaus Keller", "Bing Li", "Donald Richards"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Murali Haran, Dissertation Advisor", "Murali Haran, Committee Chair", "Klaus Keller, Committee Member", "Bing Li, Committee Member", "Donald Richards, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Climate Model Calibration", "Gaussian Process", "High-dimensional Spatial Data", "Non-Gaussian Spatial Data"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on Mortgage Refinancing", "id": "6977", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6885", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate mortgage refinancing in the following three categories: refinancing and rate-and-point choice, refinancing and borrowers\u2019 mortgage instrument choice, and estimating the market refinancing share of total mortgage origination volume. The choice of rate-and-point combination is driven by a comparison between the borrower\u2019s own estimation of his holding period of the mortgage and the implied duration priced into each selection by the lender reflecting estimations of the lender. Questions tested in this setting are: whether the borrower correctly predicts his own holding period of the mortgage and chooses the right rate-and-point combination on his fixed-rate mortgage, and once chosen, whether he treats the upfront points paid as sunk costs and refinances optimally should such opportunity arise. Comparatively, choosing a loan product is a more complex issue than the choice of rate-and-point combination, affected by borrower characteristics including expected income, wealth, housing consumption, and life cycle. Examining borrowers\u2019 product choice in a refinance situation provides an in-depth look at their decision-making process, where a comparison can be made concerning changes in borrower characteristics and changes in loan instrument choices between the original loan and the refinance loan. The effects of various factors are tested in turn. Shifting focus from understanding borrower behavior on an individual basis to the macro level, the refinancing share of the total loan originations is also studied.

For gun propulsion applications, they have advantages in storage, logistics, and demilitarization.  For space propulsion applications, their high density, low toxicity, and low freezing point are highly desirable.  In this investigation, the combustion behavior of three HAN-based liquid propellants were investigated.\n\nThe first propellant studied was XM46, whose fuel component is triethanol ammonium nitrate [TEAN, (HOCH2CH2)3NHNO3,].  The flame structure displayed three different stages: (1) nearly simultaneous decomposition of both HAN and TEAN initiating in the liquid to produce gases around 300\u00b0C, (2) breakdown of heavy opaque intermediate molecules into transparent species, and (3) reaction of transparent species to form final products in the luminous flame.  The pyrolysis data indicates that TEAN participates in the first-stage combustion.\n\nThe second propellant was HANGLY26, with glycine as the fuel component.  No luminous flame was observed in any combustion tests.  The burning rate of HANGLY26 exhibited four burning rate regimes with different pressure exponents for pressures ranging from 1.5 to 18.2 MPa.  The decrease of the burning rate pressure exponent with increasing pressure at 3.9 MPa was caused by the higher percentage of the gaseous products formed, which reduced the heat feedback.  The increase of the burning rate pressure exponent with increasing pressure at 8.8 MPa was due to a reduction of energy requirement of water vaporization.  Thus, a higher percentage of the surface heat release can be used to pyrolyze the active ingredients.\n\nThe third propellant was HAN269MEO15, with methanol as its fuel component.  An abrupt discontinuity of the burning rate curve was observed between 1.14 and 1.21 MPa.  For tests of chamber pressures near 1.14 MPa, pulsating burning was observed.  The temperature of the products after the reaction front was bounded by the boiling point of methanol and water, indicating the influence of the evaporating process of both liquids.\n\nThe burning rate curves of the HAN-based liquid propellants shared features such as dome-like burning rate curves, negative slope regions, and extremely high pressure exponents.  Staged combustion characteristics were commonly observed among these three propellants, which result from the autocatalytic decomposition of HAN.  Based upon a simple kinetic model of HAN/fuel interaction proposed by the author, possible ways of reducing autocatalytic characteristics are suggested.  They are: utilization of nitrous acid-scavenging fuel, consideration of fuels which would react more readily with NO2, and the increase of fuel percentage in the propellant formulation to slightly fuel-rich compositions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6818], "author_name_tesi": "Chang, Yi-Ping ", "last_name_ssi": "Chang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi-Ping", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Kenneth K Kuo", "Stefan Thynell", "Thomas Litzinger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Member", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Kenneth K Kuo, Committee Chair", "Stefan Thynell, Committee Member", "Thomas Litzinger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pressure exponents.", "burning rate controlling mechanisms", "decomposition", "autocatalytic", "pyrolysis", "propellants", "hydroxylammonium nitrate", "combustion"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Field-induced And Nanodisordered Ktn Crystals: Properties, Devices, And Applications", "id": "21055", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9728", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Potassium tantalate niobate [KTa1\u2212xNbxO3 (KTN)] crystal has the largest electro-optic (EO) coefficients among all Kerr mediums. As other perovskites relexors, KTNs also exhibit extraordinary thermal hysteresis on the dielectric and EO properties. This study conducted transient observations of the EO effect in cooling and heating processes. The disordered polar nano-regions (PNRs), which minimize optical depolarization and scattering, strongly impact the characteristics of nanodisordered KTNs. Our investigation showed that the super cooling process effectively suppress the influence from PNRs formation. An enormous transient EO coefficient was thus observed, and made the single-crystal KTN a good candidate as a free-space optical (FSO) switch. The large EO coefficient reduces the driving voltage of the large aperture switch. A device with a large aperture, a wide FOV, and a very fast speed is demonstrated. In addition, by taking advantage of the Kovacs effect, the driving voltage can be further reduced. Furthermore, this dissertation introduces a novel technique to manipulating the guiding waves inside the EO crystal. A field-induced dynamic optical waveguide is locally induced and controlled by an external electric field. Based on this discovery, a field-induced 1 \u00d7 2 KTN EO switch is proposed, which possesses low power dissipation, low cross-talk, and broad bandwidth. The performance of the fabricated device also shows good agreement with the proposed model.

The ability to control the structures, properties, and functions of polymer electrolytes remains a key subject for the development of next generation functional polymers. Taking advantage of synthetic strategies is a promising approach to achieve the desired chemical structures, morphologies, thermal, mechanical, and electrochemical properties. Therefore, the major goal of this thesis is to develop synthetic methods for of novel proton exchange membranes and ion conductive membranes. \nIn Chapter 2, new classes of fluorinated polymer- polysilsesquioxane nanocomposites have been designed and synthesized. The synthetic method employed includes radical polymerization using the functional benzoyl peroxide initiator for the telechelic fluorinated polymers with perfluorosulfonic acids in the side chains and a subsequent in-situ sol-gel condensation of the prepared triethoxylsilane-terminated fluorinated polymers with alkoxide precursors. The properties of the composite membranes have been studied as a function of the content and structure of the fillers. The proton conductivity of the prepared membranes increases steadily with the addition of small amounts of the polysilsesquioxane fillers. In particular, the sulfopropylated polysilsesquioxane based nanocomposites display proton conductivities greater than Nafion. This is attributed to the presence of pendant sulfonic acids in the fillers, which increases ion-exchange capacity and offers continuous proton transport channels between the fillers and the polymer matrix. The methanol permeability of the prepared membranes has also been examined. Lower methanol permeability and higher electrochemical selectivity than those of Nafion have been demonstrated in the polysilsesquioxane based nanocomposites.\nIn Chapter 3, the synthesis of a new class of ionic liquid-containing triblock copolymers with fluoropolymer mid-block and imidazolium methacrylate end-blocks is described for the first time. The synthetic strategy involves the preparation of the telechelic fluoropolymers using a functional benzoyl peroxide initiator as the macro-chain transfer agent for subsequent RAFT polymerization of the imidazolium methacrylate monomer. As revealed in DSC, SAXS and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) measurements, there was no microphase separation in the triblock copolymers, likely due to solubility of ionic liquid moieties in the fluoropolymer matrix. The anionic counterion has direct impact on the thermal properties, ionic conductivity and segmental dynamics of the polymers. The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity is well described by the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher model, suggesting that ion motion is closely coupled to segmental motion.\nIn Chapter 4 and 5, new solid electrolytes for lithium cations have been synthesized by catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction involving hydrogen atoms of polysiloxane and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) and double bonds of vinyl tris17-bromo-3,6,9,12,15-pentaoxaheptadecan-1-ol silane. The obtained structures are based on branched or dendritic with ionic liquid-ethylene oxide oligomer.

A relative density of around 99% was achieved in each material without a need of additives. \nFor a tungsten powder with an average particles size of 0.6 \u03bcm , a temperature of 2000oC with a pressure of 85 MPa and a 30 minute holding time was used to achieve 98.5% relative density. However, the sintered grain size was 33.3 \u03bcm, which is around 50 times that of the starting powder size. In order to reduce grain growth in the sintered material, sintering additives were introduced into the materials to reduce sintering temperature and inhibit grain growth.\nThe effects of ultrafine tungsten carbide (WC, particle size of 220 nm) and nano titanium carbide (TiC, particle size of 60 nm) additives on sintering, microstructure, and hardness of tungsten were studied. A noticeable enhancement in densification and reduction in grain growth were observed in the tungsten materials with the carbide additives. The relative density of around 99% was achieved in W-10vol.%WC and W-10vol.%TiC powders sintered at temperatures of 1700oC (85 MPa for 5 minutes) and 1800oC (75 MPa for 5 minutes), respectively. WC phase in W-WC materials was transformed into W2C at elevated temperatures (>1250oC), while TiC in W-TiC was decomposed partially with a formation of W2C during sintering, which agreed well with the phase diagrams. The W-W2C system exhibits eutectic reaction at the temperature around 2700oC, which is much lower than the melting point of W. The formation of the eutectic composition at the W-W2C interface increases a homologous temperature for sintering, leading to enhanced mass transport at the interfaces, which would contribute to the improved densification observed. Additionally, the solubility of W in TiC could promote densification by dissolution and precipitation processes of W through the TiC phase. The sintered grain sizes achieved were 4.8 \u03bcm for the sintered W-10vol.%WC, and less than 1 \u03bcm for the sintered W-10vol.%TiC, which are smaller than the sintered tungsten with equivalent relative density (33.3 \u03bcm), or sintered at the same sintering condition. It is expected that grain boundary migration was inhibited by the presence of the carbide phases along the grain boundary. Since TiC additive has a smaller size and higher thermal stability than WC additive, a more effective grain boundary pinning effect was observed in the W materials containing nanosized TiC additive.\nThe hardness values of the sintered materials was increased from 415 +/- 6 HV in pure tungsten to 500 +/- 8 HV in sintered W-10vol.%WC, and 1000 +/- 10 HV in sintered W-10vol.%TiC. The presence of hard carbide phases and smaller grain size, as observed in microstructure images and X-ray diffraction data, would be responsible for the increase in hardness values of both materials. Additionally in sintered W-TiC material, Ti and W could form a substitutional solid solution, which could further strengthen the material.\nSimilar results were observed in the sintering of tantalum. A relative density of around 99% was achieved at sintering temperatures between 1850oC and 2050oC, depending on the applied pressure (35, 55, and 75 MPa) at a holding time of 5 minutes. The applied pressure could enhance densification by initiating plastic deformation and diffusional creep. Although an almost fully dense tantalum material was obtained, the grain size was increased from 5 \u03bcm in the starting powder to more than 100 \u03bcm in the sintered material, leading to a need for a sintering additive to control grain growth.\nUltrafine WC and nanosized TiC at levels of 5 vol.% and 10 vol.% were investigated as an additive to improve densification and reduce grain growth in the sintering of tantalum. The relative density of around 99% was achieved at a lower sintering temperature, 1650oC (75 MPa and 5 minutes holding time), in both sintered Ta-10vol.%WC and Ta-10vol.%TiC materials, while the sintering temperature of 1850oC (75 MPa and 5 minutes holding time) was required for pure tantalum.  This densification improvement could be due to the solubility and reactivity between the carbides and the tantalum matrix, and the formation of eutectic compositions of the Ta-WC and Ta-TiC systems, having a melting point of around 2840oC, which is lower than the melting point of pure tantalum (2996oC). The grain sizes of the sintered tantalum with carbide additives were around 10 \u03bcm or below, which is much smaller than the pure tantalum sintered to the same relative density (>100 \u03bcm), or under the same conditions.\nIn this investigation, the sintered tantalum exhibits a relatively high oxygen content (~0.3 wt.%), which would originate from the starting powder, which contained around 0.4 wt.% of oxygen. As a result, the sintered tantalum materials showed a brittle fracture mechanism during bending tests. In contrast to the sintered Ta and Ta-WC materials, the sintered Ta-TiC underwent plastic deformation and exhibited ductile failure. The yield strength and fracture strength of the sintered Ta-10vol.%TiC were very high, 820 MPa and 1200 MPa, respectively, while the fracture strength of sintered Ta and Ta-10vol.%WC were 350 MPa and 450 MPa, respectively. It is suspected that the sintered Ta-10vol.%WC materials failed prematurely due to the presence of oxide phases. The ductility in the sintered Ta-TiC materials is expected to be a result from Ti atoms purifying the tantalum matrix by reducing tantalum oxide and taking away the solute oxygen. Traces of titanium oxide were observed in the sintered Ta-TiC materials.\nPure tungsten carbide powders with various particle sizes (0.2, 0.5, and 3 \u03bcm) were sintered to above 97% relative density for the 0.2 \u03bcm powder, and around 99% relative density for the 0.5 and 3 \u03bcm powders. The sintering temperature was 1500oC with the pressure of 65 MPa and the holding time up to 20 minutes. Limited grain growth (around 50% for 0.5 and 3 \u03bcm powder, and negligible for 0.2 \u03bcm powder) were observed in all three powders after sintering. The hardness values of the materials showed a trend according to Hall-Petch relation. The hardness values of 95.8 +/- 0.1, 94.6 +/- 0.1, and 90.0 +/- 0.3 HRA were obtained from the 0.2, 0.5, and 3 \u03bcm powder, respectively.\nWC-6wt.%Co with the average particle size of 4 \u03bcm were sintered to 99% relative density at 1250oC (30 MPa, for 5 minutes). The hardness obtained was 90.5 +/- 0.1 HRA. By adding the 0.2 \u03bcm pure WC powder at a level of 25 wt.% to the WC-6wt.%Co powder, the hardness was increased to 91.6 +/- 0.1 HRA, while fracture toughness remained at 14.5 MPa.m-0.5.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5929], "author_name_tesi": "Chanthapan, Sinthu ", "last_name_ssi": "Chanthapan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sinthu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jogender Singh", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni", "Gary Lynn Messing", "Douglas Edward Wolfe", "Todd Palmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jogender Singh, Dissertation Advisor", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni, Committee Member", "Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Member", "Douglas Edward Wolfe, Committee Member", "Todd Palmer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tungsten", "tantalum", "field", "assisted", "sintering", "TiC", "WC", "grain growth", "inhibition", "refractory", "metals", "nano", "submicron", "strengthening"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Surface Processing for Area Selective Mist Deposition of Nanocrystalline Quantum Dot Films", "id": "19856", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9495", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study explores surface engineering for the purpose of selective deposition of cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystalline quantum dot (NQD) thin films using the process of mist deposition.

We measured the calcite dissolution rates by using column experiments, which are packed with the same amount of calcite mass but different mineral distributed patterns in quartz-sand column (the mixed, 2-cylinder, 1-cylinmder column). The scale of each column is 2.65 cm in diameter and 10 cm in length. The mixed column has a homogeneously distributed calcite in the quartz column , and the 1-cylinder/2-cylinder column confines all the calcite particles within the middle cylindrical zone(s) that is parallel to the flow injection. We flushed the columns with acidic water at various flow velocities. Experimental data show the dissolution rate of calcite is approximately 1.6 to 2 times slower in the 1-cylinder column than in the mixed column, and the rates are about 1.6-2 orders of magnitude lower under the slowest flow velocity (0.31 m/day) compared to the fast flow velocity (m/day). Ratio (\u03b1) demonstrates the mineral spatial distributed effect playing an important role in column-scale rates. This is, the mineral spatial distributed effect is more significant under the conditions with fastest flow velocity and less homogeneously distributed reactive minerals (1-cylinder column). In the 1-cylinder column, the 2-D spatial profile modeling shows that the dissolution rates are larger by orders of magnitude at the calcite-quartz interface than the central region within the middle calcite-packed zone. Also, the range of dissolving calcite area at the calcite-quartz interface becomes wider with the increasing transverse dispersivity and under fast flow velocities. In contrast, transverse dispersivity does not affect local dissolution rates in the mixed column and all the calcite are dissolving. From those observations, we infer that transverse dispersivity caused by different mineral spatial distribution controls the mass transport in transverse direction. Two calculations in effective surface area are introduced to understand the above observations:(1) total surface area (AT), representing the total calcite surface area by assuming that all the calcite particles are dissolving; (2) effective surface area (Ae), which is the surface area of effectively dissolving calcite at the calcite-quartz interface and inlet. Column-scale bulk rates (mol/s) increase with the increasing Ae values while remain irrelevant to AT values. Also, the Ae values increases with the increasing flow velocities. This suggests that the different measures in the surface area and flow velocities can be the possibilities causing the discrepancies between field and laboratorial measure rates. This work provides the way to minimize the discrepancies in order to approach the calcite dissolution rate under natural subsurface conditions. The surface area of dissolving calcite at the interface of calcite and other non-reactive minerals needs be measured first, and then the rate constant (mol/m2/s) obtained in laboratory work can be used to infer the real rates. The results from this work also compare with the literature (L. Li, Salehikhoo et al., 2013), which applied the same experimental sets but used magnesite as their reactive mineral. The both cases have the similar conclusions about the effect of mineral spatial distribution. This work systematically quantifies the impact of mineral spatial heterogeneities on dissolutions using both experimental and modeling approach.

Two methods are presented in this collection of\nstudies: 1) NOx reduction accomplished through a change in fuel formulation,\nspecifically through a change in the saturated fuel carbon chains of biodiesel; and 2) NOx\nreduction accomplished through a mixed mode combustion process utilizing a fumigated\nfuel and a pilot injection of diesel fuel.\nIn the first study, a light duty diesel engine was used to investigate the change in\nsaturation of a biodiesel fuel and its impact on NOx emissions. Previous studies have\nshown that a reduction in the iodine value of a biodiesel fuel produces a reduction in NOx\nemissions. The iodine value of the fuel is reduced through the saturation of the C18\nmolecules via hydrogenation of biodiesel fuel. Experiments were performed at several\nspeeds and loads without exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and a NOx reduction with the\nhydrogenated diesel fuel was observed. For all the modes studied, the NOx emission was\nhigher for the biodiesel and lower for the hydrogenated biodiesel in comparison to the\nultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel. Results from the calculation of the adiabatic flame\ntemperature shows that the results could be explained by the difference in adiabatic flame\ntemperature of the fuel, thus influencing the prompt NOx contribution in addition to the\nthermal contribution. Since the adiabatic flame temperatures are similar for the\nhydrogenated biodiesel and the ULSD, yet the NOx reduction with the hydrogenated\nbiodiesel is much lower than the USLD levels, another explanation for the reduction is\nsuggested: the additional prompt NOx contribution from the change in fuel chemistry.\nThe second study investigated the NOx reductions which could be achieved with\na mixed mode combustion process utilizing a fumigated fuel and a pilot injection of\ndiesel fuel. In this research, the fumigated fuel was dimethyl ether (DME) and\nDME/Methane blends, while the pilot injection fuel was ULSD. Several sets of\nexperiments were performed to study the ignition of the fumigated fuel, and its impact on\nthe NOx emissions. In the first set of experiments, the DME concentration was spanned\nover a range of 15 to 44% energy equivalent of the total fuel requirement. An\napproximately 20% reduction in NOx emissions was observed up to 35% DME energy\nequivalent. As the energy equivalent increased above 35%, the NOx emissions began to\nincrease with the increase in the peak of the high temperature heat release (HTHR).\nWhile the NOx emissions decreased, there was also a significant shift in the NO to NO2\nconversion for all DME fumigation test conditions in comparison to the baseline diesel\ncases. For 25% DME energy equivalent, the injection timing of the pilot diesel was\nretarded and a reduction in the NOx emissions was observed. The low temperature heat\nrelease (LTHR) and the HTHR remained constant in magnitude and timing while the\ninjection timing of the pilot diesel was retarded. The peak pressure for the premixed and\ndiffusion portions merged, with increasing premixed DME combustion. With retarded\ninjection timing, NOx reduction occurred as a result of the decrease in the bulk cylinder\ntemperature and in the combustion duration before cylinder quenching from the exhaust\nstroke. In the second set of experiments, the intake air temperature was increased to\nstudy the impact on NOx and the mixed mode combustion process. While the amount of\nDME residual in the exhaust decreased along with the total hydrocarbon and CO\nemissions, the NOx emissions increased with increasing bulk cylinder temperature. For\nthe speed and load used in this experiment, there was enough fuel and compression to\ncombust most of the fuel, yet not enough to complete the combustion of the unburned\nhydrocarbons and CO. While air heating shifted the stoichiometry of the fuel and air\nmixture by reducing the density of air, the heating led to increased NOx with reduction in\nthe NO to NO2 conversion. This may indicate that the system was above the low\ntemperature range for this conversion to occur. In the third set of experiments, a small\namount of Methane was introduced into the system to study the impact on the cetane\nnumber of the fumigated fuel. On a brake specific power basis, the Methane addition\nreduced the NOx emissions more than with only DME, however the NO to NO2\nconversion was lower. NOx emissions were further reduced by retarding the injection\ntiming, but increased with increasing intake air temperature. Through the use of the\nintake air heating, it was observed that the ignition of the DME/Methane blend was\nadvanced with a smaller LTHR and a higher HTHR. While NOx emissions increased\nwith the increase in bulk cylinder temperature, only the NO emissions increased while\nNO2 remained constant. Gaseous emissions analysis showed that the heating caused\ngreater conversion of the Methane and DME during combustion.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1797], "author_name_tesi": "Chapman, Elana M.", "last_name_ssi": "Chapman", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Elana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Fuel Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Alan W Scaroni", "Angela Lueking", "Thomas Litzinger", "Daniel Connell Haworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Chair", "Alan W Scaroni, Committee Member", "Angela Lueking, Committee Member", "Thomas Litzinger, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["NOx", "oxides of nitrogen", "compression ignition engines", "biodiesel", "DME", "dimethyl ether", "diesel", "alternative fuels"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Boethian Music in Thomas of Britain, Dante, Chaucer, Spenser, and their Contemporaries, c. 1200-1600", "id": "23662", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10685", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Drawing upon the close relationship between the medieval arts of rhetoric and music, this study of medieval and early modern literary texts investigates the ways in which music theory, particularly that of Boethius, is a structural presence in writings that are seemingly non-musical\u2014texts that have no accompanying music and do not take music as their main subject matter. An influential intellectual figure for some thousand years after his death, Boethius (d. 524 CE), who is probably now best known for his allegorical dialogue \"De consolatione philosophiae\" (\"The Consolation of Philosophy\"), also set forth an influential theory of music in his treatise \"De institutione musica\" (\"The Fundamentals of Music\"). Boethian music has often been studied, but the ways in which major medieval and early modern writers incorporated it into non-musical texts have been largely overlooked. \n\nExamining the structural application of medieval music theory and performance practices in major and less-studied literary works from England, France, and Italy, I argue that these works demonstrate what I term a \u201cliterary aesthetic of 'musica'\u201d that structurally integrates music theories, philosophies, forms, images, and performance practices. For example, in Thomas of Britain\u2019s \"Tristan,\" music emphasizes the complications of Iseult\u2019s characterization. In Dante\u2019s \"Commedia,\" music progressively emulates the souls\u2019 purgation in \"Purgatorio\" and delineates the organization of \"Paradiso.\" In the tales of Chaucer\u2019s Knight and Miller, a shared six-part musical structure, hitherto unnoticed, provides an additional link between these two narratives. This aesthetic persists in early modern works as well. In the anonymous \"Le Chevalier du Papegau,\" the 1589 Medici \"intermedi,\" and Spenser\u2019s \"The Faerie Queene,\" aspects of music are incorporated to characterize political authority and the functions of authorship and literary reception.\n\nThese medieval and early modern examples of the afterlife of Boethian music theory illustrate a persistent interest in the interactions between rhetoric, music, and literature. They also foreground additional ways in which Chaucer and Spenser, as major early period British writers, share an intellectual context with their European forebears and contemporaries. Music here supports literary characteristics such as paradox, textual interpretation, authorship, and concerns for the promotion of social order.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10316], "author_name_tesi": "Chapman, Juliana Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Chapman", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Juliana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Caroline Davis Eckhardt", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt", "Robert R Edwards", "Norris Joiner Lacy", "Scott Thompson Smith", "Marica Susan Tacconi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Caroline Davis Eckhardt, Dissertation Advisor", "Caroline Davis Eckhardt, Committee Chair", "Robert R Edwards, Committee Member", "Norris Joiner Lacy, Committee Member", "Scott Thompson Smith, Committee Member", "Marica Susan Tacconi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aesthetics", "medieval", "Chaucer", "Dante", "Spenser", "music", "Boethius"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PLANNING A COORDINATED SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS: COTTON-TOP TAMARINS (SAGUINUS OEDIPUS) STICK TO THE PLAN \n\n\n", "id": "10642", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3499", "abstract_tesi": "Cotton-top tamarins have demonstrated sophisticated anticipatory motor planning when performing a single grasp (Weiss, Wark & Rosenbaum, 2007).

The four experiments presented in this thesis were designed to address the degrees of freedom problem by seeking to identify the constraints that are brought to bear in object manipulation tasks. I investigated constraints at the cognitive level of the action selection system, specifically considering constraints related to the goals and intentions of the actor. In addition to identifying the relevant constraints in object manipulation, I also sought to determine whether the relative priority of the identified constraints was consistent, or instead shifted based on the demands of each task. \n\t\nI conducted a series of bimanual rotation experiments to address these questions. In Experiment 1, I found that participants tended to complete rotations that allowed them to end with comfortable postures on the handles. This tendency to end comfortably was more important than the tendency to start the rotation in a comfortable posture or the preference to pronate in rotation. I also found that it was more important for participants to pronate in rotation than to start the rotation in comfortable postures. Experiment 1\u2019s results also revealed that participants rotated the disks in symmetry on the majority of trials, both for sequential rotation and simultaneous rotation. This suggested that ending comfortably and rotating symmetrically were both very important constraints in action selection for this task. \n\nExperiments 2 and 3 were designed to determine the relative priority of two important constraints: the preference to end in a comfortable posture and the preference to rotate in symmetry. The results of Experiments 2 and 3 revealed that both constraints were very important in bimanual rotation. I found that when it was possible to satisfy both constraints without incurring a high cost (in the form of adopting an extreme initial grasping posture), participants selected actions that allowed them to both end comfortably and rotate symmetrically. However, on trials in which satisfying both constraints concurrently did incur a high cost (extreme grasping postures), participants tended to satisfy one of the two constraints, but not both. Whether they prioritized ending comfortably or moving symmetrically critically depended on whether they rotated their hands simultaneously or sequentially. Overall, the results of Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that both end-state comfort and symmetry were very important constraints in action selection for bimanual rotation. In addition, the action selection system was critically flexible and sensitive to the demands of the task on a trial-by-trial basis. \n\nThe final experiment extended the results of Experiments 2 and 3 by investigating the role of extreme postural rotation in the perceived comfort of a bimanual posture. The results of Experiment 4 demonstrated that bimanual postures including at least one extreme grasp were much less comfortable than other postures without extreme rotation. In addition, I found that the less comfortable grasp in the pair of postures had a much larger influence on the overall comfort rating than the more comfortable grasp. These findings provide support for my interpretation of Experiment 2 and 3\u2019s results. Overall, participants preferred to both end comfortably and rotate symmetrically, but were not willing to satisfy both constraints if it required an extreme rotation of one or more hands. Participants aimed to concurrently satisfy multiple important constraints with each action but evaluated the cost of each strategy for each task.

The keratinocytes of the basal layer of the epithelium harbor a reservoir of replicating viral genomes.  The processes of the HPV life cycle depend on elements in the viral genome that are regulated by host cell specific factors and therefore, ideally, analyses of viral transcription and replication should be carried out in primary keratinocytes. However, these studies are limited by the current cell culture and transfection methods. Improvements in the transfection and culture of keratinocytes will enable more sensitive, accurate and earlier analyses of viral replication and transcription. To test this we developed an optimized keratinocyte culture system using a Rho-Kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y-27632, that greatly improved the growth rate of primary keratinocytes and immortalized these cells.  Further analysis revealed that the immortalized keratinocytes appeared to retain important characteristic of primary keratinocytes important for HPV research.  Transient HPV replication analysis was enhanced in Y-27632-treated keratinocytes, presumably due to improved transfection efficiency and survival of transfected cells.  Thus, improvements in primary cell culture and survival after transfection vastly improve the study of the establishment of HPV gene expression and replication. This allowed us to develop a complementation assay to study elements important for viral DNA replication.  Using the complementation assay and the Y-27632 treated cells we were able to confirm the significance of the three E2 binding sites most proximal to the E6 promoter for transient replication.  Finally, we designed immortalization assays using complete HPV genomes with targeted mutations to confirm that the information amassed from reporter assays holds up in more physiologically relevant systems.   We were able to demonstrate that the TATA box, the Sp1 site, and the Ap1 site proximal to the E6 promoter, but not the distal Ap1 site, were dispensable for E6 and E7 expression.  Collectively, these studies shed light on the significance of previously identified regulatory elements in the HPV life cycle as well as offer new strategies for future HPV life cycle studies.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5555], "author_name_tesi": "Chapman, Sandra Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Chapman", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Sandra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Matthew Meyers", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "Alison Mc Bride", "Diane M Thiboutot", "Jianming Hu", "Neil David Christensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig Matthew Meyers, Dissertation Advisor", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Chair", "Alison Mc Bride, Committee Chair", "Diane M Thiboutot, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transcription", "papillomaviruses", "keratinocyte", "immortalization", "differentiation", "replication"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "IMAGE ENHANCEMENT USING SGW SUPERRESOLUTION AND ITERATIVE BLIND DECONVOLUTION", "id": "6723", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4006", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The field of superresolution has seen a tremendous growth in interest over the past\ndecade. High resolution images are crucial in several applications including medical\nimaging and diagnosis, military surveillance, satellite and astronomical imaging, and\nremote sensing.

They have been used in fields\nranging from the solution of partial differential equations to mesh refinement and modeling in computer graphics. Two prominent properties of second generation wavelets,\nviz. the ability to handle irregular sampling structures and the adaptation to arbitrary\nboundaries, which are at the heart of image sequence superresolution, motivated this\nresearch on superresolution algorithms based on second generation wavelets.

Analysis leading to the selection of a threshold\nthat yields an optimal trade-off between noise reduction and blur introduction due to thresholding is subsequently presented.

The study included the farmers\u2019 perceptions of the communication effectiveness and efficiency. The variables studied were type and content of information, method of communication, and training which farmers received during 2009. \nThe study was a first attempt to identify the current communication links between the Department of Agriculture in Cyprus and the Cypriot farmers and to suggest ways to improve communication both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. This study provides an opportunity to assess the methods and practices that the officers in the Department of Agriculture in Cyprus use to communicate with the people they serve, the farmers. By identifying possible strengths, weaknesses and problems in communication, this study aims to strengthen the Extension Service of the Department of Agriculture. This study also invites ideas and suggestions from farmers regarding how they believe the communication between the Department of Agriculture and themselves can be improved.\nThe study used a descriptive survey research methodology. The study was organized into three phases and two interview schedules were developed to collect the data. During phase one, preliminary information was gathered by the researcher to determine broad parameters for questions to be developed for use in phase two of the study. For phase two, an interview schedule was used to gather information from key personnel representing producer organizations in Cyprus. Information gathered during phase two was utilized to develop an interview schedule for phase three. In phase three, data were collected from a stratified random sample of 225 Cypriot farmers. A total of 124 farmers were interviewed during phase three of the study, resulting in a 55% response rate.\nA large number of the farmers participating in the research indicated that they did not receive information or training from the Department of Agriculture during 2009; several farmers reported, however, that they receive information and training from other sources. When the communication methods were analyzed, the farmers indicated that they prefer written materials to be sent to them (such as leaflets in the mail, specialized newsletters, and the \u201cfarmer\u201d magazine).

In 1982, Guiver and Bose showed how primitive factorization of bivariate matrices can be implemented via computations only in the ground field, i.e., an extension field is not required. Since then several publications in the area emerged, including, most recently, the papers of Park-Kalker-Vetterli, Fornasini-Valcher, and Lin. The tests for multivariate polynomial matrix zero coprimeness and minor coprimeness are implemented algorithmically while progress towards the difficult problem of multivariate matrix factor extraction is also reported. The multivariate polynomial matrix factorization algorithm when some conditions are satisfied is developed. Some remarks and limitations of the algorithm are also reported.\n\nThe multivariate polynomial matrix factorization algorithm developed is applied to the multidimensional filter bank design problem. This algorithm and another algorithm for computing a globally minimal generating matrix of the syzygy of solutions associated with a polynomial matrix are both associated with a zero coprimeness constraint that characterizes perfect reconstruction filter banks. Generalizations as well as limitations of recent results which incorporate the perfect  reconstruction as well as the linear phase constraints are discussed with several examples and counterexamples. Specifically, a Groebner basis-based proof for perfect reconstruction with linear phase is given for the case of two-band multidimensional filter banks and the algorithm is illustrated by a nontrivial design example. This detailed design example and simulation results are based on an embedded zerotree wavelet encoding algorithm. Progress and bottlenecks in the multidimensional multiband case are also reported.\n\nThe Groebner basis theory is then applied to the minimax controller design using rate feedback, which was initiated by Bucy-Namiri-Velman in 1990. The complete analytic characterization and solution construction for this problem is given when the plant consists of a known fixed set of coupled oscillators of cardinality three (or order six). The case when the plant order is eight is also considered based on the use of Groebner bases. The results are given in the compact triangular form of polynomial equations so that the numerical solutions are readily computed by simple recursive substitution of the values of variables, already computed.

Treatment of the residual hardware device infections usually involves lengthy and painful procedures. Antibiotic resistance developed by the pathogens over time is another concern. It has become essential to search for alternative antibacterial treatments to mitigate the effect of these infections. Some of the transition metals of group 11 to 14 of the Periodic Table have been investigated for their antibacterial efficacy and the bacterial resistance, and in particular silver ions have been identified as the most effective antibacterial agent. However there is no established delivery system reported which can ensure the delivery of silver ions to the site of infections associated with implanted devices. \n\nThis study examines an engineered system using silver ions to create an antibiotic environment that can significantly reduce RHD associated infections. The key is to continually generate silver ions in local concentrations allowed inside the human body so that long-term microbial control can be achieved. A brief review of residual hardware device infections, the use of antibiotic silver ions, and the concept behind such a system is followed by a summary of the in-vitro tests, exploring the design constraints and working of the proposed system. The performance metric of the system and the variables affecting it have been identified for the prophylactic action of silver ions system. An experimental design is also presented to evaluate the parameter space of the variables affecting the performance of the system. \n\t\nThe Kirby-Bauer agar gel diffusion techniques were used to evaluate the bactericidal efficacy of the silver ions system against S. aureus bacteria. In addition, the issues of current and ionic concentrations were studied including device amperage, surface area of cathode and anode, as well as the separation distance between anode and cathode. Anodic devices performed better and the current in the system and the surface are of the anode were identified as most important variables affecting the device performance. This new system allowed ionized silver to travel through media containing microbes, thus attacking the bacteria directly. The system tested demonstrated an unparalleled inhibition of the growth of microbes. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1218], "author_name_tesi": "Charumani, Charumani ", "last_name_ssi": "Charumani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Charumani", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Allen Wysk", "Richard Allen Wysk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Allen Wysk, Thesis Advisor", "Richard Allen Wysk, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ELECTRICALLY ACTIVATED METALS", "ANTIBACTERIAL", "DESIGN PARAMETERS"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Reinvention of Honors Programs in American Higher Education, 1955-1965", "id": "8831", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3151", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A wave of interest in honors programs occurred at American colleges and universities in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

The first takes a narrower view and makes use of merger and acquisition activity to assess governance faced by individual firms, while the second takes a broader view and investigates how labor market frictions impact overall merger and acquisition activity.\nThe first essay examines how serving as trustee of a sponsor firm\u2019s 401(k) assets alters the incentives of mutual fund companies to monitor firm behavior. The author uses the M&A decisions of firms to reveal the governance effort of mutual fund families serving as trustee. Over a sample of acquisitions announced between 1999-2013, the evidence presented shows that firms with mutual fund family trustees undertake lower quality mergers at higher frequencies.  These firms are more likely to select private or diversifying targets, to pay with cash, and to complete the mergers they announce.  This evidence suggests mutual fund families decrease their monitoring of retirement asset client firms. \nIn the second essay, which is joint work with Matthew Gustafson and Adam Welker, the authors provide evidence on the nuanced effect of firing costs on U.S. M&A activity. Following the adoption of state laws that increase firing costs, there is an immediate increase in withdrawn deals and an immediate and persistent 30% reduction in M&A dollar volume, suggesting that post-merger employee turnover is a first-order source of value for large U.S. mergers. In contrast, small firms respond to firing costs by using the M&A market to reorganize into larger entities. There is no decline in small M&As. Instead, small M&As increase over time as average M&A size and the number of small firms decline.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15113], "author_name_tesi": "Chatt, Robert R", "last_name_ssi": "Chatt", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter G Iliev", "Peter G Iliev", "Laura C Field", "Matthew Todd Lange Gustafson", "Karl A Muller III", "George David Haushalter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter G Iliev, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter G Iliev, Committee Chair", "Laura C Field, Committee Member", "Matthew Todd Lange Gustafson, Committee Member", "Karl A Muller III, Outside Member", "George David Haushalter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mergers and Acquisitions", "Retirement Asset Management", "Business Connections", "Firing Frictions"]}]
