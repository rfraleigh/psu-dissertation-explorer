This no-till cropping system consists of two diverse six-year crop rotations designed to produce all of the feed, forage, and fuel needed to sustain a 65-cow dairy herd. This thesis project focused on managing weeds in these diverse, reduced-tillage rotations, with less herbicide. The first study compared using integrated weed management tactics to control weeds. Weed management comparisons include a \u201cStandard Herbicide\u201d (SH) and \u201cReduced Herbicide\u201d (RH) approach to control weeds in no-till corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) crop rotation. The SH treatment employs a standard herbicide-based program, while the RH treatment uses less total herbicide by incorporating rolling cover crops, banded herbicides over the crop row followed by high-residue inter-row cultivation, and planting companion crops. Weed density and biomass were often greater under RH management, but weed biomass never exceeded 19 g m-2 in corn and 21 g m-2 in soybean. Corn yield and population did not differ in any year, and experimental net financial returns to management were $90.42 ha-1 higher in RH corn due to lower herbicide costs and slightly not significantly higher average yield. Soybean yield was greater in SH in two of three years, but in both of these years, SH was replanted due to poor early establishment and RH was not replanted. In 2012, soybean population was lower in RH and population trends correlated with yield in both treatments.  Greater rye cover crop biomass and delayed planting, failure of planting slits to close, slug pressure and wider row spacing may have all contributed to the lower yield in RH. RH management met NRCS national no-till standards for a 2% slope, but predicted soil loss was greater under RH than SH management due to two high-residue cultivation events that occur in RH only.  Herbicide active ingredient use was reduced by 48% in corn in the RH vs. SH management and 12% in RH vs. SH soybean.\n\nWhile designed as a comparison between green manure crops, the second study compared planting red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) with hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) between winter wheat and corn silage.  Red clover was drilled in one half of the wheat plots in early spring of each year (RC treatment); hairy vetch was planted in the other half (HV treatment) 4 to 6 weeks following wheat harvest. Triticale (x Triticosecale) was added to HV beginning in 2011.  Weeds were sampled: i) in wheat, ii) after wheat harvest, but before hairy vetch seeding, iii) before green manure termination, and iv) in corn.  Herbicide active ingredient was reduced by 40% in the RC system as compared with HV. Weed control was often similar in wheat and corn between the green manure systems, but in 2012 wheat and corn yield were greater in RC. Corn yield was likely reduced in the HV due to population differences in 2012 that resulted from early season pest pressure. Because red clover can be harvested as forage, RC resulted in greater net financial returns to management by $1,399.67 ha-1, though harvesting forage requires some additional labor. A second study in 2012 evaluated weed control and yield of corn grown after the green manures compared to no cover crop. Weed biomass before corn planting was greater where there was no green manure, but weed biomass late summer was greater when hairy vetch-triticale residue was present as compared with having no residue. Population in corn after hairy vetch-triticale was lower than after no cover crop, most likely due to increased pest pressure where green manure residue was present. While the green manure residues did not always provide greater weed suppression during corn, and in fact may have stimulated weed seed germination later in the season, yields were still better following both cover crops, most likely because of soil moisture retained by cover crop residue and/or nitrogen from the residue.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8537], "author_name_tesi": "Snyder, Elina Miriam", "last_name_ssi": "Snyder", "middle_name_ssi": "Miriam", "first_name_ssi": "Elina", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Heather D Karsten", "William Curran", "Sjoerd Willem Duiker", "Jeffrey Hyde"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Heather D Karsten, Thesis Advisor", "William Curran, Thesis Advisor", "Sjoerd Willem Duiker, Thesis Advisor", "Jeffrey Hyde, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["no-till", "herbicide banding", "high-residue cultivation", "corn", "soybean", "cover crops", "cereal rye", "red clover", "hairy vetch", "cropping systems"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Optimization and Hardware Acceleration of Consensus-based Matching and Tracking", "id": "25036", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11273", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Image and video understanding has become an increasingly valuable capability for many emerging applications such as smart retail, intelligent surveillance, and autonomous robotic systems.   The critical barrier to enabling these applications is the high execution latencies of complex vision tasks that make real-time system constraints difficult, or impossible, to achieve.   One specific instance of a complex vision task is object tracking, which is the focus of this thesis.  Object tracking is a necessary component of grocery shopping assistance applications that track a grocery item and a person\u2019s hand and guides the hand to the item to pick it up.  Although there are many object tracking algorithms to choose from, this work investigates the performance bottlenecks and optimizations of the Consensus-based Matching and Tracking, CMT, algorithm.  To circumvent the limitations of standard optical-flow based trackers, CMT uses a descriptor matching step to redetect an object\u2019s key features that would be permanently lost in the standard approach.  This allows for an object to be hidden or occluded from view and redetected once it reappears in the view of the camera.  \n     For fully autonomous systems, in which re-initialization of a failed object track may not be possible or prohibitively costly, robustness of the tracker is of critical importance.  As such, this work introduces, an enhanced version of the CMT algorithm that exhibits improvements in accuracy and robustness as evaluated against a standardized benchmark.  The improvement in accuracy and robustness of the enhanced CMT comes at the cost of a significant increase in computational latency.   Accordingly, this work also proposes a hybrid system that integrates high-performance custom hardware accelerators with a traditional processor to alleviate these new performance bottlenecks and to support real-time throughput.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10813], "author_name_tesi": "Snyder, Joshua Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Snyder", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hardware acceleration", "object tracking", "FPGA", "CMT", "hardware architecture", "vision system", "computer vision"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Reconnecting with Your Passion:  An Action Research Study Exploring Humanities and Professional Nursing", "id": "14460", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7128", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe purpose of this action research study was two-fold.  The first purpose was to examine the process of how nurses engaged in a professional development program that drew upon reading and creative writing related to their lives and work as nurses. Secondly, this study examined the nurses\u2019 perspectives on how their involvement in the process and professional development program related to changes in their personal and professional lives. Transformative learning theory provided the theoretical framework for the study which considered the views of nurses regarding the use of reading and writing strategies.  The action research study involved eleven registered nurses from a variety of practice specialties and levels of career satisfaction who were enrolled in an eight session professional development program.  The findings of this study were based upon the data collected from pre and post participation semi structured interviews, field notes, journal entries and creative writing pieces completed throughout the program.  \nThe findings of the study were focused on three key areas including the nurses\u2019 views of reading, writing and group work, the most useful reading and writing strategies used to assist nurses in reconnecting with their professional values and ideals, and the influences of participation in this action research study on the nurses\u2019 career satisfaction and well-being.  The findings suggest that specific humanities based strategies can effectively assist nurses in identifying their core professional values and ideals while also helping to improve career satisfaction and well-being.

In particular, the research focused on the process of building domain ontologies for IS modeling. \n\nThe motivation behind the research was the fact that researchers have not yet produced comprehensive guidelines for building ontologies for IS. A recent survey reported that 60% of the respondents did not use any methodology to build their ontologies. Ontology engineering is still considered an art, rather than and engineering activity. The results of our preliminary research on building an ontology for a given domain revealed four important issues related to Ontology-Driven Information Systems. These issues are related to metamodels, procedural knowledge, temporal relations and knowledge acquisition.\n\nBased on these concerns, we set up a research to investigate existing methodologies that could provide principled guidelines to build ontologies and to overcome the issues raised in the preliminary study. We searched major bibliographic databases from which we selected 30 methodologies to investigate. The analysis of the methodologies was formulated around the core components of an ontology and the four issues raised in our preliminary research. We also discussed the methodological features that are relevant to the process of building ontologies for Information Systems.\nOur final results confirmed the four issues among the methodologies analyzed. Besides, axiomatization has emerged as another important issue for Ontology-Driven Information Systems. Moreover, the frequent use of scenarios in the initial steps of the methodologies motivated us to further investigate their use in building ontologies. We proposed to use the components of a scenario as the ontological constructs of a metamodel ontology. To illustrate the use of scenarios in the building of domain ontologies, we developed a proof-of-concept experiment. The experiment successfully showed that a scenario-based approach can help acquiring and representing relevant domain knowledge to be used in IS modeling, and can be used to improve the methodologies used to build ontologies.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [439], "author_name_tesi": "Soares, Andrey ", "last_name_ssi": "Soares", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Andrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Frederico T Fonseca", "Frederico T Fonseca", "Mary Beth Rosson", "David J Hall", "Timothy William Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Frederico T Fonseca, Dissertation Advisor", "Frederico T Fonseca, Committee Chair", "Mary Beth Rosson, Committee Member", "David J Hall, Committee Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ontology-Driven Information Systems", "Ontology", "Information Systems", "Methodologies", "Scenarios"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Role of Mineral Transformation due to CO2 Sequestration on the Shear Behavior of Reservoir Rock", "id": "13351fus145", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13351", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The sequestration of CO2 in subsurface formations is one feasible solution to mitigate the effects of climate change. The long-term effects of CO2-water-rock interactions are one of the important related issues in CO2 sequestration since it may have an effect of fault reactivation. Reactivation may, in turn, result in the leakage of CO2 into overlaying geological formations that contain groundwater aquifers or in triggering earthquakes in regions that had not previously experienced earthquakes. This work numerically simulates direct shear tests of reservoir rock analogs in various stages of alteration from permeation by CO2 over geologic timescales. Reservoir rock characteristics were assigned based on the Crystal Geyser site in Utah. Two different compositional end-members of the rock are used, related to unaltered and fully-altered materials. Frictional behavior of these end-member digital rocks is explored through granular mechanics modeling using the distinct element method (DEM). A linear contact model was applied to model the contact forces. A parametric study was conducted on the effect of confining stress and friction coefficient of walls on the model on the resulting predictions of friction coefficient. Confining stress was changed over the range of 10 to 50 MPa. The friction coefficient of the walls was also changed over the range of 0.2 to 0.8. There is direct effect of different friction coefficient of walls on the peak friction coefficient reservoir rock, but there is no clear effect of different friction coefficient of walls on the stable friction coefficient.

The present work is comprised of two main phases. First, the experimental phase is concerned with the study of the electronic structure of negatively charged metal clusters through photodetachment and photoelectron imaging. Second, the theoretical phase is devoted to the investigation of the properties of a particularly stable class of transition-metal carbide clusters known as the Met-Cars. \n\tThe design and implementation of a new velocity-map photoelectron imaging spectrometer for mass-selected negative ions are discussed in detail in the experimental setup. The photoelectron imaging technique has proved to be of great value in investigating the electronic structure of cluster anions in the gas-phase. Among the major advantages of the imaging technique over regular photoelectron spectroscopy techniques is the direct determination of the angular momentum distributions of the electrons and thus the partial-wave function composition of the orbitals through which the detachment occurs. The experimental study is mainly comprised of the photoelectron imaging investigations of noble-metal ions attached to multiple ligands, metal ions solvated in small ammonia clusters and bimetallic clusters.       \nThe results of photoelectron imaging experiments of Cu and Ag mono- and diamine anions are reported. The photoelectron images were recorded at two photon energies, 800 and 527 nm. The vertical detachment energies of CuNH2- and AgNH2- are lower than those of the respective atomic metal ion and are measured to be 1.11\u00a1\u00c00.05 and 1.23\u00a1\u00c00.05 eV, respectively. By contrast, the electron detachment energies for Cu(NH2)2- and Ag(NH2)2- are higher than those of the corresponding metal ion and are determined to be 1.48\u00a1\u00c00.05 and 1.85\u00a1\u00c00.05 eV, respectively. Energy-dependent photoelectron anisotropy parameters are also reported. The photodetachment of the Cu and Ag mono- and diamine anions exhibit a cos2 \u00a6\u00c8 angular dependence relative to the direction of the laser polarization. The nature of the chemical bonding and the symmetry of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) are discussed in relevance to the measured anisotropy parameters. \nPhotoelectron imaging study of bismuth and lead metal ions associated with small ammonia clusters is presented as an example of solvated metal-ion systems. The clusters show similar electronic transitions to the metal-ion chromophore; however, the spectral features are shifted towards the higher electron binding energy as expected in the case of solvation. The remarkable feature in the photoelectron images of the solvated clusters is the significant change of the angular distributions of the electronic bands compared to those of the respective metal ion. The stronger binding between the solvent molecules and the core metal ion in the case of solvated lead anions results in changes in the character of the highest occupied molecular orbital of the metal-ion, which correspondingly affects the angular distributions of the observed electronic bands.\nMain-group metal clusters are of wide interest from both fundamental and technological aspects. The results of photoelectron imaging experiments on small semiconductor-like clusters of gallium and bismuth, groups (III, V) elements, are presented. Also, the results of photoelectron imaging of small Pbn- clusters n\u00a1\u00dc4 are reported for the first time.\nThe theoretical phase of this work is concerned with the investigating of the atomic structure, electronic, magnetic and vibrational properties of the different Ti8C12 metallocarbohedryne clusters. The density-functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed with the all-electron projector augmented-wave method and generalized gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation functional. The seven low-energy isomers of the Ti8C12 metallocarbohedrynes are studied using spin-polarized DFT, where a correlation is found to exist between the number of rotated carbon dimers and the cohesive energy of the structure. The electronic density of states (eDOS) show that C3v, D*3d, and D3d isomers are spin polarized. The partial eDOS shows that, depending on the dimer orientation, carbon atoms and a subgroup of the metal atoms form a covalent framework while other metal atoms are bonded to this framework more ionically. This picture is further supported by the charge density of the different structures, where the Ti atoms with higher charge density show less contribution to the covalent bonding of the Ti-C framework. The vibrational spectra of the different structures are calculated using the frozen-vibration method. Also, the vibrational spectra of the C3v and C2v structures are calculated using molecular-dynamics simulations at two different temperatures. The results of the simulations demonstrate the local stability of the structures beyond the harmonic limit explored by the frozen-vibration method. \n\tThe other part of the theoretical studies is an investigation for the effect of the substitution of transition-metal atoms on the reactivity of the resulting metallocarbohedryne cluster. The substitution of two Ti atoms with other transition-metals with fewer valence electrons as Scandium or Yttrium results in more stable metallocarbohedryne clusters with less chemical reactivity. This is clearly seen from the electronic density of states of the substituted metallocarbohedrynes compared to those of the ground state Ti8C12 cluster of the C3v symmetry. These preliminary results can be regarded as a stepping stone for the formation of an extended lattice from the metallocarbohedryne clusters.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3966], "author_name_tesi": "Sobhy, Mohamed Abdelmaboud", "last_name_ssi": "Sobhy", "middle_name_ssi": "Abdelmaboud", "first_name_ssi": "Mohamed", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "James Bernhard Anderson", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Robert John Santoro", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Chair", "James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metallocarbohedrynes", "photoelectron spectroscopy", "photoelectron imaging", "cluster anions"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "TEACHERS\u2019 PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR TEACHING STYLE DEVELOPMENT IN ONE-TO-ONE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS", "id": "7769", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "779", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the current trends in education is one-to-one computing or \u201cubiquitous computing\u201d.

Two methods may be used for estimating the TVAR parameters: the adaptive algorithm approach and the basis function approach.  Adaptive algorithms, such as the least mean square (LMS) and the recursive least square (RLS), use a dynamic model for adapting the TVAR parameters and are capable of tracking time-varying frequency, provided that the variation is slow.  It is observed that, if the signals have a single time-frequency component, the RLS with a fixed pole on the unit circle yields the fastest convergence.  The basis function method employs an explicit model for the TVAR parameter variation, and model parameters are estimated via a block calculation.   We proposed a modification to the basis function method by utilizing both forward and backward predictors for estimating the time-varying spectral density of nonstationary signals.  It is shown that our approach yields better accuracy than the existing basis function approach, which uses only the forward predictor.  The selection of the basis functions and limitations are also discussed in this thesis.  Finally, the proposed approach is applied to analyze violin vibrato.  Our results showed superior frequency resolution and spectral line smoothness using the proposed approach, compared to conventional analysis with the short time Fourier transform (STFT) whose frequency resolution is very limited.  It was also found that frequency modulation of vibrato occurs at the rate of 6 Hz, and the frequency variations for each partial are different and increase nonlinearly with the partial number.

A molecular epidemiological analysis of M. bovis strains submitted to the Pennsylvania Animal Diagnostic Laboratory (PA-ADL) between December 1, 2007 and November, 30 2008 was conducted. During this period, M. bovis represented 63.6% of Mycoplasma species isolated from samples submitted to PA-ADL. The ability to separate isolates into clonally distinct groups showing strong genetic heterogeneity was demonstrated through the utilization of a novel technology, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). The results were consistent with the existence of at least two clonally distinct groups, although there was no clear geographical, month of isolation, or source origination relationship, indicating a currently unclassified characteristic is responsible for the strain heterogeneity. AFLP may serve as a valuable tool for molecular characterization of M. bovis strains from the United States.\n    Mycoplasma bovis isolates submitted to the PA-ADL (n=192) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to enrofloxacin, erythromycin, florfenicol, spectinomycin, ceftiofur, tetracycline, and oxytetracycline using a broth micodilution testing method which incorporated a redox color change reagent.  The antimicrobials which were most effective for M. bovis using the broth microdilution method were florfenicol, enrofloxacin, and tetracycline with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 2 - 32 \u00b5g/mL, 0.1 - 3.2 \u00b5g/mL, and 0.05 - >12.8 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. A significant difference in the susceptibility levels between quarter milk and lung M. bovis isolates was found for spectinomycin. Using CLSI-approved breakpoints for other bovine respiratory disease pathogens it was determined that enrofloxacin, spectinomycin, ceftiofur, erythromycin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, and florfenicol demonstrated resistance in 2.1%, 58.3%, 100%, 100%, 12.5%, 22.4%, and 11.4% of isolates, respectively.\nMIC values of a subset of the M. bovis isolates (n=12) were tested using a novel side-scatter flow cytometric technique with concurrent staining using SYBR green I and propidium iodide. The most effective antimicrobials for the 12 isolates were determined to be enrofloxacin and florfenicol. Flow cytometry offers potential in clinical applications due to high throughput-capability, quick turn-around time, and the objective nature of interpreting results.\n    Based upon the increasing resistance patterns of M. bovis to several currently administered veterinary antimicrobials, novel small molecule compounds were screened for potential inhibition of Mycoplasma bovis growth and dose-dependent response was evaluated. The determination of inhibition of M. bovis growth in a milk environment using novel small molecule natural compounds was also studied. The data suggest that 32 of the 483 compounds tested were able to inhibit growth of M. bovis using a tetrazolium salt assay.  Methanesulfonic acid, 3-[(2E)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)prop-2-enoyloxy](1S,3R,4R,5R)-1,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexane carboxylic acid,  S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine, L-aspartic acid, dihydrotachysterol, eriodictyol, and (+)-alpha-tocopherol acid succinate demonstrated a dose response in the tetrazolium broth culture assay and at 3 hours and 24 hours in fresh quarter milk. Small molecule natural compounds offer the potential for prophylactic or therapeutic use on organic and natural farms as a viable alternative to traditional antimicrobial agents.\n    A longitudinal study was conducted to determine the cumulative incidence and prevalence of M. bovis in special-fed veal calves from 4 Pennsylvania herds. The period prevalence of M. bovis colonization was 90.5% for the nasal swabs and 38% for swabs collected at the bronchial bifurcation. A total of 90 lung lesions were identified from the 252 calves in the study. A total of 42% of the lung lesions collected were culture positive for M. bovis, while 37% of bronchi swabs were culture positive. Evidence suggests that M. bovis, in concert with other respiratory pathogens, is responsible for pneumonic lesions in veal calves. It was determined that calves with a member of the Pasteurellaceae family cultured from a lung lesion was 10.8 (OR=10.7885; 95% CI 2.2245-52.3231) times more likely to also have M. bovis present in the lesion than Pasteurellaceae alone. The data suggest that nasal swab testing on special-fed veal farms can be used to screen calves for the presence of M. bovis, but are unlikely to be successful at determining exactly which calves are at increased risk of developing lung lesions.\n    A blinded, controlled trial of two commercially available M. bovis bacterin vaccines for the prevention of respiratory disease associated with M. bovis infection in special-fed veal calves was conducted. Vaccine A efficacy was compared to a placebo and vaccine B efficacy was compared to 0.9% sterile saline solution. Upper-respiratory tract colonization was not impacted by vaccination status. The presence of lung lesions was significantly reduced by treatment of vaccine A (p=0.0325), however lung lesions from tissues positive for M. bovis was not significantly reduced. Vaccine B was not shown to significantly reduce total lung lesions or M. bovis-specific lung lesions. There was no association between specific antibody concentrations and M. bovis-associated morbidity in the veal calves. Approximately 30% of all calves in the study were found to be seropositive for M. bovis upon acclimation to the barn, indicating a potential problem of maternal M. bovis in Pennsylvania. A detectable difference in the IL-1\u00e2 and TNF-\u00e1 level for vaccinated calves (vaccine A and vaccine B) was seen as compared to control calves. Under the field conditions of this study, vaccine efficacy for special-fed veal calves was determined to be 44% and less than 1% for vaccine A and vaccine B, respectively.\n    In summary, the findings presented indicate that M. bovis is an important public health concern in Pennsylvania. Although virulence specific factors or environmental factors contributing to the severity of M. bovis-associated disease have yet to be discovered, this work has provided a basis for continued investigation. Further understanding of the changing epidemiology of M. bovis in Pennsylvania will provide valuable information for the design and implementation of M. bovis prevention and management strategies in the United States.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4199], "author_name_tesi": "Soehnlen, Marty Katherine", "last_name_ssi": "Soehnlen", "middle_name_ssi": "Katherine", "first_name_ssi": "Marty", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao", "Bhushan M Jayarao", "Subhashinie Kariyawasam", "Arthur Hattel", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich", "Jeanne Ann Lumadue", "David R Wolfgang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao, Dissertation Advisor", "Bhushan M Jayarao, Committee Chair", "Subhashinie Kariyawasam, Committee Member", "Arthur Hattel, Committee Member", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich, Committee Member", "Jeanne Ann Lumadue, Committee Member", "David R Wolfgang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vaccination", "epidemiology", "cattle", "Mycoplasma bovis", "veterinary medicine", "antimicrobial"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Daily behavior and trap cropping of the brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys St\u00e5l) in Pennsylvania agricultural systems", "id": "22445", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9532", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Invasive species can cause billions of dollars in economic damage every year.   The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, is a relatively new invasive pest in the United States, and in recent years has become a serious agricultural issue.  Fruits, vegetables, legumes, and ornamental plants are all part of a wide host range; in the mid-Atlantic United States, H. halys has already caused millions of dollars in documented damage.\n\nMost current control strategies of H. halys involve the use of chemical applications to protect crops, and have disrupted Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems.  In order to protect IPM management strategies in Pennsylvania, I evaluated H. halys activity levels in the field and the laboratory.  I also evaluated feeding preferences of H. halys between peppers and sunflowers, and hypothetical implications of H. halys invasions in other countries. \n\nI began by looking at diurnal and nocturnal behavior of H. halys adults and nymphs in fruit orchard arenas placed on apple, peach, and nectarine tree limbs.  From this research, I found a general pattern of increased activity during the evening hours.  To better explore this pattern and the driving factor behind it, I placed H. halys in laboratory growth chambers and monitored them during 24-hour cycles.  Diel patterns emerged in keeping with the field experiment (increased activity later in the evening), which persisted in completely dark conditions, indicating that the activity patterns were linked to a circadian rhythm. \n\nIn order to determine if there is a plant preference between pepper and sunflower crops, I planted pepper fields surrounded by sunflower crops, thereby creating a trap cropping setup.  The attractiveness of the sunflowers was sufficiently greater to make it a potential trap crop, although more studies need to be completed to provide recommendations for a season-long protection of vegetables.\n\nIn addition to these field and laboratory components, a hypothetical invasive species awareness program was created for Belgrade, Serbia.  This was based upon surveys and a focus group questionnaire that was presented to several Serbian scientists, farmers, and agricultural consultants about the importance of invasive insect awareness in their country.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9308], "author_name_tesi": "Soergel, Deonna Catherine", "last_name_ssi": "Soergel", "middle_name_ssi": "Catherine", "first_name_ssi": "Deonna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Grzegorz Krawczyk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Grzegorz Krawczyk, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Halyomorpha halys", "stink bug", "insect periodicity", "circadian rhythm", "feeding preference", "invasive species"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Understanding Childbearing Decision Making within the Context of  Sexual and Reproductive Health Care Needs of Women Living With HIV/AIDS in Southwest Nigeria\n", "id": "17656", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8486", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In sub-Saharan Africa, women continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. In 2009, of the 22.4 million persons living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA), 13.4 million were women (UNAIDS, 2009). Women in sub-Saharan Africa between the ages of 15 and 24 years constitute 76% of those at risk for contracting HIV, and the risk of infection for this age group is three times that of the general population (UNAIDS, 2008).  As the epidemic enters its third decade, the reproductive choices available to women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA) are constantly evolving. This is in part due to the availability of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services which have contributed significantly to sustaining the reproductive intentions of many WLHA.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the sexual and reproductive healthcare (SRH) needs of WLHA in a clinical setting in southwestern Nigeria, and the factors that influence their childbearing (CB) decisions. In this dissertation, I answer three primary questions: (a) How do the perceptions of WLHA SRH needs influence and/or affect their CB decisions? (b) How are the CB decisions of WLHA influenced by their partners\u2019 desires for children? and (c) How does a supportive healthcare system influence the CB decisions of WLHA? In the first three chapters, I describe HIV infection in Lagos and in Nigeria, distinguish between fertility desires and intentions, and describe motivations for childbearing, the theoretical frameworks employed, and the methods used to conduct the study. \n\nPaper 1 (Chapter 4) is based on the first phase of data collection and is grounded in the PEN-3 cultural model. I describe the factors responsible for the CB decisions of WLHA in Lagos, Nigeria by identifying: (a) WLHA perceptions that may promote or hinder healthy behaviors when factored into CB decisions; (b) enablers, such as healthcare support services, that may influence healthy behaviors and practices; and (c) nurturers, such as partners and family members who may support or discourage childbearing among WLHA. \n\nPaper 2 (Chapter 5) is based on the second phase of data collection and is grounded in the PEN-3 cultural model and the Ottawa Decision Support Framework (ODSF). In this paper, I examine WLHA perceptions of male partner support in the CB decision-making process after disclosure, pre-partum, and post-partum. In particular, I determine whether male partners were supportive, and how this support was shown to their female partners living with HIV. The results reveal that all of the male partners were supportive except one, and the level of support provided remained consistent. \n\nIn Paper 3 (Chapter 6), I describe how WLHA interactions with the healthcare system shape their CB decisions. Specifically, I address how WLHA perceive the support and recommendations of healthcare workers (HCWs) related to their CB decisions pre- and post-partum, and what contextual factors within the healthcare system promote or hinder WLHA acceptance of healthcare recommendations. The results reveal that the role of faith was more significant to WLHA pre-partum, while the role of HCWs and access to available healthcare services were important for favorable CB outcomes post-partum.\n\nAll three studies provide evidence that CB decision-making is a process that may change over time based on different factors. If the UNAIDS/ WHO goal of eliminating new pediatric HIV infections by 2015 is to be achieved, closer attention must be paid to multiple contextual factors such as cultural expectations and spirituality that may influence CB decisions of WLHA. Furthermore, HIV and other SRH service personnel in resource-limited settings should consider WLHA perceptions of their partners and the healthcare system when designing interventions in order to help them make informed reproductive decisions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8387], "author_name_tesi": "Sofolahan, Yewande A", "last_name_ssi": "Sofolahan", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Yewande", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Collins O Airhihenbuwa", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa", "Gary King", "Rhonda Belue", "Edward A Smith", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Collins O Airhihenbuwa, Dissertation Advisor", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa, Committee Chair", "Gary King, Committee Member", "Rhonda Belue, Committee Member", "Edward A Smith, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HIV/AIDS", "Nigeria", "women", "pregnancy", "childbearing", "healthcare", "support", "men", "partners"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Effect of Experience and the Relationship Among Subjective and Objectives Measures of Voice Quality", "id": "15247", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7508", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of experience on the judgment of \nvoice quality, to determine the perceptual space being used across these groups when judging voice quality, and to examine the correlation among acoustical measurements and perceptions of voice quality.

The feasibility of IVR-ERVC depends primarily on the critical heat flux (CHF) distribution on the external bottom surface of the reactor vessel. It is now widely recognized that micro-porous coatings can enhance the local CHF limits for downward-facing boiling on the reactor vessel outer surface under IVR-ERVC conditions which in turn enhances reactor safety margins. The existing coating techniques, however, require heat treatment on the vessel wall which is not practical or feasible for commercial-size reactors. In this study, a new and versatile coating technique known as \u201cCold Spray\u201d has been used to form a micro-porous coating on a hemispherical test vessel. Steady-state and quenching experiments were performed under simulated IVR-ERVC conditions using a bare vessel and a micro-porous coated vessel of identical dimensions. The downward-facing boiling and CHF phenomena observed in the steady-state and quenching experiments were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Based on the results of visualizations in the quenching experiments, the coated vessel was found to quench much faster than the bare vessel under identical experimental conditions, indicating a higher downward-facing boiling heat transfer (i.e., cooling rate) for the coated vessel. It was also observed that the local rate of boiling and the local CHF limit tended to vary appreciably along the outer surface of the test vessel. Quantitative measurements showed that for all angular locations on the vessel outer surface, the local CHF values for the coated vessel were consistently higher than the corresponding CHF values for the bare vessel. More than 90% enhancement in the local CHF limit was obtained by using micro-porous coatings formed by the Cold Spray technique. Careful inspection of the test vessel confirmed that the micro-porous coating formed by the Cold Spray technique was very durable with its micro-structure unchanged after many cycles of heating and cooling. The Cold Spray process and related equipment are portable, flexible, and scalable, and hence the micro-porous coatings explored in this study can be utilized in new industrial designs, as well as existing reactors provided adequate cavity space is available below the RPV lower head.\n \nIn addition to the experimental work, a stability analysis of the thin vapor film blanketing the outer surface of the vessel surrounded by ambient liquid was performed to obtain the most dangerous wavelength for breakup of the vapor film. Heat and mass transfer along with the normal and shear stresses at the interface were considered to accurately predict the stability behavior of the vapor film. A film boiling heat transfer model was developed based on the stability analysis. Furthermore, a scaling analysis was performed by utilizing the experimental data obtained in this study to develop a generalized correlation for downward-facing nucleate boiling. The correlation predicts the long-term behavior of reactor pressure vessel under IVR-ERVC conditions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13166], "author_name_tesi": "Sohag, Faruk Ahmed", "last_name_ssi": "Sohag", "middle_name_ssi": "Ahmed", "first_name_ssi": "Faruk", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fan-Bill Cheung", "Fan-Bill B Cheung", "Horacio Perez-Blanco", "Gita Talmage", "Albert Eliot Segall", "Timothy John Eden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fan-Bill Cheung, Dissertation Advisor", "Fan-Bill B Cheung, Committee Chair", "Horacio Perez-Blanco, Committee Member", "Gita Talmage, Committee Member", "Albert Eliot Segall, Outside Member", "Timothy John Eden, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Downward-facing boiling", "Micro-porous coating", "Cold Spray", "CHF limit", "Nucleate boiling", "Film boiling", "Stability", "Two-phase flow", "IVR"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Modeling and Simulation of Radiation from Hypersonic Flows using Monte Carlo Methods", "id": "11737", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2460", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "During extreme-Mach number reentry into Earth's atmosphere, spacecraft experience hypersonic\nnon-equilibrium flow conditions that dissociate molecules and ionize atoms.\nSuch situations occur behind a shock wave leading to high temperatures, which have an adverse effect\non the thermal protection system and radar communications.\nSince the electronic energy levels of gaseous species are strongly excited for high Mach number\nconditions, the radiative contribution to the total heat load can be significant.\nIn addition, radiative heat source within the shock layer may affect the internal energy distribution of dissociated\nand weakly ionized gas species and the number density of ablative species released from the surface of vehicles.\nDue to the radiation total heat load to the heat shield surface of the vehicle may be altered beyond mission tolerances.\nTherefore, in the design process of spacecrafts\nthe effect of radiation must be considered and radiation analyses coupled with flow solvers\nhave to be implemented to improve the reliability during the vehicle design stage.\n\nTo perform the first stage for radiation analyses coupled with gas-dynamics,\nefficient databasing schemes for emission and absorption coefficients were\ndeveloped to\nmodel radiation from hypersonic, non-equilibrium flows.\nFor bound-bound transitions, spectral information including the line-center\nwavelength and assembled parameters for efficient calculations of emission and absorption coefficients\nare stored for typical air plasma species.

Its aim is to investigate how preservice art teachers at a large east coast university critique visual culture in a Web-enhanced learning environment that I designed with Dr. Karen Keifer-Boyd. The curriculum unit that I study involves dialogues among professor and preservice teachers, critical analysis of visual culture in course Web sites to foster critical and reflective interpretation, and other learning activities both in the physical and virtual classroom. I use Karen Keifer-Boyd\u00a1\u00afs (1996) Multivocal Art Criticism approach from her adaptation of critical theories from the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, feminism, art, and ecology for interpreting images in my study.\nMy study reveals how a Web-enhanced art class can facilitate multiple perspectives and interactive dialogic learning with technology and broaden understanding of social contexts for the critical interpretation of visual culture. Preservice teachers valued multiple perspectives on the same artwork in the online discussions. Preservice teachers recognized contemporary artworks as a visual metaphor that conveys abstract concepts in a connotative mode. Interpretation with metaphor promotes multiple interpretations of the same artwork. The threaded discussion in the online forums supported interaction through reflection among preservice teachers and provided opportunities to share different thoughts. Preservice teachers critiqued visual culture issues that they encountered everyday but differed from their own beliefs. This enabled preservice teachers to relate critiques of visual culture to broader social issues and themselves.\nThis study suggests that critical interpretation informed from critical pedagogy engaged preservice teachers in reflecting on socio-cultural forms of knowledge, ideas, and social values of race, gender, and beauty in visual culture. In this study, the participants valued and synthesized multiple theoretical stances in a Multivocal Art Criticism approach for interpretation. This study suggests that interaction through critical reflection can help preservice teachers to become conscious of connections that they develop as part of their knowledge and judgments. Cross-cultural critiques in online discussion with participants from different cultures promoted richness of both shared and diverse views. This study illustrates the significance of contextual interpretation with intertextual links to broad societal contexts. Connecting different viewpoints from intertextual links with popular culture, histories, and social contexts become significant in constructing preservice teachers\u00a1\u00af identity. This study suggests that preservice teachers benefit from a critical examination of visual culture that shaped their identity as art teachers and from cross-cultural online pedagogy.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3211], "author_name_tesi": "Sohn, Jihyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Sohn", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jihyun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Treat Keifer Boyd", "Mary Ann Stankiewicz", "Wanda B Knight", "Jamie Myers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Treat Keifer Boyd, Committee Chair", "Mary Ann Stankiewicz, Committee Member", "Wanda B Knight, Committee Member", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["preservice art education", "critical interpretation", "visual culture"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A study on how market policy affects human market selection decision", "id": "19925", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9329", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We live in the world of choices. Nowadays, the globalization and progress in information technology created the availability of multiple markets.  This study aims to deepen the understanding of human trader decision-making when there is more than one market exchange, with traders having the choice of selecting from the multiple markets. In this setting, markets have different market policies from one to another and they will subsequently affect the market selection choices of the traders. The research question spanning throughout this dissertation is: ``What will be the impact from market policies on human market selection behaviors when there is more than one market exchange?'' In particular, this study focuses on understanding the impact of fee-charging policies on trader market selection behaviors.\n\nIn this dissertation, the approach tackling this question begins from the real-world observations and computer simulation results, moves on to building trader market selection models based on microeconomic theories, then to testing the models with human trader experiments, and stops at the model refinements from the experiment and the simulation results.  Due to the complexity inherent in market systems and human traders, understanding human market selection decisions spans over the interdisciplinary context of microeconomics, design of online market exchanges, economic experiments with human traders, and understanding complex systems.\n\nBased on the findings from computer simulations, a simple game-theoretic model on trader market selection behavior is constructed when markets have different fee-charging policies on the traders. The model is then tested under the experiment settings with real human trader subjects. Using the experimental results, the model is then refined and extended to include a more complex type of fee-charging policy, where buyers and sellers face different amount of transaction fee. The rational, economic market selection models based on game theory are then further modified as to include the possible bounded-rationality in human market selection decisions.\n\nWith the understanding of human traders' market selection and its relationship to the market policies, the research outcomes are expected to provide important implications for market business entrepreneurs, market policy makers in governments, and the designers of online marketplaces.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9133], "author_name_tesi": "Sohn, Jung-woo ", "last_name_ssi": "Sohn", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jung-woo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Yen", "Jens Grossklags", "Dinghao Wu", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Yen, Committee Chair", "Jens Grossklags, Committee Member", "Dinghao Wu, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multiple markets", "game theory", "trader market selection", "economic experiment", "market design", "agent based model", "bounded rational"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ART TEACHER EDUCATOR AS RHYTHMANALYST: MAPPING SPACE(-TIME)S OF BECOMING", "id": "14486mxs814", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14486", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The process of this research itself is a transitional experience for me in becoming an art teacher educator, through working with/for becoming-art teachers in the Advanced Practicum (A ED 489) at Penn State University.

In the first part of this work, atomic layer deposition (ALD) coatings were used to encapsulate the BaTiO3 multilayer ceramic capacitors and ZnO varistors against hydrogen and humidity exposure. In the second part, the Ni particles used in the manufacturing of MLCCs were coated by lithium carbonate to preserve their conductivity in oxidizing atmospheres. This method together with fast firing enabled us to sinter the MLCC in higher partial pressure of oxygen and, consequently, decrease the concentration of oxygen vacancies in them. In both parts, the applied methodologies were demonstrated to be effective in the improvement of electroceramic performance. In following, a brief description will be provided for every chapter in this dissertation for both the first and the second parts to provide a roadmap for readers.\n\nEncapsulating of BaTiO3 MLCCs and ZnO varistors against humidity and hydrogen exposure by ALD coatings  \nHydrogen gas creates a highly damaging environment that degrades electrical properties in oxide based dielectrics and piezoelectrics. In the second chapter, the degradation resistivity due to hydrogen gas in a barium titanate X7R dielectric is studied for base metal electrode capacitors. The present paper is devoted to I-V measurements and the loss of resistivity in the electrode Schottky barriers. The DC degradation and asymmetries noted in I-V forward and reverse biasing conditions were assumed to be due to hydrogen ion interstitials, locally creating donor substitutions. Thermionic and field emission conductivity mechanisms are applied to model the I-V data; the conductivity is controlled by the Schottky barrier heights and hydrogen ions localizing at the interfaces. Finally, a mechanism was proposed for resistivity degradation due to exposure to hydrogen gas. The proposed mechanism predicts the degradation should be reversible, and its validity was examined by recovery tests.\nIn the third chapter, the contributions of electrode interface, grain boundary, and grain to the total resistivity was differentiated by impedance spectroscopy (IS) tests and a 3RC model. It turned out that the largest contribution to total resistivity comes from electrode Schottky barriers, which control the major part of the degradation. Based on the IS analysis, the hydrogen diffusion coefficients of those three components were successfully calculated and compared with the diffusion coefficient in other systems. Determination of the hydrogen diffusion in grains and grain boundaries is important in understanding how hydrogen penetrates capacitors and can also be useful for applications that involve extreme environments. In this study, we also considered the kinetics and role of the metal electrode chemistry (Ag, Au, and Pt) and the thickness of active layers on the hydrogen degradation.\nIn chapters two and three, the degradative effect of hydrogen exposure was studied and documented. Next, ALD coatings were introduced as a solution to make a physical barrier between the electroceramic device and the degrading environment. In the chapter one, the encapsulating power of ALD coating has been reviewed. In addition, it was shown that the ALD techniques can coat the nanostructures (i.e. nanowires and nanoparticles) for both encapsulation or core-shell proposes.\nIn the fourth chapter under the title of \u201cEvaluating the merit of ALD coating as a barrier against hydrogen degradation in capacitor components\u201d, the encapsulating power of ALD coating was evaluated. Three ALD chemistries of ZnO, Al2O3, and HfO2 with different thicknesses were coated onto BaTiO3 capacitors, and their merit as hydrogen gas barriers at high temperatures was evaluated by I\u2013V and impedance spectroscopy which could monitor the degradation of resistivity. These experimental investigations provide the temperature of merit (T0) and the proton (H-ion) diffusion coefficients of the ALD layers, which can be used to evaluate their barrier effectiveness. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was applied to examine the ALD layers before and after the I\u2013V tests and find out the physical dimensions, conformity, and structure (amorphous and crystalline) of the ALD layers. We determine that the failure of the barrier characteristics at elevated temperatures is due to crystallization. The diffusion coefficient associated with protons before and after crystallizations in ALD layers was determined. Within the chemistries investigated here, the most effective ALD layers are made of HfO2 with an amorphous structure. \nIn the fifth chapter, the idea of using ALD coatings to protect electroceramics against hydrogen and humidity were tested in other electroceramics. Effectiveness of HfO2 Atomic Layer Deposition coatings has been studied on ZnO varistors by I\u2013V tests, impedance spectroscopy, and highly accelerated life test. Based on impedance spectroscopy analyses, the proton diffusion coefficient was measured to be 400 K times less in the coating. Transmission electron microscopy analysis shows that Atomic Layer Deposition films are continuous and conformal. After exposure to high temperature, partial crystallization was detected in the coating and increases proton diffusion coefficient by 150 times.  \n\nPreserving the electrical conductivity of nickel nanoparticle by Li2CO3 coating to decrease the number of oxygen vacancies in MLCCs\nIn the first try to preserve the electrical conductivity of Ni particles during sintering, the ALD coatings was coated on the Ni foils to study the behavior of these coatings at the sintering conditions. Although many techniques have been applied to protect nickel (Ni) alloys from oxidation at intermediate and high temperatures, the potential of atomic layer deposition (ALD) coatings has not been fully explored. In the sixth chapter, the application of ALD coatings (HfO2, Al2O3, SnO2, and ZnO) on Ni foils has been evaluated by electrical characterization and transmission electron microscopy analyses in order to assess their merit to increase Ni oxidation resistance; particular consideration was given to preserving Ni electrical conductivity at high temperatures. The results suggested that as long as the temperature was below 850 \u00b0C, the ALD coatings provided a physical barrier between outside oxygen and Ni metal and hindered the oxygen diffusion. It was illustrated that the barrier power of ALD coatings depends on their robustness, thicknesses, and heating rate. Among the tested ALD coatings, Al2O3 showed the maximum protection below 900 \u00b0C. However, above that temperature, the ALD coatings dissolved in the Ni substrate. As a result, they could not offer any physical barrier. The dissolution of ALD coatings doped on the NiO film, formed on the top of the Ni foils. As found by the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), this doping affected the electronic transport process, through manipulating the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio in the NiO films and the chance of polaron hopping. It was demonstrated that by using the ZnO coating, one would be able to decrease the electrical resistance of Ni foils by two orders of magnitude after exposure to 1020 \u00b0C for 4 min. In contrast, the Al2O3 coating increased the resistance of the uncoated foil by one order of magnitude, mainly due to the decrease in the ratio of Ni3+/Ni2+.\n   Based on the previous chapter, Li+ can be potential candidate to increase the ratio of Ni3+/Ni2+ and increase effectively the chance of electron hoping. In chapter seven, a new Ni electrode was manufactured from Ni nanoparticles, which coated by Li salts, namely Li2CO3, LiOH, and LiF with an innovative coating method. After the confirmation of a successful coating on Ni particles by SEM (Scanning Electron Microcopy) imaging, the Ni particles with Li2CO3 coating demonstrated the greatest preservation in conductivity among the other salts. Thus they were selected for further investigation; the effect of Li2CO3 percentage, sintering program, and pO2 on electrode resistance were systematically studied. The results suggest that the coating can reduce the resistance by five orders of magnitude at oxidizing atmosphere (e.g. pO2=2\u00d710-4 atm). The reduced resistances were as low as 1 \u03a9, suitable to be used as an electrode. SEM and FIB (Focused Ion Beam) cross section imaging were used to document the Ni oxidation, the sintering process of Ni particles, and the Li2CO3 decomposition. \nIn chapter eight, a systematic study of the influence of sintering atmosphere and temperature on the morphology of Li2CO3-coated Ni particles was investigated via TEM (transmission electron microscopy), SEM-FIB (scanning electron microscopy - focused ion beam) imaging, and TGA (thermogravimetric analysis). The results suggested that the Li2CO3 decomposes and produces CO in the presence of residual carbon; CO, as a reducing agent, decreases the amount of NiO phases formed during sintering. At the same time, the NiO phase was doped with Li+, resulting in a decrease in its resistivity. The combination of these two processes decreased the resistance of the final Ni electrodes from 140 k\u2126 to 1 \u2126.  The effect and role of these two mechanisms were separated, and it is shown that both of them are equally useful in the preservation of electrical conductivity.      \nIn chapter nine, by utilizing the novel coating together with fast firing techniques, the MLCCs were sintered in oxidizing atmosphere without losing their electrode conductivity. It demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy concentration decreased in the new MLCCs relative to conventional MLCCs, as illustrated by EELS analysis, as well as the color change of the samples. Due to the decline in oxygen vacancies, the dissipation factor was decreased by 60%. In addition, the distribution of Li was mapped with TOF-SIMS (time of flight\u2013secondary ion mass spectrometry). Li was localized at the interface of electrode and dielectric and, as demonstrated with impedance spectroscopy, caused the energy activation of interfaces to increase. This rise in the activation energy improved both dielectric constant and the leakage current of the MLCCs. \nIn chapter ten, the effect of Li+ doping by using HALT tests in both dried and humid environments as well as TSDC (thermally stimulated discharging current) was evaluated. The results suggested that Li doping does not affect the electrical properties of multilayer ceramic capacitors, and the reliability is not limited by the strategies of Li2CO3 coating. So we see that the main goal to establish an approach to customize multilayer BaTiO3-Ni structures at high oxygen activities and H2-free atmospheres were successful, with no unforeseen limitations with Li-addition.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13083], "author_name_tesi": "Sohrabi baba heidary, Damoon ", "last_name_ssi": "Sohrabi baba heidary", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Damoon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clive A Randall", "Clive A Randall", "Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Michael T Lanagan", "Nasim Alem"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clive A Randall, Dissertation Advisor", "Clive A Randall, Committee Chair", "Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Outside Member", "Nasim Alem, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ALD", "MLCC", "Nickel", "Hydrogen", "Degradation", "Conductivity Preservation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Calorimetric Studies of Site-Specific Ligand Binding By RNA", "id": "12575", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2667", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "RNA is a biopolymer capable of carrying genetic information and performing diverse chemistry, where thermodynamics of  ligand binding to RNA reveal crucial insight into its molecular structure and function.  Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) provides a direct, label-free method to measure ligand-macromolecule interactions in biological systems.  This dissertation details projects exploring structure/function relationships in RNA, particularly focusing on ITC to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of site-specific ligand interactions with RNA.  Nucleotides with the syn orientation were compiled into a database, and their relevance to RNA function was analyzed. It was concluded that syn bases are low-occurring, but not uncommon, and that they cluster in binding pockets and active sites of functional RNA. One such functional RNA with several syn bases, the malachite green aptamer (MGA), was chosen for thermodynamic characterization by ITC.  It was shown that the binding of two related ligands, malachite green (MG) and tetramethylrosamine (TMR), features a favorable binding enthalpy, an unfavorable binding entropy, and a negative heat capacity, with MG binding having the greater amount for each one of these quantities.  The temperature dependent ITC data also indicates that MG binding has two binding regimes: one low temperature regime where the stoichiometry is n = 0.4 and one high temperature regime where the stoichiometry goes to n = 1.  TMR binding lacked this feature.  Preliminary results for manipulating MGA activity by incorporation of conformationally restricted nucleotides at syn positions are presented.  Site-specific metal ion binding was also investigated with ITC.  These results show that metal ion binding to RNA is driven by entropy, with an unfavorable enthalpy, and that they can be detected and quantified via ITC. The negative heat capacity for site-specific magnesium ion-RNA interactions compared to a positive heat capacity for nonspecific interactions indicate that the heat capacity may be a general thermodynamic marker for RNA specificity in its binding behavior.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2661], "author_name_tesi": "Sokoloski, Joshua Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Sokoloski", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

Within the past thirty years, increasingly stringent NOX emission standards have forced engine manufacturers to develop novel ways to reduce these emissions.  With the implementation of the latest American and European NOX emission standards, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has become the most prominent NOX reduction method in lean-burn engines.\nIn the present work, a method is developed to test the performance of commercial SCR catalyst coated monoliths and probe the deactivation mechanisms.  A monolith testing apparatus is constructed for these purposes.  Necessary design features included a programmable gas mixing system, a steam generator, a temperature control system, and an analysis system based upon Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy.  It is found that a high flow rate of carrier gas as well as a method to generate a water mist and prevent dripping is essential to ensure a stable supply of steam and repeatable results.\nImportant SCR reactions, namely the standard, fast, and slow SCR reactions as well as NH3 adsorption and performance of a zeolite catalyst coated monolith were investigated at three temperatures \u2013 250 and 300 \u00b0C representing engine operation at normal operating conditions and 400 \u00b0C representing engine operation at high load.  The amount of NH3 adsorbed decreased with temperature in line with previous studies while NOX reduction performance increased with higher temperatures at all inlet compositions tested.  A transient drop in NO conversion performance was observed upon introduction of NH3 without the presence of NO2 consistent with previous studies suggesting an NH3 inhibition mechanism.  When supplied with 1:1 and 1:3 ratios of NO:NO2 at 250 \u00b0C, the catalyst reduced more NOX than NH3 suggesting that part of the NOX reduction was proceeding through an ammonium nitrate intermediate and generating nitric acid.  In addition, NH3 oxidation into N2O was prevalent at 300\u00b0C in an excess of NO2.  The SCR reaction results indicate that both transient effects and side reactions play an important role in an NH3 SCR system, particularly one that is designed to operate under continuously changing conditions.\nCatalyst aging mechanisms were investigated by comparing catalytic performance, material structure, and surface composition of a new and a used zeolite catalyst monolith for the fast SCR reaction.  Physical analysis of the catalyst monoliths through X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) indicated four aging mechanisms.  Both the new and used catalyst monoliths performed at least 95% NOX reduction in the fast reaction at all temperatures tested.  Despite the similar NOX reduction performance, the used catalyst monolith exhibited lower NO oxidation performance, increased NH3 oxidation, and a lower quantity of adsorbed NH3 compared to the new catalyst monolith.  Dealumination is likely the primary cause of the used catalyst monolith\u2019s lower NOX reduction performance with promoter metal deactivation, poisoning by sulfur and phosphorous, and mechanical failure of the catalyst coating on the monolith also contributing to the decreased performance.  The results do not find evidence of carbon coking.

Model frameworks that the bulk parameterization has been used in include a fixed \u201cbox model\u201d and a variable 1-dimensional Lagrangian parcel model. Tests compared the water vapor and ice water mixing ratios, ice number concentrations, axis lengths, aspect ratios, and deposition coefficients predicted by the bulk model as compared to the bin solutions. Relative errors for key growth variables are generally within 30%. Considering the complexity of modeling nonspherical crystal growth, these results compare well to the accuracy of predicting mass growth of a bulk PSD of spherical crystals, which can present as much as a 20% relative error between bin and bulk PSDs. This parameterization is intended to be implemented into the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) as a part of the particle property variable (PPV) model of Jensen et al. (2017).", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16566], "author_name_tesi": "Sokolowsky, George Alexander", "last_name_ssi": "Sokolowsky", "middle_name_ssi": "Alexander", "first_name_ssi": "George", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jerry Y Harrington", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux", "Matthew Robert Kumjian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jerry Y Harrington, Thesis Advisor", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Committee Member", "Matthew Robert Kumjian, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cloud physics", "atmospheric ice modeling", "deposition coefficient", "box model", "parcel model", "bulk particle size distribution", "bulk model", "faceted ice crystals", "cirrus", "ice microphysics", "adaptive habit", "deposition coefficient prediction", "vapor deposition ice growth"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNANCE PROVISIONS ON TAKEOVER VULNERABILITY AND MANAGERIAL ENTRENCHMENT\n\n", "id": "7679", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6305", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent studies document that governance provisions reduce shareholder value and increase agency costs.  Several studies use the index of 24 governance provisions (G-Index) as a measure of takeover protection and managerial entrenchment.  However, prior studies of individual takeover defenses, included in the G-Index, provide mixed evidence as to their ability to deter takeovers.  Furthermore, there is no empirical evidence that managers of firms with a high number of governance provisions are protected from the discipline of the takeover market or from the discipline imposed by the board of directors.  This dissertation examines how governance provisions affect firms\u2019 takeover vulnerability and managerial entrenchment. Chapter 1 shows that the G-Index is not significant in explaining the likelihood of being acquired.  However, some individual provisions exhibit strong but opposing effects on takeover probability.  Grouping provisions that relate to takeover activity in a separate index, accounting for their directional effects, shows the significance of takeover defenses in predicting the takeover likelihood.  Chapter 2 shows that the G-Index does not effectively measure managerial entrenchment.  CEOs of firms with a high number of provisions are as likely to be replaced following value-reducing acquisitions as are CEOs of firms with a low number of provisions.  However, the acquiring CEOs of firms with staggered boards are less likely to face external discipline imposed by the market for corporate control for making value-reducing acquisitions than are acquiring CEOs of firms with annually elected boards.  This suggests that the staggered board indicator does proxy for managerial entrenchment.   Finally, CEOs of firms less vulnerable to corporate takeovers are more likely to face discipline from internal governance (board of directors) than are CEOs of firms more vulnerable to takeovers.  The main contribution of this dissertation to the existing academic literature is that it shows that the aggregate index of provisions does not measure either takeover protection or managerial entrenchment, and it suggests how researchers could use governance provisions to measure takeover vulnerability and managerial entrenchment. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6305], "author_name_tesi": "Sokolyk, Tatyana V.", "last_name_ssi": "Sokolyk", "middle_name_ssi": "V.", "first_name_ssi": "Tatyana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Kracaw", "Laura B Field", "N Edward Coulson", "George David Haushalter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Kracaw, Committee Chair", "Laura B Field, Committee Chair", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member", "George David Haushalter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["anti-takeover provisions", "managerial entrenchment", "corporate governance"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "SOCIAL INSECTS AS SOLITARY VEHICLES", "id": "14195exs399", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14195", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parasite-host interactions affect more than the two main characters.

Additionally, I investigate the effects of infectious and non-infectious cadaver exposure have on worker behavior, as well as determine the effects workers have on the fungus protruding from the infectious cadavers. Using both a coevolved fungus, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensus lato, and a generalist fungus, Beauveria bassiana, I found infected workers do not strongly affect the within nest dynamics of Camponotus castaneus, the natural host of O. unilateralis s. l. Furthermore C. castaneus and C. pennsylvanicus manage infectious and non-infectious cadavers differently. Workers from C. castaneus colonies are adept in quickly removing cadavers with internal and external fungal development. While C. pennsylvanicus workers must come in contact with fungal tissue in order to recognize the disease threat. However, I found C. pennsylvanicus workers to be highly effective in reducing the infectivity of hazardous fungal conidia (i.e. asexual spores). Such findings could be caused by the wood nesting ecology this species has, as well as the higher aggression towards infectious cadavers.

The formal privacy notion we use  is differential privacy  which has received significant attention because it offers meaningful guarantees of privacy in the presence of any external or auxiliary of information. Differential privacy guarantees that no more information can be extracted about an individual from the statistical database than what is already available in the presence of any external information.

This type of data occurs frequently in practice, particularly in medical applications such as brain networks based on neuroimaging data collected from electroencephalograms (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Recent work on functional graphical models assumes that the random functions observed at the vertices are Hilbert-space-valued Gaussian random elements. Since the Gaussian assumption is very restrictive, we propose two types of nonparametric functional graphical models that relax the Gaussian assumption, but when characterizing the inter-dependencies among the random functions they preserve the simplicity of the Gaussian dependence structure\nThe first model we consider is based on the notion of additive conditional independence (ACI), a new statistical relation that captures the spirit of conditional independence but without resorting to multi-dimensional kernels, which is the source of the curse of dimensionality. To account for the functional and nonlinear nature of the model, we construct additively nested Hilbert spaces: the first space contains functions of time; the second space is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space that consists of additive functions defined on the first space and is used to characterize the nonlinear or heteroscedastic relations among the random functions. The two functional spaces are nested, in the sense that the inner product of the first space determines the kernel of the second space. We then develop a functional precision operator based on the second space which characterizes ACI but without any restrictive distributional assumption. This allows us to preserve the fundamental simplicity of the Gaussian model and adopt essentially the same estimation strategy at the operator level.\nThe second model we consider is semiparametric and uses a functional Gaussian copula distribution with nonparametric marginals. This model preserves the simplicity of the Gaussian dependence structure, without requiring the random functions to be marginally Gaussian. It assumes that the vector of random functions is a multivariate Gaussian ran- dom element in a Hilbert space after a set of unknown copula transformations.\nThrough simulation studies, we show the accuracy of the proposed models when the Gaussian assumption is violated.

This paper examines how the two forces have played out in shaping the physical spaces of the capital city, Tehran.\nThe urban transformation of Tehran initiated in 1934 aimed, among other things, to restrict the cultural activities and public life of a traditional urban class in favor of a western-oriented elite. The Iranian revolution of 1979 attempted the reverse: with similar procedures but with different outlooks, the revolution reinserted traditional culture into the public sphere and marginalized non-traditional subcultures. Today, a wide gap can be observed in Iran between government-sponsored socio-cultural values and those of more liberal social groups. Both after 1934 and again after 1979, particular urban settings have played a key role in the form of \u201calternative spaces\u201d that enabled the marginalized social group to preserve the vitality of their lifestyle.\nUsing a case-study approach, this thesis examines the ways speci\ufb01c aspects of urban morphology have contributed to the formation of these alternative urban spaces. Through a parallel analysis of Tehran\u2019s morphological and social transformations, this study posits that urban boundaries shaped by physical structures have been a significant factor in the formation of these alternative social spaces. The thesis focuses on the Grand Bazaar of Tehran as the most significant alternative space for the traditional class in pre-revolutionary Iran, and Ekbatan housing estate as a major example of alternative space in the post-revolutionary era.

We develop our methods for performing challenging tasks such as clustering, anomaly detection, classification, and credit attribution in text documents, a domain with a very high-dimensional feature space.\n\nWe first focus on discovering interpretable topics which manifest on a small subset of the entire high-dimensional feature space. We propose a parsimonious topic model which allows parameter sharing in high-dimensional discrete data such as text corpora. In related topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), all words are modeled topic-specifically, even though many words occur with similar frequencies across different topics. Our approach, in contrast, determines salient words for each topic, which have topic-specific probabilities, with the rest explained by a universal shared model. Moreover, unlike in LDA, where all topics are in principle present in every document with non-zero proportions, our model identifies a sparse subset of relevant topics for each document. We derive a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), balancing model complexity and goodness of fit. Unlike in standard BIC where all model parameters are penalized equally, we identify an effective sample size and corresponding penalty specific to each parameter type in our model. We minimize BIC to jointly determine our entire model -- the topic-specific words, document-specific topics,  all model parameter values, and the total number of topics -- in a wholly unsupervised fashion. Experimental results show that our model achieves higher test set likelihood and better agreement with ground-truth class labels, compared to several baseline topic models.\n\nWe then adopt our parsimonious model for detecting anomalous groups and the atypical patterns they exhibit. We define an anomalous group (cluster) as a set of points which collectively exhibit abnormal patterns. In many applications, this can lead to better understanding of the nature of the atypical behavior and to identifying the sources of the anomalies. In particular, we consider the case where the atypical patterns exhibit on only a small (salient) subset of the very high dimensional feature space. Individual AD techniques and techniques that detect anomalies using all the features typically fail to detect such anomalies, but our method can detect such instances collectively, discover the shared anomalous patterns they exhibit, and identify the subsets of salient features. Experimental results show that our method can accurately detect anomalous topics and salient features (words) under each such topic and achieve better performance compared to both standard group individual anomaly detection techniques.\n\nWe then move from wholly unlabeled data to sparingly labeled text corpora and develop semi-supervised models for document classification and credit attribution. We first propose a semi-supervised hierarchical class-based mixture of topic models for classifying documents. Most topic models incorporate documents' class labels by generating them after generating the words. In these models, the ground-truth class labels have small effect on the estimated topics, as they are dominated by a huge set of word features. In contrast, in our model, we generate the words in each document conditioned on the class label. We show that our generative process allows us to better incorporate ground-truth labels. Within our framework, we also provide a principled mechanism to control the contribution of the class labels and the word space to the likelihood function. Experiments show that our approach achieves better classification accuracy compared to some standard semi-supervised and supervised topic models.\n\nFinally, we propose a semi-supervised multi-label topic model for jointly performing document classification and credit attribution to document sentences, i.e. labeling each sentence by the most appropriate label subset.  Under our model, each sentence is associated with, i.e. explains, only a subset of the document's labels (including possibly none of them), with the label set of the document the union of the labels of all of its sentences. Our model, in a semi-supervised fashion, discovers the topics present, learns associations between topics and class labels, predicts labels for unlabeled documents, and determines label associations for each sentence in every document. For learning, our model only uses labels provided at the document level. We develop a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo based algorithm for efficiently sampling from the joint label distribution over all sentences, a very high-dimensional discrete space. We also propose an approximate extension of our model based on stochastic variational inference which can scale up to massive datasets by performing inference in parallel. Experiments show that our approach outperforms several baseline methods with respect to both document and sentence-level classification, as well as test set log-likelihood.

The couplings are heavy and incur maintenance and cost penalties because these parts wear and need frequent replacement. A possible solution is to replace the current design with a continuous, flexurally-soft, torsionally-stiff, flexible matrix composite (FMC) shaft. This design could eliminate the flexible couplings and reduce the overall weight of the driveline. Previous research studies on this topic using preliminary materials have found design solutions that meet operational criteria; however, these designs employed thick-walled, heavy shafts. In order to significantly reduce the weight of the driveline, a stiffer FMC material resulting in a lighter shaft design is required. A new FMC with a matrix material that is stiffer than the previous, preliminary material by a factor of five is characterized in this thesis. It is believed that future design solutions with this new material will increase weight savings on the final driveline design. \n\nFor rotorcraft operated in hostile environments, a topic of concern regarding FMC shafts is ballistic impact tolerance. This topic has not yet been explored for these new kinds of composite materials and is pursued here on a coupon-level basis. Results show that tubular FMC test coupons absorb more energy and suffer larger reductions in torsional strength than their conventional composite counterpart, although reductions in tensile and compressive strengths are similar in both materials. This difference is attributed to the greater pull-out of fibers in the FMC material.  Coupon-level testing is a good first step in understanding ballistic tolerance in FMCs, although additional testing using fully sized and designed shafts is suggested so that proper comparisons between driveshafts can be made.\n\nSelf-heating of FMC shafts is an important issue because many design criteria are dependent on temperature. A model has already been developed to simulate self-heating in FMC shafts, although it is limited to analyzing composite layups with one fiber angle and no ballistic damage. New closed-form and finite element models are developed in the current investigation that are capable of analyzing self-heating in FMC shafts with multiple fiber angles through the thickness. The newly developed models have been validated with comparisons against experiments and one another. Experiments using simple angle-ply tubes made with the new FMC suggest that for a shaft operating under real service strains, temperature increase due to self-heating can be less than 10\u00b0C. Material development, characterization of the ballistic tolerance of FMCs, and improved analytical tools are contributions from the current investigation to the implementation of FMC driveshafts in rotorcraft.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5594], "author_name_tesi": "Sollenberger, Stanton  Gardner", "last_name_ssi": "Sollenberger", "middle_name_ssi": "Gardner", "first_name_ssi": "Stanton ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles E Bakis", "Charles E Bakis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles E Bakis, Thesis Advisor", "Charles E Bakis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["flexible", "rotorcraft", "rotary wing", "ballistic", "modeling", "heating", "driveshaft", "FMC", "composite"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Risk and Protective Effects of Sibling Relationships Among African American Adolescents: The Role of Familism Values and Birth Order\n\n", "id": "9183", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "360", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigated associations between sibling relationship qualities and positive and negative adjustment among African American adolescents (after controlling for family characteristics), and tested familism values and birth order as potential moderators of sibling relationship-adjustment linkages.

Study 3 examined the longitudinal associations between parents\u2019 differential treatment and youths\u2019 adjustment and tested adolescent sex, birth order, and parents\u2019 financial stress as moderators of these associations. Mothers, fathers, and two adolescent siblings in 179 African American families were interviewed on 3 annual occasions. Multilevel models revealed that decreases in youths\u2019 experiences of parental warmth, relative to a sibling, were associated with increases in youths\u2019 risky behavior and depressive symptoms, particularly in boys. Negative links emerged for differential parental conflict. These links were evident, however, in families under low but not under high financial stress. Taken together, these studies contribute to our understanding of siblings\u2019 role in youths\u2019 development and well-being, situate sibling effects within the broader family context, and provide information to inform prevention programs aimed at promoting positive development and reducing behavior problems by targeting sibling and related family dynamics.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7034], "author_name_tesi": "Solmeyer, Anna Ruth", "last_name_ssi": "Solmeyer", "middle_name_ssi": "Ruth", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Marie Mc Hale", "J Douglas Coatsworth", "Mark E Feinberg", "D Wayne Osgood"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Marie Mc Hale, Dissertation Advisor", "J Douglas Coatsworth, Committee Member", "Mark E Feinberg, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Siblings", "adolescence", "family dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Progress towards an electron electric dipole moment measurement with laser-cooled atoms", "id": "16363", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8247", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation recounts the progress made towards a measurement of the electron electric dipole moment. The existence of a permanent electric dipole moment of any fundamental particle would imply that both time reversal and parity invariance are violated. If an electric dipole moment were measured within current experimental limits it would be the first direct evidence for physics beyond the standard model. For our measurement we use laser-cooled alkali atoms trapped in a pair of 1D optical lattices. The lattices run through three electric field plates so that the two groups of atoms see opposing electric fields. The measurement chamber is surrounded by a four layer mu-metal magnetic shield. Under electric field quantization, the atoms are prepared in a superposition of magnetic sublevels that is sensitive to the electron electric dipole moment in Ramsey-like spectroscopy. The experiment requires very large electric fields and very small magnetic fields. Engineering a system compatible with both of these goals simultaneously is not trivial. Searches for electric dipole moments using neutral atoms in optical lattices have much longer possible interaction times and potentially give more precise information about the inherent symmetry breaking than other methods. This comes at the cost of a higher sensitivity to magnetic fields and possible sources of error associated with the trapping light. If noise and systematic errors can be controlled to our design specifications our experiment will significantly improve the current experimental limit of the electron electric dipole moment.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8170], "author_name_tesi": "Solmeyer, Neal Eldrich", "last_name_ssi": "Solmeyer", "middle_name_ssi": "Eldrich", "first_name_ssi": "Neal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Scott Weiss", "Kenneth O'hara", "Murat Gunaydin", "Sergei Tabachnikov"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Scott Weiss, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth O'hara, Committee Member", "Murat Gunaydin, Committee Member", "Sergei Tabachnikov, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Precision measurement", "laser-cooling", "fundamental symmetry"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Integrated Structural Process Model: An Inclusive Non-material\nSpecific Approach to Determining the Required Tasks and\nInformation Exchanges for Structural Building Information Modeling", "id": "17621", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8466", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) Industry is finding that\n\u201csilo\u201d barriers promote limitations within the community.

The problem under consideration consists of determining the supply chain infrastructure; raw material purchases, shipments, and inventories; and finished product production quantities, inventories, and shipments needed to achieve maximum profit while fulfilling demand and minimizing supply chain response time.  The development of the two-phase mathematical model parallels the supply chain planning process through the formulation of a strategic submodel for infrastructure design followed by a tactical submodel for operational planning.  The deterministic strategic submodel, formulated as a multi-period, mixed integer linear programming model, considers an aggregate production planning problem in which long-term decisions such as plant construction, production capacities, and critical raw material supplier selections are optimized.  These decisions are then used as inputs in the operational planning portion of the problem.  The deterministic tactical submodel, formulated as a multi-period, mixed integer linear goal programming model, uses higher resolution demand and cost data, newly acquired transit time information, and the previously developed infrastructure to determine optimal non-critical raw material supplier selections; revised purchasing, production, inventory, and shipment quantities; and an optimal profit figure.  The supply chain scenario is then modified to consider uncertain, long-term demand forecasts in the form of discrete economic scenarios.  In this case, a multi-period, mixed integer robust optimization formulation of the strategic submodel is presented to account for the probabilistic demand data.  Once the stochastic strategic submodel is presented, short-term, uncertain demand data is assumed to be available in the form of continuous probability distributions.  By modifying decision makers\u2019 objectives regarding demand satisfaction, the distribution-based demand data is accounted for through the development of a multi-period, mixed integer chance-constrained goal programming formulation of the tactical submodel.  In order to demonstrate the flexibility of both the deterministic and stochastic versions of the overall two-phase model, numerical examples are presented and solved.

The first section of research tried to tailor the leading edge to promote ice interfacial transverse shear stress created by the ultrasonic vibration of piezoelectric actuators. Previous work done to tailor leading edges removed material from the inside of the cap. However, there were concerns about structural integrity and erosion wear when material was removed. A new system of adding material to the inside of the leading edge instead of removing material to create stress concentrations was researched for this thesis. Finite element analysis was used to determine the optimal locations for the discontinuities for the ultrasonic IPS. The discontinuities located in the optimal location are called Tailored Stress Concentrators (TSCs). Using the finite element results, it was determined that the best location for the TSCs were in regions of normally low stress in the baseline model before the addition of the TSCs. The addition of the TSCs creates stress concentrations as well as increased the original local maximum stresses. Initial models showed increases in average interfacial shear stress of 20%. Since the first FEM was not practical to construct as a bench top experiment, a second model was developed. Next, a bench top experiment and matching finite element model were built to validate the finite element analysis. The finite element model predicted a decrease of 9% in interfacial shear stress when TSCs were added to the bench top model. The bench top experiments confirmed the ineffectiveness of TSCs. There was no reduction in power required to de-ice when the TSCs were added to the bench top model.\nThe next part of the research focused on the material used for the leading edge erosion cap. Coating systems based on titanium nitride (TiN) applied via cathodic arc physical vapor deposition (CA-PVD) were developed for rotorcraft erosion caps to protect against sand and rain erosion. Erosion resistant materials must also be compatible with ice protection systems. The ice adhesion strength of titanium nitride and titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN) were evaluated experimentally and compared to the ice adhesion strength of uncoated metallic materials currently used on rotor blade leading edge caps: stainless steel 430, Inconel 625, and titanium grade 2. Experimental studies presented in this paper investigated which environmental and material parameters are most influential on impact ice adhesion strength. The effects of median volumetric diameter, liquid water content, ambient temperature, surface roughness, and material grain direction were tested on stainless steel 430. Tests revealed that surface roughness and temperature have the greatest effect on ice adhesion strength. There was an increase in adhesion strength of 670% from -8\u00b0C to -16\u00b0C and 250% increase from 24 Ra \u00b5in to 105 Ra \u00b5in. An increase in water droplet size from 20 \u00b5m to 40 \u00b5m decreased the ice adhesion strength by 65%. The adhesion strength increased 15% when shear forces were applied 90\u00b0 with respect to the grain direction as compared to a 0\u00b0 loading configuration. While inside the Federal Aviation Regulation Part 25 and Part 29 Appendix C icing envelop for liquid water content, an increase from 0.5 to 2 g/m^3 had a 7% reduction in ice adhesion strength. A test matrix to evaluate ice adhesion strength of erosion resistant materials was developed, investigating the effects of temperature and coating surface roughness. An empirical extrapolation method to predict ice adhesion strength with varying temperature is presented and validated on metallic materials. The data for each material was reduced down to an average adhesion strength over the test conditions.   The average ice adhesion for the TiAlN and TiN coatings together was 51.5% higher than the three uncoated metallic materials together. Titanium aluminum nitride has the highest average adhesion strength of 75.1 psi and titanium grade 2 has the lowest with 36.9 psi over all of the test conditions.\nThe final phase of research compared a modern electrothermal IPS to a one of a kind laboratory test model for a ultrasonic IPS with a TiAlN coating on a 0.04\" titanium grade 2 leading edge in the Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand. The IPSs were evaluated for power required to de-ice and de-icing effectiveness. Both de-icing systems were tested at two different icing conditions. The ultrasonic IPS required 289 W at -15\u00b0C and 243 W at -8\u00b0C. The ultrasonic IPS was able to de-ice the majority main ice shape and some of the ice feathers at both temperatures. When the electrothermal IPS was tested at similar powers as the ultrasonic IPS, the electrothermal system de-iced as well as the ultrasonic system. Lastly, the electrothermal system was tested at a more typical higher power of 416 W. At the higher power, the electrothermal system was able to remove all of the ice at -8\u00b0C and all but a few feathers at -15\u00b0C. The ultrasonic system could not be tested at higher powers due to the fracture limit of the actuator. Actuator failure was observed at high applied voltages and power.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8681], "author_name_tesi": "Soltis, Jared T", "last_name_ssi": "Soltis", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Jared", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Palacios", "Douglas Edward Wolfe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Palacios, Thesis Advisor", "Douglas Edward Wolfe, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["aircraft icing", "de-icing systems", "ice adhesion strength", "ultrasonic de-icing", "erosion resistant materials"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND EVALUATION OF A PARTIALLY MELTED ICE PARTICLE CLOUD FACILITY", "id": "13309jts5183", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13309", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High altitude ice crystal clouds created by highly convective storm cells are dangerous to jet transport aircraft because the crystals are ingested into the compressor section, partially melt, accrete, and cause roll back or flame out. Current facilities to test engine particle icing are not ideal for fundamental mixed-phase ice accretion experiments or do not generate frozen droplet clouds under representative conditions. The goal of this research was to develop a novel facility capable of testing fundamental partially melted ice particle icing physics and to collect ice accretion data related to mixed-phase ice accretion. The Penn State Icing Tunnel (PSIT) has been designed and fabricated to conduct partially melted ice particle cloud accretion. The PSIT generated a cloud with air assisted atomizing nozzles. The water droplets cool from the 60psi pressure drop as the water exited the nozzle and fully glaciate while flowing in the -11.0\u00b0C tunnel air flow. The glaciated cloud flowed through a duct in the center of the tunnel where hot air was introduced. The temperature of the duct was regulated from 3.3\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C which melted particle the frozen particle from 0% to 90%. The partially melted particle cloud impinged on a temperature controlled flat plate. \nIce accretion data was taken for a range of duct temperature from 3.3\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C and plate temperature from -4.5\u00b0C to 7.0\u00b0C. The particle median volumetric diameter was 23\u00b5m, the total water content was 4.5 g/m3, the specific humidity was 1.12g/kg, and the wet bulb temperature ranged from 1.0\u00b0C to 7.0\u00b0C depending on the duct temperature. The boundaries between ice particle bounce off, ice accretion, and water run off were determined. When the particle were totally frozen and the plate surface was below freezing, the ice particle bounced off as expected. Ice accretion was seen for all percent melts tested, but the plate temperature boundary between water runoff and ice accretion increased from 0\u00b0C at 8% melt to 3\u00b0C at 90%. There were two types of ice accretion with a transition zone in between. The first type of ice was opaque in color and had a rough surface. This ice occurred roughly from 6.0\u00b0C to 12.0\u00b0C duct temperatures (8% to 50% melt). The qualitative characteristics of the ice were produced from the low water content in the cloud. The water that was available froze instantly and trapped ice particle. Duct temperatures greater than 17.5\u00b0C (80% melt) produced ice that was clear and smooth. The water in the surface did not freeze instantly due to the high water content creating a water film that froze.\nA mixed-phase cloud dynamics model from NASA Glenn was used to estimate the percent melt of the cloud exiting the duct. There was no way to validate the model by directly measuring the percent melt of the cloud, so single particle melt experiments were conducted and compared to the model. A 0.05g/L solution of rhodamine b was sprayed into a levitator and droplets formed at the nodes of the wave. A 532nm green laser was used to illuminate the dye, and the water emitted orange 593nm light given the luminescent properties of the ink. The emitted light intensity was recorded, and a linear relationship between the light intensity of ice to the light intensity of water was used to determine the percent melt of a droplet. The droplets were frozen with a cold flow of nitrogen gas via a liquid nitrogen heat exchanger. The droplets melted under natural convection when the cold nitrogen was shut off. Fifteen cases were compared with droplet diameters ranging from 324\u00b5m to 1112\u00b5m, air temperatures from 16\u00b0C to 31\u00b0C, and relative humidities from 41% to 100%. The average discrepancy between predictions and results for the cases that melted slower than ten seconds was 13% while the cases that melted faster than 10 second had 64% discrepancy between the model and experiment. To explain the discrepancy between the experiment and model, sensitivity studies of the model were conducted. It was seen that the melt time from the model was most sensitive to ambient temperature (1s/\u00b0C). It was also seen that the thermistors used in the experiment were accurate to 0.7\u00b0C. Transient effects of the rhodamine b caused an overshoot in light intensity, making it difficult to accurately determine the melting stop time. .These factors led to the difference in melt time between the model and experiments. A 2.7s difference between model and experiments was deemed to be a successful correlation between predictions and experimental results given the model sensitivity to temperature, the difficulty in measuring temperatures at the position of the droplet, and the transient characteristics of rhodamine b.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13058], "author_name_tesi": "Soltis, Jared T", "last_name_ssi": "Soltis", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Jared", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Palacios", "Jose Palacios", "Robert Francis Kunz", "Michael H Krane", "Stephen P Lynch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Palacios, Dissertation Advisor", "Jose Palacios, Committee Chair", "Robert Francis Kunz, Committee Member", "Michael H Krane, Committee Member", "Stephen P Lynch, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Engine icing", "mixed phase icing", "icing wind tunnel", "single droplet melt", "single crystal melt"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Agenda-setting in State Courts of Last Resort", "id": "26384", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11479", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The attention given to a specific issue area by a political institution drives the types of policies adopted by the institution. For this reason, scholars study agenda-setting and its impacts within institutions to shape issue attention. Yet much of the research on judicial agenda-setting has focused on individual behavior within the confines of the U.S. Supreme Court. This excludes the possibility of accounting for how institutional structure shapes a court's agenda as the Court's formal procedures have not changed significantly in the past 80 years. This previous research suggests that institutions themselves do not have an effect on a court's issue agenda or the types of cases it hears. On the other hand institutional differences might interact with the individual motivations of judges and litigants to influence the composition of a court's docket, but scholars have not identified these effects due to the continued focus on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn this project, I develop a theory of institutional judicial agenda-setting which accounts for the motivations of justices, litigants, and interest groups, the parties which have the most influence on a court's agenda, and how institutional rules effect agenda-setting at both the macro- (e.g. a court's overall policy agenda) and micro- (e.g. whether or not an individual case is heard) levels. More specifically, the project leverages cross-state variation in state courts of last resort (COLRs) to empirically test hypotheses about how two broad aspects of COLRs -- jurisdictional rules/procedures and processes for selection and retention of justices -- interact to shape the courts' agendas. In doing so, I develop a generalized model of agenda-setting applicable to any court of last resort. I apply this framework and use new data sources to evaluate how state COLRs shape their agendas. I find that that macro-policy attention is not easily explained by institutional and strategic factors; that judges engage in sincere, not sophisticated, agenda-setting; and that campaign contributions to a state COLR justice from parties involved in litigation increases judicial access.\n\nThis project offers an integrated, generalized theory of how both justices and litigants shape the judicial agenda, and is the first broad, systematic examination of agenda-setting in state courts of last resort. In the former case, the research identifies to what degree ideological and retention concerns factor into the policy attention of courts and justices' decisions to hear appellate cases, while assessing how litigants balance their desire for judicial victory with their resources and knowledge about the probability of success when facing a hostile court. In the latter case, the research examines the processes of important appellate courts and seeks to resolve the dispute over whether or not these courts are important policymaking institutions. Understanding how justices and litigants influence the agenda-setting process has implications for the strategies of these groups when deciding whether or not to appeal cases or voting to grant or deny appellate review.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10993], "author_name_tesi": "Soltoff, Benjamin Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Soltoff", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Jon Zorn", "Michael Barth Berkman", "Marie Hojnacki", "John Kramer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Jon Zorn, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Barth Berkman, Committee Member", "Marie Hojnacki, Committee Member", "John Kramer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["judicial politics", "state politics", "judicial elections", "agenda-setting"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF PROTEIN FILMS USING NOVEL ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY TECHNIQUES\n", "id": "9635", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5048", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The success of long-term blood-contacting implanted devices greatly depends upon the interaction of the blood components with the device material. The search for a perfect hemocompatible biomaterial has not yielded success yet, largely due to the incomplete understanding of blood-material interactions, especially at sub-cellular and molecular levels. In this work, critical aspects of blood-material interactions are probed at the molecular scale using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Conventional AFM imaging techniques are not capable of detecting specific plasma proteins on clinically relevant polymeric biomaterials, mostly due to the surface roughness of the biomaterial. This work has developed AFM techniques which will not require the topographical features otherwise needed by conventional AFM methods to detect proteins. Fibrinogen, the third most abundant plasma protein, plays a crucial role in surface induced thrombosis in blood contacting devices. AFM is used to characterize fibrinogen, in terms of its spatial location, on ultrasmooth mica substrate and a clinically relevant polymer substrate, poly (dimethyl-siloxane). Gold labels are used as immunological tags to detect adsorbed fibrinogen from a two-protein layer at molecular resolution. Force spectroscopy is used to calculate the time dependent activity of the platelet binding dodecapeptide epitope of fibrinogen. These nanoscale results are corroborated with macroscale platelet adhesion experiments. The effects of concentration and co-adsorption of bovine serum albumin with fibrinogen are studied on hydrophilic mica substrates.

Through the direct \u2018presynaptic\u2019 observation of quantal release using amperometry it becomes strikingly evident that the exocytotic release event is plastic and regulated by multiple mechanisms.  Electrochemistry is particularly useful for these types of studies as it provides highly sensitive qualitative and quantitative information for electroactive neurochemicals that are easily oxidized or reduced.  The overall goal of this thesis is to use amperometry, in conjunction with electron microscopy, for the study of exocytosis events.  By combining these approaches it is possible to study exocytotic mechanisms in more detail and thus to better understand specific regulatory aspects of communication between single cells.\n\nExocytosis has been studied by a variety of methods; however, when living cells are used it is difficult to discriminate between the molecular effects of membrane proteins and the mechanics of lipid-membrane driven processes.  Thus, this thesis describes the use of a novel liposome-lipid nanotube network as an artificial cell model that undergoes the later stages of exocytosis.  This model shows that membrane mechanics, even without protein intervention, are sufficient to drive the expansion of the fusion pore to the final stage of exocytosis and can affect the rate of transmitter release through the fusion pore.  \n\nThe bulk of this thesis describes the analysis of exocytosis at a single PC12 cells.  Many spikes in amperometric records of exocytosis events from many different cell types initially exhibit a pre-spike feature, or foot, which represents a steady-state flux of neurotransmitter through a stable fusion pore spanning both the vesicle and plasma membranes and connecting the vesicle lumen to the extracellular fluid.  It has been well established that the volume of secretory vesicles can be modulated.  Results presented in this thesis are the first evidence indicating that vesicular volume prior to secretion is strongly correlated with the characteristics of amperometric foot events.  Amperometry and transmission electron microscopy have been used to determine that as vesicle size is decreased the frequency with which foot events are observed increases, the amount and duration of neurotransmitter released in the foot portion of the event decreases, and vesicles release a greater percentage of their total contents in the foot portion of the event.  These previously unidentified correlations provide new insight into how vesicle volume can modulate the activity of the exocytotic fusion pore.\n\nAmperometric data have also been collected from PC12 cells in high osmolarity saline solutions, and these data are used to further clarify the biophysical characteristics of the fusion pore.  When exocytosis is measured under high osmolarity conditions, dissociation of the dense core vesicle matrix is largely inhibited and thus membrane properties and release dynamics are changed.  As a result, the shape of amperometric spikes is drastically altered with the foot portion of the spike exhibiting the most significant alterations from normal spikes.  When release is elicited in high osmolarity saline, PC12 cell dense core vesicles are delayed after opening of the fusion pore and before proceeding to full vesicular fusion.\n\nLarge dense core vesicles in PC12 cells are commonly loaded with dopamine by treatment with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA).  Indeed, many of the studies presented in this thesis utilize L-DOPA as a means of increasing vesicular volume.  The results presented indicate that the majority of the dopamine loaded into these vesicles is preferentially compartmentalized into the halo portion of the vesicle.  Amperometric records of release from cells stimulated in isotonic and hypertonic extracellular conditions have been compared.  This is useful because the latter condition has been shown to cause inhibition of dense core dissociation in neuroendocrine cells, thus allowing for release specifically from the vesicular halo.  In combination with this, transmission electron microscopy has been used to determine the morphological characteristics of dense core vesicles before and after treatment with L-DOPA in saline solutions of varied osmolarity.  The results provide a more complete understanding of the complex interaction of molecules within dense core vesicles, suggesting that newly loaded dopamine is located in the halo and that the function of the dense core involves more than simple storage of neurotransmitter and associated molecules.     \n\nTransmission electron micrographs of PC12 cells presented in this thesis indicate that some dense core vesicles contain multiple cores.  These multi-cored vesicles, which are significantly increased in volume as compared to vesicles with a single dense core, are most frequently observed in PC12 cells bathed in high osmolarity, L-DOPA containing saline solutions.  The data suggest that multiple-cored vesicles are formed when a population of single-cored vesicles homotypically fuses prior to regulated exocytosis.  As these larger, multi-cored vesicles contain a greater amount of neurotransmitter, they should release more neurotransmitter and should give rise to longer and larger pre-spike amperometric foot signals, thus leading to another mechanism by which cells can modulate communication events.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3691], "author_name_tesi": "Sombers, Leslie A.", "last_name_ssi": "Sombers", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Leslie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing", "Anne M Andrews", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Richard W Ordway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing, Committee Chair", "Anne M Andrews, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fusion pore", "exocytosis", "amperometry", "transmission electron microscopy", "PC12 cells", "vesicle volume", "foot"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "DIELECTRIC AND TUNABLE BEHAVIOR OF LEAD STRONTIUM CERAMICS AND COMPOSITES", "id": "6482", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6863", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-09-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The needs of materials for microwave applications have been increasing due to the demands of mobile communication systems and it is preferable for most applications to be manufactured inexpensively using the least amount of space possible. One of the ideas presented to achieve this goal is to reduce the number of components. By changing certain properties under a specific electric and/or magnetic field condition, a component is able to have more than one function, which decreases the number of components necessary. Although microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), semiconductors, and ferrite based devices are available for tuning applications, ferroelectrics in the paraelectric regions and incipient ferroelectric materials are the most promising for low cost and miniaturized products over a wide frequency range of 1-10 GHz and higher frequencies.\n\tBarium strontium titanate ((Ba, Sr)TiO3 (BST)) is a considerably studied field dependent ferroelectric material. However, BST requires special techniques to prepare samples which show good reproducibility because the conventional mixed oxide method is not expected to offer high homogeneity due to low reactivity among the raw oxide chemicals of BST. On the contrary, lead strontium titanate ((Sr, Pb)TiO3 (SPT)) permits much simpler processing due to the high reactivity of lead oxide, a raw oxide chemical, towards the other component oxides. Therefore, the SPT system has been selected as a potential candidate for the frequency agile ferroelectrics for electronics (FAME) applications. \nSelected compositions, for example, Sr-Pb (0.7:0.3 by mole and 0.8:0.2 by mole) in the pure SPT system show the following properties: i) high relative permittivity, \u0192\u00d5r, ii) low tangent \u0192\u00d4 in the paraelectric states, iii) moderate DC bias dependence of \u0192\u00d5r far above the transition temperatures, and iv) high DC bias dependence of \u0192\u00d5r close to the transition temperatures. In addition, the SPT system does not show a significant composition dependence of the properties. \nBecause microwave applications need low capacitance materials in order to match the impedance for a device, the relative permittivity of the composition used should not be too high. Thus the \u0192\u00d5r of the SPT system is tailored by the addition of non-ferroelectric low \u0192\u00d5r and low tangent \u00a3_ oxides such as magnesium oxide (MgO). In order to achieve low tangent \u0192\u00d4 in SPT based systems around room temperature, the composition, Sr-Pb (0.8:0.2 by mole), has been chosen as the SPT source of the composites. \t\n\tThe SPT-MgO composites show \u0192\u00d5r ~ 100, tangent \u0192\u00d4 less than 0.001 at room temperature and a frequency of 10 kHz using an LCR meter, and Q \u201ee frequency ~ 700 GHz in a microwave frequency range based on the Hakki-Coleman method at room temperature. The tunability is ~ 0.02 with a DC field of 20 kV/cm (the reference field to compare various materials) and ~ 0.30 with a DC field of 175 kV/cm at room temperature and at 10 kHz. \nMixing rules are analyzed for the best estimate relative permittivity of the composites. The \u0192\u00d5r of the MgO based composites at room temperature and a frequency of 10 kHz show a reasonable agreement with the mixing model proposed by Wakino et al.\t\n\tBesides the MgO based composites, other composite systems have been explored. Composites prepared from SPT and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) show unusually low temperature coefficients of dielectric permittivity and modest but relatively constant values of dielectric tunability over a wide temperature range. Composites prepared from SPT and zirconium oxide (ZrO2) show the possibility to achieve higher Q \u201ee frequency values than most MgO based composites, but it would be difficult to achieve high density samples.  \n\tIn the pure SPT system, detailed studies are focused upon a departure from the Curie-Weiss law above the Curie point, Tc. The studies reveal that the Tc is unexpectedly below the Curie-Weiss temperature, theta. In addition, unusually high values of weak AC field relative permittivity are observed at the transition temperatures. These behaviors have been traced to the inhomogeneity in the solid solutions, but further work is necessary to establish both the nano-scale and the amplitude of the composition fluctuations, which are enhancing the relative permittivity maximum at the Tc.  \nA more precise phase diagram has been established for the (Sr1-xPbx)TiO3 system in the important range of x (0.05 - 0.30) for room temperature applications.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6860], "author_name_tesi": "Somiya, Yoshitaka ", "last_name_ssi": "Somiya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yoshitaka", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leslie Eric Cross", "Amar S Bhalla", "Dr R Guo", "Sridhar Komarneni", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Chair", "Amar S Bhalla, Committee Chair", "Dr R Guo, Committee Member", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Curie-Weiss", "dielectric", "lead strontium titanate", "composite", "tunable"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "German and French Compositional Influences in B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k's Orchestral Works 1903-1924: Case Studies in a Methodology of Appropriation \n", "id": "11855", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4855", "abstract_tesi": "Attending the Budapest premiere of Richard Strauss\u2019s tone poem Also sprach Zarathustra in February 1902 profoundly influenced the subsequent trajectory of the young B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k\u2019s musical endeavors.  Afterward, the budding composer, who at the moment stood at a creative impasse, immersed himself in Strauss's orchestral works\u2014Ein Heldenleben in particular\u2014and thereafter resumed his compositional studies.  In Strauss, Bart\u00f3k discovered \u201cthe seeds of a new life,\u201d a means with which he could create complex, serious music that he would unite with Hungarian characteristics\u2014at least those elements that Europe as a whole associated with Hungarian identity at the time, meaning gypsy music and the verbunkos.  Only with these \u201cauthentic\u201d elements did Bart\u00f3k believe he could craft a musical embodiment of the Hungarian ethos.  Yet like many artists of the period, Bart\u00f3k viewed Straussian modernism as a means to imbue his music with renewed vitality.  Thus, he plunged into the tone poems of the world\u2019s leading Teutonic composer. \n\tThis thesis offers a fresh, interdisciplinary perspective on Bart\u00f3k\u2019s compositional development, focusing particularly on the relationship between artistic nationalism and the European mainstream.  Although early critics acclaimed Bart\u00f3k\u2019s first orchestral works as hallmarks of Hungarian nationalism, the music of Strauss, the most famous Germanic composer of the era, roused Bart\u00f3k \u201cas by a lightning stroke.\u201d  Moreover, Bart\u00f3k\u2019s subsequent orchestral compositions bespeak the influence of other non-Hungarian composers, particularly Debussy, Wagner, and the honorary \u201cNew German,\u201d Liszt.  Bart\u00f3k\u2019s appropriation of these specific composers\u2019 stylistic tendencies foreshadows his rich engagement with European peasant music.  Study of his early works from this perspective traces the complete origins and manifestation\u2014both nationalistic and otherwise\u2014of his developing musical aesthetic and methodology of appropriation.\n\tThree chapters, each focused on a few of Bart\u00f3k\u2019s major orchestral works between the years 1903-24, comprise my research.  I analyze each orchestral work with respect to orchestrational technique, melodic development and transformation, harmonic language and function, and early emergences of peasant music.  Chapter One centers on Strauss\u2019s blatant appearance in Bart\u00f3k\u2019s symphonic poem Kossuth during his embrace of a chauvinistic nationalist ideology.  \n\tChapter Two addresses Strauss\u2019s continued presence in the music as well as the reintroduction of Wagner and Liszt in Suite No. 1, Suite No. 2, Two Portraits, and Two Pictures.  Nationalist politics in early twentieth-century Hungary provides a philosophical and cultural context, especially as to why Bart\u00f3k continued to use Strauss, the period\u2019s leading Teutonic composer, as a compositional model.  His gradual shift in political ideology away from the most fanatical forms of nationalism during this time provides a framework for exploring the meaning behind such shifts in his musical development.  \n\tChapter Three addresses the complete internalization of the styles of the aforementioned composers as well as the appearance of Debussy in Four Orchestral Pieces (1912), The Wooden Prince (1917), and The Miraculous Mandarin (1919-24).  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4831], "author_name_tesi": "Sommerfeld, Paul  Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Sommerfeld", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Paul ", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Musicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Dowell Youmans", "Charles Dowell Youmans"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Dowell Youmans, Thesis Advisor", "Charles Dowell Youmans, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["compositional influence", "Bart\u00f3k"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Physical Activity in Later Life: The Role of Constraints, Negotiation, Motivation, Selective Optimization with Compensation (SOC), Age and Gender\n\n", "id": "7105", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2552", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aim of this study was to elucidate the leisure constraint negotiation process\u2014the relationships between leisure constraints, leisure negotiation strategies, motivation, and leisure behavior\u2014for the physically active leisure of people fifty and older.  To accomplish this aim, three investigations were conducted.  The first study tested and extended Hubbard and Mannell\u2019s (2001) models of leisure constraint negotiation, replicating the finding that negotiation fully mediates motivation and participation but also finding, in contrast, that constraints and negotiation have independent, counterbalancing effects on participation.  The second study examined whether or not these relationships were maintained across multiple dimensions of physically active leisure (frequency, duration, and a combination of these subdimensions with activity intensity) while controlling for the effects of age and gender.  Including age and gender yielded the same result for activity frequency but a different result for overall physically active leisure.  In the latter case, negotiation only partially mediated the influence of motivation on participation.  Further, frequency fully mediated the effects of constraints, negotiation, and gender on duration.  The third study added selective optimization with compensation (SOC) to the examination of the constraint negotiation process of physically active leisure.  There were significant interactions between SOC and motivation for negotiation strategies and physical activity duration.  In the case of negotiation, there was a positive relationship between SOC and negotiation across motivation levels, with increases most pronounced for people with low motivation.  In the case of duration, there was a negative relationship between SOC and duration for people with low to moderate motivation whereas there was a positive relationship between SOC and duration for people with high motivation.  Taken altogether, these results suggest that SOC, age, gender and multidimensional measures of physical activity can help contribute to our understanding of the constraint negotiation process.  Further research is needed to examine these factors longitudinally and within the general population to understand these relationships over time and in diverse contexts.  In turn, revealing the nuances of the constraint negotiation process for physically active leisure participation has implications for leisure-based health promotion programming.   \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2532], "author_name_tesi": "Son, Julie Stafford", "last_name_ssi": "Son", "middle_name_ssi": "Stafford", "first_name_ssi": "Julie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Leisure Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Melissa Hardy", "Careen M Yarnal", "Laura Payne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Chair", "Andrew Justin Mowen, Committee Chair", "Melissa Hardy, Committee Member", "Careen M Yarnal, Committee Member", "Laura Payne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["selective optimization with compensation", "leisure", "physical activity", "constraints", "negotiation", "older adults"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "THE ROLE OF THE MEMBRNAE IN INTEGRIN-MEDIATED ADHESION OF CELLS TO SURFACES  ", "id": "15230szs328", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15230", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The adhesion of cells to an extracellular matrix is a dynamic process involving structural and signaling proteins, that, in turn, regulate key cellular processes, including migration, gene expression, differentiation, and signaling. Integrins play important roles as primary adhesion receptors, and integrin-mediated cell adhesion sites can be differentiated, based on size and location, into nascent adhesions, focal complexes, focal adhesions, and fibrillar adhesions. The formation of nascent adhesions to a surface requires the bending of the membrane toward a surface, diffusion of integrins to the area of close contact, and molecular adhesion. Each of these processes is sensitive to the lipid makeup of the membrane. Therefore, the lipid bilayer may exert significant control over the dynamics of nascent adhesion formation.  Because integrin-mediated adhesion is a central feature of cellular adhesion, locomotion, and endothelial cell mechanobiology, we investigated how membrane properties of thickness, compressibility, and bending rigidity modulate the formation of nascent cell adhesions via membrane curvature, redistribution of integrins and bond formation.\nAlthough integrins are known to be transmembrane proteins, little is known about the role of membrane biophysics and dynamics in integrin adhesion. We treated human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) with exogenous amphiphiles shown previously in model membranes and computationally to affect bilayer thickness and lipid phase separation and subsequently measured single integrin molecule adhesion kinetics using an optical trap, and diffusion using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS).  Benzyl alcohol (BA) partitions to liquid-disordered (Ld) domains, thins them, and causes the greatest increase in the hydrophobic mismatch between liquid-ordered (Lo) and Ld domains among the three amphiphiles, leading to domain separation. In HAECs, BA increased \u03b21-integrin-RGD affinity by 18% with a transition from single to double valency, consistent with a doubling of the molecular brightness of mCherry-tagged \u03b21-integrins measured using FCS. Accordingly, BA caused an increase in the size of FAK/paxillin positive peripheral adhesions and reduced migration speeds as measured using wound healing assays. Vitamin E (VE), which partitions to domain boundaries and disperses them by lowering edge energy, left integrin affinity unchanged, but reduced binding probability, leading to smaller focal adhesions, and equivalent migration speed relative to untreated cells. VE reversed the BA-induced decrease in migration speed. Triton X also thickens Lo domains but partitions to both lipid phases and left unchanged binding kinetics, focal adhesion sizes, and migration speed. These results demonstrate that only the amphiphile that thinned Ld lipid-domains increased \u03b21-integrin-RGD affinity and valency thus implicating Ld domains in modulating integrin adhesion, nascent adhesion formation, and cell migration.  \nTo study the membrane mechanical properties, we developed a method for measuring, in situ, dynamic mechanical changes in lipid bilayers. A model was developed that enabled the conversion of the first and second moments of a stretched exponential distribution of fluorescence lifetimes of 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3'3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) to the average area per lipid and variance of area per lipid, properties directly related to compressibility and bending moduli of lipid bilayers.  \nThis newly developed method enabled molecular scale assays of surface micromechanics of liposomal membranes and plasma membrane of human red blood cells (hRBCs) and HAECs. The mechanical properties of nanoliposomes vesicles were similar to other well-established standard techniques such as x-ray diffraction and neutron spin echo. In hRBCS, the mechanical moduli of the membrane were mainly related to the shape of the cells. The discocyte-echinocyte transition of hRBCs with ATP depletion decreased membrane compressibility and bending modulus.  Furthermore, Ld and Lo domains of the HAECs could be specifically targeted with DiIs of different lengths. The membrane mechanical properties of ATP-depleted HAECs were significantly changed only in membrane Lo phase, suspected to be lipid rafts, and preferential platforms for membrane-fodrin-actin linkages. \nThis new method was used to assess the role of benzyl alcohol (BA), shown previously to have profound effects on integrin-mediated cell adhesion, in modifying the mechanical properties of membranes at the lipid domain level.  Although BA has been shown in computational studies to partition to liquid disordered domains, it drives coalescence of both liquid ordered and disordered membranes by differentially thinning them and increasing the edge energy between the domains.  Accordingly, BA was shown to increase area per lipid and decrease compressibility and bending moduli in both domains.  Considering that lipid volume tends to be conserved in membranes, the increase in area per lipid is consistent with BA-induced thinning of membranes, shown computationally in previous studies.   The decreases in measured membrane compressibility and bending moduli are, in turn, consistent with the reductions in moduli that accompany thinning of membranes.      \nWe conclude that modification of the interrelated lipid bilayer structural properties of bilayer thickness, area per lipid, compressibility and bending moduli modify single integrin molecule affinity, diffusion, dimerization, and proximity to extracellular matrix molecules that result in changes in nascent focal adhesion assembly, cell migration, and mechanotransduction.   Such analysis supports a model of mechanotransduction in which the cytoskeleton, membrane, and glycocalyx form a dynamic complex that converges on integrins and coordinates the physical and chemical interaction of cells with their environment.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16865], "author_name_tesi": "Son, Seoyoung ", "last_name_ssi": "Son", "first_name_ssi": "Seoyoung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter J Butler", "Peter J Butler", "William O Hancock", "Justin Lee Brown", "Tae-Hee Lee", "Esther Winter Gomez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter J Butler, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter J Butler, Committee Chair", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Justin Lee Brown, Committee Member", "Tae-Hee Lee, Outside Member", "Esther Winter Gomez, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Integrin", "Membrane mechanical Properties", "Time-correlated single photon microscopy", "Cell adhesion", "Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy", "Optical trap"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Software-Based Disk Power Management for Scientific Applications", "id": "8847", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6094", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Power consumption by high-performance systems is becoming an increasing concern for system designers and software writers a like. Disk subsystem is known to be a major contributor to the overall power budget of high-performance systems.  Most scientific applications today rely heavily on disk I/O for out-of-core computations, checkpointing, and data visualization. To reduce excess energy consumption on disk system, prior studies proposed several hardware or OS-based disk power management schemes.  While such schemes have been known to be effective in certain cases, they might miss opportunities for better energy savings due to their reactive nature. While compiler based schemes can make more accurate decisions on a given application by extracting disk access patterns statically, the lack of runtime information on the status of shared disks may lead to wrong decisions when multiple applications exercise the same set of disks concurrently.  Therefore, quantitative comparison of reactive, compiler-based, and hybrid schemes is very important.\n\nThis dissertation makes four major contributions towards more effective disk power management for scientific applications that use disk-resident data frequently (i.e., so called I/O-intensive applications).  First, it shows that, while conventional hardware  based disk power management scheme is useful in certain cases, compiler-driven approach can be more effective for array-based scientific applications executing on parallel architectures.  Second, it shows that restructuring the application code increases length of disk idle periods, thereby leading to better exploitation of available power-saving capabilities. Third, it proposes a compiler-directed energy-aware prefetching scheme for scientific applications that process disk-resident data sets.

It has caused fundamental changes in many scientific fields. This thesis studies the strengths and limits of quantum computing from a cryptographic perspective. Our main focus is on investigating how secure computation, a central subject in classical cryptography, changes in a quantum world. In another endeavor, we also examine the potential of efficient quantum algorithms for solving some computational problems, which are regarded hard classically and are used in cryptographic constructions.  \n\nSecure computation allows a group of players to jointly perform a computational task on their private inputs without revealing more information about their inputs beyond what the output values imply. There are secure protocols that can realize any poly-time computation task under various conditions~\\cite{F:Yao86,S:GMW87,S:CLOS02,S:Kilian88}. However, these classical protocols may become insecure in presence of quantum attacks. First of all, quantum algorithms, e.g., Shor's quantum factoring algorithm~\\cite{Shor97}, can solve some computational problems efficiently, which are otherwise assumed hard classically to construct cryptographic protocols. Even if we assume some problems are also hard for quantum computers, classically secure protocols based on them can still be broken by a quantum attacker without solving the hard problem necessarily. On the other hand, we can also exploit quantum computing capability in a positive way.  For example, Bennett et al.~\\cite{C:BBCS91} constructed a quantum protocol for oblivious transfer (OT) that is secure against unbounded attackers, assuming existence of an ideal {commitment} protocol. Remarkably, such a goal is unattainable using purely classical protocols. \n\nIn view of these challenges and opportunities, we make two major contributions in the realm of secure computation: first we prove that there are classical protocols for computing any poly-time function securely against poly-time quantum attackers and show that a large family of classical protocols can be made secure against quantum attackers. This means that the classical feasibility picture largely remains unchanged in the presence of quantum attacks. Second, we construct a quantum OT protocol assuming a task called \\emph{2-bit cut-and-choose} is already realized, which gives another demonstration of separation between quantum and classical protocols in the flavor of~\\cite{C:BBCS91}. Along the way we also develop new tools that are useful when analyzing quantum cryptographic protocols. As an application of our two-fold investigation into secure computation in a quantum world, we are able to give an almost thorough categorization of an important class of two-party secure computation tasks. Very roughly speaking, if we consider quantum poly-time attackers, there is a zero-one law, analogous to the classical setting~\\cite{C:MPR10}: every task is either feasible or it can be used to realize any other task. Whereas in the presence of unbounded attackers, every task belongs into one of three mutually exclusive subclasses, in contrast with the more complicated classical picture~\\cite{TCC:MPR09,TCC:KMQ11}.  \n\nAs we have seen, certain computational assumptions can be broken by efficient quantum algorithms. It is thus crucial to understand which problems are easy or hard for quantum computers. In this direction, we show evidence that an important number-theoretical problem can by solved by an efficient quantum algorithm. Specifically, we show that finding the group of units in a number field of arbitrary degree (Unit-Finding) can be reduced to an hidden subgroup problem (HSP). The best classical algorithm requires super-polynomial time to compute the units. Therefore it has also been used to as a candidate of hardness assumption for cryptographic constructions. However, our result indicates that finding units is potentially easy on a quantum computer, as the HSP instance to which we reduce is a natural generalization of the HSP instances for which there exist efficient quantum algorithms (e.g., HSP over finite Abelien groups and over constant-dimension real spaces). Thus we have made the first substantial step towards a complete quantum algorithm solving Unit-Finding.

We describe a new method called CAGE for recon- \nstructing the recent evolutionary history of gene clusters, and evaluate its performance \non both simulated data and actual human gene clusters. \nAlthough our CAGE program for inferring the evolutionary history of gene clus- \nters provides useful information, our analysis still encounters computational challenges. \nOne of the ma jor reasons for these di&#64259;culties is gene conversion among the duplicated \nregions of the cluster, which can obscure their true relationships. Many computational \nmethods for detecting gene conversion events have been released, but their performance \nhas not been assessed for wide deployment in evolutionary history studies due to a lack \nof accurate evaluation methods. We designed a new method that simulates gene cluster \nevolution, including large-scale events of duplication, deletion, and conversion as well as \nsmall mutations. We used this simulation data to evaluate several di&#64256;erent programs for \ndetecting gene conversion events. Our evaluation identi&#64257;es strengths and weaknesses of \nseveral methods for detecting gene conversion. \nTo correct the distorted information generated by traditional methods for analyz- \ning sequence data in gene clusters such as construction of phylogenetic trees or multi- \nspecies alignments, we have developed an automated pipeline for detecting conversion \nevents using the best performance in our evaluation study.

Accurately mapping orthology, however, is complicated by conversion \nevents. \nWe propose a re&#64257;ned method of orthology assignment based on two paradigms \nfor interpreting the de&#64257;nition: by position or by content.

We have developed a computational method for automatically \nmapping both types of orthology in gene clusters, and have extended our CHAP software \npackage for analyzing cluster histories to include this new orthology pipeline; we call this \nnew package CHAP 2. Our results are visualized for users to examine easily.\nWe evaluate this method using both simulation data and real gene clusters, in- \ncluding the well-known &#945;-globin and &#946; -globin clusters.

Goal orientation is important in problem solving because it guides students\u00a1\u00af intrinsic motivation in solving problems. Recently, some researchers have suggested that a person\u00a1\u00afs goal orientation can be modified by contextual attributes that influence goal orientation. A common limitation of previous studies failed to take into account a combination of contextual attributes that affect goal orientation.  This study predicts that providing a specific type of goal-oriented context including a combination of essential contextual attributes will develop the intended goal orientation. <br>  \nWorking in a peer group also has been shown to facilitate intrinsic motivation and problem solving skills. Typically, peer group learning advocates recommend that students are grouped heterogeneously. In this study, self-efficacy was chosen to form more effective peer groups because it mediates the relationship between goal orientation and performance. <br>  \nThis study, therefore, examined 1) the effect of types of goal-oriented contexts and 2) the effect of types of peer group composition by self-efficacy levels on intrinsic motivation and problem solving skills. Interaction effects between these two factors were also investigated first for all students participating in the study and then for students with low-levels of self-efficacy only. <br>  \nNinety sixth-grade students from four classrooms at one rural middle school located in the northeastern United States participated in this study. A 2 x 2 randomized factorial design was used. The independent variables in this study were types of goal-oriented contexts (learning, performance) and types of peer group composition (heterogeneous, homogeneous). Two different versions of a Web-based PBL treatment were developed for this study, providing either a learning-oriented context or a performance-oriented context. Each treatment included three essential contextual attributes promoting goal orientation: a) tasks design, b) distribution of authority, and c) evaluation practice. Dependent variables were intrinsic motivation and three components of problem solving skills (problem representation, solution development, and monitoring and evaluation). <br>  \nThe results showed some significant findings. First, for intrinsic motivation, the factorial ANCOVA showed a significant main effect for the types of goal-oriented contexts, F (1, 85) = 3.95, p < .05. Students working in the learning-oriented-context (M = 3.49, SD =.69) had a significantly higher intrinsic motivation score than the students working in the performance-oriented context (M = 3.16, SD =.66). Second, for problem solving skills, the factorial ANOVA showed a significant main effect for types of peer group composition on one component of problem solving skills, monitoring and evaluation, F (1, 86) = 5.57, p <.05. Students working in the heterogeneous groups had an overall average of .57 (SD = .96) on monitoring and evaluation, while students working in the homogeneous groups had an overall average of .18 (SD = .50).   Third, for the relationship between goal orientation, intrinsic motivation, and problem solving skills, different patterns of correlations were found according to the treatment group. A significant positive correlation was found between the learning-goal orientation and solution development (r = .491, p <. 05,. n = 23) for the students who participated in the learning-oriented context in heterogeneous peer groups, while no significant correlation was found for the students who participated in the performance-oriented context in homogeneous peer groups. <br>  \nThe findings of this study have important implications for the design of problem solving learning environments. First, given that intrinsic motivation is increased by a learning-oriented context, instructional designers should provide a context that stresses the intrinsic value of learning, allows students to choose learning activities of their interests, and provides self-referenced evaluation. Second, given that the heterogeneous peer groups had significantly higher scores on monitoring and evaluation, instructional designers should provide opportunities for students to work in heterogeneous peer groups to promote higher levels of cognitive skills. Third, the positive correlation between the learning goal orientation and solution development implies that instructional designers should employ the contextual attributes in problem solving environments resulting in increasing students\u00a1\u00af learning goal orientation. <br>  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2394], "author_name_tesi": "Song, Hae-Deok ", "last_name_ssi": "Song", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hae-Deok", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara L Grabowski", "Kyle Leonard Peck", "Susan M Land", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Alison Alene Carr Chellman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara L Grabowski, Committee Chair", "Kyle Leonard Peck, Committee Member", "Susan M Land, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Alison Alene Carr Chellman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Achievement Goal Orientation", "Goal-Oriented Context", "Peer Group", "Intrinsic Motivation", "Problem Solving"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "NONPARAMETRIC IDENTIFICATION AND SEMI-NONPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF FIRST-PRICE AUCTIONS\n\n", "id": "7743", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2297", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, we study nonparametric identification of first-price auction models and propose a semi-nonparametric simulated integrated\nmoment estimation method to recover the underlying value distribution.\n\n\nIn the first essay, we investigate the  nonparametric identification of the first-price auction model. In most cases in the nonparametric auction literature, the support of the bidders' values is assumed to be bounded. We show via an\nalternative nonparametric identification proof that the boundedness assumption can be relaxed to the condition that the value distribution has a finite expectation. In the first instance, we\nshow this for the case of independent and identical first-price auctions, and then we extend the proof to the case of first-price auctions with observed auction-specific heterogeneity. Also, we\nconsider the case where the log of the values is modeled as a median regression model, and the case where the bidders know ex-ante the actual number of bidders rather than the number of potential\nbidders. \n\n\nIn the second essay, we propose a  semi-nonparametric simulated integrated moment (SNP-SIM) to estimate the value distribution of\nindependently repeated identical first-price auctions. First, we construct an increasing sequence of compact metric spaces of distribution functions (the sieve), based on the approach in Bierens (2007). Given a candidate value distribution function in the sieve, we simulate bids according to the equilibrium bid function involved. We take the difference of the empirical characteristic functions of the actual and simulated bids as the moment function. The objective function is then the integral of the squared moment function over an interval. Minimizing this integral to the distribution functions in the sieve then yields a uniformly consistent semi-nonparametric estimator of the actual value distribution. Also, we propose an\nintegrated moment test for the validity of the first-price auction model, and a data-driven method for the choice of the sieve order.\nFinally, we conduct a few numerical experiments to check the performance of our approach.\n\n\nIn the third essay, we propose to estimate first-price auction models with observed auction-specific heterogeneity via a semi-nonparametric simulated integrated conditional moment (SNP-SICM) method. The auction-specific heterogeneity will be incorporated via a median regression model for the log values with unknown error distribution. The latter distribution will be modeled semi-nonparametrically using orthonormal Legendre polynomials, similar to the approach in Bierens (2007). Given a parametric specification of the median function, the semi-nonparametric conditional value distribution involved can be estimated consistently by minimizing the integrated square distance between the empirical characteristic functions of the actual bids and the simulated bids, together with the covariates, via an integrated conditional moment criterion. This approach yields as a by-product an integrated conditional moment test for the validity of the model. Moreover, we apply the SNP-SICM estimation method to the US timber auction data and test the validity of the first-price auction model\nfor this data.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2277], "author_name_tesi": "Song, Hosin ", "last_name_ssi": "Song", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hosin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herman J Bierens", "Quang H Vuong", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse", "Runze Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herman J Bierens, Committee Chair", "Quang H Vuong, Committee Chair", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["First-price Auctions", "Nonparametric Identification", "Semi-nonparametric Estimation", "Sieve", "Simulated Integrated Conditional Moment", "Simulated Integrated Moment"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "SECURE WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS: BUILDING BLOCKS AND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n", "id": "7780", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2296", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sensor networks are ideal candidates for a wide range of applications, such \nas monitoring of critical infrastructures, data acquisition in hazardous \nenvironments, and military operations.

One potential approach is by understanding hikers\u2019 involvement in the activity and setting. This study examined hikers\u2019 specialization and attachment to the setting through comparing different settings, investigating relationships with satisfaction, and developing a typology of hikers. Data for this study were collected using onsite interviews of Appalachian Trail (AT) and Olle Trail (OT) hikers. \n The first chapter provides an introduction and conceptual framework for the study. Results are then shown in the following three chapters, and summarized in chapter 5.\n Chapter 2 compares American and Korean hikers across individual dimensions of specialization and place attachment. A series of tests were conducted to understand the relationship between specialization and place attachment. There were interesting differences between them. Results suggest that knowledge and skill in hiking were not predictors of place attachment for both groups of hikers. While AT hikers\u2019 hiking involvement (i.e. affective dimension) had only a direct influence on place identity, OT hikers\u2019 involvement showed significant effects on place identity and place dependence. \n Chapter 3 focuses on expanding the relationship between specialization and place attachment theory by examining their association with satisfaction in outdoor recreation. Findings suggest the affective dimension of specialization has a linear relationship with both the place identity and place dependence factors of place attachment, which in turn made hikers feel more satisfied with their hiking and the setting itself. For the relationship between place attachment and satisfaction, there were different patterns for individual dimensions of place attachment with individual dimensions of hiking and place satisfaction. While the achievement dimension of hiking satisfaction and the amenity aspect of place satisfaction were influenced by place identity, place dependence was a significant predictor of the other aspects of hiking (i.e., enjoyment dimension) and place (i.e., nature dimension) satisfaction.  \n Chapter 4 develops a hiker typology of specialization and place attachment and tries to examine the simultaneous effects of both concepts on hikers\u2019 behavior. Three types of hikers emerged and included \u201cNovice\u201d, \u201cAffection driven\u201d, and \u201cExpert\u201d hikers. Significant differences existed among the types of hikers on both specialization and place attachment. Comparatively, the \u201cExpert\u201d class included older, higher income, more experienced and more educated hikers than the \u201cNovice\u201d group. Through these classes, I found that as specialization in hiking and place attachment to the setting increased, satisfaction (i.e., to the hiking and place at the site) and intention to revisit also increased.  In addition, the \u201cAffection driven\u201d group showed different patterns for individual dimensions of specialization. For this class, place attachment was highly related to the affective dimension of specialization (i.e., activity involvement).   \n Overall findings from the study indicate specialization and place attachment have a significant relationship in hiking, as previously thought. Past experience and hiking involvement (i.e., affective dimensions of specialization) were significant predictors of place attachment at both U.S. and Korea trails. Through this study, I found that as a trail develops and gains more popularity, the behavioral and cognitive aspects of specialization revealed a weaker relationship with attachment to the setting. Additionally, the mediation results indicated that place attachment was positively related to satisfaction. Results also showed that evaluations do vary significantly across the user typologies with the more specialized and more attached hikers being more satisfied with the setting and showing a higher intention to revisit. Future research is needed to examine these relationships in the same and other settings over periods of time.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9541], "author_name_tesi": "Song, Hwasung ", "last_name_ssi": "Song", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hwasung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan R Graefe", "Alan R Graefe", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "William F.

However, a critical level of interply shear strain, which governs the gross failure of composite laminate due to the delamination, appeared to be independent of different lay-up of 2-ply vs. symmetric 4-ply configuration.  Reflecting their matrix-dominated failure modes such as cord-matrix debonding and delamination, composite laminates with different cord reinforcements showed the same S-N relationship as long as they were constructed with the same rubber matrix, the same cord angle, similar cord volume, and the same ply lay-up.  Because of much lower values of single cycle strength (in terms of gross fracture load per unit width), the composite laminates with larger cord angle and the 2-ply laminates exhibited exponentially shorter fatigue lifetime, at a given stress amplitude, than the composite laminates with smaller cord angle and 4-ply symmetric laminates, respectively.  The increase of interply rubber thickness lengthens their fatigue lifetime at an intermediate level of stress amplitude.  However, the increase in the fatigue lifetime of the composite laminate becomes less noticeable at very low stress amplitude.  Even with small compressive cyclic stresses, the fatigue life of belt composites is predominantly influenced by the magnitude of maximum stress.  Maximum cyclic strain of composite laminates at failure, which measures the total strain accumulation for gross failure, was independent of stress amplitude and close to the level of static failure strain.  For all composite laminates under study, a linear correlation could be established between the temperature rise rate and dynamic creep rate which was, in turn, inversely proportional to the fatigue lifetime.  Using the acoustic emission (AE) initiation stress value, better prediction of fatigue life was available for the fiber-reinforced composites having fatigue limit. The accumulation rate of AE activities during cyclic loading was linearly proportional to the maximum applied load and to the inverse of the fatigue life of cord-rubber composite laminates.  Finally, a modified fatigue modulus model based on combination of power-law and logarithmic relation was proposed to predict the fatigue lifetime profile of cord-rubber composite laminates.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3206], "author_name_tesi": "Song, Jaehoon ", "last_name_ssi": "Song", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jaehoon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Francesco Costanzo", "Albert Eliot Segall", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Maurice Francis Amateau", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Francesco Costanzo, Committee Chair", "Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Maurice Francis Amateau, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["LIFE PREDICTION", "TIRE", "CORD-RUBBER COMPOSITES", "FATIGUE", "ACOUSTIC EMISSION"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE INTEGRATIVE DETERMINANTS OF ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE\nIMPROVEMENT: THE IMPACTS OF DIMENSIONS OF LEARNING\nORGANIZATION AND DYNAMIC KNOWLEDGE CREATION\n\n", "id": "8461", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3098", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to identify the structural pathways of the learning\norganization cultural aspects and knowledge creation process as they relate to determinations of\nthe perceived organizational performance improvement in the Korean context.\nDimensions of the learning organization and knowledge creation process-- SECI\nknowledge conversion theory -- have been adapted, and are the independent variables; the levels\nof organizational financial increase and the intensity of organizational knowledge gain are\nexplored as dependent variables.\nData were collected from five different types of businesses in the Korean conglomerate\nthrough the in-house intranet on-line self-response questionnaire.

In this study, an Arabidopsis miRNA gene, AtMIR171a, was characterized and used as a model to study the biogenesis and function of plant miRNAs. \n\nAtMIR171a is a strongly conserved miRNA that is expressed at high levels in Arabidopsis. The transcription unit of the AtMIR171a gene is quite complex. It has at least three transcription start sites, Pri-I, -II and -III. It also contains alternative splice sites and alternative polyadenylation sites. Most transcripts of the AtMIR171a locus initiate at the transcription start site Pri-I located 74 bp upstream of the putative AtMIR171a-containing stem-loop. The complexity of the gene structure may reflect the low selection pressure exerted outside the stem-loop structure.\n\nMutations in three genes have been identified to affect miRNA accumulation in Arabidopsis. These genes are Dicer-like1 (DCL1), Hua Enhancer1 (HEN1) and Hyponastic Leaves1 (HYL1). DCL1 encodes an RNase III enzyme that cleaves miRNA precursors to generate mature miRNAs. HEN1 codes for a methyltransferase that prevents uridylation and degradation of small RNAs by methylating the ribose of the 3\u2019-most nucleotides in the miRNA:miRNA* or siRNA:siRNA* duplex. HYL1 encodes a double-stranded RNA binding protein (dsRBP) which has two double-stranded RNA binding motifs (DSRM) in its N-terminal region. Three lines of evidence suggest that HYL1 and DCL1 act in the same step in miRNA biogenesis. First, the loss-of-function homozygotes of dcl1 and hyl1 exhibit similar development defects. Second, the accumulation of mature miRNA is reduced in both dcl1 and hyl1 mutant plants. Third, a previous study showed that a dsRBP R2D2 facilitates an RNase III protein DCR-2 in loading siRNA into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in Drosophila. This suggests that an RNase III enzyme interacts with a specific dsRBP in gene silencing. To test whether HYL1 acts with DCL1 in miRNA biogenesis, the amounts of AtMIR171a precursors were measured by northern blotting and RT-PCR.\n\nThe results showed that unlike hen1 homozygotes, which do not accumulate pri-AtMIR171a, both hyl1 and dcl1 mutants have much greater amounts of pri-AtMIR171a than wildtype plants. Therefore the paucity of mature AtMIR171a in hyl1 and dcl1 mutant plants is not attributable to either reduced miRNA stability or decreased transcription from the AtMIR171a gene, but is caused by a defect in the processing of pri-miRNA. In addition to the genetic evidence, the co-localization of HYL1 and DCL1 in the nucleoplasm and in perinucleolar bodies further supports the notion that these two proteins function together in miRNA biogenesis. The HYL1-DCL1-containing bodies are distinguishable from Cajal bodies, which contains the DCL3-dependent siRNA silencing machinery, because neither Arabidopsis Cajal body marker, AtCoilin or U2B\u201d, co-localizes with HYL1. When HYL1 and SE, another protein involved in miRNA biogenesis, were co-expressed in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts, the two proteins displayed partially overlapping distribution in the nucleus. Recent studies showed that SE, along with the two cap-binding proteins CBP20 and CBP80, are required for correct splicing of pre-mRNAs. CBP20 and CBP80 also control proper miRNA processing as mutations of the CBP20 and CBP80 genes lead to increased amounts of pri-miRNAs and decreased mature miRNA levels. Therefore, it appears likely that SE acts as a bridge to assemble pri-miRNAs with DCL1 and HYL1. It remains unknown whether the pri-miRNAs are transported to the DCL1-HYL1 bodies for cleavage or the DCL1 and HYL1 proteins are recruited to the sites of transcription to process pri-miRNA.\n\nAtMIR171a has been shown to direct the cleavage of three SCL6-like genes, SCL6-II, SCL6-III and SCL6-IV. To determine the function of the SCL6-like genes, an AtMIR171a fragment was overexpressed in Col-0 background to simultaneously knockdown the SCL6-like transcripts. The silencing of the three SCL6-like genes causes many developmental defects such as abnormal inflorescence and flower development, abnormal phyllotaxy, reduced shoot branching from both cauline rosette leaf axils, epinastic dark green leaves, and reduced primary root length. There is a positive correlation between the AtMIR171a expression level and the severity of phenotypes. The pleiotropic phenotypes observed in the transgenic plants overexpressing the AtMIR171a fragment (171a-OX) may partially be caused by abnormal expression of WUS, as the WUS transcript level increases in 171a-OX seedlings. \n\nTo assess the biological importance of the AtMIR171-mediated post-transcriptional silencing of the SCL6-like transcripts, wildtype or AtMIR171-resistant SCL6-like::GUS genes were expressed from gene native promoters in Col-0. GUS staining assays detected all three wildtype or AtMIR171-resistant SCL6-like::GUS proteins in root tips. In the aerial organs, the expressions of the wildtype SCL6-like::GUS proteins were reduced compared to those of their AtMIR171a-resistant counterparts, indicating that AtMIR171 restricts the expression of the SCL6-like genes in shoots but not in roots.\n\nA previous study has shown that the long, near-perfectly base-paired primary transcripts of several recently evolved miRNA genes are processed by DCL4, while the canonical miRNA precursors are cleaved by DCL1. These observations suggest that the canonical miRNA precursors have acquired the appropriate secondary structure that can be preferentially processed by the DCL1-dependent miRNA-biogenesis machinery. Canonical miRNA precursors have imperfectly base-paired stem-loop structures. To determine how the secondary structure of miRNA precursor determines the processing of miRNA, a series of mutations were introduced to alter the secondary structure of two pri-miRNAs, pri-AtMIR171a and pri-AtMIR167a. The mutated and wild-type pri-miRNAs were over-expressed in Arabidopsis and the phenotypes of the transgenic plants were analyzed. Over-expression of the wild-type pri-miRNA resulted in moderate to severe phenotypic effects, such as reduced shoot branching caused by over-expression of pri-AtMIR171a, or reduced silique length caused by over-expression of pri-AtMIR167a. When the base-pairing at the bottom of the miRNA-containing stem-loop was fully abolished, the transgenic plants were similar to those transformed with the vector alone. When the bulges and mismatches at the bottom of the miRNA-containing stem-loop were replaced by perfectly matched base pairs, the transgenic plants exhibited less severe phenotypes compared to those over-expressing wild-type pri-miRNAs. In contrast, removal of the bulges near the terminal loop in the miRNA-containing stem-loop did not significantly reduce the severity of the phenotypes observed upon over-expression of the wild-type pri-miRNA. Consistent with the phenotypic effects, lower levels of mature miRNA were observed in plants expressing pri-miRNA structural variants causing less severe phenotypes. Overall, these observations suggest that a stem with bulges and mismatches at the bottom of the miRNA-embedded hairpin is the most important structural feature for optimal miRNA processing.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3880], "author_name_tesi": "Song, Liang ", "last_name_ssi": "Song", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Liang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nina Fedoroff", "Nina Fedoroff", "Michael Axtell", "Hong Ma", "Timothy W Mcnellis", "Teh Hui Kao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nina Fedoroff, Dissertation Advisor", "Nina Fedoroff, Committee Chair", "Michael Axtell, Committee Member", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DCL1", "Arabidopsis", "SCL", "miR167a", "miR171a", "HYL1", "miRNA biogenesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Korean mothers' beliefs and practices on early English education in ESL and EFL contexts", "id": "6128", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6025", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nThis study examines the relationship between the beliefs and practices of mothers and children\u00a1\u00afs learning experiences.

To examine Korean parents\u00a1\u00af enthusiastic attitudes toward early English education, the researcher describes their subjective beliefs and self-reported practices.  \nThe present study is designed to employ both qualitative methodology and Q-sort methodology.  To collect data, the researcher met 30 Korean mothers individually, some in Korea and some in the United States.  Among them, eight mothers in Korea and eight mothers in the United States were randomly selected and interviewed.  The purpose of the interviews was to elaborate on the mothers\u00a1\u00af beliefs and practices through narratives that would complement the data from the Q-sorts.  Using Q-sort methodology, the researcher examined mothers\u00a1\u00af subjective beliefs concerning early English education and conducted semi-structured interviews using a standardized, open-ended strategy to describe and compare mothers\u00a1\u00af beliefs in different sociocultural contexts.  \nThe results of this study were the following: (1) Similarities and differences exist in mothers\u00a1\u00af beliefs concerning early English education in different contexts.  Mothers in both contexts showed positive beliefs concerning early English education, even though their satisfaction was higher in the EFL context.  Mothers in Korea clearly showed more enthusiastic belief in direct mother-child interaction in early English education than mothers did in the United States; (2) Mothers in Korea and mothers in the United States reported different patterns of practices related to early English education at home.  Mothers in Korea were more likely to hire a tutor, provide printed materials regularly, use websites to find materials, tell stories in English, and listen to audio tapes.  On the other hand, mothers in the United States were more likely to read books in English, show foreign films, sing songs in English, and teach the alphabets at home.  These differences in maternal practices are the result of the different contexts that they are in; (3) The beliefs of mothers in Korea can be clustered into five groups, and the beliefs of mothers in the United States can be clustered into four groups through factor analysis; (4) Mothers\u00a1\u00af demographic characteristics, such as their English proficiency and number of children, are associated with some maternal practices related to early English education, such as teaching the alphabet.  \nIn sum, mothers\u00a1\u00af sociocultural contexts influence some of their beliefs, but not all, and their practices at home, even if they share have educational and social backgrounds.  Despite their differences regarding some beliefs and reported practices, Korean mothers in ESL and EFL contexts have strong beliefs concerning early English education and they clearly value English learning through enjoyment for their young children.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6017], "author_name_tesi": "Song, Seung-Min ", "last_name_ssi": "Song", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seung-Min", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson", "Susan Mary Land", "Jamie Myers", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson, Committee Chair", "Susan Mary Land, Committee Member", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Integrating social relationship dynamics into the association between emotional disturbances and physical health: A stress psychophysiological approach", "id": "19762", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9463", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Interpersonal stress from conflictive social interactions and emotional disturbances are robust psychosocial predictors of physical health. However, there has been little research on the joint effects of social relationships and emotion on health. The current dissertation provided two theoretical models to explain biopsychosocial mechanisms by which emotional factors and social dynamics interact and relate to affect physical health outcomes, including general health status, inflammation, and sleep.  \nThe first study of this dissertation involved an examination of the effects of having multiple negative social relationships on inflammatory cytokine responses to stress and whether trait hostility aggravates the effects of negative relationships over and above effects of depressed mood. Participants were healthy young adults who were challenged with a laboratory stress protocol to measure physiological responses after stress; they were also asked about negativity in their relationships with a romantic partner, roommates, friends, and family as well as levels of trait hostility and depressed mood. Results showed that those who reported negativity in multiple social relationships showed greater IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 responses to stress; they also had higher mean IL-6 across time, and less reactivity in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Differences in mean IL-6 and diastolic blood pressure (but not changes in IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 to stress) were accounted for by either depressed mood or hostility. Overall, this research indicates that having multiple negative relationships may exacerbate acute inflammatory responses to a laboratory stressor. \nThe second study focused on the relationship with a romantic partner and how negative and positive emotional states may interact with couple interactions to affect sleep of chronic pain patients. Knee osteoarthritis patients and their partners were assessed for their daily positive and negative emotional states, three different partner responses to pain behaviors (empathic, punishing or solicitous), and subjective sleep quality across 14 consecutive days. Results demonstrated that higher daily negative emotional states and lower positive emotional states were associated with poorer sleep of patients. Interactions between emotional states and partner solicitous responses were observed, such that higher solicitousness strengthened the association between both negative and positive emotional states and sleep. Thus, the second study demonstrated that day to day fluctuations in negative and positive emotional states can interact with partner behaviors to affect nightly sleep quality among knee osteoarthritis patients. \nThe third study examined whether different aspects of negativity in marital relationships mediate the association between depressive symptoms and physical health.  Adults with a married spouse or partner were asked about their depressive symptoms at baseline, three indicators of negativity in their relationship (marital risk, spousal emotional strain, and marital disagreement) at 9 year follow-up, and physical health outcomes at 10 year follow-up, including three markers of inflammation (CRP, IL-6, and sIL-6r), sleep quality, and numbers of physical symptoms and chronic conditions. The results showed that depressive symptoms at Time 1 were associated with greater marital risk at Time 2 and lower sleep quality at Time 3, and that marital risk and sleep quality in turn were associated with greater number of physical symptoms and chronic conditions at Time 3. Age and gender moderations for these associations were observed. These results demonstrate that impaired marital relationships and sleep can explain the processes by which depressive symptoms aggravate physical health over time. \n\tFindings connect the emotion and social relationship literatures and explain how those processes are closely connected to affect physical health. Applying the stress amplifying model of social relationship and stress generation model of depression, this dissertation found specific pathways for how social interactions can aggravate the impact of emotional disturbances on health and how emotional disorders may have long lasting effects on health by impairing the marital relationship.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9254], "author_name_tesi": "Song, Sunmi ", "last_name_ssi": "Song", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sunmi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Elise Graham Engeland", "Jennifer Elise Graham Engeland", "Elizabeth Susman", "Laura Klein", "William Ray"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Elise Graham Engeland, Dissertation Advisor", "Jennifer Elise Graham Engeland, Committee Member", "Elizabeth Susman, Committee Member", "Laura Klein, Committee Member", "William Ray, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["social stress", "social relationships", "emotional factors", "inflammation", "psychophysiology"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Locating Petroleum Sources Using Dsp Techniques", "id": "25095", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11181", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the last several decades, techniques used in detecting underground oil and gas have become mature.

We show that, under some mild technical conditions, the RV-SIS possesses a sure independence property, which is defined by Fan and Lv (2008). Numerical comparisons suggest that RV-SIS has competitive performance compared to other screening procedure and outperforms them in many different model settings. Third, we develop a test procedure for the hypothesis of a constant regression function, and also a test-based variable screening procedure. We study the asymptotic theory for the variance of the regression function and use it to introduce a new test procedure for testing the significance of a predictor. Using the set of p-values, we introduce a variable screening procedure with a specified desirable false discovery rate by using Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) approach.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11077], "author_name_tesi": "Song, Won Chul", "last_name_ssi": "Song", "middle_name_ssi": "Chul", "first_name_ssi": "Won", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael G Akritas", "Runze Li", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin", "Jingzhi Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael G Akritas, Dissertation Advisor", "Runze Li, Committee Member", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Committee Member", "Jingzhi Huang, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sure independence screening", "test-based screening", "Ultrahigh dimensionality"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Geometric Quantization, reduction and K-homology", "id": "19877", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9431", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Let G be a compact connected Lie group acting on a stable complex manifold M that has an equivariant vector bundle E on it.

KJ (ATCC strain BAA-592).  To investigate the effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) on perchlorate reduction, anaerobically grown cultures of Dechlorosoma sp. KJ were exposed to near-saturated concentration of DO for various periods of time.  It was determined that cells exposed to oxygen for more than 12 hours were incapable of reducing perchlorate.  Cells exposed to oxygen for less than 12 hours, when re-introduced to anoxic conditions, quickly reduced the redox potential to highly negative values (-127 mV to -337 mV) and were able to reduce perchlorate or chlorite. This result suggested that aeration during backwashing of biofilm reactors, or exposure of perchlorate-degrading cell suspensions to oxygen for periods of less than 12 hours, will not be detrimental to the ability of perchlorate-degrading bacteria to use perchlorate as an electron acceptor.\n\nInhibitors were used to block specific respiratory enzymes, and thus to identify elements of the electron transport chain (ETC) involved in the reduction of molecular oxygen and perchlorate (Chapters 3 and 4).  Inhibition of dissimilative perchlorate reduction by a low concentration of cyanide was due to oxygen build up, not inhibition of enzymes used for perchlorate reduction.  The threshold DO concentration to inhibit perchlorate reduction was < 0.04 mg/L.  The main ETC used by cells grown on high DO concentrations likely contains cytochrome bc1, cytochrome c and cytochrome aa3.  When cells were grown on perchlorate, DO uptake occurred via a shorter ETC than that used by cells grown at higher DO concentrations.  The ETC to oxygen at low DO concentrations is branched off the quinone to cytochrome bd, while the ETC to perchlorate is branched off the quinone to perchlorate reductase.  These results should be useful in helping to improve the design and operation of biological perchlorate treatment systems. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6861], "author_name_tesi": "Song, Yanguang ", "last_name_ssi": "Song", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yanguang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "William D Burgos", "John Michael Regan", "Maryann Victoria Bruns"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Chair", "William D Burgos, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["perchlorate reduction", "bioremediation", "perchlorate", "electron transport chain", "redox potential"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "NANOCOMPOSITES OF POLYMERS WITH LAYERED INORGANIC NANOFILLERS: ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY, THERMO-MECHANICAL PROPERTIES, MORPHOLOGY, AND DISPERSION  \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "10333", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5025", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-01-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the first part of the thesis, polyethylene/layered silicate nanocomposites that exhibit an antimicrobial activity were synthesized and studied. Their antimicrobial activity was designed to originate from non-leaching, novel cationic modifiers \u2013amine-based surfactants\u2013 used as the organic-modification of the fillers. Specifically, PE/organically-modified montmorillonite (mmt) nanocomposites were prepared via melt-processing, and simultaneous dispersion and antimicrobial activity was designed by proper choice of the fillers\u2019 organic modification. The antimicrobial activity was measured against three micotoxinogen fungal strains (Penicillium roqueforti and claviforme, and Fusarium graminearum). Various mmt-based organofillers, which only differ in the type or amount of their organic modification, were used to exemplify how these surfactants can be designed to render antifungal activity to the fillers themselves and the respective nanocomposites. A comparative discussion of the growth of fungi on unfilled PE and nanocomposite PE films is used to demonstrate how the antimicrobial efficacy is dictated by the surfactant chemistry and, further, how the nanocomposites' inhibitory activity compares to that of the organo-fillers and the surfactants. An attempt to improve the thermomechanical reinforcement of PE/mmt nanocomposites while maintaining their antimicrobial activity, was also carried out by combining two different organically modified montmorillonites. However, a uniform microscopic dispersion could not be achieved through this approach.\nIn the second part of this thesis, a number of fundamental studies relating to structure-property relations in nanocomposites were carried out, towards unveiling strategies that can concurrently optimize selected properties of polymers by the addition of nanofillers. Specifically, the dispersion-crystallinity-reinforcement relations in HDPE/mmt nanocomposites was investigated. The influence of a functional HDPE compatibilizer\u2019s characteristics to the thermo-mechanical properties of their nanocomposites was systematically explored. The appropriate compatibilizer, based on HDPE-g-MA, was identified from achieving the best mechanical performance, i.e., maximizing the tensile modulus improvement without sacrificing the polymer ductility, which was found to be achieved where the smallest crystallinity change occured. It was revealed that lower-than-the matrix molecular weight HDPE-g-MA better enhanced the tensile properties across three HDPEs, compared to that of high viscosity HDPE-g-MA, while the flexural properties were not markedly affected by this parameter, but rather were mostly determined by the amount of clay nanofiller. Finally, polymer/layered double hydroxide (LDH, positively-charged layered clays, also termed as \u2018anionic\u2019 clays referring to their anion exchange capacity) were characterized as potential fillers for a variety of polymer matrices. The main focus in this part of the research was on the morphology and dispersion of the LDH as it related to their composition and their organic modification in relation to the nature of various polymers. Exemplary polymer matrices that span the range from non-polar to polar interactions \u2013including Polypropylene (PP), polyethylenes (PE, and PE-copolymers), polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA), polystyrene (PS)\u2013 were explored. It was observed that the LDH composition, organic modification, and polymer types were the parameters which controlled the LDH structure and dispersion, albeit in a rather involved fashion.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5001], "author_name_tesi": "Songtipya, Ponusa ", "last_name_ssi": "Songtipya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ponusa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Evangelos Manias", "Evangelos Manias", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco", "James Patrick Runt", "Sridhar Komarneni", "Gary Lynn Messing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Evangelos Manias, Dissertation Advisor", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Chair", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco, Committee Chair", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member", "Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ION-EXCHANGE REACTIONS", "CLAY NANOCOMPOSITES", "MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES", "MONTMORILLONITE NANOCOMPOSITES", "MODIFIED LAYERED SILICATES", "POLYMER/LAYERED SILICATE NANOCOMPOSITES", "ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY", "HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE", "ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPING A GEOGRAPHIC ONTOLOGY FOR GAZETTEERS\n", "id": "9869", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3658", "abstract_tesi": "In applications such as web-based information retrieval, gazetteers are often used to provide information about places in the real world, including names, geographic coordinates, and feature class membership. Although this information is often sufficient to differentiate places with ambiguous geographic names for a given point in time, the information contained in standard gazetteers does not account for the dynamic aspect of geographic features that evolve over time. When utilizing gazetteers that describe geographic entities this shortcoming can cause two different places to be considered identical, or the same place to be viewed as different entities. Misidentifying places may cause significant mistakes in decision-making during crisis management or national security situations by missing critical information associated with a place of interest or by incorporating erroneous information.\n\nTo support the temporal continuity of geographical features, this thesis develops a geographic ontology that provides information regarding the evolution of coastal geographic features. This problem context is chosen because the changes in such features are strongly influenced by well-known earth system processes, such as sea level rise. Grounded in the notion of low-resolution conceptual neighborhoods, this thesis combines spatial data with the GeoNames gazetteer to develop the geographic ontology of coastal features. This ontology extends standard approaches by making explicit the knowledge of evolution of the spatial configuration of geographic features and their topological relationships. Using two local datasets from Florida and Alaska, the evaluation has shown that this type of geographic ontology can improve the automated matching between place names. This result in turn supports automated utilization of gazetteer-based information that represents the land surface at different times.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3638], "author_name_tesi": "Soon, Kean Huat ", "last_name_ssi": "Soon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kean Huat", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas A M Iller", "Douglas Alan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas A M Iller, Thesis Advisor", "Douglas Alan Miller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["evolution", "ontology development", "matching gazetteers", "geographic ontology", "conceptual neighborhoods"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF ANIMAL-ASSISTED THERAPY FOR RESPONDING TO PASSIVE BEHAVIOR IN ELDERLY NURSING HOME RESIDENTS WITH DEMENTIA: A SINGLE-SUBJECT DESIGN STUDY\n\n\n", "id": "10526", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "934", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Passive behavior (PB) is a behavioral disturbance that affects 61 to 88 percent of nursing home residents (NHRs) with dementia. PB in persons with dementia (PWD) often leads to such negative consequences as, social isolation, loss of physical functioning, excess disability, and further cognitive decline, which, in turn, may lead to loss of quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, and caregiver distress. PB in PWD is often misdiagnosed as depression and treated with psychoactive medications. The black-box warning against the use of psychoactive medications in PWD warrant the need for non-pharmacological interventions aimed at better managing PB in PWD. Many studies have suggested health and social benefits may be derived from animal-assisted therapy (AAT). The specific aim of the present study was to determine if a functional relationship existed between AAT and PB in PWD. The Need-driven Dementia-compromised Behavior Model (NDB) and attachment theory (AT) were the organizing frameworks for this study. A within-subject, repeated measurements, quasi-experimental \nA-B1-A\u00b4-B2 design was used to measure PB. Eight subjects, who met the study\u2019s inclusion criteria, completed 32, daily, 20-minute sessions under two conditions: dog present and dog absent. Sessions were videotaped and measures of PB were obtained from the video-recordings, using the Observational Form of Passivity in Dementia (O-PDS) scale. Pairwise t tests were performed on the adjusted mean scores of the O-PDS. Visual analyses of the graphs of O-PDS scores consistently demonstrated significantly less PB in 7 of the 8 subjects during the AAT conditions. Findings suggest that AAT can serve as a useful intervention for decreasing PB in PWD.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [926], "author_name_tesi": "Soprano, Cherie Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Soprano", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Cherie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ann Marie Kolanowski", "Ann Marie Kolanowski", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli", "Janice Lee Penrod", "Daniel Jay Lago", "Dr Kathleen Colling"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ann Marie Kolanowski, Dissertation Advisor", "Ann Marie Kolanowski, Committee Chair", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli, Committee Member", "Janice Lee Penrod, Committee Member", "Daniel Jay Lago, Committee Member", "Dr Kathleen Colling, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["passive behavior", "Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "animal assisted therapy", "dementia"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Design and Implementation of a Cognitive Radar for the Study of Plasma Instabilities at Equatorial and Mid-latitude Regions", "id": "25659", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10966", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cognitive radar is envisioned to be the future of remote sensing systems.

This dissertation discusses in detail both the hardware configuration and signal processing aspects of the CIRI system.

It is a history that explores the turbulent origins of land-grant colleges in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey. A coalition of gentlemen farmers from state agricultural societies, scientists trained in German universities, and economically-minded statesman led the region\u2019s land-grant movement in the 1860s and 1870s. Men like Daniel Coit Gilman, Evan Pugh, Samuel Johnson, Andrew Dickson White, and Justin Morrill were intent on building institutions that could nurture scientific study and advance agricultural, industrial, and national development. These educational reformers wanted colleges with advanced curricula and stiff admissions standards, which would graduate leaders for a new economy in science, engineering, and business. The rise of state granges in the 1880s organized farmers against this \u201cNational Schools of Science\u201d model. Farmers held a proprietary attitude towards land-grant colleges, due to the legislation\u2019s commitment to agriculture and the industrial classes, and demanded vocational curricula, required labor, and broad access. Grange leaders insisted that land-grant colleges abandon advanced science and liberal arts courses in favor of an agricultural curriculum and practical farm training to become true \u201cPeoples\u2019 Colleges.\u201d It was hoped that such vocational programs would curb the rapid outmigration of rural youth to urban, middle class jobs occurring in the latter half of the nineteenth century, by returning college graduates home to the farm. By the 1890s, farmers succeeded in reforming the region\u2019s higher education landscape by seizing land-grant funds from Brown, Dartmouth, and Yale and founding new colleges that would in time become the University of Connecticut, the University of New Hampshire, and the University of Rhode Island. The grange only briefly implemented their practical education model at these new institutions, coming into competition with the vocational programs of an emerging public high school sector. To remain viable and increase enrollments, the institutions of the land-grant reformation minimized their agricultural curricula and were refashioned as \u201cstate colleges.\u201d With enhanced academic standards, a burgeoning campus life, and no required labor, these new state colleges abandoned the old mantra of producing farmers, and embraced a new role as gatekeepers of social mobility into the middle class. The land-grant colleges maintained their historic commitment to the agricultural classes through agricultural extension, short courses, and rural community outreach. Cornell University became a national leader of this emerging land-grant college standard: rigorous academics, liberal curricula, and extension and outreach to farmers and agricultural communities. This history reveals that the guiding principles of land-grant colleges were formed through contentious inter-class dialogue between farmers, scientists, and bourgeois reformers. Industrialization and the rise of modern capitalism produced economic classes with conflicting educational visions and curricular demands, and the process of creating and controlling land-grant colleges is best conceived as a contest to protect or elevate the status, power, and economic privileges of different classes. The sources of the tension were opposing beliefs of the proper progression of America capitalism and land-grant colleges\u2019 relationship to that development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4658], "author_name_tesi": "Sorber, Nathan Masters", "last_name_ssi": "Sorber", "middle_name_ssi": "Masters", "first_name_ssi": "Nathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger Lewis Geiger", "Roger Lewis Geiger", "Roger L Williams", "Lisa Lattuca", "William Alan Blair"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger Lewis Geiger, Dissertation Advisor", "Roger Lewis Geiger, Committee Chair", "Roger L Williams, Committee Member", "Lisa Lattuca, Committee Member", "William Alan Blair, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["New England", "history of higher education", "land-grant colleges", "agriculture", "nineteenth century"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "WATCHING OUT FOR MEDIA: AN INSTITUTIONAL ETHNOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE ON THE FEMINIST DEMOCRATIC MEDIA ACTIVISM OF \"MEDIA MONITORING AFRICA\"", "id": "13874gus176", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13874", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project explores the activism and impact of Media Monitoring Africa (MMA), a successful South African non-governmental organization (NGO) with the mission to promote media democracy, diversity, quality, and ethics. MMA is a media monitoring and advocacy NGO whose activism addresses both recurring (mis)representation in media content and inequitable structures in the political economy of the South African mediascape. Though scholars have referenced MMA for its successful media activism (Van Zyl & Kantor, 1999; Gallagher, 2001; Geertsema, 2010), MMA has never been the focus of an extensive study. Through a six-week institutional ethnography (Smith, 2005) at MMA using participant-observation, in-depth semi-structured interviews, and textual analyses of organizational documents, I map MMA\u2019s network of social relations, assess MMA\u2019s social position, and understand MMA as a feminist democratic media organization. MMA\u2019s activist strategies go beyond representational critiques in media content. Rather, the NGO recognizes the need for democratic intervention in the political economic structure of the South African mediascape. MMA\u2019s content-based activism targets misrepresentation through media monitoring analysis, while MMA\u2019s structure-based activism targets media regulation, policy, and media organizational politics. In most cases, MMA engages in both forms of activism simultaneously. Through the institutional ethnographic method, I derive \u201creputation\u201d and \u201cimpact\u201d as two central conditions that shape MMA\u2019s activist role in the South African mediascape. Via their stakeholder relationships and social position, MMA weaves into the organizational fabric of the South African mediascape through consistent intervention, activist innovation, and the curation of strategic relationships. Moreover, I use the institutional ethnographic analysis of MMA\u2019s organizational particularities to study the NGO\u2019s commitment to feminism and democracy that guide their activism in South Africa.

For certain concentrations, these filaments develop a beads-on-string structure previously observed only in polymer jets and filaments surrounded by air.  By taking advantage of the longer time scales present in this experiment, we are able to quantify the evolution of individual beads.  We also investigate the stability of these filaments and the robustness of the beads-on-string structure by stretching the filament within a rotating flow.  Using a slender body approximation, we derive an integro-differential evolution equation that governs the development of a viscoelastic filament.

Mitigating the processing difficulties associated with processing dissimilar materials, however, can be expensive and limit their application.   In this work, a new class of materials recently proposed called microstructure composites were fabricated and mechanically tested to gain insight into the mechanical response of these composites.   Microstructure composites are composites in which the constituent components are not dissimilar materials, but different microstructures of a material with the same composition.   The material used in this work is &#945;-Al2O3 and the constituent microstructures are a fine-grained, equiaxed Al2O3 microstructure and a textured Al2O3 microstructure.   Textured alumina grains exhibit crack deflective properties due to the low fracture energy of the basal plane, and can therefore be used to toughen alumina. Crack deflection increases the amount of energy absorbed by a ceramic during fracture and can be quantified by work of fracture.  The textured microstructure is achieved by templated grain growth (TGG); template &#945;-Al2O3 particles added to a colloidal slurry are aligned during forming.  The addition of 0.14 wt% CaO + SiO2  liquid-forming dopant induces anisotropic growth of the template particles during densification.\nMicrostructure composites can be fabricated with a variety of complex architectures according to the concept of connectivity, as used for piezoelectric applications.  The connectivity of a composite describes the dimensions in which each component is connected to itself.  A novel processing method, slurry co-casting, which involves the simultaneous tape casting of two ceramic slurries, was utilized to cast composite tapes. These were subsequently cut and stacked in specific sequences to create microstructure composites of 1-1, 2-2, and 3-3 connectivities. Microstructural control between the equiaxed and textured layers was achieved by sintering at 1550\u00b0C.  A sharp interface between the constituent components ensured that distinct connectivities were achieved.   Combining constituent components in such specific configurations increases the control a researcher has over the properties of the material.\nThe alumina microstructure composites were mechanically tested in equibiaxial flexure using the ring-on-ring method.  Load/deflection curves, fracture surfaces, and failure behavior were analyzed.  Crack deflection and step-wise fracture were observed for all connectivities tested.  Extended crack deflection (&#8805; 1 mm) was observed in only the 1-1 and 3-3 connectivities.  So-called \u201cgraceful failure\u201d was observed in all connectivities and work of fracture reached values in excess of 7 kJ/m2.  The mechanical response of the 2-2 connectivity was variable; it was the only connectivity to exhibit catastrophic, instead of graceful, failure in some cases.   The 2-2 connectivity, however, is unique from the 1-1 and 3-3, in that due to the nature of the architecture and the chosen loading geometry, it is possible that a crack traveling through the specimen would never encounter a reinforcing, textured layer.  For this reason, the 2-2 connectivity studied in this work is not recommended for structural applications. The 1-1 and 3-3 connectivities, however, demonstrated crack deflective and energy absorbing properties, which increase the toughness of the material.   The fabrication and mechanical testing of equiaxed/textured microstructure composites in this work offered new insights into the effect of connectivity (namely the 1-1, 2-2, and 3-3) on the mechanical response of alumina. \nMicrostructure composites of SiAlON were also fabricated in which the constituent microstructures were the &#945;- and &#946;-SiAlON phases. &#945;-SiAlON was used for its high hardness and &#946;-SiAlON was used for its high toughness, due to the elongated nature of its grain structure.   Microstructure composites of these phases could exploit the advantageous mechanical properties of both.  Many processing issues, however, including failure in both the green state and during densification (by hot-pressing), were encountered.  Initial mechanical testing of the 3-3 connectivity in SiAlON microstructure composites reveals catastrophic failure and low biaxial strength.  This behavior is most likely the result of one of the processing issues encountered in the fabrication of these composites, that is, the \u201cpre-cracking\u201d of the green sample in the hot-press prior to densification. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [623], "author_name_tesi": "Soublet, Brandy A", "last_name_ssi": "Soublet", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Brandy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Lynn Messing", "Gary Lynn Messing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Lynn Messing, Thesis Advisor", "Gary Lynn Messing, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["microstructure property relations", "alumina", "connectivity", "ceramic processing", "mechanical properties"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "GROWTH OF NANOSCALE BaTiO3/SrTiO3 SUPERLATTICES BY MOLECULAR-BEAM EPITAXY", "id": "8093", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "342", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The well known ferroelectric BaTiO3 was confined within nanoscale BaTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices to investigate the importance of finite size and strain on its ferroelectric properties, especially the paraelectric-to-ferroelectric transition temperature (TC).

With the aid of reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), precise single-monolayer doses of BaO, SrO, and TiO2 were deposited sequentially to create commensurate BaTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices with a variety of periodicities. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements exhibit clear superlattice peaks at the expected positions for the targeted superlattices. XRD rocking curve measurements of the BaTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices grown on (101) DyScO3 and (101) GdScO3 substrates exhibit full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 9 and 7 arc sec, respectively, the narrowest ever reported for any oxide superlattices grown by any technique.

With each new generation, designers find it difficult to provide deterministic operating characteristics or guarantee a certain lifetime. This has led to the need for architectural designs that not\nonly need to be performance-efficient but also provide reliable operation as well. This dissertation is a step towards developing architectural designs that address reliability issues. As a case in point, we look at two performance-critical processor structures -\nthe issue queue and reorder buffer. Given that devices can fail at any point in their lifetime, our solutions address failures occurring at these different periods. These include manufacturing process variations that affect the operating speeds of the device, soft errors that flip the stored data value and wearout failures that severely limit the useful operating period of a device.\n\nIssue queues in high performance microprocessors involve multiple activities, moving instructions in and out of the queue, occurring within a single cycle. Process variation in the issue queues limit the synchronization that exists amongst these different activities in turn limiting their operating frequency. Our solution\nallows the faster and slower cells in the issue queue to co-exist limiting the stall cycles even at higher frequencies, thereby allowing performance scaling to continue. Soft errors occur when random particles strikes cause a transistor state to flip. Complete protection against soft errors is a overkill for certain market segments as this protection comes at the cost of performance. We provide microarchitectural\nsolutions that provide guarantees on limiting the soft error vulnerability of a platform based on limits required by the market. Our solution enables flexible spanning of the performance-reliability space depending on requirements. Further, we explore the impact of soft error vulnerability in multicores. We do a detailed analysis and identify factors that determine the overall vulnerability when the number of cores gets scaled and use this analysis to provide a runtime solution to minimize the soft error vulnerability. Also prior works have ignored the soft error vulnerability when scaling the voltage and frequency of a system. Our analysis clearly\nshows the need for designers to be aware of the reliability impact when adopting different voltage frequency algorithms. Finally, we address wearout issues in the issue queue which lead to entries getting shut down early in a microprocessor\u2019s lifetime, in turn affecting the overall performance. Our solutions to limit the variation in wearout in the issue queue entries decrease the degradation significantly and allow its entries to age more uniformly. This in turn helps them meet lifetime requirements.\n\nTogether, this dissertation provides a comprehensive framework minimizing the impact of failures at different points in a device\u2019s lifetime.

Generally, when either of the unstressed high vowels /i/ and /u/ appears next to any of the other vowels /e/, /a/, or /o/ the result is a diphthong (i.e., puerta \u2018door\u2019 > [pwer.ta], miel \u2018honey\u2019 > [mjel], and so on).  All other combinations of the vowels /i, e, a, o, u/ (along with their orthographically-accented counterparts where possible, /\u00ed, \u00e9, \u00e1, \u00f3, \u00fa/) typically remain in separate syllables and are said to be in hiatus (i.e., teatro \u2018theater\u2019 > [te.a.tro], poeta \u2018poet\u2019 > [po.e.ta], pa\u00eds \u2018country\u2019 > [pa.\u00eds], etc.).\t\nWhen speaking, however, vowel combinations that are supposed to be in hiatus often are not, such that teatro [te.a.tro], for example, is reported to be pronounced [tea.tro] or even [tja.tro]; se aman [se.a.man] might become [sea.man] or [sja.man], and so on\u2014 a phenomenon referred to as  hiatus resolution.  Previous accounts of hiatus resolution have claimed that there are a number of different possible phonetic outcomes of hiatus resolution with most authors finding that hiatus resolution typically results in a) the formation of a diphthong, b) vowel deletion, or c) maintenance of hiatus (Jenkins 1999, Aguilar 2003, Alba 2006, D\u00edaz-Campos et al. 2006).  Some of these same accounts have also suggested that there are a number of factors that predict when hiatus resolution is likely to happen.  These include which specific vowels are found in the VV sequence, and which vowel(s) (if any) receive stress (Jenkins 1999).  Other factors have been investigated as possible catalysts for either hiatus resolution or maintenance including dialectal differences (Lipski 1994, Jenkins 1999, Hualde 2005, Alba 2006, D\u00edaz-Campos et al. 2006, Michnowicz 2007, among others), individual speaker differences (e.g., Quilis 1981, Hualde et al. 2002), and differences in socioeconomic levels (e.g., Matluck 1995, D\u00edaz-Campos et al. 2006), speech rate, and carefulness of speech.  It is readily agreed upon that the faster one speaks and the less care with which one speaks the more likely vowel sequences in hiatus are resolved (e.g., Navarro-Tom\u00e1s 1968b, Harris 1969, Jenkins 1999, Alba 2006). \nAn additional factor that has been reported to affect hiatus resolution is frequency.  Although it has received less attention in the traditional hiatus/diphthong literature, recently some authors have found that more frequent vowel sequences, words, and/or word strings tend to show both a higher propensity to resolve hiatus, as well as to show a higher degree of vowel resolution (Jenkins 1999, Aguilar 2003, Alba 2006, D\u00edaz-Campos et al. 2006).  Both Jenkins (1999) and Alba (2006) found that the more frequent word strings in their corpora showed greater tendency to resolve hiatus and to resolve it to a greater degree (i.e., more resolution, or even more unlike the original vowels in hiatus).  These findings claim that hiatus resolution is not brought on only by fast and/or careless speech but that frequency might also be playing an important role in predicting what (and to what degree) vowel sequences, words, or word strings will undergo hiatus resolution.    \n\tA 2x2 experimental investigation of 36 Mexican Spanish speakers was conducted to investigate via word-naming tasks the role of frequency (high vs. low) and speech rate (fast vs. slow) in the resolution of within-word [ea] sequences in Spanish.  Words and vowel sequences were measured for overall word duration and VV sequence duration.  Formant data was also measured for the vowel sequences to determine the nature of the resolution (diphthong-like, or not).  The results reveal that fast speech rate significantly modulated both temporal measures as well as formant measures.  The results also reveal a significant modulation of temporal and formant measures for the high frequency words.

Turbulence is also responsible for the mixing of air inside the canopy, playing an important role in chemical and biophysical processes occurring in the plants\u2019 environment. In the last fifty years, research has significantly advanced the un- derstanding of and ability to model the flow field within and above the canopy, but important issues remain unsolved. In this work, we focus on (i) the estimation of turbulent mixing timescales within the canopy from field data; and (ii) the development of new computationally efficient modeling approaches for the coupled canopy-atmosphere flow field.\nThe turbulent mixing timescale represents how quickly turbulence creates a well- mixed environment within the canopy. When the mixing timescale is much smaller than the timescale of other relevant processes (e.g. chemical reactions, deposition), the system can be assumed to be well-mixed and detailed modeling of turbulence is not critical to predict the system evolution. Conversely, if the mixing timescale is comparable or larger than the other timescales, turbulence becomes a controlling factor for the concentration of the variables involved; hence, turbulence needs to be taken into account when studying and modeling such processes. In this work, we used a combination of ozone concentration and high-frequency velocity data measured within and above the canopy in the Amazon rainforest to characterize turbulent mixing. The eddy diffusivity parameter (used as a proxy for mixing efficiency) was applied in a simple theoretical model of one-dimensional diffusion, providing an estimate of turbulent mixing timescales as a function of height within the canopy and time-of-day. Results showed that, during the day, the Amazon rainforest is characterized by well-mixed conditions with mixing timescales smaller than thirty minutes in the upper-half of the canopy, and partially mixed conditions in the lower half of the canopy. During the night, most of the canopy (except for the upper 20%) is either partially or poorly mixed, resulting in mixing timescales of up to several hours. For the specific case of ozone, the mixing timescales observed during the day are much lower than the chemical and deposition timescales, whereas chemical processes and turbulence have comparable timescales during the night. In addition, the high day-to-day variability in mixing conditions and the fast increase in mixing during the morning transition period indicate that turbulence within the canopy needs to be properly investigated and modeled in many studies involving plant-atmosphere interactions.\nMotivated by the findings described above, this work proposes and tests a new approach for modeling canopy flows. Typically, vertical profiles of flow statistics are needed to represent canopy-atmosphere exchanges in chemical and biophysical processes happening within the canopy. Current single-column models provide only steady-state (equilibrium) profiles, and rely on closure assumptions that do not represent the dominant non-local turbulent fluxes present in canopy flows. We overcome these issues by adapting the one-dimensional turbulent (ODT) model to represent atmospheric flows from the ground up to the top of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The ODT model numerically resolves the one-dimensional diffusion equation along a vertical line (representing a horizontally homogeneous ABL column), and the presence of three-dimensional turbulence is added through the effect of stochastic eddies. Simulations of ABL without canopy were performed for different atmospheric stabilities and a diurnal cycle, to test the capabilities of this modeling approach in representing unsteady flows with strong non-local transport. In addition, four different types of canopies were simulated, one of them including the transport of scalar with a point source located inside the canopy. The comparison of all simulations with theory and field data provided satisfactory results. The main advantages of using ODT compared to typical 1D canopy-flow models are the ability to represent the coupled canopy-ABL flow with one single modeling approach, the presence of non-local turbulent fluxes, the ability to simulate transient conditions, the straightforward representation of multiple scalar fields, and the presence of only one adjustable parameter (as opposed to the several adjustable constants and boundary conditions needed for other modeling approaches).\nThe results obtained with ODT as a stand-alone model motivated its use as a surface parameterization for Large-Eddy Simulation (LES). In this two-way coupling between LES and ODT, the former is used to simulate the ABL in a case where a canopy is present but cannot be resolved by the LES (i.e., the LES first vertical grid point is above the canopy). ODT is used to represent the flow field between the ground and the first LES grid point, including the region within and just above the canopy. In this work, we tested the ODT-LES model for three different types of canopies and obtained promising results. Although more work is needed in order to improve first and second-order statistics within the canopy (i.e. in the ODT domain), the results obtained for the flow statistics in the LES domain and for the third order statistics in the ODT domain demonstrate that the ODT-LES model is capable of capturing some important features of the canopy-atmosphere interaction. This new surface superparameterization approach using ODT provides a new alternative for simulations that require complex interactions between the flow field and near-surface processes (e.g. sand and snow drift, waves over water surfaces) and can potentially be extended to other large-scale models, such as mesoscale and global circulation models.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13799], "author_name_tesi": "Souza Freire Grion, Livia ", "last_name_ssi": "Souza Freire Grion", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Livia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marcelo Chamecki", "Chris E.

Caffeoyl-CoA-O-methyltransferase 1 (CCoAOMT1), an enzyme in the lignin biosynthetic pathway, is more abundant in the rachis of maize inbreds resistant to A. flavus infection and aflatoxin accumulation than in susceptible inbreds. Evaluation of lignin in cobs resistant or susceptible to A. flavus was done by studying lignin composition, the digestibility of the cobs, cob protein antifungal properties, and characterizing the CCoAOMT1 (AJ242980) gene. Lignin was extracted from an A. flavus resistant inbred (Mp313E) and a susceptible inbred (SC212m) cob 21 days after silking (DAS). Thioglycolic acid and acetyl bromide extractions determined that there were no significant differences in total lignin content between the two inbreds, while thioacidolysis extractions determined Mp313E contained significantly more lignin than SC212m.  Higher amounts of lignin in Mp313E could inhibit fungal growth in the cob due to crosslinkages reducing fungal movement.  Thioacidolysis monolignol tests showed that resistant inbreds had two times more guaiacyl subunits than SC212m. The presence of a higher proportion of syringyl lignin in SC212m may make it easier for A. flavus to infect the cob. Enzymatic saccharification and fiber analysis found that more cellulose can be digested in SC212m.  There was also a significant difference between the hemicellulose content of resistant and susceptible cobs.  Antifungal activity assays were performed using resistant and susceptible cob proteins extracted 21 DAS and analyzed 25 days after inoculation. The assay found that Mp313E and SC212m cob protein extracts inhibited fungal growth more than a buffer control, but there was no significant difference in fungal inhibition between the two inbreds. Quantitative real-time PCR determined that there was no difference of CCoAOMT1 transcription levels in Mp313E and SC212m.  The genetic DNA sequences of CCoAOMT1 in Mp313E and SC212m contain four introns of similar length.  There is no difference in the coding region of either inbred.

In particular, Ni-Zn intermetallic compounds (which are ordered arrangements of these two elements) are utilized for the selective semi-hydrogenation of acetylene, which is a high-volume industrial reaction that currently requires the use of precious metal catalysts. The poor catalytic properties of pure Ni are greatly improved through the addition of a second base metal, Zn, making the Ni-based catalysts behave more like precious metals. While we cannot perform alchemy, turning two base metals into an intermetallic material that behaves like a precious metal might be the closest we can come. The synthesis of well-defined materials and corresponding kinetic measurements utilizing isotopic labeling are combined with density functional theory calculations to highlight the reasons for the enhanced selectivity of Ni-Zn intermetallic catalysts. In situ structure-determination during catalyst synthesis helps to lay the framework for future intermetallic catalyst development. \n\tDeveloping new catalytic materials requires detailed knowledge of catalyst structure, because structure is related to function.

Ordinary tasks such as precision hovering and landing can become increasingly difficult when performed in the unsteady winds that develop behind ship superstructures and above a moving ship deck. Often, the increased pilot workload is the limiting factor in determining whether a particular task can be performed in certain  wind-over-deck conditions. In recent years,  research has been performed to identify the ship gusts that are affecting pilots. If the unsteady winds can be identified, then gust rejection tools  can be developed to help reduce pilot workload, and to make missions safer. Additionally, from accurate wind information, high fidelity real time simulations can be developed to test new engineering designs and to train naval pilots.\n\nThis study further investigates gust identification methods by applying new engineering tools to develop offline and online gust  identification processes. In the offline environment, aircraft time history data is used to develop colored noise filters that capture the spectral properties of the ship airwake gusts. When the continuous filter is transformed to a discrete transfer function, and excited with a white noise input, the power spectral density of the filtered output matches the power spectral properties of the stochastic portion of the unsteady airwake gusts.\n\nAlthough the offline gust identification method is successful, it can become computationally intensive to develop gust identification filters for every ship airwake condition a particular helicopter may encounter. As a result, an online identification method is examined. In this initial feasibility study, a sixth order autoregressive Burg model is used to determine colored noise filter coefficients in a real-time simulation environment. Initial results shows that the  spectral properties of the filters converge to key peaks that were evident in the offline filter fitting method.\n\nIn this study, the gust identification principles used to identify the stochastic airwake properties are then applied to create a real time simulation airwake model. Previous approaches to developing airwake simulation models of the shipboard environment employed computational fluid dynamics. Often the memory restrictions placed on the size of data allowed for the real time simulation applications either limited the fidelity of the CFD solution, or the length of unrepeatable data created. By relying on a grid of stochastic filters, which are excited with a random white noise, the computational effort is significantly reduced and guaranteed not to show noticeable\nrepetitions in flight simulation data.

The integration of semiconductors into the pores of microstructured optical fibers merges these two conflicting frameworks into one entity to result in a novel class of fiber geometry optoelectronic materials. The realization of such structures is a challenge in materials synthesis because conventional nanofabrication techniques cannot conformally coat such extreme aspect ratio pores with films of uniform thickness.\n\nThe focus of this dissertation was to develop an innovative, high pressure chemical deposition technique that removes the mass transport constraints in such intricate structures. The meter long, ultra-high aspect ratio pores of microstructured optical fibers are treated as high pressure chemical reactors for the deposition of Group IV and II-VI semiconductors from organometallic precursors. The behavior of molecules compressed to high pressures and confined to the small dimensions of the micro/nanoreactors is dramatically altered such that nearly every aspect of the pathway from molecular precursor to reaction product, including reactant flow, surface chemistry, chemical kinetics and thermodynamics, and nucleation and growth, differs from that under conventional conditions.

Further, I propose that the rhetoric of biopolitics, which describes the way that power is organized and instrumentalized through definitions of life itself, reveals how figurative language serves to perpetuate the relation of inclusive exclusion that the feminine has with the nation and the body politic. At the core of this study is the question of how to escape this ideational cycle which links figurative and material violence. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4648], "author_name_tesi": "Sparling, Nicole Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Sparling", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sophia A Mcclennen", "Sophia A Mcclennen", "Djelal Kadir", "Susan Merrill Squier", "Lorraine Dowler", "Laurence E Prescott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sophia A Mcclennen, Dissertation Advisor", "Sophia A Mcclennen, Committee Chair", "Djelal Kadir, Committee Member", "Susan Merrill Squier, Committee Member", "Lorraine Dowler, Committee Member", "Laurence E Prescott, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["reproduction", "biopolitics", "bare life", "twentieth century", "Margaret Atwood", "Ariel Dorfman", "Carlos Fuentes", "Toni Morrison", "Clarice Lispector", "Diamela Eltit", "inter-American", "comparative literature", "Americas", "America", "1980s", "female body", "womb", "fetus", "gender", "nation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING WITH PLAYFULNESS IN THE ADULT EDUCATION CLASSROOM\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "10548", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3043", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Adult learning practices that incorporate experiential learning and playfulness promise greater learner involvement and engagement, produce better results than teaching-to-the-test lectures and presentations, and represent a major opportunity to improve adult learning.

Using surveys, quizzes, and interviews, this longitudinal mixed-method study spanned three contacts with subjects over an average of 131 days, including transfer of learning to real-world boating experience. \nResults show that the PALA is significantly more effective for learning and retention than presentation alone, but it was even more effective for less experienced boaters. This study examined the value of playfulness beyond the classroom, and the subjects testified to outcomes such as greater confidence, improved awareness and perception, and a more safety-conscious attitude, often tied to a more interactive and socially-aware relationship with family, friends, and others. The findings suggest other benefits from PALA for most groups in the population.\nThis study addresses a lack of experimental studies of playfulness and experiential adult learning in the literature. It suggests a need for changes and extensions to theoretical models along with a need for more research into playful adult learning activities. It recommends that experiential learning with playfulness should be widely adopted for safety, compliance, and certification training.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3033], "author_name_tesi": "Spaulding, James Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Spaulding", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Patricia A Cranton Ph D", "Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Edward W Taylor", "Kathryn Weed Jablokow", "Roy Clariana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Patricia A Cranton Ph D, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Chair", "Edward W Taylor, Committee Member", "Kathryn Weed Jablokow, Committee Member", "Roy Clariana, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["simulation", "learning transfer", "EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING", "playfulness", "adult education", "PALA", "learning activity", "instructional design", "role play"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE MAJOR FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE SELECTION OF A CUSTOM EXECUTIVE EDUCATION PROVIDER\n", "id": "7094", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2808", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-04-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding client needs and interests, and doing so in an ever-changing and rapidly evolving marketplace, is essential for any business. The field of executive education is no exception. University-based, general audience executive education programs have been a mainstay of the executive and leadership development process for over 50 years, and play an increasingly important role within organizations. Evaluations and judgments are routinely made about providers, with decisions based upon a variety of factors and desired outcomes. In an increasingly competitive marketplace, executive education providers with a clear understanding of the decision-making and selection processes employed by clients will prove most successful in their efforts. \n\nResearch regarding the selection of custom executive education providers was conspicuously absent. Therefore, the significance of this study lies in its contribution of knowledge regarding specific factors that influence the selection of a partner or provider of custom executive education as well as the role of universities within this industry. This study sought to explore client investment in custom executive education, identify and rank the key factors that influence provider selection, and explore the role of universities in executive development. Utilizing an on-line survey process and follow-up telephone interviews, the study targeted Fortune 500 companies and sought the opinions of key decision makers in executive education and development in their respective organizations. \n\nStudy findings suggest that university-based executive education is alive and well, and remains a vital resource for professional development within many Fortune 500 organizations. The study validates prior predictions that the growth trend for custom executive education programs would continue, accompanied by increasing levels of investment. Of note and concern, however, is the continued growth in prominence of for-profit consulting organizations in the marketplace. \n\nStudy participants reported that universities are most valued for their breadth and depth of content expertise, research insights into best practices and alternative strategies, program design, teaching experience, expertise in learning methodologies, and flexible, cost-effective solutions. Alternatively, universities are often viewed as impractical, providing academic perspective without corporate experience. \n\nThe study reflects a continuing redefinition of executive education and executive development. Market demand is shifting from education, to education with consultation to supporting implementation, to an evolving era of assessment and consultation with education as a by-product based upon deep partner relationships. For some providers, a new business model may be needed, including the ability to build and maintain consulting relationships and conduct organizational assessments of corporate strategy, leadership challenges, and culture, with efforts resulting in true custom program design based upon client needs.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2804], "author_name_tesi": "Spearly, Jeffrey L.", "last_name_ssi": "Spearly", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William J Rothwell", "Albert Vicere", "Wesley Edward Donahue", "Fariborz Ghadar", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William J Rothwell, Committee Chair", "Albert Vicere, Committee Member", "Wesley Edward Donahue, Committee Member", "Fariborz Ghadar, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Executive Education", "Executive development", "Custom Executive Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Institutionalizing Information Security Risk Management: A Multi-Method Empirical Study on the Effects of Regulation\n\n", "id": "7984", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2813", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Information security has traditionally focused on known vulnerabilities to technological assets in order to safeguard organizational information from external threats, such as hackers and viruses. However, the majority of information security breaches are believed to be caused by internal employees, suggesting that more attention may be needed in managing internal people and process-related threats and vulnerabilities. In recent years, a series of regulations has forced organizations to manage various aspects of information security-related risk. The research question examined is: How does regulation affect information security risk management? \n\nA multi-method study was conducted. Interviews with twenty practitioners across ten organizations were conducted as part of a qualitative interpretive study. Informants included participants in Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and information security experts. Interpretive results informed a theoretical model that was tested in a subsequent positivist study. \n\nInstitutional theory and process maturity were applied to examine the effects of regulation on institutionalizing information risk management practices. Two hundred and eighteen completed survey responses were obtained from ISACA members, a professional association specialized in IT audit and governance. A multi-dimensional model was examined using structural equation modeling. The model contained both causal and effect indicators, resulting in a model that is both descriptive and predictive.\n\nFindings from both the interpretive and positivist studies suggest that regulation may contribute to institutionalized risk management in at least two ways. First, regulation encourages a more formalized risk management process because organizations must be able to provide documented proof of their practices for compliance. Secondly, regulation raises the level of organizational awareness of information risk management when business managers are explicitly held accountable or when the regulation is aimed at business processes. Mature risk management practices and business participation in managing risk were found to result in an organizational culture that exhibits a shared language, heightened awareness, and business ownership of risk management.\n\nResults from the interpretive study suggested that information security has two dimensions: management and practice. Support for these two dimensions was found in the positivist study. Institutionalized information security risk management was found to result in improved performance of operational and technical security controls from increased efficiency.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2809], "author_name_tesi": "Spears, Janine L.", "last_name_ssi": "Spears", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Janine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Russell Richard Barton", "Johann Baumgartner", "John Watson Bagby", "Peng Liu", "Timothy Grant Pollock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Russell Richard Barton, Committee Chair", "Johann Baumgartner, Committee Member", "John Watson Bagby, Committee Member", "Peng Liu, Committee Member", "Timothy Grant Pollock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["institutional theory", "information security", "risk management", "regulation", "multi-method", "Sarbanes-Oxley"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Stem Cell Trafficking to Sites of Injury by Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)", "id": "17471", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8550", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Diseases of bone, such as osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta, cause weaker, more porous, and more brittle bones. Stem cell therapy has been suggested as one alternative approach that can be applied to treat these diseases.  This approach however, would require distribution of the stem cells to the entire skeleton, which at present is not an easy task.  The present project focused on developing methods to enhance trafficking of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the skeleton using mouse models of injury. MSCs are the precursor cells to bone, cartilage, and many other tissues. MSCs are found in extremely small amounts around the body, but mostly in the bone marrow. The goal of this project was to determine if trafficking and engraftment of intravenously injected MSCs in mouse models of injury could be enhanced by parathyroid hormone (PTH) administration. Mesenchymal stem cells were harvested from donor mice and were either labeled with PKH 26 to fluoresce red or harvested from mice engineered to express red fluorescent protein (RFP). The donor, red fluorescing cells were then injected into mice with marrow-ablated femurs to simulate an injury model following PTH administration. Donor cells trafficking and engraftment were assessed by histology, FACS analysis, and Real-Time PCR.  By using PKH 26 to track the donor cells using FACS analysis, the results showed that there was a trend that PTH enhanced trafficking of donor MSCs in femurs of recipient mice at 48hr following cell injection, although no significant difference was detected. At day 7, all mice showed higher cell engraftment in femurs and tibia and no differences were noted between groups.  These data suggested that PTH may be important for immediate trafficking but at later points injury appeared to be the determining factor in donor cell engraftment. When RFP cells were used followed by histological analysis 48 hours after the injection of donor MSCs, there appeared to be more donor cells in tissue sections made from femur and tibia of recipient mice than in the control mice that did not receive PTH. At day 7, there appeared to be a greater number of donor MSCs found in both femur and tibia of both the PTH and control groups. To confirm the histological findings, Real-Time PCR was used. The results showed that at 48hr following donor cell transplantation, mice treated with PTH had a higher engraftment of donor cells in femurs and tibia than in mice that did not receive PTH. Although the data showed more donor cells in PTH treated mice, there was a fluctuation in engraftment of donor cells between individual mice, resulting in no significant difference. Although the data was not significant, there was a trend indicating that either PTH or injury enhanced trafficking of MSCs.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8439], "author_name_tesi": "Specht, Shane Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Specht", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Shane", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Niyibizi", "Patricia Mc Laughlin", "Henry Joseph Donahue"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Niyibizi, Thesis Advisor", "Patricia Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor", "Henry Joseph Donahue, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["mesenchymal stem cells", "MSC", "parathyroid hormone", "PTH"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Development of a Genetically Modified Silage Inoculant for the Biological Pretreatment of Lignocellulosic Biomass", "id": "19997", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7642", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this work, novel strains of Lactobacillus plantarum were developed to provide enzymatic pretreatment to lignocellulosic biomass during ensilage.  This pretreatment was catalyzed by the in process production of ferulic acid esterases.  The substrates that these novel microorganisms were used to ensile were winter rye and corn stover.  On winter rye, these inoculants were able to significantly increase the enzymatic digestibility of the silage by 11.1% \u00b1 3.2% (P=0.05) compared to a control treatment.  If combined with a subsequent thermochemical pretreatment, the benefit of inoculation with FAE producing strains of L. plantarum increased to 18.7% \u00b1 5.0% (P=0.05).  On corn stover modified strains produced no benefit for the raw silage, but after thermochemical pretreatment, the biologically treated silage had an increase in digestibility of over 30% (P=0.05) when compared to a control treatment.  Furthermore, this work focused on the balance between heterologous expression and the ability to maintain a robust, competitive organism in a natural system.  This work found that strains producing a heavy amount of heterologous esterase achieved a lower population in the fermented silage that strains producing lower amounts of esterase.  In addition, this work found that using acid-inducible promoters to drive heterologous expression enabled the strain to achieve higher final populations.  In final, this work presents a mathematical model for optimizing the balance between enzymatic production and survival to deliver the maximum amount of enzyme using a given organism.

Researchers are developing a more detailed understanding of CIS activities and the tools to support them; however, most studies of CIS focus on how people find and retrieve information collaboratively, while overlooking the important question of how context affects CIS activities. This dissertation focuses on unpacking the concept of context to understand how contextual factors affect CIS.\nAlthough context is an important topic in numerous disciplines, a common definition in the research is difficult to identify. Broadly, context includes the circumstances and conditions that surround and affect a phenomenon. These circumstances and conditions may be tangible or intangible and could include location, position, people, objects, function, purpose, meaning, or time. \nIn this dissertation, I address two important gaps in current research on CIS as related to context. First, there is limited research on the contextual factors that can affect collaborative information seeking activities. Second, there is a lack of understanding on how contextual factors influence collaborative information seeking activities. \nTo address these research gaps I conducted an ethnographic field study of the CIS activities of information technology teams in two hospitals. In this field study, I used qualitative methods including interviews, observations, shadowing, and artifact collection to examine the contextual factors impacting CIS activities and how these contextual factors impacted CIS practices.\nThrough this investigation, I contribute to the research field by offering a conceptual understanding of the contextual factors affecting collaborative information seeking activities in organizational settings. Specifically, this study (i) identifies categories of contextual factors impacting CIS activities, (ii) explains how the contextual factors impacted those CIS activities, and (iii) develops a framework of contextual factors and their impact on collaborative information seeking in organizations.\nThe research presented in this dissertation helps us extend our conceptual understanding of context and collaborative information seeking and also highlights the importance of studying context as an aspect of CIS.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8035], "author_name_tesi": "Spence, Patricia Ruma", "last_name_ssi": "Spence", "middle_name_ssi": "Ruma", "first_name_ssi": "Patricia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Madhu Reddy", "Sandeep Purao", "Bernard James Jansen", "Barbara Louise Gray", "Wayne G Lutters"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Madhu Reddy, Dissertation Advisor", "Sandeep Purao, Committee Member", "Bernard James Jansen, Committee Member", "Barbara Louise Gray, Committee Member", "Wayne G Lutters, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CIS", "teams", "collaboration", "context", "healthcare", "contextual factors", "information seeeking"]}]
