The elimination of wires and the associated failures such as chafing, sparking, ageing, and connector issues can increase reliability and design flexibility while reducing costs.  These factors present an appealing case for the pursuit of wireless solutions for harsh environments and particularly for their use in space and on spacecraft.\nRecent testing of this prototype system in the NASA Ames Research Center\u2019s Aerodynamic Heating Facility during Test 289 in January 2010, demonstrated the feasibility of using wireless sensors in ground test programs and point to their use on flight vehicles.  The test demonstrated data collection of a type-K thermocouple at \u00b12.5 \u00b0C resolution, with real-time data rates of 1 Hz, and high-speed data collection rates of 60 Hz and higher.  The presence of the plasma, heat, and vacuum within the chamber did not inhibit data acquisition, although there was a period of radio blackout while there was plasma between the system and the receiver.  A further test was attempted in the Panel Test Facility to show 100% communication uptime and multiple sensor support, and although that test was halted by critical battery failure, an upcoming \u201cwedge\u201d test in the Interaction Heating Facility, will showcase a fully functional system.\nWith continued refinement, the next version of the wireless sensor system has the potential to exhibit an increase in data frequency, a dramatic increase in battery life, and a marked reduction in size. This thesis demonstrates that wireless sensor systems have the capability to replace wired systems in space applications.  Future testing will further increase the technology readiness level of the wireless sensor system, verifying that wireless systems have a place on future flight missions.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1727], "author_name_tesi": "Weir, Erik David", "last_name_ssi": "Weir", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Erik", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sven G Bilen", "Sven G Bilen", "Julio Urbina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sven G Bilen, Thesis Advisor", "Sven G Bilen, Thesis Advisor", "Julio Urbina, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["wireless sensor system", "zigbee", "thermal protection system", "thermocouple"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Stability of Low Damping Rubber and Lead-Rubber Seismic Isolation Bearings", "id": "11177", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2995", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Elastomeric bearings are one of the most commonly used types of seismic isolation devices.  Composed of alternating layers of rubber and steel shims, this study focuses on elastomeric bearings made from low damping rubber with and without a lead core.  AASHTO specifications require these bearings to remain stable both service loading as well as seismic loading.  Stability under service loading is well understood and evaluated in a method similar to column buckling.  During seismic loading some of the bearings in the isolation system are subjected to increased axial compressive loads at large displacements and their ability to sustain load in this configuration is less clear.  At present, design for stability under these conditions is performed using the overlapping area method, which reduces the critical load calculated for service loading as a function of the area that overlaps between the top and bottom bearing end plates.  Finite element and experimental investigations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the overlapping area method and to provide insight into finding an improved method for assessment of stability when bearings are laterally displaced.  In addition, the use of a simple mechanical model to predict instability was explored.\n\nThe results of these studies showed that the overlapping area method fails to accurately capture trends observed in experiments and finite elements and that it provides inconsistent predictions between low damping rubber and lead-rubber bearings.  The lead core was found to have negligible impact on bearing stability by comparison to the low damping rubber bearing.  A two-dimensional parametric study performed in finite elements demonstrated the impact of several geometric properties that are ignored in the simplistic overlapping area formulation.  The mechanical model that was studied better estimated the stability behavior for the low damping rubber bearing in the range of displacements of interest for design, but like the overlapping area method still lacks a significant theoretical foundation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2986], "author_name_tesi": "Weisman, Jared Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Weisman", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Jared", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gordon Patrick Warn", "Gordon Patrick Warn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gordon Patrick Warn, Thesis Advisor", "Gordon Patrick Warn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Stability", "elastomeric bearing", "lead-rubber"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Characterization of Ammonia Borane for Chemical Propulsion Applications", "id": "15486", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7623", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ammonia borane (NH3BH3; AB), which has a hydrogen content of 19.6% by weight, has been studied recently as a potential means of hydrogen storage for use in fuel cell applications.  Its gaseous decomposition products have a very low molecular weight, which makes AB attractive in a propulsion application, since specific impulse is inversely related to the molecular weight of the products.  AB also contains boron, which is a fuel of interest for solid propellants because of its high energy density per unit volume.  Although boron particles are difficult to ignite due to their passivation layer, the boron molecularly bound in AB may react more readily.  The concept of fuel depots in low-earth orbit has been proposed for use in deep space exploration.  These would require propellants that are easily storable for long periods of time.  AB is a solid at standard temperature and pressure and would not suffer from mass loss due to boil-off like cryogenic hydrogen. \nThe goal of this work is to evaluate AB as a viable fuel in chemical propulsion.  Many studies have examined AB decomposition at slow heating rates, but in a propellant, AB will experience rapid heating.  Since heating rate has been shown to affect the thermolysis pathways in energetic materials, AB thermolysis was studied at high heating rates using molecular dynamics simulations with a ReaxFF reactive force field and experimental studies with a confined rapid thermolysis set-up using time-of-flight mass spectrometry and FTIR absorption spectroscopy diagnostics.   Experimental results showed the formation of NH3, H2NBH2, H2, and at later times, c-(N3B3H6) in the gas phase, while polymer formation was observed in the condensed phase.  Molecular dynamics simulations provided an atomistic description of the reactions which likely form these compounds.\nAnother subject which required investigation was the reaction of AB in oxidizing environments, as there were no previous studies in the literature.  Oxygen bond descriptions were added to the ReaxFF force field and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to identify important species and reactions in the AB oxidation.  Since the thermodynamic properties of many of these species were unknown, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed in the Jaguear 7.8 program using the B3LYP functional and 6-311G**++ basis set to calculate enthalpy and entropy of formation, as well as specific heat as a function of temperature.  These results were used to create a gas-phase chemical kinetic mechanism for AB combustion.  New elementary reactions (57) were combined with those found in the literature for ammonia and boron oxidation, to form a mechanism of 201 reversible reactions.  Results from a simple homogenous, constant pressure and energy calculation are presented in this work.  The results show that H2NBH2 can be dehydrogenated via radical attack when temperatures are too low to overcome the hydrogen elimination barrier and pressures are low enough to allow sufficient radicals to form.  Molecular dynamics calculations require very high pressures to facilitate reactions over a short simulation time, and show the formation of heavy B/N/H/O molecules, such as HNBOH and H2NB(OH)2.  On the other hand, the chemical kinetics calculations at 1 atm show that if the HNBO molecule is further oxidized, the products will likely fission with B-N bond cleavage.\nThe final objective towards the research goal was to study how AB can be effectively integrated into a propulsion application.  AB was added to a paraffin wax binder to form a heterogeneous solid fuel matrix.  Opposed-flow burner experiments were performed where a flow of gaseous oxygen was impinged on the solid fuel surface and regression rates were measured.  Regression rates were shown to increase with small additions of AB, but the condensed phase product build-up at higher AB concentrations limited the solid fuel regression.  Solid fuel grains with various amounts of AB were manufactured and tested in a lab scale hybrid rocket engine, where performance parameters such as thrust, chamber pressure, specific impulse (Isp) and characteristic exhaust velocity (C*), were measured.  AB addition was shown to increase Isp and C*, but large additions were shown to reduce the overall thrust due to the hindrance of the solid fuel regression.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7560], "author_name_tesi": "Weismiller, Michael Raymond", "last_name_ssi": "Weismiller", "middle_name_ssi": "Raymond", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter", "Richard A Yetter", "Prof Adrianus Van Duin", "Stefan Thynell", "Randy Lee Vander Wal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Chair", "Prof Adrianus Van Duin, Committee Member", "Stefan Thynell, Committee Member", "Randy Lee Vander Wal, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Energetic materials", "Novel propellants", "Hydrogen storage", "Hybrid rocket", "Boron"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO?: EDUCATOR (MEMBER) RETENTION IN AN ONLINE LEARNING COMMUNITY FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT", "id": "13687aew113", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13687", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Professional development (PD) can be effective in addressing K-12 science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) educators\u2019 content and pedagogical needs, if it is conducted over the course of many weeks or months.  Given budget, geographic and time constraints on educators, one proposed method for delivering this ongoing PD is online learning communities (OLCs), which are designed to also encourage long-term collaboration.  However, many OLC members rarely return, a situation strikingly similar to student departure from traditional higher education institutions between the first and second years of enrollment.  Since education professionals have different capacities and motivations for engaging with online PD, one possible explanation for the observed departure was that some members\u2019 characteristics matched well with an OLC (goodness-of-fit) while others did not (poorness-of-fit).  To test this hypothesis, member information and usage data covering a 22-month period were obtained from the NASA Educators Online Network (NEON) OLC for STEM education professionals.  Using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and step-wise multivariate linear regression methods, combinations of members\u2019 background characteristics and markers of initial or subsequent activity in the NEON environment were evaluated for goodness-of-fit.  Despite research design and Type 1 error constraints, results indicated that the idea of applying quantitative methods and a goodness-of-fit framework to understand OLC member activity had some merit.  With matches found between STEM PD needs, members\u2019 initial perceptions of NEON as potentially capable of meeting those needs, and subsequent activity in this OLC designed to deliver STEM content, the study appeared to lend support to the notion that a goodness-of-fit existed, to varying degrees, between NEON and its members.  This fit was most pronounced for female K-12 in-service educators, who comprised a majority of the audience that NEON was designed for and who also stood to gain the most from the kind of collaborative PD in STEM content offered by this OLC.  Implications from these findings, which should be interpreted with consideration of the study\u2019s limitations in mind, included a need for more purposeful strategies in training administrative members, which would aid in alignment of educator OLC activity with local school district needs, as well as a more clearly delineated program for documenting PD hours earned from individualized activities that are more relevant to an educator\u2019s curiosity and need.

Analysis and identification of the protocols of traffic on a network allowed for some classification of whether or not the behavior on the network was permissible.  This type of protocol classification can address similar needs in the software-defined radio space as well as in various military applications.  In these, as well as many other, applications there is a need to classify the protocol of an unknown wireless signal and to provide some general insights into the activity that is present on such signals.\n\nTo this end, a protocol detection system was developed to compare the protocol of an unknown set of recorded packet traces to a set of known and previously characterized protocols.  The basis for this detection system was the concept that protocols can be defined by the related sets of packets that get transmitted between the client and server of a connection.  Many protocols have a request-and-response communication structure in which one side of the connection, often the client, is requesting data from the other, often the server.  In the case of the server sending command or configuration packets to the client device, there are often sets of acknowledgment packets that follow this request-and-response structure.  \n\nThis system was designed to analyze a network trace using an unknown protocol by comparing the packets to the request-and-response structure of previously characterized, known protocols.  By determining how similar the unknown protocol traffic is to known protocols, a detection decision can be made based on the number of packets that are identified as belonging to each of the known protocols.  This approach is shown to be relatively successful for the limited, available sets of network traces that were recorded for this research.  Packet trace lengths of greater than 200 packets are shown to provide a sufficient amount of detection accuracy when comparing an unknown trace to the Bluetooth and ZigBee protocols.  However, there is much room for improvement for this system in its detection-decision criteria.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1543], "author_name_tesi": "Weiss, Daniel Ross", "last_name_ssi": "Weiss", "middle_name_ssi": "Ross", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sven G Bilen", "Mark P Mahon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sven G Bilen, Thesis Advisor", "Mark P Mahon, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Protocol Analysis", "Wireless Protocols", "Wireless Protocol Classification", "Automated Protocol Detection"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Theoretical Simulations of Sum-frequency Generation\nspectroscopy\n", "id": "22709", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9855", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Often times, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish the bulk material from a surface or an interface\nof two or more materials. Compared to the bulk, the response of the material is much smaller at an interface. In order to elucidate these systems, a technique is needed to distinguish interfaces from the bulk. One such technique is known as sum-frequency generation (SFG). In this vibrational spectroscopy, a visible and an infrared photon probe the target molecule, and scatters a photon that is sum of the two incident photons. SFG has garnered much attention for its selectivity to surfaces and interfaces due to zero response for systems with inversion symmetry. This interface specificity allows for the determination of molecular orientation at these interfaces separately from the bulk. In this thesis, we explore various computational methods to model SFG using first principles. Several different types of systems are modeled, and shown to agree quite well with experimental results. These methods were developed with the motivation of being accurate by using a quantum mechanical description of the target molecule that is cheap enough to calculate within the limits of density functional theory. Firstly, this work looks at the SFG of large polymeric crystalline cellulose. By only considering a small portion of the polymer, many features of the experimental spectrum match the theory.\nSecondly, a new theory for doubly-resonant SFG is shown to give good agreement with experiments, and predicts the orientation of a molecule on a surface. Lastly, a method for modeling the SFG of molecules on metal nanoparticles is shown using a discrete interaction model/quantum mechanics (DIM/QM). DIM/QM has been previously been developed for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and here we extend it to SFG.

Multi-field actuating materials have actuation responses in more than one externally applied field. An example of this is electrically active materials that also actuate when a magnetic field is applied. These types of materials offer many benefits in a variety of different research fields (aerospace, biomedical, automotive, etc). An electroactive polymer, P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) terpolymer, and a magnetoactive composite, barium hexaferrite-terpolymer film, were created using different processing and poling techniques to achieve multi-field actuation. Two magnet set-ups, electromagnets and permanent magnets, were used to orient the barium hexaferrite particles within the terpolymer matrix. Electrical and dielectric characterization was performed on the films, and the results were compared to pure terpolymer. Electrical polarization and dielectric spectroscopy showed that the composite films are dielectrically lossier than pure terpolymer; however, they also show a higher dielectric constant than pure terpolymer. Strain measurements and electrical actuation proved that although decreased in magnitude compared to pure terpolymer, electrostriction is still present in the composite films. Electrical actuation also showed that the presence of barium hexaferrite particles causes an increase in overall temperature of the film when an electric field is applied. A study was done to examine how the barium hexaferrite particles align when subjected to a magnetic field. It was found that the particles stack one on top of another along the short axis of the particle. Magnetic characterization was then done on composite films. Vibrating-sample magnetometry showed that only one of the poling conditions creates films that are poled in the intended direction. Magnetic actuation showed that all composite films have a response to an external magnetic field; however, maximum actuation occurs when the magnetic field is one hundred and eighty degrees (180o) out of phase from the film\u2019s overall c-axis.

Legacy sediments, deposited during the historic, post-settlement period marked by deforestation, land clearing, and plowing of uplands and valley slopes, act as a significant non-point source of nitrogen to the Bay. At Big Spring Run in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, these legacy sediments now overlay a buried hydric soil, which affects the contemporary transfer of nitrogen from uplands to streams.  Recent research suggests that nitrogen transfer to streams is also affected by soil drying and rewetting.  Climate change models predict that the variability and magnitude of precipitation events will increase over time.  Such changes could lead to extended periods of droughts, followed by increased precipitation.  These dry-rewet cycles can alter the structure and activity of soil microbial communities, impacting nutrient retention and release. This project was undertaken to increase the understanding of nitrogen processing and movement in legacy sediments along a landscape gradient before and after soil drying.\nShort-term incubations were carried out on field-moist soil as well as on soil that was air-dried, then rewetted prior to incubation. Samples were from three landscape positions (non-legacy uplands, legacy zone, and stream bank) and three layers (top 20 cm, midlayer, and bottom layer) .  Respiration rates, net ammonification rates, and net nitrification rates were determined in laboratory incubations.  A community-level physiological profile and extracellular enzymes were assayed to determine microbial activity levels.  Four key discoveries were found from this work: net nitrification was greatest in the surface soils away from the stream bank; drought induced nitrate pulses were unexpectedly absent; buried hydric soils appeared to have low biological activity and low nitrification potential; and the low activity in the buried layer may have been due to a lack of labile carbon.\nGiven their prevalence in Pennsylvania there was a critical need to understand how nitrogen flows through legacy sediments to improve predictions and management of nitrogen transport from uplands to streams.  Future measurements are needed to explore how different hydrological flowpaths impact microbial communities and contaminant pulses in, and between, soil layers, and how such interactions change after the removal of legacy sediments.  My data suggest that flowpaths through the buried hydric layer will not have strong nitrogen immobilization, despite high C in that layer.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2913], "author_name_tesi": "Weitzman, Julie Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Weitzman", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Julie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye", "Jason Philip Kaye"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye, Thesis Advisor", "Jason Philip Kaye, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["biogeochemistry", "nitrogen", "legacy sediments"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Variation in Soil Nitrogen Retention Across Land Uses, Landscapes, and Landforms in Central Pennsylvania", "id": "13210jnw142", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13210", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThe global nitrogen (N) cycle has been substantially altered by human activities \u2013 like land-use change \u2013 with natural inputs of N to the biosphere now exceeded by anthropogenic inputs. These shifts have led to increased availability and mobility of N, which in turn can change the rates and pathways of N cycling and loss. It is not clear, however, the extent to which the fate of newly deposited N varies across ecosystems, nor which mechanisms play major roles in driving such differences. Thus, as the global N cycle continues to change due to human impacts, understanding variation in soil N retention and loss across different ecosystems becomes ever more important. The ultimate objective of this dissertation was to assess the major pathways of N transport and transformation in different land-uses prominent in central Pennsylvania.\n\n\tIn order to better understand the possible fate of N deposition and its contribution to both internal and external N cycling processes a watershed N budget was constructed for the Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) \u2013 a 7.9-ha forested, first-order catchment in central PA known to receive high inputs of atmospheric N. Results showed that inputs of N to the Shale Hills CZO were greater than outputs, with plant biomass and soils acting as major sinks for deposited N. Ultimately, these results suggest that forests can retain a large portion of inorganic N inputs. To determine the possible mechanism for such high N retentive capacities in forests, and whether other land-uses behave similarly, a 15N labeling study was conducted to quantify the soil sink strength for inorganic N in forest, urban, and agricultural ecosystems. The rate and magnitude of soil N retention in the different land-uses was measured by separating total soil N and 15N into labile and stable pools using long-term incubations with repeated leaching. Pathways of N retention were found to vary dramatically among land-use types, with forests stabilizing the most new N inputs, followed by urban and agricultural systems. These differences in N stabilization are largely due to differences in the pathways of N retention that are active in each land-use. Lastly, to understand how management practices might impact ecosystems known to be poor N retainers, N retention in soils of a legacy sediment impacted stream reach was studied. Intact soil columns were extracted from three distinct soil horizons, with the surface and mid-layer horizons characterized as agricultural soils, while the deepest layer served as a proxy for a buried forest soil. Each soil column was isotopically labeled with 15NO3- and then subjected to drought conditions followed by a rewetting event. Low initial 15N retention in all three soil horizons was largely balanced by leaching losses, providing evidence for N saturation in such systems. Further, evidence of NO3- flushing following the rewetting of the dry soil horizons suggests that a fluctuating water table could release stored NO3- to nearby waterways. Thus, it appears that the expected N removal capacity of one soil horizon can be impacted by the long-term burial beneath another soil horizon that is characteristic of a different land-use. Overall, this dissertation shows that the cycling of N is dynamic across different ecosystems, and that as anthropogenic N inputs continue to increase, it will be important to document the dominate pathways of N retention in different ecosystems in order to help us to better manage N losses.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13094], "author_name_tesi": "Weitzman, Julie Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Weitzman", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Julie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Patrick Joseph Drohan", "Richard Charles Stehouwer", "Denice Heller Wardrop", "Patrick Joseph Drohan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye, Dissertation Advisor", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Chair", "Patrick Joseph Drohan, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Charles Stehouwer, Committee Member", "Denice Heller Wardrop, Outside Member", "Patrick Joseph Drohan, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Biogeochemistry", "Soil", "Land Use", "Nitrogen", "15N", "N Retention"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Distributed Cellulosic Ethanol: A County Level Investigation of Sustainable Production Potential\n", "id": "9268", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "338", "abstract_tesi": "Development of ethanol from cellulosic biomass may present significant opportunities for areas and regions not currently engaged in starch based ethanol production.

Though there has been numerous efforts to characterize the nation\u2019s cellulosic ethanol production potential, there is little information available for local communities to gauge local resource availability for fuel production.  Furthermore, there have not been significant investigations into sustainable cellulosic fuel production at a local level based upon local site characteristics. \nThis study developed a methodology for assessing cellulosic resource potential at a local level through spatial analysis of current land use patterns and agricultural practices, application of sustainability criteria based upon local conditions, and a biofuel calculator designed to accommodate this data.  Five cellulosic resource categories were considered during this study and the process for determining local fuel production potential were illustrated with a case study of Centre County, Pennsylvania.  Land based resources for which spatial analysis was performed included: 1) forest products; 2) agricultural residues; and 3) dedicated energy crops.

Two levels of sustainability (low and high) were calculated, and differed in the level of protection applied to riparian areas as well as in the removal rates of biomass material from forest and agricultural ecosystems.  A cellulosic biomass total from all five resource categories was ultimately converted into a local ethanol fuel potential and compared against local fuel demand to asses the degree to which local cellulosic resources might offset local fuel demand.\nThe case study of Centre County, PA demonstrated that ethanol production potentials increased from a level capable of meeting just under 10 percent of the county\u2019s fuel demand under the high sustainability scenario encompassing only forested land within 50 meters of roads up to a maximum of over 25 percent of consumption for the low sustainability scenario encompassing all harvestable forestland in the county.  This thesis and calculator show that, though local biofuel potential can not fully meet total liquid fuel demand for the study site with the sustainability criteria applied in this calculator, there is a considerable resource potential present.  Economic development opportunities may be realized through the sustainable collection local cellulosic resources and the production of a value added product such as ethanol.\nThrough the creation of a calculator, this study provides a tool for local communities to better understand local resource collection potential under a sustainably paradigm for liquid fuel production.   The biofuel calculator is a flexible tool which can be easily updated to keep pace with new technological specifications for the ethanol industry, as well as potential changes in biomass yields, consumption rates and land use patterns at the study site level.  Moreover, the calculator may be used as a comparative analysis tool for local, regional or other scaled applications.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [332], "author_name_tesi": "Welch, Amy P", "last_name_ssi": "Welch", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Amy Glasmeier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Amy Glasmeier, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["renewable energy", "calculator", "sustainability", "biofuel", "biomass"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "God, Oil, and Politics: Hebrew Prophetic Texts and the Dynamics of Regional Economy in the Southern Levant During the 8th and 7th Centuries B.C.E.", "id": "26193", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11487", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "During the 8th and 7th centuries B.C.E. the Eastern Mediterranean underwent significant political and economic changes as the ever-expanding Neo-Assyrian Empire overtook small Levantine states such as Israel and Judah.

The current study examines this rapid and dramatic restructuring of the economy as an avenue to better understand the composition of the prophetical texts of the 8th and 7th centuries B.C.E. Critical in this evaluation are the archaeological remains of the olive oil industry of the late Iron Age, which indicate a massive centralization and intensification of production following Assyrian hegemony in the region. The move toward large-scale production is situated in the context of a move toward royal estate farming that was conducted in order to meet the tribute demands imposed by the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

This demand for salespeople creates a buyers\u2019 market, and as such provides the future sales professional with numerous employment opportunities.  With more sales positions to fill than potential candidates, sales managers need to enhance their recruitment efforts to increase their chances of attracting top sales talent.  To differentiate from the competition and become a company where salespeople are attracted to and ultimately consider as a place to work, sales organizations must establish and convey an employer brand.  Defined as \u201cthe package of functional, economic, and psychological benefits provided by employment, and identified with the employing company\u201d (Ambler & Barrow, 1996, p. 187), the employer brand is simply the company\u2019s reputation as an employer. The purpose of this study was to explore sales manager perceptions of employer branding strategies B2B companies use for the external recruitment of entry-level salespeople. To explore these issues, a grounded theory qualitative data analysis approach was chosen.  Ten sales managers from B2B companies who engaged in the external recruitment of entry-level salespeople for their organization were interviewed for this research study.  The interviews were subsequently transcribed and coded, using a three-phased coding process that resulted in the construction of themes.  Secondary data was also analyzed and coded for this grounded theory study.  A theoretical grounded theory framework was developed for a better understanding of employer branding\u2019s role in recruitment.  The study results revealed that building a solid employer reputation by creating value for current and potential employees attracts job applicants to fill sales positions, and retains ideal employees as well.  The findings suggest that leveraging employer branding for recruitment is far better for attracting a large pool of candidates than relying on the corporate brand.  However, neither employer branding nor leveraging the corporate brand appears to be producing the best quality salesperson applicants.  The findings did suggest that employers could improve recruitment efforts to attract better quality candidates by engaging in, or increasing campus recruiting.  The findings indicate that if companies increase their efforts to build a strong employer brand and target college campuses with their employer branding messages, they will attract a sufficient number of quality salesperson candidates, building a foundation for successful entry-level salesperson recruitment.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13818], "author_name_tesi": "Welliver, Michele Carol", "last_name_ssi": "Welliver", "middle_name_ssi": "Carol", "first_name_ssi": "Michele", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. William J.

Arguably, the lubrication system is the most critical part in any mechanical system because it serves many functions including friction reduction, wear reduction, cooling, anti-corrosion, cleaning action and sealing. A loss of lubrication leads to high friction and excessive wear in gears and bearings, which leads to component failure. The key is to find the most effective and efficient method for\ndetecting lubrication loss in a closed mechanical lubrication system. Currently, the drive differentials for most vehicles do not possess a sensor to detect the lubrication level within the differential casing. Due to the lack of space and the dynamics of the gear system inside of the differentials, it is impractical to place a sensor inside of the housing. However, installing an external sensor on the differentials is reasonable and can be an after-market addition to most vehicles. Tests were performed on two different military vehicle differentials to determine if the\nlubrication level could be detected using a vibration sensor on the outside of the main drive differential. These tests consisted of monitoring the vibration levels generated by the differential at different speeds and lubrication levels. It was confirmed that, at different speeds and lubrication levels, the vibration levels in certain frequency ranges fluctuated depending on those two elements previously stated. By monitoring these vibrations, the lubrication level contained\nwithin the differential can successfully be determined with a practical amount of certainty.\nFuture studies will focus on creating a sensor that can be installed on any differential, detect the lubrication level and eventually send warning messages if a leak has formed.

An immobilized sulfonimide lithium salt is the source of lithium cations, while a cation-solvating cosubstituent, 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy, was used to increase free volume and assist cation transport. The ionic conductivities showed a dependence on the percentage of lithiated sulfonimide substituent present. Increasing amounts of the lithium sulfonimide component increased the charge carrier concentration but decreased the ionic conductivity due to decreased macromolecular motion and possible increased shielding of the nitrogen atoms in the polyphosphazene backbone. The ion conduction process was investigated through model polymers that contained the non-immobilized sulfonimide \u2013 systems that had higher conductivities than their single ion counterparts.\nChapter 3 details the synthesis of novel polyoctenamers with pendent functionalized-cyclotriphosphazenes as amphiphilic lithium-ion conductive membranes.  Cyclotriphosphazene monomers were functionalized with one cycloocteneoxy substituent per ring. Two different types of monomer units, one with oligoethyleneoxy cation-coordination side groups and the other with hydrophobic fluoroalkoxy side groups, were then prepared. The syntheses of these monomers, their ring-opening metathesis copolymerization, and the characteristics of the resultant polymers are discussed, with an emphasis on the dependence of ionic conductivity and hydrophobicity on polymer composition.\nChapter 4 focuses the design of novel amphiphilic single-ion conductive polynorbornenes with pendent cyclotriphosphazenes as candidates for lithium-ion conductive membranes for lithium-seawater batteries. The cyclotriphosphazene components were linked to a 5-norbornene-2-methoxy substituent to provide a polymerizable unit. 2-(2-Phenoxyethoxy)ethoxy co-substituents on the cyclotriphosphazene unit of the first co-monomer were utilized to simultaneously facilitate lithium cation transport and introduce hydrophobicity into the polymer electrolyte. 4-(Lithium carboxalato)phenoxy side groups were linked to the rings of a second co-monomer to provide tethered anions with mobile lithium cations and to increase the dimensional stability of the final polymers. The synthesis of norbornenemethoxy-based cyclotriphosphazene monomers, their ring-opening metathesis polymerization, deprotection and lithiation of the 4-(propylcarboxalato)phenoxy side groups, and the characterization of the polymers are discussed to illustrate the dependence of ion transport and hydrophobic properties on the polymer composition.\nChapter 5 is an analysis of the ionic conduction characteristics of silicate sol-gel poly[bis(methoxyethoxyethoxy)phosphazene] hybrid networks synthesized by hydrolysis and condensation reactions. Conversion of the precursor polymers to covalently interconnected hybrid networks with controlled morphologies and physical properties was achieved. Thermal analyses showed no melting transitions for the networks and low glass transition temperatures that ranged from approximately -38 \u00b0C to -67 \u00b0C.  Solid solutions with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide in the network showed a maximum ionic conductivity value of 7.69 \u00d7 10-5 S/cm, making these materials interesting candidates for dimensionally stable solid polymer electrolytes. \nChapter 6 investigates the influence of an organophosphate electrolyte additive on poly(ethylene oxide) lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide-based gel polymer electrolytes for secondary lithium battery applications. Tris(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)phosphate, is compared to the well known gel-battery component, propylene carbonate, through a study of complex impedance analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and limiting oxygen index combustion analysis.  The conductivities of the gels at low concentrations of tris(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)phosphate (1.9 - 4.2 mol %) are higher to those of propylene carbonate based systems with the same concentration. Despite micro-phase separation at high concentrations of tris(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)phosphate (7.0 \u2013 14.9 mol %), the conductivities remain comparable to systems that use propylene carbonate. The addition of tris(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)phosphate to poly(ethylene oxide) gives increased fire retardancy, while the addition of propylene carbonate to poly(ethylene oxide) results in increased flammability.\nThe appendix is a pyrolysis study of electrostatically spun poly(norbornenyldecaborane), a polymeric boron carbide precursor. Electrostatic spinning techniques provided an efficient and large scale route to non-woven mats of boron-carbide/carbon nanoscale ceramic fibers with narrow size distributions. Scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy were used to characterize the polymer and ceramic fibers. The results suggest that electrostatic spinning followed by pyrolysis can be used as a general route to a wide variety of single-phase and hybrid non-oxide ceramic fibers.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1569], "author_name_tesi": "Welna, Daniel Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Welna", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock", "Karl Todd Mueller", "Alan James Benesi", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock, Committee Chair", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Member", "Alan James Benesi, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polyphosphazene", "lithium battery", "polymer electrolyte", "ionic conductivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "damage-free patterning of ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate thin films for microelectromechanical systems via contact printing ", "id": "29002", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12406", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes the utilization and optimization of the soft lithographic technique, microcontact printing, to additively pattern ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films for application in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). For this purpose, the solution wetting, pattern transfer, printing dynamics, stamp/substrate configurations, and processing damages were optimized for incorporation of PZT thin films into a bio-mass sensor application. This patterning technique transfers liquid ceramic precursors onto a device stack in a desired configuration either through pattern definition in the stamp, substrate or both surfaces.\nIt was determined that for ideal transfer of the pattern from the stamp to the substrate surface, wetting between the solution and the printing surface is paramount. To this end, polyurethane-based stamp surfaces were shown to be wet uniformly by polar solutions. Patterned stamp surfaces revealed that printing from raised features onto flat substrates could be accomplished with a minimum feature size of 5 \u00b5m. Films patterned by printing as a function of thickness (0.1 to 1 \u00b5m) showed analogous functional properties to continuous films that were not patterned. Specifically, 1 \u00b5m thick PZT printed features had a relative permittivity of 1050 \u00b1 10 and a loss tangent of 2.0 \u00b1 0.4 % at 10 kHz; remanent polarization was 30 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5C/cm2 and the coercive field was 45 \u00b1 1 kV/cm; and a piezoelectric coefficient e31,f of -7 \u00b1 0.4 C/m2. No pinching in the minor hysteresis loops or splitting of the first order reversal curve (FORC) distributions was observed.\nNon-uniform distribution of the solution over the printed area becomes more problematic as feature size is decreased. This resulted in solutions printed from 5 \u00b5m wide raised features exhibiting a parabolic shape with sidewall angles of ~ 1 degree. As an alternative, printing solutions from recesses in the stamp surface resulted in more uniform solution thickness transfer across the entire feature widths, with increased sidewall angles of ~ 35 degrees. This was at the cost of degrading line edge definition from ~ 200 nm to ~ 500 nm. The loss of line edge definition was mitigated through the combined use of printing from stamp recesses onto raised substrate features. This allowed for printing of PZT features down to 1 \u00b5m wide. Solutions could also be transferred onto both fixed and free standing cantilever structures patterned into a substrate surface. \nOptimization of the stamp removal from the substrate was crucial in increasing sidewall angles of printed PZT films. It was determined that solutions gel once deposited onto the stamp before printing. As a result, printed films could not redistribute easily after transfer had occurred. Through a combination of varying peeling directions and peeling rates, it was possible to deposit thin film PZT on a pre patterned feature ~ 1 \u00b5m wide with sidewall angles > 80 degrees.\nThese printing techniques were utilized in printing a 250 nm thick 30/70 PZT onto pre-patterned cantilever structures for use in a bio-functionalized, mass sensing resonating structure in collaboration with a bio-nanoelectromechincal sensing research group from the University of Toulouse, France. The features ranged in lateral size from 30 down to 1 \u00b5m. The printed devices exhibited a relative permittivity of 500 \u00b1 10 and a loss tangent of 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 %. The hysteresis loops were well formed, without pinching of the loops, and exhibited remanent polarizations of 24 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5C/cm2, and coercive fields of 110 \u00b1 1 kV/cm. Dry etched features of the same size and thickness displayed a relative permittivity of 445 \u00b1 8 and a loss tangent of 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 %. The hysteresis loops exhibited pinched loops with remanent polarizations of 24 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b5C/cm2, and coercive fields of 112 \u00b1 2 kV/cm. Upon cycling, the dry etched films developed a 20 kV/cm imprint with reduced remanent polarizations to 20.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5C/cm2.\nAn understanding of the influence of patterning on the material properties is essential to predicting and controlling the behavior of polycrystalline films for MEMS applications. The influence of pinning centers on domain wall motion, particularly near feature sidewalls, in patterned features was explored in reactive ion etched (RIE) and microcontact printed films with the same thickness (i.e. 1 \u00b5m) and lateral feature size (i.e. 5 and 10 \u00b5m). This was accomplished by measuring global dielectric nonlinearity through Rayleigh and minor hysteresis measurements. For comparative purposes, local quantitative mapping of the piezoelectric nonlinearity was undertaken through the use of band excitation piezo-response force microscopy (BE-PFM). The printed and etched films exhibited differing microstructures which precluded quantitative direct comparisons. However, qualitative trends were identified. The dielectric aging rate of all Rayleigh parameters for the etched films increased with increases in perimeter length. In particular, the aging of the dielectric irreversible/reversible Rayleigh ratio (\u03b1/\u03b5init) increased from -7 \u00b1 0.6 %/decade to -11.6 \u00b1 0.7 %/decade (600 to 5 \u00b5m in width, respectively). In contrast, the printed films showed very slight aging rates. BE-PFM measurements revealed that defects from the etching process introduced large concentrations of pinning centers near the patterned sidewalls, resulting in reductions in the piezoelectric irreversible/reversible Rayleigh ratio (\u03b1/d33,init) as far as 750 nm from the sidewall. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) showed that variations in stoichiometry of crystal quality were not the predominant factor controlling the decreased domain wall mobility near sidewalls. In contrast to the etched films, printed films showed an increase in \u03b1/d33,init as the sidewall was approached due to mechanical declamping from the substrate.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11773], "author_name_tesi": "Welsh, Aaron Joel", "last_name_ssi": "Welsh", "middle_name_ssi": "Joel", "first_name_ssi": "Aaron", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Clive A Randall", "Michael T Lanagan", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Dissertation Advisor", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["soft lithography", "thin films", "dry etching", "piezoresponse force microscopy", "electroceramics", "piezoelectrics", "ferroelectrics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "FINANCIAL PRACTICES OF PARTICIPANTS AFTER BANKRUPTCY EDUCATION:                             FOUR STEPS TO A SECURE FINANCIAL FUTURE \n\n\n", "id": "10407", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4511", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study was designed to describe the population of individuals who took the Penn State Cooperative Extension class Four Steps to a Secure Financial Future and the self-reported behavioral changes participants have made since taking the class.

Knowledge management therefore is a learning behavior which is undertaken to acquire additional knowledge and improve the firm\u2019s profit capacity.  The core elements of knowledge management involve i) the learner, to whom the learning behavior is attributed, ii) the learning process, which consists of acquiring information and processing information to additional knowledge, and iii) the learning outcome, which is what we obtain from knowledge management.\n\nThis research study focuses on the firm decision maker as the learner while the learning outcome is the updated knowledge base playing an important role in the firm\u2019s decision making.  The learning process, where the learner obtains additional knowledge, has two phases.  In the information acquisition phase, the decision maker acquires internal information by managing the internal data from past experience (for example, learning-by-doing), and/or acquires the external information by communicating with others via social learning activities (e.g., conversation, cooperation, and collaboration).  On the other hand, the knowledge updating phase involves the use of a learning mechanism translating the collected information into additional useful knowledge feeding into the existing knowledge base.  \n\nThis research addresses i) how the learner (the firm decision maker) learns and seeks to formalize the learning process, ii) how the decision maker chooses among different knowledge management schemes, and iii) how social learning behavior reflects on production heterogeneity. This thesis research develops a conceptual model focusing on the definition of knowledge, the different ways of executing learning process, and the way the updated knowledge base influences future decision making.  The theoretical model is investigated by using a mathematical model where the decision maker maximizes the firm\u2019s profit over time under production and knowledge management constraints.  The optimization conditions point out the marginal costs and benefits of learning and guides the decision maker to allocate the physical input and the effort for knowledge management.  \n\nLearning strategies, such as always learn, wait to learn, learn-in-bursts, and quit learning, are observed in the deterministic dynamic programming model as the output price changes.  Considering the learning decisions under uncertainty, two stochastic dynamic programming models are constructed where the market and technological uncertainties are represented by the stochastic properties of output price and knowledge base accumulations.  The numerical results indicate that the decision maker faces several possible states because of the market and the technological uncertainty.  In addition, each state has its corresponding decision, and the decision maker will not make the learning decision until the true state is revealed.\n\nThe empirical model is used to reveal the connection between social learning and production heterogeneity.  A latent class stochastic frontier model (LCSFM) is introduced to estimate the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) India data.  The households\u2019 group-memberships are obtained, and the households assigned to the same group are assumed to use the same production technology.  Thus, the common characteristics of the households in the same group indicate the reason behind technical heterogeneity across households.  The empirical results indicate that caste rank plays an important role in households\u2019 production decisions.  Since households in the same caste rank are more likely to communicate with each other, they have a greater opportunity to exchange production information.  The frequent social activities within the caste rank provide the opportunity for social learning.  Thus, the importance of caste rank in production behavior represents the importance of social learning in production decision.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1951], "author_name_tesi": "Wen, Fang-I ", "last_name_ssi": "Wen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fang-I", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou", "James William Dunn", "Jeffrey R Stokes", "Duncan Fong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Chair", "James William Dunn, Committee Member", "Jeffrey R Stokes, Committee Member", "Duncan Fong, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Knowledge management", "Dynamic Optimization", "Social Learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "CARBONATE DISSOLUTION IN POROUS AND FRACTURED MEDIA", "id": "14905hzw122", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14905", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "        Mineral dissolution plays a critical role in determining water chemistry, element cycles, vegetation abundance over short time scales and global climate, and structures of natural systems over geological timescales. Extensive studies on mineral dissolution rates from laboratory and field observations suggest scale- and time-dependence. Spatial heterogeneity has been considered as one potential mechanism causing scale- and time-dependence of dissolution rates, as heterogeneity determines flow paths and changes the mineral-water contact possibility. However, due to the challenges in quantifying spatial heterogeneity, systematic understanding and quantification of mineral dissolution rates in natural systems and how they are impacted by spatial heterogeneity remain elusive.\n       This dissertation is dedicated to investigate carbonate dissolution in heterogeneous porous and fractured media. In porous media, we focused on the effects of spatial heterogeneity on dissolution rates under steady-state conditions where media properties are kept constant. Based on experimental data and numerical experiments under a wide range of flow and length conditions, we developed an upscaled rate law to quantify magnesite dissolution rates in heterogeneous porous media across scales through the quantitative function that links spatial heterogeneity, water-mineral contact time, effectively-dissolving magnesite, and dissolution rates. Generally, under the same flow and length conditions, high heterogeneity with large permeability variance and long correlation length diverts water mostly into the high-permeability quartz zones, therefore bypassing and minimizing the flow in the low-permeability magnesite zones. As such, the water-magnesite contact time is long and magnesite zones easily reach local equilibrium, leading to less effectively-dissolving magnesite and lower dissolution rates. On the other hand, the effects of spatial heterogeneity change with scales. Long residence times (e.g., small flow velocity and long domain length) promote the importance of diffusive-dispersive transport that homogenizes the spatial profiles, leading to negligible heterogeneity impacts. In contrast, under extremely short residence times where only reaction kinetics matters, spatial heterogeneities are not important. These findings provide a panoramic view on how magnesite dissolution rates change across scales and a quantitative framework to predict mineral dissolution rates in field scales.\n        For fractured media, as an extreme case of spatial heterogeneity with large permeability variance and long correlation length equal to the domain length, we focused on the evolution of carbonate dissolution rates and spatial heterogeneity in a fractured rock composed by carbonate, quartz and clay from the Brady\u2019s field in Nevada over a timescale of one year. Preferential calcite dissolution leads to the formation and enlargement of altered zones with larger porosity in the rock matrix and therefore faster solute transport. In turn, the enlargement of altered zones results in the decrease of calcite dissolution rates with time. This alternation is highly related to the carbonate abundance, as lower abundance of reactive minerals leads to greater alteration in solute transport in fractured media. Collectively, it was demonstrated that it is important to consider spatial heterogeneity in predicting the long-term property evolution of fractured rocks.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15720], "author_name_tesi": "Wen, Hang ", "last_name_ssi": "Wen", "first_name_ssi": "Hang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Li Li", "Li Li", "Zuleima T.

It can be present in raw or Ready-To-Eat (RTE) foods and is one of the most pressure- and heat-resistant vegetative foodborne pathogens.  High Pressure Processing (HPP) is a non-thermal process of increasing interest due to the needs for minimally processed foods in the market.  HPP allows microbial inactivation while maintaining the fresh flavors of foods; however, non-linear inactivation (tailing) during HPP of L. monocytogenes, which is a potential danger to food safety, has been reported.  My initial experiments focusing on the mechanism(s) producing tailing were unsuccessful.  Therefore, the focus of this research turned to changes in barotolerance, thermotolerance and cellular morphology of L. monocytogenes throughout its life cycle.  In part one, L. monocytogenes was grown to log, stationary, death and long-term survival phases at 35\u00b0C in tryptic soy broth with yeast extract (TSBYE).  Cells were diluted in UHT whole milk and then high pressure processed at 400 MPa for 180 s or thermally processed at 62.8\u00b0C for 30 s.  As cells transitioned from log to long-term survival phases, D400 MPa and D62.8\u00b0C increased 10 and 19 fold, respectively.  Cells decreased in size as they transitioned from log to long-term survival phases, and rod-shaped cells transitioned to cocci as they entered late-death and long-term survival phases.  In part two, cells in long-term survival phase were centrifuged, suspended in fresh TSBYE and incubated at 35\u00b0C.  As cells transitioned from long-term survival to log and stationary phases, they increased in size and log reductions increased following HPP or heat treatment.  In part three, cells in long-term survival phase were centrifuged, suspended in UHT whole milk and incubated at 4\u00b0C.  After HPP or heat treatment similar results were observed as in part two.  These results demonstrate that cells of L. monocytogenes are most barotolerant and thermotolerant in long-term survival phase, which needs to be considered when developing food processing or preservation methods to eliminate L. monocytogenes.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3099], "author_name_tesi": "Wen, Jia ", "last_name_ssi": "Wen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jia", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "Stephen John Knabel", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Thesis Advisor", "Stephen John Knabel, Thesis Advisor", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["life cycle", "morphology", "barotolerance", "Listeria monocytogenes", "thermotolerance"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Factors affecting biofilm formation and transition of Listeria monocytogenes to the long-term-survival phase and their possible roles in persistence in food processing plants", "id": "14191", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7227", "abstract_tesi": "Our earlier research showed that Listeria monocytogenes changes its cellular morphology from bacilli to cocci and increases its resistance to heat and high pressure during the transition to the long-term-survival (LTS) phase.  The goal of this thesis project was to understand factors affecting biofilm formation and transition to the LTS phase and their relationships to persistence in the food processing environment.  The transition to the LTS phase was significantly affected by both initial cell density and pH (P < 0.001) with initial cell density being the main determining factor.  Control of population growth/death kinetics appeared to be consistent with the Logistic Equation and under the control of L. monocytogenes, not external environmental factors (e.g., loss of nutrients).  After 30-d incubation, the mean cell density was 4.3 \u00b1 1.1 \u00d7 108 CFU/ml and there was no significant difference between any of the initial cell density and pH treatment combinations (P > 0.05).\nTo understand the transition of L. monocytogenes to the LTS phase on a gene expression level, the transcriptomic profiles of L. monocytogenes at different growth stages in tryptic soy broth with yeast extract (TSBYE) were compared using a whole-genome DNA microarray.  A total of 225 differentially expressed genes (\u2265 4-fold, P < 0.05) were identified during the transition to the LTS phase.  Genes related to cell envelope structure, energy metabolism and transport were most significantly upregulated in the LTS phase.  The upregulation of compatible solute transporters may lead to accumulation of cellular solutes, lowering intracellular water activity and thus increasing bacterial stress resistance in the LTS phase.  The downregulation of genes associated with protein synthesis may indicate a status of metabolic dormancy in the LTS phase. When cells in the LTS phase were inoculated into fresh TSBYE the transcriptomic profiles resembled those of log-phase cells (r = 0.94) and decreased baro- and thermotolerance were observed.  \nThe LTS phase may help L. monocytogenes persist over a long period of time within harborage sites in food plants and subsequently transmit to food products during processing.  Specific strains of L. monocytogenes are known to persist in food processing plants for years and cause contamination; however, there is a lack of understanding as to why specific strains persist in different processing plants that process different foods.  Thus, we investigated the effects of different L. monocytogenes strains and different types of food-conditioning films (FCFs) on cell attachment, growth, and biofilm and cocci formation, which may help explain the persistence of specific strains in food processing plants.  Type of FCF, strain and their interaction significantly affected cell density after 2-d incubation (P < 0.001).  Meat and poultry FCFs showed significantly higher cell densities, as compared to the control without FCF (P < 0.05).  All strains showed medium to very high densities on the respective foods from which they were isolated, except that the strain J1703 (isolated from turkey) showed very low cell density on Wegman\u2019s Brand turkey deli but very high densities on all other brands of turkey deli meat.  Strains lacking the comK prophage showed lower cell densities than those containing the prophage on all four meat and poultry FCFs (P < 0.05).  Biofilms were only formed by strains containing the comK prophage.  Cocci were formed by all strains on all FCFs after 2-weeks incubation.  The ability of specific strains of L. monocytogenes to form biofilms on specific FCFs and subsequently control their entry into the LTS phase may explain why specific strains persist in different food processing plants and cause contamination of foods manufactured in those plants.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7214], "author_name_tesi": "Wen, Jia ", "last_name_ssi": "Wen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen John Knabel", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "Stephen John Knabel", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "Edward G Dudley", "Allen T Phillips", "Zhang, Wei"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen John Knabel, Dissertation Advisor", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen John Knabel, Committee Chair", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Committee Chair", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Member", "Allen T Phillips, Committee Member", "Zhang, Wei, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Listeria monocytogenes", "persistence", "long-term-survival phase", "biofilm"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Optimization of an outbound logistic network: a vehicle routing problem", "id": "19243", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8643", "abstract_tesi": "Outbound logistics is one of the primary processes of logistics, concentrating on the delivery of finished products to the retailers.

Probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA) are used to model the semantic patterns in the observations of the sensors. A novel pattern discovery algorithm is developed to extract the PFSA model from symbol sequences. It is shown that this algorithm can capture semantic structures more effectively than the existing techniques. In order to formulate the data fusion problem for semantic features, a link is established between the formal language theory and functional analysis by constructing a Hilbert space over a class of stochastic regular languages represented by PFSA. New algebraic operations are defined for PFSA with a family of parametrized inner products. The norm induced by the inner product is interpreted as a measure of the information contained in PFSA. Applications of this technique are discussed in the following areas: a) Orthogonal projection in the Hilbert space to solve the model reduction problem of PFSA. Numerical examples and experimental results are provided to elucidate the process of model order reduction. b) Supervised learning of semantic features of heterogeneous sensor data in the product Hilbert space. The semantic features are combined optimally for classification using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The proposed algorithm has a set of parameters that can be potentially configured by the users to adapt the algorithm to environment changes. The proposed algorithm is validated for object recognition at the US-Mexican border. An architecture of fusion-driven sensor networks is introduced to incorporate the proposed fusion framework in sensor networks. The network protocol, called dynamic time-space clustering (DSTC), and its heterogeneous version, are designed to adapt the network to the fusion algorithms. A sensor network for selectively tracking mobile targets is implemented in the network simulator NS-2 for both homogeneous and heterogeneous sensor fields in an urban scenario for validating the propose architecture.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6877], "author_name_tesi": "Wen, Yicheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Wen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yicheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Asok Ray", "Asok Ray", "Shashi Phoha", "Qiang Du", "Alok Sinha", "Qian Wang", "Ishanu Chattopadhyay"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Asok Ray, Dissertation Advisor", "Asok Ray, Committee Chair", "Shashi Phoha, Committee Chair", "Qiang Du, Committee Member", "Alok Sinha, Committee Member", "Qian Wang, Committee Member", "Ishanu Chattopadhyay, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wireless sensor network", "pattern recognition", "Information fusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Sub-km-gridlength Ensemble for Representing Mesogamma Hazard-prediction Uncertainty in the Stable Boundary Layer over Complex Terrain", "id": "25606", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10982", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Atmospheric transport and dispersion (AT&D) forecasting in the stable boundary layer over complex terrain is inherently uncertain. An ensemble prediction system with sub-km horizontal grid spacing and high vertical resolution is used with the goal of quantifying this uncertainty. Diversity in initial conditions and/or planetary boundary layer/surface layer physics within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model provides ensembles with up to 12 members. WRF explicit ensemble member data drive trajectory calculations and the Second-Order Closure Integrated Puff (SCIPUFF) model for hazard prediction. Explicit ensemble outcomes from SCIPUFF are compared against SCIPUFF forecasts driven by single members derived from the WRF ensemble and capable of leveraging ensemble wind-field uncertainty statistics. Ensemble performance is evaluated for both 1.3-km and 0.4-km horizontal-grid-spacing ensemble configurations for three case studies of differing flow regimes with respect to the Nittany Valley in central Pennsylvania. AT&D uncertainty is expected to be dependent on small-scale drainage flows and circulations related to trapped-lee wave activity over the valley. \n\nResults demonstrate that a 12-member ensemble provides reasonable spread in AT&D outcomes. Additionally, single-member SCIPUFF forecasts reflect much of the spatial spread and impact probability given by explicit SCIPUFF ensemble forecasts but at a reduced computational cost. When evaluated against meteorological observations from the Rock Springs observation network within the valley, ensemble performance statistics demonstrate that low-level wind and temperature forecasts exhibit a statistically significant improvement in the 0.4-km configuration forecasts over the 1.3-km configuration forecasts. Analysis reveals that sub-km horizontal grid spacing better captures temperature and wind fluctuations related to drainage flows and trapped-lee wave activity that directly impact AT&D, and in general, the sub-km ensemble reliably samples the true state of these low-level variables. The best forecast skill is given by the full 12-member ensemble configuration involving both initial-condition and physics diversity. In the trapped-lee wave cases, the use of localized data assimilation positively impacts overall probabilistic forecast skill while the drainage flow case appears more dependent on model physics than initialization strategy with the available observations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10562], "author_name_tesi": "Wendoloski, Eric B", "last_name_ssi": "Wendoloski", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David R Stauffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David R Stauffer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Numerical Weather Prediction", "Ensemble Modeling", "Stable Boundary Layer", "Complex Terrain", "Nittany Valley"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Geochemistry of the Union Springs Member, Marcellus Formation in Central Pennsylvania and Environmental Implications of hydraulic fracturing", "id": "25053", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11069", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The black shales of the Appalachian Basin have gained renewed and widespread attention over the last several years. While gas has been produced from the Appalachian Basin for over one hundred years, low recovery had made these source rocks uneconomical to companies in the past. In the last several decades, advances in drilling technology and an increase in demand have renewed interest in the Marcellus Formation as a source of natural gas; however, concerns over the safety of hydraulic fracturing persist. Additionally, debate continues over the conditions that persisted when the Marcellus Formation was deposited, specifically, over the relative importance of primary productivity versus the preservation of organic matter.\n\nTo better understand the depositional conditions that persisted when the Marcellus Formation was deposited, a high-resolution geochemical data set was constructed for the Union Springs Member from more proximal to more distal from the paleo-shoreline in the Appalachian Basin. Results suggest that during deposition, the sediment-water interface and a portion of the water column was anoxic to sulfidic. As deposition continued, euxinia was periodically interrupted by dysoxia and even oxic conditions, and a greater influx of clastic material occurred. Such variations were likely related to variations in water depth and progradation of deltaic complexes from the eastern margin of the Appalachian Basin.\n\nSequential extractions were performed to determine the phase in which the metals reside in the Union Springs Member, both to confirm geochemical conditions under which the Marcellus Formation was deposited, and also to gain a better understanding of what conditions may mobilize and transport metals from Marcellus Formation after hydraulic fracturing. It has generally been believed that the elevated concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS) are due to the dissolution of constituents from the shale by the water that is injected during hydraulic fracturing. Most notably, results show that uranium was solubilized from the sample during the first extraction step involving hydrochloric acid. This most likely is related to the presence of acid-soluble uraninite in the samples, suggesting that uranium may be solubilized from the Marcellus Formation after hydraulic fracturing.\n\nTo assess the mobility of uranium from the Marcellus Formation, a small sample set of produced waters was analyzed for the presence of naturally occurring radionuclides. Uranium was not detected above the method detection limit in the flowback waters. It is still difficult to conclude that hydraulic fracturing is the cause of mobilization of uranium reported in previous data sets, as little published data is available, and radium and uranium do not appear to be in secular equilibrium. However, an accurate method for the determination of uranium in produced and flowback water samples is required to assess the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and uranium concentrations in flowback and produced waters. Preliminary research shows that the use of Kinetic Phosphorescence Analysis (KPA) may be a viable method for the determination of uranium at low concentrations. Use of such techniques may allow better understanding of the presence of uranium and other radionuclides in flowback and produced waters.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10642], "author_name_tesi": "Wendt, Anna Katherine", "last_name_ssi": "Wendt", "middle_name_ssi": "Katherine", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Allan Arthur", "Rudy Slingerland", "Susan Louise Brantley", "Gary Lee Catchen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Allan Arthur, Dissertation Advisor", "Rudy Slingerland, Committee Member", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Member", "Gary Lee Catchen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Marcellus Formation", "geochemistry", "uranium", "hydraulic fracturing"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Patterns of Misreporting Intimate Partner Violence Using Matched Pairs", "id": "15395", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7633", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an issue of serious public concern. However, IPV policy interventions and theoretical development have been complicated by mixed research evidence about whether men or women experience higher levels of IPV. Some of this discrepancy arises from IPV\u2019s measurement and whether abuse and victimization is asked of one or both partners.  In this study, I examine partner IPV reporting discrepancies and develop hypotheses for why such discrepancies might exist. I examine IPV reporting discrepancies with matched partner data from 1,393 heterosexual couples collected in Wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.  I hypothesize that discrepancies in reporting between men and women may be caused by gendered effects of social desirability, such that 1) disagreement about violence will be greater for reports of male perpetrated violence than female perpetrated violence, 2) disagreement about victimization will be greater for reports of male victimization than female victimization, 3) disagreement between partner reports of male perpetrated violence and victimization will increase with the seriousness of IPV, 4) disagreement between partner reports of male perpetrated violence and victimization will decrease with the seriousness of IPV, and 5) disagreement  about men\u2019s victimization will be greater for men with higher levels of masculinity.  Finally, I hypothesize that masculinity may be the mechanism which explains male underreporting of victimization, such that more masculine men will be more likely to deny victimization than less masculine men.  Overall, results suggest that disagreement is greater for male perpetrated violence and victimization than for female perpetrated violence and victimization, with the exception of injury, and that disagreement increases with the seriousness of IPV.

It begins with a conceptual chapter that makes the case for including constructs at multiple levels of aggregation to separate their effects at each level. Studies in this line of research typically include characteristics at only one level of analysis, without regard for the implications of doing so. I refer to this limitation as omitted level bias. Further, city characteristics have largely been omitted in recent research and I encourage their inclusion as a level.\n\tThe conceptual chapter is followed by two empirical chapters. Each of these concentrates on one community characteristic to reveal distinct effects of that construct at each level and to consider the implications of this separation for understanding underlying processes. The first empirical chapter, Chapter 2, focuses on a composite measure of disadvantage, separating its effects at the block-group, tract, and city levels using multilevel modeling. The second empirical chapter, Chapter 3, follows a similar procedure for income inequality. The data for both chapters are block-group level crime counts from the NIJ Foreclosure and Crime Data Archive and demographic information from the American Community Survey for 11,485 block-groups nested in 3,797 tracts nested in 35 cities. \n\tChapter 2 reveals that the association between disadvantage and crime depends on the level of aggregation.  Disadvantage appeared associated with crime at all three levels when each was considered in isolation, but joint analyses to separate effects by level showed that only tract and city disadvantage increase crime. Further, I find cross-level interactions between the measures of disadvantage that suggest that the influence of disadvantage on crime is stronger when disadvantage at other levels of analysis is low. By contrast, in Chapter 3, tract inequality is the only measure of inequality that increases crime once the effect of inequality is separated across the levels of aggregation. As with disadvantage, I find cross-level interactions between inequality measures. Taken together, results support the continued pursuit of distinct effects for different levels of analysis and the incorporation of explicit reference to level of analysis in theory.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12169], "author_name_tesi": "Wenger, Marin Ruth", "last_name_ssi": "Wenger", "middle_name_ssi": "Ruth", "first_name_ssi": "Marin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["D Wayne Osgood", "D Wayne Osgood", "Derek Allen Kreager", "Barrett Alan Lee", "Shannon Marie Monnat", "Eric P Baumer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["D Wayne Osgood, Dissertation Advisor", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Chair", "Derek Allen Kreager, Committee Member", "Barrett Alan Lee, Committee Member", "Shannon Marie Monnat, Outside Member", "Eric P Baumer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["neighborhoods", "disadvantage", "income inequality", "criminology", "omitted level bias", "multilevel"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Experiments on One-Dimensional Bose Gases: From Thomas Fermi to Tonks-Girardeau", "id": "7457", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6275", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A set of experiments was performed on a one-dimensional Bose gas system.

Our targeted vegetables were the protective deep orange, cruciferous and dark green leafy vegetables.\n\nThe first research step used eight focus groups, segmented by sex and vegetable-liker/disliker status, to investigate the process of family vegetable selection, especially of our target vegetables. Participants (n=61) in all segments reported more costs than rewards for serving vegetables. Past experiences, food preparer role expectations, and pleasing family member preferences led meal preparers to serve only a limited range of vegetables that were acceptable to all family members. Participants were unfamiliar with our target vegetables, did not know how to prepare them so they tasted good, and said that tasting samples or vegetable dishes might inspire serving them at family meals.\n\nThe second research step was an experimental community-based intervention, based on Social Cognitive Theory, which was designed to improve target vegetable serving and intake among rural Appalachian, low-income, middle-aged, married/cohabiting food preparers and their partners. Food preparers were randomized to the experimental or the control treatment. Experimental food preparers (n=25) attended 8 weekly lessons that eliminated commonly cited barriers to altering food choices by providing food preparers with skills, familiarity, knowledge and access to the target vegetables while highlighting ways to minimize cost, time and effort. Lessons used visual demonstrations, tasting opportunities, comparative data, handouts, and preparation of vegetable recipes (which food preparers took home to serve to their families). Control food preparers (n=25) received 8 weekly mailed packets that included the same handouts and recipes given to experimentals. \n\nEvaluation measures were completed by both food preparers and their partners using several questionnaires filled out at baseline, immediate post-test, and 3-month follow-up.

Initial impact analyses yielded few significant differences between original experimental and control treatments. However, subgroup analysis indicated food preparers in families reporting greater involvement of both parents and children in vegetable dish evaluation through a meal diary had significantly greater increases in intake and frequency of serving of target vegetables than those reporting poorer family involvement.

Because of the decline in grassland bird populations in North America I wanted to identify what species were using CREP fields.  I also wanted to identify what field and landscape characteristics affected use and productivity of avian species on CREP fields.  To assess the benefit of CREP fields benefit for grassland birds, I compared them to active hayfields.    \nThe project was conducted from May 2001 \u2013 July 2004 in 9 CREP counties of south-central Pennsylvania.  I randomly selected CREP fields in three size categories: 2.0 \u2013 4.0 ha, 7.3 \u2013 12 ha, and 16 \u2013 28 ha to get a mixture of field sizes because small fields were much more common than either medium or large fields.  Hayfields were located as near as possible to selected CREP fields.  I surveyed birds in all fields twice during the breeding season, using distance sampling to generate densities for each species that had > 25 observations.  I searched for nests in over half the fields that were surveyed.  Nests that were located were monitored until completion (fledging, depredation or abandonment).  Vegetation was measured at the nest and along the survey transects.  Landscape characteristics were calculated using geographic information system data for the areas surrounding the fields.  \nI made a total 1,929 observations of 31 different species on 114 CREP fields.  I monitored 969 nests of 19 species in 73 CREP fields.  The most common species was the red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) with 1,052 observations and 613 nests.  The next most common species were field sparrows (Spiza pusilla; 111 obs.; 171 nests), song sparrows (Melospiza melodia; 343 obs.; 78 nests) and indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea; 130 obs.; 21 nests).  The most common grassland specialists were grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum; 104 obs.; 19 nests) and eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna; 31 obs.; 9 nests).  Ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus; 3 nests), dickcissels (Spiza americana; 2 obs.; 1 nest), Henslow\u2019s sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii; 2 obs.), savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis; 17 obs.; 2 nests), vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus; 10 obs.; 5 nests) and bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus; 50 obs.; 1 nest) were uncommon to rare.  Mayfield nest success for the most common above-ground nesting species, red-winged blackbird, was 30.2 + 2.0% and the most common ground nesting species, grasshopper sparrow, was 12.4 + 7.1%.  \nI developed models to describe species density and nest abundance.  Both field and landscape characteristics were significantly associated with species density and nest abundance, but the specific variables and the direction of effect varied among species and in some cases varied between density and nest abundance within a species.  Consequently, there were no specific variables that were universally important to the community of birds using CREP fields. \nI made 68 observations of 7 different species on 16 hayfields and 185 observations of 8 different species on the 16 matched CREP fields.  Species richness was higher (p=0.001) on CREP fields (2.75 \u00b1 0.233) than hayfields (1.38 \u00b1 0.24).  Densities of field sparrows, song sparrows and indigo buntings were higher on CREP fields than hayfields (p = 0.012, 0.004, 0.006 respectively).  No other species differed in density between hayfields and CREP fields.   I located 193 nests of 10 different species on 15 CREP fields and 87 nests of 5 species on 15 hayfields.   Species richness of nesting birds was higher (p< 0.001) on CREP fields (2.47 \u00b1 0.40) than hayfields (0.60 \u00b1 0.19).  Field sparrow and song sparrow nest abundance was higher (p = 0.011, 0.001 respectively) on CREP fields (0.318 + 0.15, 0.193 + 0.10) than hayfields (0.006 + 0.01, 0.006 + 0.01).   No other species differed in nest abundance between hayfields and CREP fields.  However, wild turkeys, indigo buntings and eastern meadowlarks were only located nesting on CREP fields and not on hayfields.  Nest success of red-winged blackbirds (the only species with multiple nests on hayfields) was higher (p = 0.029) on CREP fields (27.9 \u00b1 6.2%, n = 59) than hayfields (12.6 \u00b1 3.4%, n = 73).    \nMy study indicated that generalist and edge species used CREP fields much more than grassland specialists.  Although numbers of grassland specialists are low, overall species richness, abundance and nest success were higher on CREP fields than hayfields.  To provide habitat for a diversity of farmland and grassland species and to increase the likelihood that grassland specialists will use CREP fields, the largest fields possible should be enrolled in the CREP program.  Since the sizes of agricultural fields in Pennsylvania tend to be small, one way to increase effective field size would be to attempt to enroll adjoining fields in CREP even if they are owned by different people.  Fields should be managed to provide heterogeneous vegetation, including heterogeneity of vegetation types (e.g. forbs and grass), species and structure (e.g. different heights and density).  Some form of maintenance, such as strip mowing, burning or light disking, on the field will probably be necessary to maintain or attain heterogeneity.  Monitoring of CREP fields should continue to assess how avian species composition and abundance change as the fields mature.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3475], "author_name_tesi": "Wentworth, Kevin ", "last_name_ssi": "Wentworth", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham", "Duane R Diefenbach", "Heather D Karsten", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham, Committee Chair", "Duane R Diefenbach, Committee Member", "Heather D Karsten, Committee Member", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Grasslands", "distance sampling", "grasshopper sparrows", "pennsylvania birds"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "CO2 Emissions in Yellowstone, USA, and Solfatara Volcano, Italy: Use of Eddy Covariance and Mass Flux Modeling", "id": "5996", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "939", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-04-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\tCarbon dioxide emissions are monitored in volcanic and hydrothermal areas to understand volcanic processes, to assess hazards in active regions, and to improve estimates of global volcanic and hydrothermal degassing.  Over the last twenty years, significant advances have been made in linking surface emissions of CO2, SO2, and other acid gases to volcanic processes at depth.  This advancement has been accompanied by improvements in methods to measure and monitor emissions in volcanic regions.  Despite these improvements, no tested method exists for obtaining large-scale (km2) estimates of CO2 degassing.  In this work, eddy covariance, a micrometeorological technique, was tested for the first time in volcanic and hydrothermal terrain to measure CO2 fluxes over large land areas (km2).  An eddy covariance (EC) station was deployed at Yellowstone National Park during August 1999 to determine if EC fluxes were consistent with surface flux measurements using the accumulation chamber technique in volcanic regions.  A second deployment of EC at Solfatara Crater, Italy, June 8-25, 2001 assessed if EC could continuously measure CO2 fluxes for volcanic hazards monitoring at this site.  Both regions had slopes less than 15 %, but displayed significant variations in CO2 and heat flux upwind of the EC tower. At Yellowstone, fluxes measured using EC varied over three orders of magnitude (from ~100 to 10,000 g CO2 m-2 d-1) and were consistent with fluxes measured using the chamber technique within a factor of 2.  At Solfatara, EC measurements of CO2 fluxes were made continuously for three weeks at six locations.  Turbulent (EC) fluxes were calculated in 30-minute averages and varied between 950 and 4460 g CO2 m-2 d-1 depending on location within Solfatara.  Comparing turbulent fluxes with chamber measurements of surface fluxes using footprint models yielded an average difference of 0 \u00b1 4 %, indicating EC measurements were representative of surface fluxes at this hydrothermal site.  \n\tReliable EC measurements (i.e., measurements with sufficient and stationary turbulence) were obtained primary during daytime hours (08:00 and 20:00 local time).  EC fluxes measured closest to the degassing pools within Solfatara were the highest measured during the campaign (4392-4459 g CO2 m-2 d-1).  Because EC fluxes include the contribution from degassing pools, where chamber fluxes do not, the difference between the EC measurements and estimates using chamber fluxes yielded emission rates between 12 to 27 t CO2 d-1 for the degassing pools in Solfatara.  For comparison, emissions for these features was previously estimated at 84 t CO2 d-1 following a seismic crisis in 1984 when the area experienced 3 meters of uplift.  Daily average EC fluxes varied by \u00b1 50 % with changes in atmospheric pressure, indicating volcanic emissions would have to exceed this for in order to predict volcanic hazard.  First-order models of magma emplacement or eruption suggest emissions could exceed this rate for events similar to those observed in the past.  In conclusion, eddy covariance was found to provide reliable estimates of surface fluxes both at Solfatara, and Yellowstone, thereby providing a new technique for monitoring significantly larger areas than previous methods.  Monitoring larger areas provides new insight to the temporal variability and spatial distribution of degassing in volcanic regions, and thus provides a new and useful technique for monitoring volcanic hazard.\n\tCO2 emissions were estimated for the Yellowstone volcanic / hydrothermal system using ground-based measurements and through modeling of the volcanic system.  The estimates of degassing of Yellowstone were within an order of magnitude of one another, and indicate that Yellowstone likely emits 3.7 \u00b1 1.3 x 1011 mol CO2 y-1.  This estimate is significant in that it represents up to 16 % of the global emission rate estimated for volcanic plumes, and up to 7 % of global emissions from volcanic and hydrothermal environments estimated at 6-7 x 1012 mol CO2 y-1, suggesting that more measurements are needed in hydrothermal regions to estimate global volcanic and hydrothermal emissions more accurately.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [931], "author_name_tesi": "Werner, Cynthia Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Werner", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Cynthia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Deines", "Susan Louise Brantley", "Kenneth James Davis", "David H Eggler", "John Corry Wyngaard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Deines, Committee Member", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Chair", "Kenneth James Davis, Committee Member", "David H Eggler, Committee Member", "John Corry Wyngaard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Yellowstone", "carbon dioxide", "Solfatara", "volcanic degassing", "diffuse fluxes", "eddy covariance"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "COMPARISON OF TWO VIDEO PROMPTING INTERVENTIONS TO TEACH DAILY LIVING SKILLS TO ADOLESCENTS WITH AUTISM", "id": "14277jlw1170", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14277", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study used an adapted alternating treatments design to evaluate and compare the effects of video prompting (VP) and video prompting plus frequency building (VP + FB) to teach daily living skills to three adolescents with autism spectrum disorder.

Today, the itinerant activist architect has emerged as an alternative to office-bound practice.  Typically defined as one who uses design as a tool for political change, immediate response, and/or in reaction to man-made or natural catastrophe, an activist architect can be more simply described as one who takes architectural practice with him/her, commits to a community, and engages with that community\u2019s building needs. While it is still essential for the activist architect to possess formal design skills, knowledge of design process and craft, be well practiced in communicating ideas, and to promote ethics, safety, and responsibility, they must also cultivate knowledge and skills gained through informal experience \u2013 immersion in community, collaborative communication, thriftiness and inventiveness, trust-building. What, in addition to building, drawing, design, craft knowledge, and experience, enables the activist arch to engage in a meaningful way? The activist architect must be a facilitator, enhancing the inherent desire in every community to create a built environment reflective of their values and needs.\n\nDespite the rise of student interest in humanitarianism and social consciousness, and the profession\u2019s promotion and commendations of the \u201ccitizen architect,\u201d the formal curriculum of today\u2019s architectural education system (NAAB-centric) does little to educate or prepare students to be activists. If the activist architect is created through the combination of informal experience, immersion, compassion, sympathy, understanding, holistic thinking, proper application of skills, resourcefulness, politics, and formal training, how does one prepare for those things educationally? Furthermore, how does formal and informal knowledge, professional training, and experience get to communities in need in order to facilitate change?\n\nApparatus X, the design/build project informed by this thesis, is both an educational preparation and a response to the needs of an itinerant activist architect. It is a self-sufficient, mobile design/construction studio designed to serve the essentials of architectural activism \u2013 responsiveness, tools/knowledge transmission, and the establishment of relationships where knowledge sharing, design-as-dialog, and community engagement occur. This unit becomes part of the community, placing the activist architect exactly where they need to be in order to commune with their neighbors and collaborators. By empowering the autonomous re-development of a community through self-progressive architectural activism, the rebuilding process and the architect\u2019s role changes. It evolves from that of a removed designer to an engaged activist and community member.\n\nThree physical spaces designed into the mobile unit are critical to facilitating re-building efforts: tooling workshop, design studio, and relatable space open to public. In these spaces within the mobile unit, tangible and intangible deliverables are brought into the community: tools, knowledge, and empowerment through reciprocal re-building. With a prepared physical presence, the activist architect and his/her community can engage in design activities and tasks together \u2013 WITH the community rather than FOR the community. In this way, there is reciprocity in learning that provides local knowledge and direct feedback to the activist architect, creating an environment of effective design and engagement for the betterment of communities and individuals in need.\n\nFor me, as a student of architecture and a person who has been involved in community re-building, Apparatus X is a tool of anticipation \u2013 a tool designed for engagement; a tool prepared to address unknown factors that shape re-building efforts \u2013 and so I go forth, armed with this physical manifestation of architectural activism, prepared to facilitate change.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10837], "author_name_tesi": "Wertman, Aaron Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Wertman", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Aaron", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marcus Steven Shaffer", "James Theodore Kalsbeek", "Darla V Lindberg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marcus Steven Shaffer, Thesis Advisor", "James Theodore Kalsbeek, Thesis Advisor", "Darla V Lindberg, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Activist Architect", "Architectural Activism", "Social Capital", "participatory design", "itinerant architect", "embodied knowledge"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Are Load Forecasts Predictable?

High tunneling magnetoresistance, a high resistance demagnetized state, and applied field angular dependences were found in manganite magnetic tunnel junctions.  A switching signal and applied field angular dependence was seen YBCO/manganite spin diffusion measurement devices.  Various unique YBCO/manganite critical current suppression devices were measured and showed rather small gains.\n\nLa0.67Sr0.33MnO3/SrTiO3/La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO/STO/LSMO) magnetoresistive tunnel junctions were produced and tested.  The junction resistance was measured as a function of temperature and magnetic field applied at various out-of-plane angles. A tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of\n360% was found at 5K for the LSMO/STO/LSMO junctions.  The TMR signal was present up to a temperature of 275K.  Angular measurements showed increased switching fields with similar TMR values.  An unusual high resistance state was found when the samples were demagnetized at low temperatures. Demagnetized samples showed higher TMR values and sharp switching in low magnetic field sweeps than when measured in standard high magnetic field sweeps.  A TMR of 457% was found at 5K for the same LSMO/STO/LSMO junction quoted above.  Differences in resistance between the demagnetized state and the lowest measured resistance state showed that the TMR could be as large as 800% at 5K. Current-voltage (IV) measurements were taken and fit with a Simmons model to obtain the insulating barrier height and thickness. La0.67Ca0.33MnO3(LCMO)/STO/LSMO junctions were also created and displayed anomalous temperature and angular dependence with varying TMR values.\n\nLSMO/YBCO/LSMO spin diffusion measurement devices were created. Voltage was measured between a LSMO pad and a gold pad in contact with a thin YBCO layer subject to an injection current from a bottom LSMO layer. A voltage in such a configuration has been proposed to be generated by the diffusion of spin in the YBCO layer. Spin-like switching effects were seen. The voltage showed sharp switching between two states.  An inversion in the switching between the two states was found based on the orientation of the sample in relation to the magnetic field. Effects were seen to differ from hall signals of a single LSMO layer.  A spin diffusion length in YBCO at 100K was calculated to be approximately 0.1 microns.\n\nA variety of YBCO/STO/LSMO and YBCO/STO/LaNiO3(LNO) critical current suppression devices were created. The critical current of the YBCO was measured as a function of current injected from the LSMO/LNO layer. LSMO is a colossal magnetoresistive material (CMR) and is believed to have a highly spin polarized current (>80%). LNO is a unpolarized normal metal. The non-equilibrium state imposed by an injected polarized spin overpopulation in superconducting YBCO has been proposed to have a larger critical current suppression than the unpolarized case. However, differences between the two injection cases are not found to be appreciable. Gains (-dI(C)/dI(Inj)) are found to be approximately 1 - 3 at temperatures from 80K - 20K for both injection scenarios.

Adopting a person-oriented approach to studying sexual behavior provides a more nuanced understanding of sexual repertoires and can help elucidate the meanings of behaviors in the context of one another. The goals of this project were to use Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to (1) document patterns of sexual behaviors ranging from kissing to penetrative sex, (2) determine how latent class structure varies by gender and partner type (romantic v nonromantic), and (3) determine how latent class distribution varies by gender and partner type. Our analyses revealed four latent classes of sexual behavior, including Kissing Only, Kissing and Touching, All Behaviors, and Oral and Penetrative Only. Only men belonged to the Oral and Penetrative Only class. Engaging in the full range of behaviors was most common for students with romantic partners, whereas profiles characterized by only kissing and/or touching were most common for those with nonromantic partners. These findings demonstrate that college students engage in diverse patterns of sexual behaviors, and that these behaviors differ by gender and type of partner.  Researchers may achieve a more accurate and detailed understanding of sexuality in adolescence and emerging adulthood by recognizing the diversity of behaviors in sexual partnerships and between partner types.

Social relationships, including friendships and romantic and sexual relationships, may influence adolescent and young adult alcohol use. Understanding diverse social influences on heavy alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood is important for preventing heavy alcohol use and its associated negative consequences. In this dissertation, I examined how diverse social relationships are associated with heavy alcohol use during adolescence and young adulthood. By incorporating multiple relationships and exploring multiple mechanisms of social influence, this dissertation advances understanding of both who matters for heavy alcohol use in adolescence/young adulthood, and how those individuals matter.\nIn Paper 1, I used data from PROSPER to examine the unique associations of close others\u2019 frequency of drunkenness, unstructured socializing, and alcohol-related attitudes with adolescents\u2019 (ages 13-18) own frequency of drunkenness. I distinguished between the contributions of romantic partners, friends, and romantic partners\u2019 friends in order to determine whether these potential sources of influence have unique associations with drunkenness. When examined separately, close others\u2019 frequency of drunkenness, alcohol-related attitudes, and unstructured socializing each predicted adolescents\u2019 own frequency of drunkenness. However, in a combined model, only friends\u2019 frequency of drunkenness contributed independently to adolescents\u2019 frequency of drunkenness. Furthermore, unstructured socializing with friends predicted increased frequency of drunkenness as adolescents aged. \nIn Paper 2, I assessed how romantic partners\u2019 binge drinking and negative alcohol-related consequences are associated with changes in young adults\u2019 (ages 18-24 at baseline) own binge drinking using data from Add Health. I also explored whether relationship type (dating, cohabiting, or married) moderated these associations. Young adults increased their binge drinking frequency over six years if their partner binge drank more frequently at baseline. In addition, individuals increased their binge drinking frequency if their partners experienced more negative alcohol-related consequences at baseline; however, this association was no longer significant after controlling for additional variables. None of the associations measured differed by relationship type.\nIn Paper 3, I used data from the University Life Study to examine how sexual behavior with committed romantic and casual sexual partners, and with and without heavy alcohol use, is associated with daily fluctuations in college students\u2019 affect. Sexual behavior was associated with increases in positive affect and decreases in negative affect. These improvements in affect did not differ according to heavy alcohol use, sexual partner type, or interactions of these variables with each other or with semester in college.\nOverall, the results of this dissertation highlight the importance of friends in determining adolescents\u2019 heavy alcohol use and the importance of romantic/sexual partners in determining young adults\u2019 heavy alcohol use. The mechanisms of social influence on heavy alcohol use differ between friendships and romantic relationships and across developmental stages. Findings suggest that prevention strategies may differ when addressing friends\u2019 versus romantic partners\u2019 potential influences on heavy alcohol use.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14835], "author_name_tesi": "Wesche, Rose Bryant", "last_name_ssi": "Wesche", "middle_name_ssi": "Bryant", "first_name_ssi": "Rose", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eva Lefkowitz", "Eva Lefkowitz", "Steffany Jane Fredman", "Derek Allen Kreager", "Rachel Annette Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eva Lefkowitz, Dissertation Advisor", "Eva Lefkowitz, Committee Chair", "Steffany Jane Fredman, Committee Member", "Derek Allen Kreager, Committee Member", "Rachel Annette Smith, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adolescence", "young adulthood", "alcohol use", "friendship", "sexual relationships", "romantic relationships"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Politics of Faith:  Religious Authority and Politics During the American Civil War", "id": "11050", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6236", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the political involvement of denominational preachers, both black and white and in both the North and South, during the Civil War. Wartime ministers were often gravely conflicted, torn between patriotic impulses and a desire to maintain the inviolability of their sacred pulpits. Churchmembers and lay people however often expected the clergy to lead home front campaigns to sustain their respective war efforts and were unwilling to abide clerical apathy or recalcitrance. Most in the Union believed in fact that religious propriety did not discourage, but actually compelled, preachers to rhetorically toe the Union line. In the South, where political preaching was in theory an abomination but was in reality an established fact of life by the beginning of the Civil War, preachers became important agents of Southern nationalism and arbiters of Confederate loyalty. And as directed by the leaders of the foremost independent black denominations, the politicized wartime leadership of the African American clergy was characterized by both an emphasis on racial uplift and a persistent level of disagreement among its members.\nIn looking at conventional denominationalists who resisted the politicization of their offices and not, as a rule, pacifist or Peace Church leaders, this project reveals a degree of individuality and self-determination among members of the mainstream wartime clergy that has not been identified before. The categorization of ministerial thought featured in this dissertation is predicated on the truism that spirituality was as salient as Copperheadism in the formation of clerical attitudes during the war and thus likewise challenges the dominant historiography. And by showing the ways in which the greater society---including elements of state and local governments and the national government, denominational hierarchies, and local populations---proscribed ministerial speech during the war, this dissertation seminally posits that the war marked the first meaningful campaign to check the clergy\u2018s freedom of speech in the nation\u2018s history.

Distance education, often understood as a means for adults to further or diversify their educational attainment, is increasingly courting the demographic often referred to as \u201ctraditional age students\u201d (18-24 yr. old). These students are choosing distance delivery of education for a myriad of life issues and circumstances, but there is increasing speculation that there may be an overrepresentation of students with mental and emotional concerns choosing distance delivery of education to avoid the social environment of an on-campus educational experience. \n\tThere are no statistics that clearly pinpoint the number of students with diagnosable concerns in distance education nationwide, however, looking at the broad scope of mental health issues nationally, the National Institute of Mental health in 2008 reported that over 13% of the entire U.S. population sought mental health services or treatment. More importantly, they indicate that as much as 40% of adults with serious mental illness do not receive treatment for their mental health problem. Furthermore, there is no reason to believe that the distance learners, who represent the most diverse student population (age, race, etc.), would experience mental and emotional health concerns at a lower rate than the national statistics. Therefore, there is clear need to explore counseling and psychological support services to improve student access to expert opinion, improving students\u2019 quality of life, promoting distance learner retention, and bolstering academic success among the distance learner population.\n\tThis study is an exploratory qualitative study guided by four research questions with a 3-phase approach. Phase I was a pilot of a literature generated Delphi protocol. The Delphi protocol sought to generate expert consensus through an iterative process focused on the guiding research questions. The guiding questions focused on the potential challenges and benefits of providing some form of counseling and psychological service expansion to online learners. The research questions also sought to illuminate practitioner perspectives on institutional responsibility to provide services and generate potential strategies that might be employed to meet distance learner needs. Each of the rounds of the Delphi survey built on the data received in the previous round through data aggregation, feedback to participants, and subsequent revisions to the Delphi survey. Upon completion of the Delphi phase targeted interviews were conducted with two of the panelists and two senior \u201cdecision-makers\u201d for the purpose of expansion of the dataset and triangulation of data.\n\tThrough holistic and thematic coding of the data this study indicates that college counseling practitioners experience a high degree of conflict over expanding counseling services to the distance learner population. Student safety, individual and institutional liability and cost top the list of concerns, but those are balanced by the realization that access to services, retention of students, and academic success are all benefits of counseling to residential learners that are important for the distance learner as well.\n\tThe results of this study imply that the time is right to begin the conversation around expanding student services to distance learners. This, however, does not mean that we are currently at a point where we can confidently establish counseling and psychological services in the distance learner environment. This study suggests a more incremental approach that consistently asks, \u201cwhat can we reasonably do right now\u201d to meet the needs of students in the distance learning environment. The findings of this study imply that future expansion of counseling and psychological services will need to include honest conversations about the merits of technology integration in counseling practice and technological education for mental health counseling students and staff. Additionally, experimental implementations of technology in counseling practice and a slight shift in focus from attempting to translate counseling and psychological services into the distance learning environment to first finding ways to effectively identify distance learner needs and help them make appropriate connections to campus support services, their local community support services, a peer network for student support, and psycho-educational support mechanisms will be critical. And finally, a concerted effort to promote a national conversation around licensure and professional liability balanced with expanding access to services will likely be necessary before any large scale changes can occur.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8742], "author_name_tesi": "Wessel, Erik Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Wessel", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Erik", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson", "Robert M Hendrickson", "John Jesse Cheslock", "Jerry G Trusty", "Dennis Edward Heitzmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert M Hendrickson, Committee Chair", "John Jesse Cheslock, Committee Member", "Jerry G Trusty, Committee Member", "Dennis Edward Heitzmann, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["College", "University", "Student", "Online", "Distance-Learner", "Services", "Counseling", "Mental Health", "Psychologist", "Research", "Delphi"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF DISORDER ON SUPERFLOW IN THE QUANTUM SOLID He-4", "id": "11164", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3045", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The existence of a superfluid-like phase in solid helium was predicted in the late 1960\u2019s. The first convincing experimental evidence of such a phase was the non-classical rotational inertia (NCRI) measurements published in 2004 by Kim and Chan. Uncovering the exact microscopic mechanism giving rise to this effect is the subject of this dissertation. The majority of the work concentrates on exploring the effect of various types of disorder on NCRI and performing some of the first simultaneous measurements of crystal quality and NCRI. \nWe have measured the effect of 3He impurities in solid 4He crystals, from isotopically pure 4He (<1ppb 3He) up to 30 ppm. We find that the onset temperature and the broadness of the transition increase continuously with the 3He concentration. We have also studied ultra-high purity 4He crystals down to temperatures of ~1 mK finding no additional features in the period or dissipation. \nThe sample quality dependence of NCRI was measured by growing samples with various methods known to produce crystals of high or low quality. The addition of disorder is observed to increase the magnitude of NCRI and the onset temperature. Higher quality crystals were found to be more reproducible from sample to sample. In some crystals, annealing was found to reduce the NCRI and dissipation. However, there was always appears to be some non-zero minimum NCRI. \nThe first combined sample characterization and torsional oscillator measurements were made for solid helium confined within aerogel. Torsional oscillator measurements were made at Penn State and a complimentary x-ray scattering experiment was performed at the APS synchrotron facility. Although the samples were highly disordered (with an average grain size of 1000 \u00c5) the NCRI signals were comparable with those from high quality crystals, the data were also highly reproducible, as with the high quality samples. \nA set of complimentary torsional oscillator and heat capacity measurements with helium confined within thin slab geometries were undertaken to test a confinement effect reported by Rittner and Reppy. Rather than a confinement effect, we find that the data are more consistent with a quenching effect (a dependence on how rapidly the samples are grown). \nDay and Beamish reported an increase in the shear modulus of solid helium with a dependence on temperature, frequency, etc. which match the torsional oscillator experiments. In collaboration with Syshchenko and Beamish, we have studied the shear modulus and NCRI for both 3He and 4He crystals. The 4He solid exhibits an anomaly in the NCRI and shear modulus. The solid 3He only shows a shear modulus increase for the hcp phase and no NCRI effect for either the bcc or hcp crystal phases. \nWe have made the first simultaneous NCRI and optical measurements. These measurements enable us to determine crystal quality, orientation, etc. The experimental details will be presented along with some preliminary data because the experiments are currently in progress. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3035], "author_name_tesi": "West, Joshua T", "last_name_ssi": "West", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Moses Hung Wai Chan", "Moses Hung Wai Chan", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr.", "Peter E Schiffer", "Jayanth R Banavar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Moses Hung Wai Chan, Dissertation Advisor", "Moses Hung Wai Chan, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr., Committee Member", "Peter E Schiffer, Committee Member", "Jayanth R Banavar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["supersolid", "solid helium", "quantum solids"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Topographic fingerprints of hillslope erosion in the central Appalachians as revealed by meteoric 10be: Toward understanding the evolution of critical zone architecture", "id": "22613", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10166", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Regolith-mantled hillslopes are ubiquitous features of most temperate landscapes, and their morphology is a reflection of the climatically, biologically, and tectonically mediated interplay between regolith production and downslope transport.  Despite this understanding, relatively few studies have been able to independently measure these processes and relate them to mechanistic controls (e.g., bioturbation, freeze-thaw).  This dissertation encompasses two field-based studies and one remote data study that aim to quantify the rates of regolith production and transport, define the physical rules that dictate the shape of hillslopes, and identify the mechanisms by which topography adjusts.  Here, I exploit the cosmogenic radionuclide meteoric 10Be to measure regolith residence times, erosion rates, and downslope regolith fluxes in the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHO), located in the Valley and Ridge Physiographic province of the central Appalachians.  I compare these isotopic measurements with measures of hillslope morphology taken from recently acquired high-resolution LiDAR derived digital topography in order to test transport rules acting at  SSHO and tease out mechanisms responsible for regolith transport.  \n\tFrom this work I have determined that the Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory is approaching steady state, where the fluxes of regolith production at SSHO ridgetops are balanced by regolith erosion, within uncertainty.  Additionally, regolith fluxes along hillslopes in and adjacent to SSHO suggest that the entire landscape is lowering at a rate of ~30 m/My.  I have found that this condition exists despite observed aspect-related asymmetry with respect to hillslope gradient and regolith thickness.  In fact, it is likely that the topographic asymmetry is a result of the landscape adjusting its morphology in order to maintain a steady flux of material off hillslopes receiving different amounts of solar radiation over geologic time.  I contend that a transport mechanism that is both aspect-controlled and dependent on regolith depth is freeze-thaw cycling, which appears to occur more frequently on sun-facing hillslopes at SSHO.  \n\tAlong SSHO ridgetops, where regolith is uniformly thin and aspect-related differences are minimal, regolith flux appears to be linearly dependent on local topographic gradient.  Ridgetop curvature values extracted from high-resolution digital topography accurately reflect erosion rates and transport efficiency measured at SSHO, using meteoric 10Be.  Applying this understanding of landscape evolution from SSHO to first-order watersheds elsewhere in the Susquehanna River Basin (n=27), reveals that, in the steadily lowering reaches of the basin, transport efficiency is everywhere equal, despite differences in lithology, and proximity to the last glacial margin.  These results suggest that much of the topography of the central Appalachians has adjusted to regional climatic and tectonic perturbations occurring over the Cenozoic.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9855], "author_name_tesi": "West, Nicole R", "last_name_ssi": "West", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Kirby", "Rudy Slingerland", "Susan Louise Brantley", "Douglas Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Kirby, Dissertation Advisor", "Rudy Slingerland, Committee Chair", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Member", "Douglas Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["critical zone", "beryllium-10", "hillslope erosion"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Understanding the role of HFE polymorphism in cancer", "id": "22848", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10399", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Proteins involved in iron regulation are modifiers of cancer risk and progression. Of these, the HFE protein is of particular interest because of its interaction with both iron handling and immune function and the high rate of genetic polymorphisms resulting in a mutant protein. Clinical studies suggest that HFE polymorphisms increase the risk of certain cancers, but the inconsistent outcomes suggests a more nuanced effect, possibly interacting with other genetic or environmental factors. Some basic science research has been conducted to begin to understand the implications of variant HFE genotype on cancer, but the story is far from complete. In this chapter, the current understanding of HFE\u2019s role in cancer is described and models for future directions are identified. \nIntroduction: Studies suggest that iron metabolism is associated with tumor progression, but the relative importance of different iron handling proteins still remains unclear. We investigated the effects of the frequently polymorphic high iron gene (HFE), on tumor growth. This study is significant because of the ability of HFE mutant protein to alter iron handling and because our previous studies have shown the presence of this mutation is associated with altered cancer phenotype in cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that mutations in the HFE protein modify tumor progression and metastatic potential.\n Methods: C57BL/6 mice possessing either H67D/H67D (H63D in humans) or WT/WT HFE genotype, aged 18 months, were injected subcutaneously with 4x106 B16F10 cells. After 2 weeks, mice were sacrificed and the tumors were weighed and prepared for analysis of RNA, protein, and histology. At the same time, plasma was collected by cardiac puncture. Animal methods were approved by our IACUC, protocol 04-166. RT-PCR analysis of tumors was performed using the Mouse Cancer Pathwayfinder Array (SABiosciences). In parallel, bone marrow derived macrophages were cultured to determine how B16F10 cell cultures react to conditioned media from macrophages of each genotype. ELISAs were performed for ferroportin and ferritin. Secreted cytokine and chemokine content of macrophage media was assessed with an ELISA array (Qiagen). \n Results: H67D mice had significantly smaller tumors (t-test, P = 0.02) after two weeks. Exploratory qRT-PCR analysis of tumors revealed that the H67D host may suppress angiogenesis and growth. In culture, macrophages derived from H67D mice express higher levels of MCP1 (p = 0.02). Conditioned media from the H67D macrophages was associated with significantly less B16F10 cell growth compared to WT (p < 0.01 MTT, p = 0.01 BrdU). In macrophage cell lysates, H67D is associated with higher levels of Ferroportin (p = 0.03), and WT macrophages showed higher iron levels in response to FAC (p = 0.03). \n Conclusions: Tumors grown in H67D mice are significantly lower in weight than wild type control mice. Macrophages from H67D mice neither load iron nor support tumor cell proliferation as well as WT controls. Our data reveal the importance of HFE genotype on macrophage function and tumor growth.  The H63D HFE allele is seen in approximately 15% of the human population so its impact on cancer studies is likely significant.  \nBy utilizing a novel experimental model of HFE host genotype in cancer, the sizable effect of a single HFE polymorphism on tumor progression is now evident. Considering the results of this work alongside the existing basic science and clinical findings on HFE and cancer, the role of HFE in cancer biology is considerably more complex and potentially clinically applicable than previously thought. Based on the host effects observed in the C57BL/6 B16F10 model, it appears that HFE host genotype affects tumor growth through changes in angiogenesis, and changes in macrophage behavior. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10064], "author_name_tesi": "Weston, Cody Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Weston", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Cody", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "James Robert Connor", "Wafik El Deiry", "Willard Freeman", "Jennifer W Baccon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Dissertation Advisor", "James Robert Connor, Committee Chair", "Wafik El Deiry, Committee Member", "Willard Freeman, Committee Member", "Jennifer W Baccon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cancer", "Iron", "HFE", "H67D", "Melanoma", "Mouse"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Graphene Oxide Synthesis and Radiolysis", "id": "18645", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8778", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The diverse functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) provides this material unique chemical and physical properties that can theoretically be tailored during the synthesis and/or reduction of the material.

In particular, this effort focused on the dovetails joints in the compressor section of jet turbine engines.\nDeposition of nickel coated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) via High Velocity Particle Consolidation (cold spray) is being investigated as a possible self-lubricating coating for surfaces prone to fretting.  Although hBN is a solid lubricant which has a low coefficient of friction and is able to retain its lubricious properties in high temperatures and at high pressures, its brittle nature makes it a poor candidate for Cold Spray processes.  Encapsulation of hBN particles with a ductile medium, such as nickel, allows for particle deformation needed to create metallurgical bonds for cold spray coatings.\nNickel coatings ranging from 10-15\u00b5m have successfully been deposited onto 10\u00b5m hBN powder through an electroless nickel deposition procedure.  The fabricated composite powder has effectively been deposited onto Ti-6Al-4V substrates through cold spray deposition.  Incorporation of hBN particles within the coating have been characterized through optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, micro hardness, and friction tests.  Friction and bond tests have been conducted to determine self-lubricating properties and adhesion strength of the cold spray coatings.  Results indicate that hBN has been uniformly distributed within the cold spray coating yielding a reduced friction coefficient. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2666], "author_name_tesi": "Weyant, Jens E", "last_name_ssi": "Weyant", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Jens", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ivica Smid"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ivica Smid, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Eletroless Nickel Deposition", "Self Lubricating Coatings", "Cold Spray", "Hexagonal Boron Nitride"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Healthy leisure and its relationship to substance use in South African adolescents: A variable and person centered approach.", "id": "19239", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9194", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this dissertation is to develop a more complete understanding of how healthy leisure was associated with substance use in South African adolescents. Although initial comparisons of both US and SA prevalence rates suggest similar levels of substance use, SA adolescents initiate illicit substance use at an earlier age and transition through substances at a faster rate. One means of addressing substance use in adolescence is targeting healthy leisure use; however, little work has been done to understand the role of healthy leisure in adolescent substance use. Using previously collected longitudinal data (HealthWise), two studies, guided by Problem Behavior Theory, analyzed this association. Both studies took an exploratory approach to conceptualizing healthy leisure by conducting a factor analysis producing a healthy leisure factor and a leisure planning efficacy factor. \nStudy 1 (Chapter 2) used multi-level modeling to analyze the association between state and trait healthy leisure factors and substance use while including treatment and perceived parental over-control as moderators. Results indicate both state and trait healthy leisure were associated with substance use. The leisure planning efficacy factor was not significantly associated with substance use and perceived parental over-control and treatment did not moderate either relationship. \nStudy 2 (Chapter 3) used growth mixture modeling to identify distinctive developmental patterns of adolescent substance use development and then determine the influence of healthy leisure on subgroups of substance use development. A four-class solution was found to best fit the data, demonstrating three increasing (Early, Middle, and Late Escalators) and one stable (Low/Rare Users) trajectory group. Results found individuals with high levels of healthy leisure were more likely to be in the Low/Rare Users than in the Early or Middle Escalators class. The leisure planning efficacy factor demonstrated the opposite results where individuals with higher levels were more likely to be in the Early or Middle Escalators than in the Low/Rare Users class. \nOverall, results from both studies within this dissertation found subjective perceptions of healthy leisure protective against substance use.

Three closely related, widespread respiratory pathogens, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella pertussis, and Bordetella parapertussis, were implemented to understand how pathogens can utilize classical virulence factors to overcome host flora, and, conversely, how microflora can be utilized to prevent pathogen colonization.  After initially characterizing a locus in B. bronchiseptica predicted to mediate bacterial competition in vitro, the Type VI Secretion System (T6SS), we created a non-functional T6SS mutant to investigate how this pathogen uses this secretion system to initially induce pathology, modulate the immune response, and persist in the respiratory tract.  The mechanism underlying persistence was later investigated; the T6SS is capable of modulating lipid antigen presentation and NK T cell accumulation at the site of infection, causing deleterious downstream effects on antibody production.  Interestingly, although this secretion system has significant effects on the host and the immune response, the T6SS was also shown to mediate bacterial competition in our natural infection system.  B. bronchiseptica requires a function T6SS, a Type III Secretion System, and the master regulatory system, BvgAS, to displace nasal cavity microflora organisms in vivo and out-compete host organisms in vitro.  We also determined that bacterial competition within the respiratory tract can be immune-mediated; cytotoxic T-cells and IL-17, which can additionally cause the release of antimicrobial compounds, are also required to displace nasal cavity flora in vivo.  Interestingly, cytotoxic T cell-mediated microflora displacement was shown to be an essential mechanism for initial colonization.  In stark contrast, the human restricted pathogen, B. pertussis, did not displace murine host flora, and single host organisms were capable of blocking B. pertussis colonization.  Furthermore, mice that had been antibiotic treated, and therefore were lacking normal microflora, were shown to be more susceptible to B. pertussis infection.  As a first step to understanding how the T6SS is regulated and therefore understanding when this factor is utilized by these pathogens, we discovered small RNA regulatory molecules that target a putative T6SS effector.  Lastly, to correlate our murine research to humans, we used metagenomic sequencing to identify bacterial flora in the lower respiratory tract of healthy humans, as well as patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and asthma, to understand how the microbiome can contribute to health and disease.  Finally, the ethical implications of this experimental research were examined, in terms of identifying the best method for teaching effective ethical training during graduate research and, secondly, determining the ethical and legal implications of patenting human isolated microbes.

I then apply these techniques to the results of several recent studies and highlight how critical errors in interpretation might have been avoided by first resolving species boundaries. I then show that these approaches are an important first step in connectivity studies.

Differences in timing between co-located fluid and bulk apparent electrical conductivity data have previously been used to estimate solute mass transfer rates between mobile and less mobile domains; here, we consider if this behavior can arise from other types of heterogeneity.  Numerical models are used to investigate the electrical signatures associated with large-scale hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity and small-scale dual-domain mass transfer, and address issues regarding the scale of the geophysical measurement.  We examine the transport behavior of solutes with and without dual-domain mass transfer, in: 1) a homogeneous medium, 2) a discretely fractured medium, and 3) a hydraulic conductivity field generated with sequential Gaussian simulation.  We use the finite element code COMSOL Multiphysics to construct two-dimensional cross-sectional models and solve the coupled flow, transport, and electrical conduction equations.  \nOur results show that both large-scale heterogeneity and subscale heterogeneity described by dual-domain mass transfer produce a measurable hysteresis between fluid and bulk apparent electrical conductivity, indicating a lag between changes in the mobile and less mobile domains of an aquifer, or mass transfer processes, at some scale.  The shape and magnitude of the observed hysteresis is controlled by the spatial distribution of hydraulic heterogeneity, mass transfer rate between domains, and the ratio of mobile to immobile porosity. Because the rate of mass transfer is related to the inverse square of a diffusion length scale, our results suggest that the shape of the hysteresis curve is indicative of the length scale over which mass transfer is occurring.  We also demonstrate that the difference in scale between fluid conductivity and geophysical measurements is not responsible for the observed hysteresis.  We suggest that there is a continuum of hysteresis behavior between fluid and bulk electrical conductivity caused by mass transfer over a range of scales from small-scale heterogeneity to macroscopic heterogeneity.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1354], "author_name_tesi": "Wheaton, Daniel Devin", "last_name_ssi": "Wheaton", "middle_name_ssi": "Devin", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kamini Singha", "Kamini Singha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kamini Singha, Thesis Advisor", "Kamini Singha, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["electrical resistivity", "dual-domain mass transfer", "solute transport", "mobile-immobile domain model", "COMSOL"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Dietary Satisfaction and its Association with Weight Loss: An Exploratory Analysis", "id": "18746", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9203", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Weight loss and weight-loss maintenance are undertakings that require physical and mental stamina. Short-term weight loss success has been observed among diverse populations and within a variety of interventions; however, long-term weight-loss maintenance has not been widely evident, likely due to minimal continued adherence and satisfaction with the prescribed intervention. In an attempt to improve long-term adherence to weight-loss interventions, it is critical to realize the facilitators and barriers that may prevent or promote an individual\u2019s compliance. A review of literature was conducted to establish the influences related to satisfaction or adherence to a diet or dietary intervention. The most prominent influences included time, cost, motivation, self-control, family and friend support, like/dislike of foods, and availability or accessibility of foods. From this review, it was established that dietary satisfaction can be defined, at least partially, through the facilitators and barriers to adherence. \nA 45-item dietary satisfaction questionnaire (D-SAT) was created in 2004 that was consistent with the factors revealed through the aforementioned literature search. The D-SAT was completed in two weight-loss interventions in premenopausal women aged 20-45y with overweight or obesity (n=180; mean \u00b1 SD age=34.5 \u00b1 6.9 y; BMI=30.3 \u00b1 3.6 kg/m2). There were no differences between baseline D-SAT scores, thus the results were combined for analysis. A secondary data analysis was completed to evaluate the internal validity of the D-SAT through exploratory factor analysis of the baseline D-SAT scores. This analysis resulted in two versions of the D-SAT suggesting 6-factors (36 items) and 7-factors (38 items). The constructs were labeled: \u201cBenefits of diet, \u201cPreoccupation with diet,\u201d \u201cEating away from home,\u201d \u201cDiet planning,\u201d \u201cFamily impact,\u201d and \u201cFinancial cost,\u201d (6-factor D-SAT) and \u201cPersonal cost\u201d (7-factor D-SAT). \nThe 6-factor D-SAT and the 7-factor D-SAT were employed in a subsequent secondary analysis to explore the relationship between a prompt change in D-SAT score from baseline to week 2 (jumpstart phase of the intervention) and weight outcomes (body weight [BW] and body mass index [BMI]) during a 12 week intervention phase and 12 week weight-maintenance phase of a study in premenopausal women aged 20-45y that were overweight/obese. Sixty-eight women were included in the analysis whose D-SAT change scores from baseline to week 2 were stratified into 3 groups based on a decrease in score (negative group), no change (neutral group), and increase in score (positive group). A repeated measures ANOVA (4Time x 3Group) and Pearson\u2019s correlation were explored using the 3 groups. Results of the 6-factor D-SAT showed a significant main effect of time on BW [F (1.262, 82.02) = 125.722, p<0.001] and BMI [F (1.305, 123.95) =127.808, p<0.001]. A significant main effect of D-SAT group and time x D-SAT group interaction were not found for BW or BMI. The 7-factor D-SAT results also revealed a significant main effect of time on BW [F (1.243, 82.82) =124.949, p<0.001] and BMI [F (1.284, 83.43) = 127.463, p<0.001]; however, there was not a significant main effect of D-SAT group or time x D-SAT group for BW or BMI. Further, there was not a significant bivariate correlation between D-SAT group and BW and BMI change over the 24-week intervention for the 6-factor D-SAT or the 7-factor D-SAT. \nDue to the risks associated with overweight and obesity, it is critical to address the factors that influence satisfaction with a diet or dietary intervention, in order to personalize a regimen to the point of satisfaction, adherence, and subsequent improvement in weight, and long-term weight-loss maintenance. Continued analysis of the D-SAT in various populations and interventions is important for refining the questionnaire to confirm that satisfaction is addressed in its entirety and establish its use as a tool for gauging dietary satisfaction and maximizing weight-loss.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9022], "author_name_tesi": "Wheeler, Brooke Elaine", "last_name_ssi": "Wheeler", "middle_name_ssi": "Elaine", "first_name_ssi": "Brooke", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sharon M Nickols Richardson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sharon M Nickols Richardson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Diet", "Satisfaction", "Dietary Satisfaction Questionnaire", "Adherence", "Weight-Loss"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Experimental Studies on the Effects of a Spacer Grid in a 1x3 Rod Bundle Single and Two-phase Flow", "id": "21838", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9881", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the effects of spacer grids on the coolant flow through a nuclear reactor core is required for best-estimate design and analysis of the nuclear power plant.

A state of the art four sensor conductivity probe capable of measuring local time averaged two-phase flow parameters is employed to investigate locally the influence of the spacer grid on two-phase flow at four axial locations, one upstream and three downstream of the spacer grid. 1-Dimensional laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) is employed to measure local axial turbulence distributions in single-phase flow at three locations, one upstream, and two downstream.\nThe local conductivity probe data indicates a redistribution effect caused by the spacer grid, inducing mixing and lateral motion of the bubbles. Furthermore the local data indicates near the cap-turbulent to slug transition boundary an increased spacer grid induced coalescence effect through the decreasing group-I (spherical/distorted bubbles) void fraction. The slug and churn-turbulent transition boundary demonstrates a spacer grid induced breakup of bubbles observed in Sauter mean diameter leading to an increase in the interfacial area concentration.

The region with spacer grid dimples directly upstream of the measurements has increased turbulence intensity compared to the region without.

In the class, lectures on aerospace engineering topics are presented in support of the theoretical work of the design teams.  In lab, project teams learn the hands-on skills needed for the fabrication of a full-scale sailplane.   Data from a series of semi-formal interviews are used to explore how the social dynamics (such as a well-ordered social hierarchy and mutual accountability of upper- and lowerclassmen) support the learning of difficult aerospace engineering topics.

The antiglucocorticoid properties of DHEA-S suggest that it may protect against the long-term health consequences of chronic, stress-induced cortisol release. Little is known about the role of DHEA-S in the biological stress response in humans, but a handful of studies suggest that DHEA-S levels increase following intense physical stressors.

Results validate salivary DHEA-S levels collected via Salivette\u00ae and confirm that men have higher levels of DHEA-S than do women.  Further, DHEA-S levels are higher in the morning than in the late afternoon, which has not been reported before.\n\tThe second and third studies measured DHEA-S levels in response to acute laboratory stressors.

Immersive virtual reality (VR) may offer a solution to the training challenge.  VR technology presented in a CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) provides a high-fidelity, one-to-one scale environment where areas of the power plant can be recreated and virtual radiation environments can be simulated, making it possible to safely expose workers to virtual radiation in the context of the actual work environment.\nThe use of virtual reality for training is supported by many educational theories; constructivism and discovery learning, in particular.  Educational theory describes the importance of matching the training to the task.  Plant access training and radiation worker training, common forms of training in the nuclear industry, rely on computer-based training methods in most cases, which effectively transfer declarative knowledge, but are poor at transferring skills.  If an activity were to be added, the training would provide personnel with the opportunity to develop skills and apply their knowledge so they could be more effective when working in the radiation environment.\nAn experiment was developed to test immersive virtual reality\u2019s suitability for training radiation awareness.  Using a mixed methodology of quantitative and qualitative measures, the subjects\u2019 performances before and after training were assessed.  First, subjects completed a pre-test to measure their knowledge prior to completing any training.  Next they completed unsupervised computer-based training, which consisted of a PowerPoint presentation and a PDF document.  After completing a brief orientation activity in the virtual environment, one group of participants received supplemental radiation awareness training in a simulated radiation environment presented in the CAVE, while a second group, the control group, moved directly to the assessment phase of the experiment.  The CAVE supplied an activity-based training environment where learners were able to use a virtual survey meter to explore the properties of radiation sources and the effects of time and distance on radiation exposure.  Once the training stage had ended, the subjects completed an assessment activity where they were asked to complete four tasks in a simulated radiation environment in the CAVE, which was designed to provide a more authentic assessment than simply testing understanding using a quiz.  After the practicum, the subjects completed a post-test.  Survey information was also collected to assist the researcher with interpretation of the collected data.  \nResponse to the training was measured by completion time, radiation exposure received, successful completion of the four tasks in the practicum, and scores on the post-test.  These results were combined to create a radiation awareness score.  In addition, observational data was collected as the subjects completed the tasks.  The radiation awareness scores of the control group and the group that received supplemental training in the virtual environment were compared.  T-tests showed that the effect of the supplemental training was not significant; however, calculation of the effect size showed a small-to-medium effect of the training.  The CAVE group received significantly less radiation exposure during the assessment activity, and they completed the activities on an average of one minute faster.  These results indicate that the training was effective, primarily for instilling radiation sensitivity.  Observational data collected during the assessment supports this conclusion.\nThe training environment provided by the immersive virtual reality recreated a radiation environment where learners could apply knowledge they had been taught by computer-based training.  Activity-based training has been shown to be a more effective way to transfer skills because of the similarity between the training environment and the application environment.  Virtual reality enables the training environment to look and feel like the application environment.  Because of this, radiation awareness training in an immersive virtual environment should be considered by the nuclear industry, which is supported by the results of this experiment.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6393], "author_name_tesi": "Whisker, III, Vaughn Eugene", "last_name_ssi": "Whisker, III", "middle_name_ssi": "Eugene", "first_name_ssi": "Vaughn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Messner", "Anthony Baratta", "C Frederick Sears", "Lawrence E Hochreiter", "Robert M Edwards"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Messner, Committee Member", "Anthony Baratta, Committee Chair", "C Frederick Sears, Committee Chair", "Lawrence E Hochreiter, Committee Member", "Robert M Edwards, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Virtual Reality", "CAVE", "Radiation Awareness", "ALARA", "Training"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Observational Consequences of Gravitational Wave Emission From Spinning Compact Sources", "id": "7132", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1513", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis covers two distinct projects on gravitational wave physics.  The first project is a mathematical computation of the gravitational radiation recoil from spinning black hole binary mergers.  Radiation recoil speeds have important implications in several astrophysical scenarios such as black hole ejection from globular clusters and dwarf galaxies, hierarchical formation of black holes and more.  The inability to directly measure this effect means that theoretical predictions offer the only insight into the size and importance of radiation recoil in the aforementioned astrophysical scenarios.  The result found is that spin has the effect of reducing the recoil.  Furthermore, the recoil speed is bounded above by roughly 100 km/s.\n\nThe second project details computing the Fisher information matrix and parameter space search metric for spinning down periodic sources using a simple \"Ptolemaic\" model of the Earth's orbit.

The effects of SCI are often recognized as a loss of motor control and sensation in portions of the body below the level of injury. Autonomic nervous system function is also severely impaired.  Neurogenic bowel is a slow transit colonic dysfunction believed to result from a lack of supraspinal control of the sacral circuits regulating the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  It is one of the most prevalent comorbidities of spinal cord injury and is recognized by SCI individuals and caregivers as a lifelong physical and psychological challenge that profoundly affects quality of life. Despite the enormity of the problem, the mechanisms leading to colonic dysmotility after SCI have yet to be fully understood or effectively treated.\nThe enteric nervous system (ENS) intrinsically regulates GI motor functions and output to smooth muscle cells can be detected as neuromuscular excitatory and inhibitory junction potentials (EJPs and IJPs).  The ENS is unique in that it can function quasi-autonomously. However, it is extrinsically regulated by the autonomic nervous system.  Following a spinal cord injury, the function of the ENS is presumed to be preserved.  Complex integrated activities requiring both voluntary and reflexive muscular control, such as defecation, are significantly impaired.  With such a severe knowledge gap pertaining to neurogenic bowel, it is necessary to draw upon other disorders, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) that share similar abnormalities in colonic motility, to elucidate possible underlying mechanisms.\nUsing an acute rat model of T3-SCI combined with histological techniques and in vivo physiological approaches this research tested the overarching hypothesis that following SCI, long-term morphological alterations occur within the colon that affect the normal physiology and contribute to long-term colonic dysmotility, similar to those seen in models of IBD.\nThe first study assessed the levels of inflammatory markers and morphological changes that occur within the colon in T3-SCI rats. It was revealed there is an acute inflammatory response that is most significant 3 days post-injury, but resolves within 1 week.  Colonic mucosal crypt depth was significantly reduced within the proximal colon of 3-week T3-SCI rats.  Additionally, thickness of the muscularis propria and collagen content was significantly increased within the distal colon of 3-week T3-SCI rats.  Derangements in collagen networks and shortening of mucosal crypts are hallmarks of animals with colitis, and are known to contribute to the observed bowel motor dysfunctions.  These findings suggest that the acute inflammatory response following T3-SCI results in long-term pathophysiological remodeling of the colonic wall that can compromise its integrity and functioning. \nFollowing SCI, there is an immediate loss of vascular sympathetic tone resulting in circulatory hypotension that may limit blood flow through the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The GI system is highly dependent upon adequate blood flow for proper functioning and other models of gastrointestinal inflammation report that even brief periods of visceral hypoxia lead to GI dysmotility, inflammation and neuromuscular remodeling.  Following T3-SCI, rats displayed significantly reduced mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and IMA blood flow 3 days and 3 weeks post-injury.  Immunohistochemical analysis of colonic tissue revealed progressive changes in oxygen levels within the mucosa and myenteric ganglia following T3-SCI where tissue oxygen levels were significantly decreased acutely but significantly increased by 3 weeks.  T3-SCI rats had elevated levels of oxidative stress within the myenteric ganglia that was accompanied by a progressive loss of enteric neurons.  These data suggest that arterial hypotension diminishes mesenteric blood flow and that the resulting GI tissue hypoxia may be an underlying mechanism leading to colonic dysmotility.\n  Contractions within the proximal and distal colon were significantly reduced 3-days after SCI and persisted in 3-week SCI rats.  The nitrergic component of IJPs was significantly reduced in 3-day and 3-week SCI animals by 25% and 40%, respectively. The purinergic component appeared to be unaffected. Overall enteric neuron counts, as well as nNOS specific neurons, were significantly decreased in SCI animals.  \nIn summary, colonic neuromuscular junctions are disrupted in the post-SCI colon and this disruption is associated with a decrease in the inhibitory nitrergic component of enteric neurotransmission.  Since relaxation of the colonic smooth muscle is necessary for propulsion of luminal contents, we propose that the colonic smooth muscle becomes hyporeflexic, resulting in colonic stasis.  Therapeutic targeting of this failed inhibitory circuit may ameliorate neurogenic bowel symptoms and improve upon current bowel management strategies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16869], "author_name_tesi": "White, Amanda Rose", "last_name_ssi": "White", "middle_name_ssi": "Rose", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gregory Michael Holmes", "Gregory Michael Holmes", "David R Gater", "Andras Hajnal", "Ralph Lauren Keil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gregory Michael Holmes, Dissertation Advisor", "Gregory Michael Holmes, Committee Chair", "David R Gater, Committee Member", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Neurotrauma", "Spinal cord injury", "Enteric nervous system", "Tissue remodeling", "Colon"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Using Cover Crop Mixtures to Reduce Nitrate Leaching and Supply Nitrogen to Corn: Models to Inform Adaptive Management", "id": "27560", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12221", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Agriculture faces two great sustainability challenges: the ability to provide nutrition for a growing world population and the ability to increase ecosystem services that maintain clean air, clean water, and other benefits to humanity.  Planting cover crops is one management practice that can contribute towards realizing the goal of increasing ecosystem services.  However, to provide multiple ecosystem services and to manage tradeoffs between services, cover crops will need to be intensively managed.  This dissertation develops models and tools that can support the adaptive management of cover crops to reduce nitrate (NO3-) leaching and supply nitrogen (N) to a subsequent corn crop through N mineralized from decomposing residues.  Models were developed from a wide range of cover crop experiments carried out over 14 site years that included 39 different treatments of cover crop mixtures and monocultures composed from 18 different species of grasses, brassicas, and legumes.  A model for potential NO3- leaching under cover crop mixtures indicated that increasing total non-legume biomass N content (sum of fall and spring N contents) of a cover crop reduced leaching at a rate of -0.91 kg NO3--N kg-1 biomass N, up to a threshold of 51 kg N ha-1 total non-legume biomass N, above which increasing non-legume biomass N had no further effect.  In a model for relative corn yield following cover crop mixtures, relative yield was negatively related to fall and spring cover crop biomass carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios and positively related to soil carbon (C) concentration.  In another model, the response of unfertilized corn yields to a previous cover crop, relative to fallow conditions, increased with cover crop biomass N content and a decreasing biomass C:N ratio, with regression models that were different for winterkilled and winterhardy cover crops due to differences between the cover crop types in the length of decomposition and the synchrony between decomposition and corn N demand.  For these models to be applicable in an adaptive management process, farmers need to be able to rapidly and inexpensively measure cover crop biomass N content.  A handheld NDVI meter was able to accurately predict biomass N content in fall and spring for a wide range of cover crop types.  Coupling between C and N cycles also needs to be considered in relation to predicting N mineralization from decomposing cover crops and others forms of organic matter.  In models that represent soil organic C saturation, regulation of the C humification efficiency by C saturation level affected a coupled N mineralization model in a way that depended on the model structure used.  Under some model structures, N mineralization increases as the C saturation level increases, which could affect the extent to which cover crop residues supply N to subsequent crops.  Collectively, these models provide a foundation that can support the adaptive management of cover crops to provide N-related ecosystem services.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11611], "author_name_tesi": "White, Charles Macaulay", "last_name_ssi": "White", "middle_name_ssi": "Macaulay", "first_name_ssi": "Charles", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian", "Gregory Wayne Roth", "Douglas Brian Beegle", "Thomas Lehman Richard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye, Dissertation Advisor", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Chair", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian, Committee Chair", "Gregory Wayne Roth, Committee Member", "Douglas Brian Beegle, Committee Member", "Thomas Lehman Richard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cover crop", "nitrogen", "carbon", "models", "nitrate leaching", "nitrogen mineralization", "nitrogen immobilization", "decomposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Is Sleep Behavior Influenced by Perceived Discrimination?", "id": "14140", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7327", "abstract_tesi": "Prior research on the influence of perceived discrimination on sleep quality outcomes and the potential impact of socio-demographic factors on this influence has been limited. \nThis study uses an observational study design to analyze data from the cross-sectional annual 2007-2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey.

Across these venues the figure of the \u201cvanishing animal\u201d emerges as a dominant trope, as modern extinctions and the explosion of machine culture combine to frame animals within a spectral logic\u2014disappearing, but more visible than ever.  The first half of this dissertation examines the extensive technological, ideological, and representational apparatus through which animals and animal life are rendered in modern American culture, while the second half explores a significant, if surprising, correlative phenomenon whereby the modernized figure of the animal returns to haunt, and in fact disrupt, the very technics that facilitated its emergence in the first place.  \n\nChapter One addresses the popular genre of the \u201crealistic\u201d wild animal story and the hunting narratives of Theodore Roosevelt, and identifies the figure of the vanishing animal as a significant trope linking a number of prominent Americans at the turn of the century.  Chapter Two focuses more explicitly on the elaborate techn\u00e9 through which animals become nostalgia-laden images of the primitive, by examining Ernest Hemingway\u2019s Death in the Afternoon in the context of modern taxidermy, wildlife photography, and early nature films.  Chapter Three shifts directions in order to explore the \u201cprimitive\u201d behind, or within, modern technologies of communication.

As faculty move into administrative positions they will likely experience a significant shift in their job duties and expectations, from faculty positions with activities primarily centered on research, teaching and service within an academic discipline, to positions involving broader administrative responsibilities. This transition involves significant shifts in both personal and professional identities and activities.\n\tThe particular level of focus for this study is that of associate dean positions.  While the exact duties vary between institutions and between academic colleges, these positions have many commonalities and are typically at the administrative level directly above department heads and directly below academic deans.  This level of administration in higher education is important because this is the point at which I hypothesize that there is a significant shift in both job function and identity from one of alignment and involvement with one\u2019s academic field (i.e., that of a faculty member or a department head) to that of an administrative level that oversees academic departments that may or may not be closely aligned.  This stage of administration is also typically responsible for many broader administrative duties, as well as for increased interaction with other units outside of one\u2019s college or department.  One key area of exploration is why a faculty member, who has spent many years learning to become a researcher in a particular discipline, would choose to make what is arguably a career change to a time-consuming administrative position that will likely result in significantly less time for research or teaching in the faculty member\u2019s discipline.  I am also interested in the processes involved in this transition, and in how experiences in an administrative role influence professional and personal identity, as well as future career choices.  The research questions for this study are:\n\n\uf0a7\tHow do aspects of a faculty member\u2019s identity (personal and professional) influence their decision to enter into an administrative position (associate dean level) in higher education?\n\n\uf0a7\tHow does the new administrative role impact personal and professional identity for faculty members making this transition?  What are their experiences in the position and how do these experiences influence future personal and professional decisions?\n\tThe primary data sources for this project are interviews with faculty members who have made the transition from either faculty member or department head into the role of associate dean.   A pilot project for this study was conducted in the fall of 2008 and the spring of 2010, which informed this study and aided in the development of the interview protocol.  This project consists of qualitative interviews with 8 participants from each of 3 different research universities, for a total of 24 participants.  Interviews were coded and themes developed using the principles of grounded theory.  The conceptual framework that guides this project has been developed from current theories on leadership and professional identity and from the literature on academic leadership roles.  \n\tResults of the study are divided into two parts.  The first part (Chapter 4) discusses backgrounds of the individuals and their transition into the associate deal role.  Findings show that there are divergent pathways into the associate dean role and that identification by others is an important component.  The decision-making process involves an analysis of fit and timing in their personal lives and careers.   Mentoring is an important and valued activity but one which is not often present as one contemplates and moves into the role of associate dean.\n\tThe second section of findings (Chapter 5) shows that the transition into the associate dean position is stressful and difficult.  The first year in the position involves a great deal of on-the-job learning and skill acquisition, as well as learning to navigate the broader organizational environment.  The first year is also a time when participants experience significant changes in the nature of their interactions with colleagues from their previous departments, a great sense of loneliness and isolation, and a need to establish new peer groups.  During the first two years, new associate deans learn a great deal about the necessary skills and leadership traits necessary for academic leaders and they gain an understanding of how well they are able to assimilate into this role.  Findings show that associate deans still retain their identities as faculty members while also acquiring a new identity as academic administrator.  Almost all report high levels of job satisfaction and a desire to stay in their position or to consider higher levels of administration.\n\tSeveral overarching themes are discussed in Chapter 6.  First, the transition into the associate dean position is very difficult.  Second, there is tension in one\u2019s perceived identity versus the reality.  Third, despite the difficult transition and identity tension, there is an overwhelming sense of job satisfaction and desire to continue in an administrative capacity.  This study provides a better understanding about why faculty members enter administrative positions in higher education, as well as the impact of this job experience on their personal and professional identity and future career choices.  This research also has implications for practice as it provides information that will help improve the selection and retention of administrators in higher education and provides information to improve the transition process for newly appointed administrators.  This project is also significant because it adds to recently developed theories about leadership identity development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7472], "author_name_tesi": "White, Gary ", "last_name_ssi": "White", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson", "John Jesse Cheslock", "Kimberly Griffin", "Timothy Grant Pollock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson, Dissertation Advisor", "John Jesse Cheslock, Committee Member", "Kimberly Griffin, Committee Member", "Timothy Grant Pollock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Associate Deans", "hihger education administration", "leadership development", "leadership"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Estimating the Cost of \"No Child Left Behind\"  at the Local School Level\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "6796", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2041", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ingredients approach was used to estimate the cost of one school's effort to comply with the reading and writing achievement goals as established for Pennsylvania schools in response to the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001.

A key feature of the model is that accrual levels, rather than changes, are examined as they provide a more complete measure of the estimates included in earnings for the period.

Hypotheses were proposed for the examination of these mechanisms based on previous studies in ultrasound propagation in the skull bone (Fry, F.J. Ultrasound Med. Biol. 1977) and recent developments in transducer technology (Clement, G.T. et al. Phys. Med. Biol. 2000). The state-of-the-art has progressed to the point where noninvasive surgery through the skull in conjunction with alternate surgical monitoring modalities has been demonstrated to be feasible (Hynynen, K. et al. Med. Phys. 1993). This has been most recently been shown in the case of large-aperture segmented transducer arrays producing lesions within in vivo animal brain tissues through intact human skulls (Hynynen, K. et al. Magn. Resonance Med. 2003). But these studies have also identified a need for better energy transmission through bone layers to achieve an effective and noninvasive procedure.\nThrough a series of computer simulations and cadaveric experiments, it was demonstrated that modalities of enhancing the transcranial transmission of ultrasound energy do exist. First, the controlled modification of ultrasound amplitude distribution across a sonicated skull surface was shown to produce changes in the acoustic pressure field at the surgical site (White, P.J. et al. IEEE Trans. on Ultrasonics Ferroelectrics and Freq. Cont. 2005). Using this method, it was observed that the homogenizing of amplitude across a spherically focused wavefront has a less significant effect at the focus than had been previously proposed (Thomas, J. and Fink, M.A. IEEE Trans. Ultrason. Ferroelectr. Freq. Contr. 1996) (Aubry, J.F. et al. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 2003).  Second, the frequency dependence of transmission at local portions of the skull was determined with backscattered signals. These spectra were then used to examine the optimization of total energy transmission by the adaptive adjustment of sonicating frequency. And finally, a shear mode of vibration in the skull bone was shown to be better matched in characteristic impedance to surrounding media. This mechanism was then determined to have a higher attenuation index than the longitudinal mode of vibration in the skull bone, reducing its applicability for high-power applications.\nThese findings have revealed some fundamental aspects of ultrasound interaction with the structure of the human skull, opening up possibilities for clinical implementation. But they have also given impetus into finding other potential pathways for the transcranial delivery of energy into the brain parenchyma. With continued research, these discoveries will eventually integrate into a complete and effective system for noninvasive surgery within the brain.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4884], "author_name_tesi": "White, Phillip Jason", "last_name_ssi": "White", "middle_name_ssi": "Jason", "first_name_ssi": "Phillip", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nadine B Smith", "Ryan Clement", "Thomas B Gabrielson", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "Gregory J Clement"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nadine B Smith, Committee Chair", "Ryan Clement, Committee Member", "Thomas B Gabrielson, Committee Member", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member", "Gregory J Clement, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ultrasound", "skull", "therapy"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Processing and Deformation Mechanisms of Boron Carbide Titanium Diboride Directionally Solidified Eutectics\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12634", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5289", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Current military personnel armor solutions are generally monolithic ceramics including boron carbide (B<sub>4</sub>C), silicon carbide (SiC), titanium diboride (TiB<sub>2</sub>),  and aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).

I characterize seismic anisotropy in the mantle throughout the central Appalachian region, the boundary between the northern and southern segments, in order to identify any first-order lithospheric changes between the two segments.

Extended analysis was performed at three permanent stations located in the eastern, western and central part of the study area. These results show complex, or multilayered, anisotropy in the eastern portion of the study area and less complex, likely single layered anisotropy in the western portion of the study area. The top layer of the multilayered case has a \ufffdphi of 60 degrees\ufffd, roughly normal to the continental margin, which can be associated with frozen-in anisotropy from Triassic rifting. This top layer does not extend into the western most part of the study area, but instead pinches-out or diminishes in magnitude to zero. The bottom layer, present at all three permanent stations, is modeled with \ufffd phi = -60\ufffd, which is sub parallel to apparent plate motion and likely produced by finite strain in the asthenosphere. Fast azimuth directions in the northern portion of the study show less change along longitude and remain mostly E-W oriented.

Despite the\nundesirable common occurrence of attrition, it remains fundamentally understudied in STEM, and\nspecifically in engineering disciplines.

In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, about 945,000 people receive their drinking water from smaller CWS, and the CWS of Centre County provide an excellent example of small, rural systems with low human capital, changing regulatory demands, and aging infrastructure.  With resources already stretched, it may be difficult for CWS managers to adapt to the impacts of future climate change.  \nThe purpose of this dissertation is to study Centre County CWS managers\u2019 perceptions of their systems\u2019 capacities to adapt to more frequent floods and droughts.  Results from nine interviews with Centre County CWS managers and from managers\u2019 social network maps revealed that these managers are limited in their availability to raise funds, comply with water quality regulations, and upgrade system technology.  Some managers of small, rural systems compensate for scarce human capital and financial resources by taking advantage of layered social and institutional capital.  One of these systems is the Gregg Township Water Authority (GTWA).  In a series of mediated modeling focus groups, GTWA members and stakeholders helped to build a scenario generator that allows CWS managers to explore their potential adaptive capacities.  \nThe system dynamics-based Community Water System - Future Adaptive Capacity Scenario (CWS-FACS) generator allows managers to explore how system management variables change under five climate scenarios and three growth rate scenarios.  The sample scenarios presented to the GTWA suggested that the system\u2019s financial adaptive capacity is low and the stress on the system from a lack of financial resources may be greater than the climate-related stress.  Despite this result, managers remained concerned about climate change and found the scenario results to be plausible and consistent.  They also valued the model\u2019s flexibility and its utility as a learning tool for climate and other influences affecting their system\u2019s management.  Ultimately, these results indicate that mediated modeling and system dynamics are effective approaches for making climate information relevant to resource managers.

This overhaul of the welfare system followed years of debate over how the government should distribute aid to its citizens, and in many ways revolved around the question of who is deserving of government assistance. Unlike recipients of other aid programs, TANF recipients are often perceived as responsible for their own poverty because of their own moral failings and substandard work ethic; thus, they do not warrant government support.\nGiven their unique intersectional identity along race, class, and gendered lines, we may expect that there would be no safety net for TANF recipients categorized as the \u201cundeserving poor.\u201d And yet, one exists, so how are the interests of the \u201cother\u201d represented in government?

The general field of scholarship is at a critical turn where difference must be interrogated as difference between women, rather than between men and women (Aldoory, 2006). Such a perspective will offer more sophisticated analyses of women\u2019s experiences, choices and work outcomes.\nThis dissertation seeks to continue that trajectory by focusing on how sexuality shapes workplace experiences and sense of self, using college sports public relations, commonly called \u201csports information\u201d as a specific site of inquiry. Sexuality has not been a focus of research from any perspective in the context of sports media producers and micro-level studies of public relations and sports journalism workroom cultures, and this project seeks to address that gap. As a media scholar, I used this dissertation to take ideas developed in literature related to sports participation and physical education and apply them to a media setting, where I could begin to think about the ways sexuality mediates relationships among women, organizes the sports media workplace and works as a system of discourse that produces what Bartky (1988) calls a specifically feminine docile body.\nIn doing so, I have employed a poststructuralist perspective that regards sexuality not as an inherent identity natural in each of us, but as a discursive framework that normalizes bodies through the naturalization of sexual identity categories (Foucault, 1990). These ideas are not new among those situated in sports cultural studies literature. However, applying such an analysis to workplace media cultures does reflect a divergence in this area of scholarship, and I offer this project as an answer to recent calls for such a theoretical turn (Aldoory, 2006). \nIn articulating arguments about the ways sexuality as a public, but often invisible, discursive framework functions as an organizing principle in sports information, I draw from in-depth interviews with female sports information directors (SIDs) that I conducted at a regional and national convention of this industry\u2019s large, formal organization, called College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA). I used the transcripts to think through how the SIDs I interviewed situated sexuality in their everyday lives and to further theorize about the politics of sexuality in this particular sports media workplace culture.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1742], "author_name_tesi": "Whiteside, Erin E", "last_name_ssi": "Whiteside", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Erin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marie Hardin", "Marie Hardin", "Matthew Paul Mcallister", "Colleen Connolly Ahern", "Mark Dyreson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marie Hardin, Dissertation Advisor", "Marie Hardin, Committee Chair", "Matthew Paul Mcallister, Committee Member", "Colleen Connolly Ahern, Committee Member", "Mark Dyreson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sports media", "sexuality", "feminist media studies", "sports information", "gender and sports", "women in sports media"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Effects of Blockages on the Effectiveness of Cylindrical Film Cooling Holes", "id": "19972", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9489", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As power and efficiency demands for gas turbines increase, turbine inlet temperatures are rising.

The crowded conditions of the cell may also play a role in facilitating RNA folding, reducing the stability of any misfolded intermediates.  In addition, metal ions (and in particular divalent metal ions) stabilize RNA folding by neutralizing the inherent clash of negatively charged phosphate backbones.  Studies in this thesis focus on the effects of RNA folding under macromolecular crowding conditions, as well as the role of divalent metals on RNA secondary structural elements.\n\tAlthough the folding of functional RNAs under idealized conditions of dilute solution and high ionic strength has been well studied, much less is known about RNA folding under the more in vivo conditions of low Mg2+ concentrations and high macromolecular crowding.  It is believed that while RNA may fold hierarchically, a certain cooperativity of folding transitions might be necessary to fold the RNA on a biological timescale.  We propose that a functional RNA (transfer RNA) can fold cooperatively in the presence of a molecular crowder and physiological Mg2+ concentrations (Chapter 2).  In addition, through a study of secondary structure strengthening mutants, we established that under cooperative (two-state-like) conditions, thermostability of a functional RNA can be increased through base pairing.\n\tIn Chapter 3, the divalent metal ion interactions with several GAAA tetraloops were studied using thermal denaturation by UV absorbance (referred to as \u201cmelting\u201d throughout the thesis) to compare thermodynamic parameters, in particular, Gibbs free energy values (&#8710;G37).  GAAA tetraloops with both cg and gc closing base pairs were studied in the presence of divalent alkaline earth metals to determine if there is preference for a particular divalent metal ion to stabilize the GAAA tetraloop with a gc closing base pair.  Preliminary results suggest that, surprisingly, both closing base pairs prefer larger ions for stabilization.  An inner-sphere coordination site for the metal ion in the tetraloops may explain these results.\n\tFurther studies for both Chapters 2 and 3 are discussed in Chapter 4.  After studying the thermodynamics of RNA folding under crowding conditions, folding kinetics of a functional RNA can be studied using stopped-flow spectroscopy as well as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) single molecule studies.  We hypothesize that macromolecular crowding conditions should cause slower unfolding of tertiary structure under cooperative conditions.  In addition, Raman spectroscopy and phosphorothioate substitutions can be used to further probe GAAA tetraloops to determine the nature of a metal-coordination site.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1867], "author_name_tesi": "Whitman, Elisabeth E", "last_name_ssi": "Whitman", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Elisabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

However, recent evidence indicates that mature, cytoplasmic tRNA accumulates in the nucleus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to amino acid starvation or when nuclear export of tRNA is defective.  The mechanism and regulation by which tRNA returns to the nucleus is unclear.  To investigate whether this phenomenon occurs as a general response to nutrient starvation we deprived cells of glucose.  Employing fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) we were able to assay the localization of tRNA.  During glucose starvation, cytosolic tRNAs accumulated in the nucleus.  The accrual of mature tRNA in the nucleus was rapid (within 10 minutes) in response to nutrient starvation and completely reversible in an equally prompt manner.  This process did not require new transcription and was independent of the aminoacylation status of tRNA.  Investigation into the signal transduction pathways responsible for altering the cellular localization of tRNA revealed the TOR pathway is required for nuclear accumulation of tRNA in response to amino acid starvation, but not glucose starvation. Cells with constitutively low levels of cAMP\u2013dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity did not accumulate tRNA in the nucleus in response to amino acid or glucose deprivation.  As reported with amino acid starvation, the karyopherin Mtr10 was also required for nuclear accumulation of tRNA in response to glucose starvation.\nExamination of the mechanism by which various multi-copy suppressors are able to suppress defects in tRNA export revealed novel factors involved in cellular distribution of mature tRNA.  SOL1 and SOL2 were originally identified as multi-copy suppressors of the loss of tRNA-mediated nonsense suppression phenotype of a mutation in a known tRNA exporter, LOS1.  We show that SOL1 and SOL2 did not restore tRNA nuclear export or processing in los1 cells.  However, SOL1 and SOL2 are required for normal cellular distribution of mature tRNA and tRNA-mediated nonsense suppression.  Similarly, SBP1 was found to suppress the nuclear export defect of a mutation in the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase gene (TYS1).

Results suggest that idiom comprehension may not be specifically impaired in ASD beyond delays in structural language abilities such as syntax. Syntax, vocabulary (or both) were always significant contributors to performance on idioms, other figurative/nonliteral expressions, and pragmatic expressions, across three methods of analyses. Multiple regressions indicated that in addition to basic language skills, social skills contributed to understanding pragmatic expressions.

The phenotype of elevated androgen production persists in theca cells isolated from PCOS women and maintained in long-term culture.  Increased androgen biosynthesis in PCOS theca cells is correlated with increased enzyme activity and gene expression of several steroidogenic enzymes responsible for androgen biosynthesis including cytochrome P450 17a-hydroxylase (CYP17) and cytochrome P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage (CYP11A).\n\nThe overall objective of this thesis research was to test the hypothesis that altered transcriptional activation of the CYP17 promoter contributes to increased CYP17 gene expression in PCOS.  Specifically, the mechanism(s) involved in increased CYP17 expression was examined by I) comparison of CYP17 promoter activities in normal and PCOS theca cells, II) examination of minimal region(s) of the CYP17 promoter required for increased CYP17 gene expression, and III) identification of putative transcriptional regulators involved in CYP17 gene expression in normal and PCOS theca cells.  Studies were also initiated to examine whether the transcriptions factors involved in increased CYP17 transcription in PCOS theca cells coordinately increase CYP11A gene expression.\n\nThe comparison of CYP17 promoter function in normal and PCOS theca cells indicated that CYP17 transcription was increased in PCOS theca cells.  Sequences within the general boundaries of -235 to -109 bp of the CYP17 promoter were required for increased promoter function in PCOS theca cells.  Additional deletion and mutational analysis of the CYP17 promoter was performed to characterize basal and cAMP-response elements and identify the minimal sequences involved in increased CYP17 promoter function in PCOS.  Results of these analyses demonstrated that sequences between -188 and -147 bp of the CYP17 promoter were required for significant basal promoter function, whereas, cAMP-dependent regulation was conferred by two separate regions located within -172/-140 bp and -109/-61 bp.  Sequences between -188 and -140 bp were both necessary and sufficient for increased promoter function in PCOS theca cells.  Scanning mutation analysis of this region demonstrated that a 16 bp sequence, between -174 and -158 bp, was required for increased promoter function in PCOS theca cells.  Examination of this sequence revealed a nuclear factor-1 (NF-1) binding site within -174/-162 bp of the promoter.  A specific NF-1 family member, NF-1C, was found to bind this sequence and repress CYP17 promoter function in theca cells.  Mutation of this NF-1 site ablated NF-1C binding and NF-1C-dependent CYP17 repression.  Comparison of NF-1C binding in normal and PCOS nuclear extracts demonstrated that the level of NF-1C binding was reduced in PCOS.  CYP11A promoter function was also repressed by cotransfection of NF-1C in theca cells.  The C-terminal domain of NF-1C was found to be required for NF-1C-dependent repression of CYP17 and CYP11A transcription.  These studies suggest that the diminished NF-1C-dependent repression in PCOS theca cells may be associated with increased CYP17 and CYP11A promoter activity in PCOS.  The identification of NF-1C as an inhibitor of both CYP17 and CYP11A promoter function provides a possible common mechanism by which the expression of multiple steroidogenic enzymes are dysregulated in PCOS.  Future studies are required to identify how NF-1C and additional transcription factors coordinately regulate CYP17 and CYP11A transcription in PCOS theca cells.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2747], "author_name_tesi": "Wickenheisser, Jessica K", "last_name_ssi": "Wickenheisser", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janette Marie Mcallister", "Patrick Quinn", "Gary Alan Clawson", "Richard Scott Legro", "Robert G Levenson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janette Marie Mcallister, Committee Chair", "Patrick Quinn, Committee Member", "Gary Alan Clawson, Committee Member", "Richard Scott Legro, Committee Member", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["theca cells", "ovary", "transcription", "CYP17", "polycystic ovary syndrome"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS: AN EXAMINATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN COUPLES\n", "id": "7916", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6208", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An increasing number of studies have documented African Americans\u2019 experiences with racial discrimination.

Fire suppression, increasing temperature, and prolonged drought have resulted in increased wildfire frequency and severity in recent decades in the western United States.  Large and severe wildfires impact the carbon cycle both through direct emissions and reduced sequestration resulting from tree mortality.  Mechanical thinning and prescribed burning can reduce fire severity and carbon loss when wildfire occurs.  Ecosystem carbon dynamics altered during treatment implementation include carbon removal (thinning) and carbon emissions (prescribed fire), and following treatment include carbon sequestration (biomass growth) and charcoal production formed from burning vegetation.  To accurately assess long-term carbon costs and benefits of thinning and burning these dynamics need to be evaluated.\nWe quantified the 10-year post-treatment carbon stocks from a full-factorial experiment for three levels of thinning and two levels of burning in a mixed-conifer forest in California\u2019s Sierra Nevada.  Our results indicate that (1) treatments that retain large trees quickly recovered the initial carbon loss, (2) the carbon emitted from prescribed fire was recovered within the historical fire return interval, and (3) in treatments that included prescribed fire, fire-tolerant species experienced similar percent change in carbon as fire-intolerant species.  Selective thinning to reduce forest density, followed by prescribed burning to reduce surface fuels, can help stabilize forest carbon and restore ecosystem resilience.  By retaining large diameter trees and selectively thinning midsize (25-75 cm DBH) fire-intolerant tree species, the remaining tree carbon is aggregated in fewer, larger trees that are resistant to subsequent wildfire-induced mortality.\nAdditionally we compared charcoal carbon produced from coarse woody debris and fine woody debris charred during prescribed burning.  We quantified post-treatment charcoal carbon formation in organic matter and the top 5 cm of mineral soil from downed logs (> 30 cm diameter) that were present prior to treatment.  Our results indicate that there was no difference in the amount of charcoal carbon produced from combusted coarse woody debris and combusted fine woody debris.  We also compared treatment effects of charcoal production and found that treatments that included burning had significantly more charcoal carbon than the control.  Charcoal carbon represented 0.19% of total ecosystem carbon, a relatively small fraction of total ecosystem carbon.  However, charcoal carbon is long-lived and will likely continue to accumulate with repeated burning, leading to additional increases in long-term soil carbon storage.  Given increasing efforts to reduce high-severity wildfire risk with thinning and burning, our findings help improve our understanding of the effects these treatments have on ecosystem carbon flux. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9603], "author_name_tesi": "Wiechmann, Morgan L", "last_name_ssi": "Wiechmann", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Morgan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew David Hurteau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew David Hurteau, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["climate change adaptation", "fuels treatment", "restoration", "wildfire"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Weathering responses to rapid climate change:  analysis of a high resolution osmium isotope record at the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum", "id": "14084", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7451", "abstract_tesi": "The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ~55.8 million years ago; Ma) was an abrupt ~170 thousand year (ky) global warming event in which a large amount of carbon was added to the atmosphere-ocean system over a few thousand years.  According to our current understanding, such perturbations of the carbon cycle are regulated over geologic timescales by weathering processes, as atmospheric carbon is removed through the process of silicate weathering.  Evidence of past weathering (\u201cpaleoweathering\u201d) is determined through the use of isotope proxies; the marine osmium isotope record is one proxy commonly utilized for its ability to record geologically rapid events due to osmium\u2019s short (10 ky) residence time in the ocean.\n\nHere I present an osmium isotope record (187Os/188Os) from Spitsbergen, Svalbard (core BH 9/05) spanning the PETM interval.  The core is a marine grey-shale sequence with the PETM-defining carbon isotope excursion spanning ~50 m, making it ideal for high-resolution analysis.  For this study, forty-four bulk rock samples were digested using Carius tube procedures and/or NiS fire assay bulk fusions and their rhenium (Re) and Os concentrations and Os isotopic compositions measured using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).\n\nBulk rock Os concentrations range from 111 to 207 pg/g while Re concentrations range from 0.7 to 13.1 ppb.  Both Re and Os concentrations increase over the PETM interval, coincident with an interval of laminated shales and elevated pyrite content, suggesting regional euxinic conditions.  187Os/188Os ratios range from 0.3557 to 0.8238, with a definitive maximum ~6 ky after the onset of the carbon isotope excursion (CIE), concurrent with a large increase in the proportion of kaolinite.  These increases in 187Os/188Os ratios and kaolinite content are interpreted as an increase in continental weathering through increased riverine Os input rather than lithologic source change.  Modeling also supports this conclusion, though influence from a source change cannot be absolutely ruled out.\n\nBulk elemental oxide concentrations were also measured in shales spanning the PETM in order to provide additional constraints on both timing of events and potential weathering sources.  Bulk oxides are used to calculate the chemical index of alteration (CIA), a common weathering intensity index. CIA measurements indicate source material deposited during the onset of the PETM was intensely weathered. Additionally, this independent CIA record is nearly identical to the 187Os/188Os record, with coincident maxima and minima, supporting the hypothesis that variations in both proxies are linked to either a change in source or variation in the local environment. \n\nThough BH 9/05 reflects the shape of contemporaneous Os isotope records, the measured 187Os/188Os ratios in BH 9/05 are nearly double those of open ocean seawater (~0.3-0.45) before and after the PETM.  This leads to the inference that BH 9/05 represents a restricted environment rather than the open ocean, most likely a basin environment with limited ocean contact and periodic episodes of anoxia.  Modeling yields a global river increase of 40-50% while smaller rivers may have tripled their Os output over this interval.  Overall, though the restricted basin setting of BH 9/05 may limit conclusions about global weathering patterns at the PETM, it simultaneously provides an important look at the paleo-Arctic response to rapid warming and may give further insight into climate change in the polar regions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7397], "author_name_tesi": "Wieczorek, Rebecca A.", "last_name_ssi": "Wieczorek", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Scott Fantle", "Lee Kump"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Scott Fantle, Thesis Advisor", "Lee Kump, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["PETM", "osmium", "Spitsbergen", "Arctic", "weathering"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Effects of Environmental Variation on Ateline Primate Population Dynamics\n", "id": "11360", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5303", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Assessing the effects of environmental stress and variation on primates is crucial as globally, up to one-third of primate species are threatened with extinction. The subfamily Atelinae (large-bodied New World primates) is of particular conservation concern because it is a highly threatened group. Little work has been done on the impacts of global warming and climate change on primate species in general, or on their reproduction and population viability. However, an understanding of the role of extrinsic, environmental factors on primate population dynamics and reproduction is needed to assess the effects of global climate change on these species. In addition, overexploitation of neotropical wildlife populations has been increasing over the last several decades and poses a serious threat to the long-term survival of large-bodied primate species. Therefore, the goal of my research was to examine the effects of environmental change on ateline primate populations and the nature and capacity of these genera to respond to ecological stress. I examined this topic from three different aspects. First, I investigated the effects of harvest rates and reserve area on primate population persistence, hunting yields and sustainability, and social dynamics using a spatially explicit, individual-based model. My results showed a prominent role of reserve area in population persistence and hunting sustainability. Under harvesting pressure, only in scenarios with no reserve areas did the population go extinct, and when reserve area decreased, population losses and losses per unit area increased disproportionately. Hunting also disrupted the social structure, and these alterations in social dynamics could have a synergistic effect causing further reductions in population growth in addition to hunting mortality. Finally, it was found that reserve area could improve hunting yields (kgs. of biomass). Thus, I found that spatial control of hunting via a reserve system holds merit as an effective conservation strategy for hunted species and a useful tool for wildlife management. \nMy second project examined the effects of the El Ni\u00f1o southern oscillation, hemispheric climatic variability, and global warming on ateline primate population dynamics using time series analyses. I found significant negative impacts of global warming on all ateline primates examined. Ateline genera experienced either an immediate or a lagged negative effect of El Ni\u00f1o events. Furthermore, the more frugivorous primates (muriquis, woolly, and spider monkeys) exhibited a high level of interspecific population synchrony across considerable distances found to be attributable to large-scale climatic trends. This ability of large-scale climate change to synchronize population trends is problematic because it can exacerbate the extinction risk of multiple populations. \nLastly, I investigated the impacts of the El Ni\u00f1o southern oscillation and hemispheric climatic variability on the reproduction and infant sex ratios of ateline primates. El Ni\u00f1o years were characterized by reduced birth rates, which were indirectly affected by climate through alterations in reproductive seasonality.

Additionally, El Ni\u00f1o years were characterized by male-biased offspring sex ratios, which could slow population growth rates.

Instead of the security and egalitarian economic gains foretold by the postwar era, income inequality and job insecurity have increased.  Increasingly fluid, global borders are eroding the social pact between capital and labor and the move away from manufacturing and toward services employment produces jobs that provide vastly less security and benefits for a great many workers.  In short, America is moving toward a new and postindustrial economy.  Many people thrive in this new economy and many more are left fearful.   But we know little about how this transformation will play out in the political arena.  \n\nThe individual-level anxiety accompanying America\u2019s transition to a postindustrial, globalized economy has not been explored in any systematic way.  What is the nature of the relationship between perceptions of the postindustrial economy and political beliefs and opinions?  It is to this question that this dissertation speaks.  In the following chapters I first sketch the broad outlines of America\u2019s economic transformation and then review the findings and theories that suggest a strong impact of economic forces upon political opinions and review the weak link political scientists have found thus far.  I describe in detail my conceptualization of economic anxiety and why I am asserting its political significance.  \n\nTo examine the impact of economic anxiety on political opinion I estimate several regression models using data from a mail survey of Central Pennsylvanians conducted in December 1998.  I use ordinary least squares multiple regression analysis to determine the effect of postindustrial anxiety, controlling for other relevant characteristics on several political beliefs and policy opinions.  These models present strong evidence of the predictive power of economic anxiety. \n\nThe line of inquiry underlying my study focuses attention upon the everyday trials and tribulations of people.  We need to understand people\u2019s lives in order to ascertain if and how people link their personal lives to politics.  Further, emotions like worry and fear are far too central to the way individuals experience life not to be examined in depth by researchers seeking to understand political processes.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4660], "author_name_tesi": "Wiefek, Nancy M.", "last_name_ssi": "Wiefek", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Nancy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Constance A Flanagan", "Michael H Bernhard", "Eric Plutzer", "Susan Welch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Constance A Flanagan, Committee Member", "Michael H Bernhard, Committee Member", "Eric Plutzer, Committee Chair", "Susan Welch, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["economic fears", "economic anxiety", "public opinion", "political opinion", "worry"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Christian Religiosity and Social Trust", "id": "12225", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1145", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Trust is fundamental for social life\u2014it supports economic growth democratic governance and societies, is a necessity for stable social relationships and social control, promotes civic participation and is considered a fundamental part of the creation, maintenance, and use of social capital.

Using The Baylor Religion Survey I inductively examine what facets of religion do combine as part of an individual\u2019s religiosity. I do this through an examination of two general models of an individual\u2019s commitment to a Christian moral order and how this commitment influences both interpersonal and social trust. Religion provides a foundation of beliefs and narratives for particular religious moral orders, which are the sustained through behaviors and activities, both religious and secular. One\u2019s commitment to a religious moral order should then impact trust through both the beliefs which create that order, and the actions taken to maintain it.\nUltimately, I find that one\u2019s commitment to a Christian moral order is the result of both one\u2019s religious beliefs and behaviors as represented as a singular characteristic of individuals \u2013 their religiosity, and it is this commitment that influences trust. When examined as separate from religious participation, religious beliefs do not seem to be associated with most types of interpersonal trust, or social trust, but religious behaviors are. I find that while one\u2019s religious beliefs, on their own, do not influence trust, they do have an impact, which can be seen when compared to the effect of one\u2019s religious social participation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1133], "author_name_tesi": "Wiernik, Craig S", "last_name_ssi": "Wiernik", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Craig", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffery Todd Ulmer", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer", "Duane Francis Alwin", "Alan M Sica", "Roger Kent Finke", "Constance A Flanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffery Todd Ulmer, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer, Committee Chair", "Duane Francis Alwin, Committee Member", "Alan M Sica, Committee Member", "Roger Kent Finke, Committee Member", "Constance A Flanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Religion", "Trust", "Social Trust", "Religiosity", "Structural Equation Modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "ENHANCING FLAVOR: UTILIZING HERBS AND SPICES TO PROMOTE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION AMONG CHILDREN\n\n", "id": "10401", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "248", "abstract_tesi": "Despite the overwhelming benefits of adequate fruit and vegetable consumption, few children are meeting the USDA dietary guidelines for these food groups.

This study evaluated the possibility of using fruit and vegetable dips enhanced with herbs and spices as a vehicle to increase fruit and vegetable consumption. A series of fruit and vegetable dips were developed, including plain and herb and spice enhanced versions. Objective of the dip development process was to develop a dip that was high in flavor and low in calories, fat, and sugar.  Food preference testing was conducted on 34 preschool children between the ages of 3-5. Level of acceptance and change in consumption of the vegetables were measured. Results demonstrated that the addition of a spiced dip increased the acceptance of disliked vegetables, specifically vegetables previously rated as disliked (p<.001). The impact of a spice dip on consumption level was tested among 27 preschool aged children from the same population.

Molecular genetic studies have uncovered genes that are important for anther development. However, little is known about most of the genes that are active during anther development, including possible relationships between these genes and known key regulators. In Arabidopsis, two previously isolated male sterile mutants are dramatically altered in anther development. The sporocyteless (spl)/nozzle (nzz) mutant is defective in the differentiation of primary sporogenous cells into microsporocytes and does not properly form the somatic cell layers. The excess microsporocytes1 (ems1)/extrasporogenous cell (exs) mutants produce excess microsporocytes at the expense of the tapetum, suggesting that EMS1 promotes tapetum differentiation. To gain further insights into possible gene functions and interactions during anther cell differentiation, mRNA expression profile of the wild-type anther (stage 4-6) was compared with that of the spl and ems1 anthers. The significance analysis of microarray (SAM) method was used to identify 1954 genes that were differentially expressed in the ems1/exs and/or spl/nzz anthers compared with the wild-type anthers. These genes were grouped into 14 different co-expression clusters using the K-mean clustering method. Biological relevance of these clusters were assessed using genes with known and putative functions. To obtain clues about possible co-regulation within co-expression clusters, we searched for enriched cis-regulatory motifs in putative promoters. These results, together with the published literature, were then used to develop a model of gene regulatory networks for anther development. The hypotheses in this model can be tested experimentally in order to gain further understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling anther cell differentiation. We have characterized the meiotic function of one of the 1954 genes identified our microarray study. \nDuring meiosis, pairing, synapsis and recombination play an important role for precise chromosome segregation into four gametes. In yeast, there are two genetically separable pathways for the formation of crossovers (COs), interference sensitive and interference insensitive. The last key intermediate of the interference sensitive crossover pathway is known as the double Holliday junction. Despite identification of several key genes that regulate the formation of crossover pathway intermediates, only a few genes are known for the resolution of double Holliday junctions. In recent years, Arabidopsis has emerged as an excellent model organism for studying the meiotic process. Here we describe the identification of the PARTING DANCERS (PTD) gene, as a gene with an elevated expression level in meiocytes. Analysis of two independently generated T-DNA insertional lines in PTD showed that the mutants had reduced fertility. Further cytological analysis of male meiosis in the ptd mutants revealed defects in meiosis, including reduced formation of chiasmata, the cytological appearance of COs. The residual chiasmata in the mutants were distributed randomly, indicating that the ptd mutants are defective for CO formation in the interference-sensitive pathway. Presence of normal level of synaptonemal complexes and late recombination nodules at pachytene stage suggests that the mutant was defective in bivalent formation in a post-synaptic manner. Furthermore, PTD appears to be the founding member of a gene family conserved in plants. According to our results, in connection with the current model of homologous recombination in meiosis, PTD promotes the formation of COs in the interference sensitive pathway, possibly by regulating the resolution of double Holliday junction intermediates in favor of CO formation. \nSince PTD is a novel gene and its function has not been described previously it is imperative to understand its function in relation to other genes, which are already known to be involved in CO formation. Meiotic CO formation starts with Double Strand Break (DSB) formation, which is induced by a protein called SPO11. These DSBs are later repaired by RAD51. Our genetic analyses indicated that in Arabidopsis, PTD acts downstream of SPO11 and RAD51. In addition, our data indicated that PTD might function in the same pathway as the AtMSH4 and AtMER3/RCK genes, which are important for interference sensitive CO formation in Arabidopsis. Functions of SPO11, RAD51, MSH4 and MER3 have been described in other organisms and their functions appear to be conserved in these orgasinsms. Therefore, our findings suggest that PTD belongs to a cache of conserved meiotic mechinary. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [179], "author_name_tesi": "Wijeratne, Asela J", "last_name_ssi": "Wijeratne", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Asela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Ma", "Teh Hui Kao", "Paula Mc Steen", "Naomi S Altman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Ma, Committee Chair", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Paula Mc Steen, Committee Member", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Anther Development", "meiosis"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Pathogenomics of neonatal meningitis causing\nEscherichia coli", "id": "21085", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10032", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bacterial neonatal meningitis is one of the most devastating infections in early period of human life that accounts for high mortality and morbidity among infants. Escherichia coli is the most predominant Gram-negative bacterial pathogen associated with neonatal meningitis.  Evidence from previous studies has shown a significant heterogeneity of virulence properties of neonatal meningitis causing E. coli (NMEC) which makes it difficult to define the NMEC pathotype and understand its pathogenesis. In this study, we have attempted to define the NMEC pathotype and identify novel virulence traits using a pathogenomic approach. First, we have evaluated genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of NMEC (n=53) in comparison to those charactristics of fecal commensal E. coli (HFEC, n=48) in order to identify a set of genotypic and phenotypic characteristics that can be used to distinguish NMEC from HFEC. We found that a typical NMEC can be defined as K1+, sitA+ and having at least two of the three genes, vat, neuC and iucC. Then, we sequenced the genome of prototypicNMEC strain E. coli RS218 and conducted a comparative genomic analysis with reference to the other sequenced extra intestinal pathogenic E. coli genomes. Analysis of the genome revealed that RS218 chromosome is 5.087 Mb in size with an average G+C content of 50.6%.  Total of 51 genomic islands (GIs) have been identified in the RS218 genome which are absent from the E. coli K12 genome. Out of these GIs, 16 GIs were common to all NMEC strains whereas two GIs were common to all ExPEC. The GIs shared in all NMEC encode for several sugar uptake pathways, an acid tolerance operon, iron uptake systems and putative adhesins and invasins, indicating  potential virulence associated genes of E. coli RS218 genome that may contribute to NMEC pathogenesis. In addition to the chromosome, it contains one large plasmid, pRS218 which is 114, 231 bp in size which belongs to the IncFIB/IIA incompatibility group, and contains a genetic load region that possesses several virulence and fitness traits such as enterotoxicity, iron acquisition and copper tolerance. Based on an in vitro invasion assay that used a human brain microvascular endothelial cell line and an in vivo assay that used a neonatal rat pup model of neonatal meningitis,  the pRS218-cured strain was significantly attenuated as compared to RS218 wild-type strain. We also observed that the genes (n=45) located on pRS218 were overly represented in NMEC strains compared to HFEC indicating the importance of pRS218 to NMEC pathogenesis.

Previous experiments have demonstrated that a thermoacoustic engine based on ideally reversible heat transfer and traveling acoustic waves can convert thermal power to acoustic power with a conversion efficiency of 30%. However, these experiments on thermoacoustic engines have also relied on internal heater embedded hot zones placed directly inside the pressure vessel to apply heat to the working fluid. While this method of heat input is acceptable for examining the fundamental acoustic and thermodynamic cycles in a laboratory setting, it does not address the challenging design of a practical hot heat exchanger suitable for integration with a gas burner, which is required for a commercial product.\n\nRecently, a thermoacoustic-Stirling engine electric generator, or TaSEG, consisting of a thermoacoustic engine coupled to a set of electrodynamic alternators has been developed and tested. This TaSEG was capable of producing 100 W of electrical output power with an overall thermal-to-electric efficiency of 7%. While the demonstrated overall efficiency has not been very high (for reasons that are mostly understood), the design has moved this technology away from laboratory prototypes and toward a commercially viable product configuration. One challenge left unaddressed in the aforementioned TaSEG is a method for suppressing so-called Gedeon streaming, also known as traveling-wave streaming, which is compatible with commercial mass production.\n\nPrevious tests on this TaSEG, as with other thermoacoustic engines, employed either an externally adjustable flow element (\u201cjet pump\") or a latex barrier. The former involves an adjustment rod that passes through the pressure vessel via a sliding seal; the latter is an existing part with an unknown lifetime and failure rate. This thesis describes the design and testing of a functional equivalent to the jet pump (\u201cjet plate\"), which has the durability of the jet pump, is just as compact as the latex barrier, and requires no sliding seal through the pressure vessel wall, all of which make it a viable option for a mass-produced TaSEG.\n\nAdditionally, several other experimental investigations of the TaSEG, including more accurately characterizing the heat flux into the TaSEG during steady state operation, ribbing of the power pistons, and exploring the TaSEG's thermodynamic cycle phasing are briefly presented. Based on the TaSEG's experimental performance results, recommendations for future work that might improve the overall efficiency of the TaSEG are presented.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1323], "author_name_tesi": "Wilcox, Douglas Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Wilcox", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Mitchel Keolian", "Robert Mitchel Keolian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Mitchel Keolian, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Mitchel Keolian, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["themroacoustic", "streaming"]}]
