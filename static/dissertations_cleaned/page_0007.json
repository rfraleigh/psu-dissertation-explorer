In this study, bench scale batch reactors were setup under mesophilic conditions (35\u2103) with SS/PM volatile solid ratios at 7:1, 14:1, 21:1, and 2 controls of pure SS and PM. The ratio selection was based on the SS production of the University Park Wastewater Treatment Plant and PM production by the University Farm. Physical/chemical properties of sludge before and after digestion were analyzed. Daily methane production and cumulative methane yield were recorded, and the cumulative methane yields were fitted with both the first-order kinetic and the modified Gompertz model. All mixing ratios showed stable digestions as indicated by the pH, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), and volatile fatty acid (VFA)/alkalinity ratios of the final digestates. PM produced more methane than SS and as a result, increasing PM in co-digestion also increased methane yield. The maximum methane yield occurred at SS/PM ratio of 7:1 with a 10% increase at 200 mL CH4/g VSadded compared with SS alone at 182 mL CH4/g VSadded. This is also the maximum co-digestion need from the University Farm in winter seasons. Although residual nitrogen increased in the co-digestion digestates, most of which were in solid form, resulting a decrease in soluble nitrogen. This implies a potential decrease in the nitrogen return which helps relief mainstream treatment. Both the first-order kinetic model and the modified Gompertz model showed good fit to the data produced. However, the modified Gompertz model proved to be the best choice that works for degradation with or without a lag-period. The first-order kinetic model indicated faster gas production kinetics by the 3 co-digestion treatments than the pure controls, which implies the existence of a positive synergistic effect by co-digestion. The modified Gompertz model also showed the highest maximum gas production rate, a decreased lag-period, and a shortened gas production period by co-digestion, which implies a facilitated hydrolysis has occurred from the mixture. This faster kinetics implies a shorter digestion time than the original wastewater sludge digestion which can help accommodate the increased digestion materials from the co-digestion process.

China's Restrictions on Direct Trading (with Kala Krishna)\n\nIn this paper we discuss the background of China's restrictive policy on direct trading rights and document the changes made in the requirements for domestically-owned Chinese firms to have direct trading rights. We first show that these restrictions (and hence their removal) had differential coverage across industry, location and time. By looking at the impact of removing these restrictions on a variety of variables, we argue that removal of this restrictive policy was indeed an important force affecting exports. Exploiting information on eligibility for direct trading rights at the firm-level, we evaluate the effect of becoming eligible for direct trading on firm behavior and performance. We find positive and significant effects of gaining eligibility on probability of exporting, export values and total revenue. Moreover, most of the effects come from former indirect exporters. This suggests that former indirect exporters who may have been the most constrained firms who gained the most from the liberalization. We also find that gaining direct trading rights tomorrow has advance effect on firms' probability of exporting today suggesting firms are more likely to export indirectly in anticipation of becoming eligible tomorrow. However, these exports are small so that becoming eligible today raises export value and revenues tomorrow, not yesterday so that eligibility operates on these variable with a lag. \n\nChapter 2: How You Export Matters: Export Mode, Learning, and Productivity in China (with Kala Krishna and Hong Ma)\n\nFirms can choose how they export: directly or through intermediaries. What are the costs and benefits of such choices? Firms may choose to trade directly, even if this is more costly in the short run, if doing so results in better future outcomes. A policy pursued by China gives us a unique chance to look at such trade-offs in the real world. Before China's accession to the WTO, a large share of domestic Chinese firms were not allowed to export directly, only through intermediaries. \n\nIn this paper we develop and estimate a dynamic discrete choice model where firms choose their export mode. We recover not only the sunk and fixed costs of exporting according to mode, but also the evolution of productivity and demand under different export modes. We find that the evolution of both demand and productivity is more favorable under direct exporting. On average, starting direct exporting requires significantly higher start-up costs than starting indirect exporting. It is also more costly to remain a direct exporter than to remain an indirect one. Moreover, climbing the export ladder by starting off as an indirect exporter and then transitioning into direct exporting is cheaper than exporting directly to begin with. \n\nOur counterfactual experiment suggests that this policy reduced Chinese export growth considerably. Exports would have been $30$ percent less and the export participation rate would have been $37$ percent lower had there been no liberalization of trading rights. In addition, we compare the effects of different trade policies, namely export subsidies and subsidies on export costs. For export subsidies, it is better to target direct exporters over indirect ones, both for increasing the number of exporters and in terms of exports per dollar expended. However for cost subsidies, the opposite is true.\n\nChapter 3: Productivity and Exporting: Selection, Learning by Exporting and Preparing to Export (with Bernardo Diaz de Astarloa and Kala Krishna)\n\nMuch of the trade literature has focused on the links between productivity and exporting. Three channels have been emphasized. First, productivity causes exporting, so that there is selection into exporting by more productive firms. Second, that exporting generates productivity growth through, for example, learning-by-exporting. Third, that firms make choices that make them more productive in preparation to export. In this paper, we study these links and try to entangle this export-productivity correlation. \n\nUtilizing unique features of the Chinese data, we focus on the entire evolution of firms' productivity and decompose productivity growth before and after entering foreign markets. We show that patterns of Chinese exporters are consistent with all three hypotheses. First, exporters are more productive than non-exporters, which is consistent with selection. Future exporters' productivity grow steadily both before and after entry. A larger share of this growth of successful exporters happened after the entry, while productivity growth slows down after exiting for unsuccessful exporters. This is consistent with the learning-by-exporting theory and suggest possible active preparation to export. Furthermore, new exporters increase sales expenditures and earn higher revenue from new products than other firms before they start exporting. This indicates that firms actively invest in marketing structures and product upgrading to prepare for exporting in both demand and cost sides. This is true when compared to both non-exporters and continuous exporters. In addition, China's gradual and anticipated liberalization of direct trading rights help us identify further firm actions in preparing to export. In particular, we find evidence showing that Chinese firms undertook investment with the specific purpose of acquiring direct trading rights.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9970], "author_name_tesi": "Bai, Xue ", "last_name_ssi": "Bai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xue", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kala Krishna", "Kala Krishna", "Mark John Roberts", "James R.

It extends the top-down approach suggested by Klemes and formalized by Sivapalan and colleagues through a Monte Carlo framework in which model ensembles are tested for four different watershed response signatures across time scales. Lumped watershed model structures of increasing complexity have been applied to twelve watersheds across a range of hydro-climatic conditions within the US.  The necessary minimum complexity and the related model assumptions provide indicators of the dominant controls on the watershed response at each temporal scale represented by different water balance signatures.  Probabilistic measures of model performance with respect to reliability (Is the model ensemble capturing the observed signature?) and with respect to shape (Is the model structure capable of representing the signature variability?) have been developed to distinguish the ability of the models to represent watershed response behavior for each time-scale. The probabilistic measures are combined in a fuzzy rule system to guide model selection. Results suggest that the framework can be tuned to function as a screening tool that formalizes our model selection process. This fuzzy model selection framework therefore enhances our ability to objectively and automatically select parsimonious model structures for large databases of watersheds.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6816], "author_name_tesi": "Bai, Yaoling ", "last_name_ssi": "Bai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yaoling", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thorsten Wagener", "Patrick M Reed"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thorsten Wagener, Thesis Advisor", "Patrick M Reed, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["model selection", "top-down approach", "hydrologic model", "uncertainty"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Maltreated children with mental health needs: does coordination between child welfare agencies and mental health providers improve their outcomes?\n\n", "id": "7539", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6903", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The high prevalence of mental health problems among children in child welfare and the inadequate provision of mental health services for this subpopulation have been well documented. Calls for strengthening cooperation between child welfare and mental health agencies are derived from two pervasive assumptions. First, children without mental health problems had better experiences and outcomes than those with mental health problems. Second, more cooperation between child welfare and mental health agencies is needed to better serve vulnerable families. The body of evidence to support two assumptions, however, is sparse and even contradictory. In addition, few studies highlight what factors support more of such interagency coordination. This dissertation addresses these questions through a longitudinal analysis of a national sample.        \nThis dissertation is composed of three studies. The first study examines whether mental health needs affect safety and permanency for children in child welfare. The second study investigates the role of the intensity of interorganizational relationships (IORs) between child welfare agencies and mental health providers in increasing mental health services use and improving psychological functioning. The third one explores organizational determinants of the intensity of IORs for child welfare agencies.      \nThe first study evaluated the safety and permanency among children in the child welfare system with mental health needs and compared these outcomes with those of children without mental health needs. Longitudinal analyses drew on data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW). Proportional hazard models and Generalized Linear Models with sampling weights were used to identify the predictors of safety and permanency. Results indicated that having mental health needs increased the risk of a new maltreatment report and decreased the likelihood of reaching permanency. Externalizing and internalizing patterns had different associations with safety and permanency. Policy implications include the need to assess mental health straight after intake of children and that coordination between child welfare agency and mental health providers should be strengthened.\nThe second study investigated whether IORs increase the use of mental health services and improve the mental health status for children served by child welfare system.This analysis was longitudinal involving 36 months follow-up data from the NSCAW. The sample consisted of 1,613 children within 75 child welfare agencies, who were 2 year old or above and had mental health problems at baseline. IOR intensity was measured as the number of coordination approaches between child welfare agencies and mental health providers. Weighted multilevel logistic regression model showed that agency level factors accounted for 14% of the variance in probability of service use and mental health improvement. Greater intensity of IORs was associated with higher likelihood of service use and mental health improvement. It was concluded that IORs were an effective means to improve children\u00a1\u00afs well-being.\nThe third study sought to identify organizational and contextual factors associated with higher numbers of inter-agency ties. This study was cross-sectional with 86 child welfare agencies whose directors were interviewed through the NSCAW. Five organizational factors were investigated: the child welfare agency\u00a1\u00afs scope of services, agency size, organizational affiliation, fiscal resources, and IORs with other types of child-serving agencies. IOR intensity was measured as the number of coordination approaches between child welfare agencies and mental health providers. Poisson regression model revealed that greater number of IORs with the judicial system and schools significantly predicted high intensity of connections between child welfare agencies and mental health providers. Neither agency size, scope of child welfare agency services, expenditures, nor agency affiliation was associated with the number of ties with mental health providers. Child welfare agencies appear to cooperate more extensively with mental health agencies when they have a general affinity for cooperation.  Agencies with more ties to other child-serving organizations might share strategies with their peers that encourage them to cooperate more actively as well. \nIn general, this dissertation extends previous research through the use of a nationally representative sample, a rich array of measures from multiple sources, appropriately sophisticated quantitative methodologies, and a systematic approach to very complex issues .\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6900], "author_name_tesi": "Bai, Yu ", "last_name_ssi": "Bai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier", "Rebecca Wells", "Rhonda Belue", "D Wayne Osgood", "E Michael Foster"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Chair", "Rebecca Wells, Committee Chair", "Rhonda Belue, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "E Michael Foster, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["safety", "permanency", "mental health", "child", "child welfare", "interorganizational relationship", "organizational"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "life\u00a0cycle assessment and\u00a0optimization model for\u00a0earth extractive\u00a0systems,\u00a0based\u00a0on multiple \u000bcriteria\u00a0decision making problem", "id": "19672", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9024", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a comprehensive method to evaluate all attributes or aspects of potential environmental impacts (and economic benefits) throughout a product\u2019s lifecycle. However, LCA is typically not able to provide effective guidance in the design/production process and forecast potential impacts without obtaining a complete data set needed (e.g. yield, electricity consumed, and CO2 released etc.). Such kind of large data query not only consumes a large amount of time, but limits this method application in new technologies and projects. This is because in practice, it is usually difficult to gain all the specified data in the design phase due to many new technologies or projects that are yet in production with many variables undecided. \n\nThis report describes a life cycle assessment optimization model (LCAO). This specific model is based on the life cycle inventory (LCI) hybrid method, combining with a modified multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. It requires data but can conduct in the condition of incomplete data set. This helps managers to determine some unknown variables to minimize environmental impact while maximizing economic benefits. In many cases, a number of possibilities for improvements exist and it is not always obvious which one of them results the optimum solution. There could also be more than one optimum solution. In this case, LCAO is also able to find the \u201cbest\u201d alternative with multiple and conflicting objectives to provide guidance to managers. It is important to note that LCAO is an iterative process to obtain more and more data determined by the guidance provided by LCAO until the data set is completed.

We found that the total cell number and the percentage of CD4+ T cells in Itk KO mice are significantly higher than those in WT mice. No significant difference was found in skin CD8+ T cells. We also used mice that express human Itk or murine Txk only in T cells on the Itk-/- background to determine whether this would rescue the difference we observe between WT and Itk KO mice. We found that T cell specific expression of both human Itk, and mouse Txk could restore the CD4+ population (percentage) in Itk KO mice. We also compared WT and Itk KO mice on a Balb/c background. The data did not show significant differences in the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in these mice. In addition, we used CD44 and CD122 surface marker to characterize the phenotype of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in skin and found that both WT and Itk KO have high CD44 expression, resembling activated or memory T cells.

Air chemistry modeling is used to locate ozone sources, to test ozone mitigation strategies, and to forecast high episodes of ambient ozone. However, it is proving difficult to accurately depict ozone production, P(O3), due to model uncertainties and inconsistencies between modeled and measured species. \n\nTesting of model output and chemical mechanisms can be achieved with the direct comparison to measured P(O3). The Penn State MOPSv2.0 provides a more qualitative P(O3) measurement than the MOPSv1.0. Developments to the MOPS improve upon the MOPSv1.0 component limitations, the measurement technique, and the flow through the chambers. Air flow through the chambers is critical; interactions between air sampled at the output of the chambers and chamber walls can add or remove unwanted chemicals from the air. Thus, a great deal of the chamber and flow development aims to reduce the sampling of air that has interacted with the chamber walls. A new design to the MOPS includes the addition of a heating grid, which increases stability in the chambers. The air flow within the chambers has been developed to be much like a sheath flow regime, which aims to deter air sampled at the outlet of the chambers from interacting with the chamber walls. The MOPSv2.0 is now fully automated and includes a highly-efficient NO2-to-O3 converter unit that improves upon the MOPSv1.0 converter unit. In addition, photochemical box model characterization of this new version of the MOPS is much more comprehensive than the MOPSv1.0. \n\nTwo MOPSv2.0s, MOPS1 and MOPS2, have been designed, built and deployed to Houston, TX during the ``Deriving Information on Surface conditions from COlumn and VErtically resolved observations Relevant to Air Quality\" (DISCOVER-AQ) field campaign. The MOPSv2.0s retrieved continuous ozone production rate measurements at two locations: Houston, TX, and Smith Point, TX. Measurements of P(O3) in both locations provide insight into local ozone source locations and ozone production sensitivity regimes, and provide the first calculations of ozone advection rates. MOPSv2.0 measurements of P(O3) while they were running at the same location provide validation for the use of the MOPSv2.0s in a network setting and insight into possible sources of error in the MOPS measurement. \n\nThe results presented in this thesis demonstrate the potential for the MOPSv2.0  measurement to determine where air quality model output and chemical mechanisms succeed and fail, to aid in the design of air quality standards for mitigating ozone pollution and to provide a direct P(O3) measurement for assimilation into air quality simulation models.

Ozone can be reduced in the absence of transport from other areas if its production rate is reduced. Therefore, mitigation strategies target emissions reductions of O3 formation precursors, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Chemical models are used to predict ozone levels and to evaluate these emissions control strategies. However, these models are driven by complex chemical reaction mechanisms that do not always accurately represent ozone formation chemistry. One way to test chemical mechanisms and to provide an alternative method for determining the ozone formation rate, P(O3), is through direct observations. \n\nA second-generation Measurement of Ozone Production Sensor (MOPS) was deployed to NASA's DISCOVER-AQ field campaigns at Houston, TX in 2013 and at Golden, CO in 2014. These deployments enabled the first P(O3) measurements using this new, second-generation sensor. During the 2013 Houston DISCOVER-AQ campaign, MOPS measurements exhibited P(O3) patterns that were consistent with observed ozone variations. Furthermore, direct P(O3) observations from two sensors were used to calculate the ozone advection rate in two areas: Houston, TX and Smith Point, TX. In comparison with the local ozone rate of change, these measurements suggested that ambient ozone levels during a high ozone event were a result of localized chemical production near downtown Houston, while even higher ozone levels exceeding 120 ppbv near the Houston Ship Channel were a result of ozone transport during a gulf breeze event. Thus, while the MOPS can provide in situ ozone production rate measurements, it can also prove to be a useful tool for evaluating ozone source and receptor regions in areas currently in exceedance with ozone standards.\n\nThe MOPS measurements can test model ozone photochemistry through comparisons to zero-dimensional (box) modeled P(O3) using both near-explicit and lumped VOC aggregation mechanisms. While DISCOVER-AQ measurement locations in Texas and Colorado differ in both meteorology and ozone precursor emissions, observed P(O3) behavior relative to chemical models was similar in these areas. Photochemical box models used to predict VOC oxidation products -- namely, radical species -- under-predict P(O3) relative to the MOPS for NO mixing ratios greater than 1 ppbv. As high NO or NOx is often observed in cities during rush hour, this discrepancy often occurs during the early morning when P(O3) is the largest. \n\nDiurnal ozone formation patterns are closely linked to nitrogen oxides and the production of hydrogen oxides. Model-measurement P(O3) disagreement is attributed to model underestimation of the hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) at high NOx levels. This disagreement of HO2 at high NOx levels has been observed in prior literature using various, independent HO2 measurement methods over a wide range of meteorological and chemical environments. Higher measured to modeled P(O3) ratios at high NO were also observed using first-generation MOPS measurements from Houston in 2009. Reasons for this HO2 discrepancy at high NO are explored in this work, including MOPS measurement artifacts, reactive chlorine chemistry, and missing reactions involving additional production of HO2 at high NOx. \n\nAlthough the MOPS measurements are new, this work can have large implications for model predictions of ozone formation dependence on NOx and VOCs during early morning hours when P(O3) is greatest. Higher measured than modeled P(O3) at high NO may suggest a shift in ozone production sensitivity from mainly VOC-sensitive to more NOx -sensitive regimes in some urban areas, implying that reducing emissions of both NOx and VOCs can reduce ozone levels. \n\nFurther work is needed to decrease the MOPS P(O3) uncertainty and limit of detection, which can be accomplished using a more sensitive, artifact-free ozone analyzer within the MOPS measurement system. Nonetheless, deployment of this sensor in air quality networks can improve our current understanding of ozone chemistry, distinguish ozone source areas from those dominated by ozone transport, and evaluate chemical model output. These MOPS measurements can prove to be a critical component of air quality observational networks and ozone reduction strategies and can aid in the reduction of ozone not only in the United States, but worldwide.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12912], "author_name_tesi": "Baier, Bianca Chae", "last_name_ssi": "Baier", "middle_name_ssi": "Chae", "first_name_ssi": "Bianca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. William Brune ", "Dr. William Brune", "Dr. Kenneth Davis", "Dr. Anne Thompson", "Dr. Miriam Freedman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. William Brune , Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. William Brune, Committee Chair", "Dr. Kenneth Davis, Committee Member", "Dr. Anne Thompson, Committee Member", "Dr. Miriam Freedman, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["atmospheric chemistry", "ozone", "instrument development", "chemical modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Evaluating Health Policies Aimed at Improving Health Care Access of Underserved Populations ", "id": "15133szb211", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15133", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examined if and how the recent initiatives aimed at improving health care access of underserved populations were effective.

The differential changes between those with and without chronic conditions were also significant, however, the magnitude of differential changes were small.\n\nThe second paper estimated how Medicaid expansion under the ACA has affected hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care provision, and how the changes following the partial Medicaid expansion may have varied by hospitals\u2019 Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) status. Using the 2011-2015 Medicare Cost Reports, Medicaid DSH Audit Reports, Area Health Resources File (AHRF) data, and difference-in-differences and triple differences approaches, the study found that while Medicaid expansion significantly reduced hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care provision, the changes were not significantly different between Medicaid DSH hospitals and non-DSH hospitals. \n\nThe third paper estimated how changes in funding for health center programs, including those implemented under the ACA, may affect hospitalizations of people with potentially preventable conditions, which could be avoided with timely and effective ambulatory care. Using a county-level longitudinal panel dataset constructed with the 2009-2013 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases, Uniform Data System, and AHRF, the study estimated linear regressions including year and county fixed effects for Florida, Kentucky, and New York. The study did not find that federal funding growth for health centers significantly affected potentially preventable hospitalization rates.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16884], "author_name_tesi": "Baik, Sohye ", "last_name_ssi": "Baik", "first_name_ssi": "Sohye", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joel E Segel", "Joel E Segel", "Caprice A Knapp", "Margaret Susan Winchester", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joel E Segel, Dissertation Advisor", "Joel E Segel, Committee Chair", "Caprice A Knapp, Committee Member", "Margaret Susan Winchester, Committee Member", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Health Policy", "Underserved Populations", "ACA", "Medicaid Expansion", "Medicaid DSH", "CHC", "Health Center", "Safety Net", "Insurance Expansion"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "EXPLORING ADULT BUSINESS STUDENTS\u2019 TRANSITION TO COLLEGE THROUGH A FIRST-YEAR SEMINAR COURSE: AN ACTION RESEARCH STUDY", "id": "9353", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "85", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this action research study was to explore the transitional experiences of adult business students during their return to higher education through an adapted first-year seminar course.  This study addressed a gap in the literature of adult business students in the first-year seminar research and explored the importance of tailoring a first-year seminar course to adult student needs.  The study participants were seven returning business students who enrolled in a special summer offering of the BSN101 Foundations of Business Administration course focused on designing a curriculum that is relevant to the adult student\u2019s needs.  The study objectives were to understand the reasons for the students\u2019 return to college and to examine the participants\u2019 learning, adjustment to university life, and personal development through the course.\n\tThe findings from the study addressed four major themes.  First, the primary reason adult students were returning to an undergraduate business program was for advancement in their careers.  Second, the participants found that they were feeling fearful, mentioned their age, and were showing signs of low self-esteem and low self-efficacy about their ability to return to college.  However, through the first-year seminar course, BSN101, the students began to feel more positively about their decision to return to college and also felt a sense of belonging with the other adult business students in the class.  Third, the action research process allowed students to be actively engaged in the collaborative research project and gave them a sense of appreciation for each other\u2019s experiences, which assisted in students\u2019 learning, adjustment to university life, and personal development.  Fourth, the students were having difficulty balancing life roles and often through the course mentioned times of conflict and how important support from family, employers, faculty, and administrators was in their coping with the added stress of retuning to college.  Primary recommendations are that universities should pay attention to the needs of adult students, such as extending hours for administrative offices, having an adult student advocate, introducing new students to key administrative personnel, and taking into consideration their lived experience by tailoring the first-year orientation program.   This study contributes to the fields of higher education and adult education by sharing the importance of engaging students in faculty-student activities and paying attention to the participants who voiced changes to be made to universal, traditionally designed first-year seminar programs. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [86], "author_name_tesi": "Bailey, April Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Bailey", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "April", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Daniele D Flannery", "Senel Poyrazli", "Stephen Patrick Schappe", "Heather L Stuckey", "Ian E Baptiste"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Angelica Cranton, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Chair", "Daniele D Flannery, Committee Member", "Senel Poyrazli, Committee Member", "Stephen Patrick Schappe, Committee Member", "Heather L Stuckey, Committee Member", "Ian E Baptiste, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adult students", "business students", "first-year seminar", "student transitions and adjustment", "undergraduate business programs", "action research"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Premorbid Measures and Sports-Related Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: Appropriateness and Accuracy\n\n\n", "id": "7386", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1062", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current study examined the accuracy of estimating baseline neuropsychological performance using a variety of methods (Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, WTAR; demographically-based methods; and empirically constructed methods). \n\n103 collegiate athletes were administered baseline mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) neuropsychological batteries. 19 of these participants sustained concussions and were used in post-MTBI analyses. Initial baseline estimates were developed according to demographics [WTAR demographics-only and Barona et al.

Also, separate repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted comparing observed baseline performance and each estimation method with significant demographic groups entered as between-subject factors. Stepwise regressions predicting the observed baseline performance were also conducted by entering the above estimation methods and significant demographic variables (age, sex, race, previous concussion status, and sport). The proportions of accurately estimated baselines were also compared using Binomial Tests for each measure.

The proportions of declined participants when utilizing observed or estimated baselines were compared using Binomial Tests for each measure.\n \nMild to moderate effects were observed on correlations and few mean differences were observed on the baseline repeated measure ANOVAs. Stepwise regressions showed a pattern of selecting demographic factors (especially race) and demonstrated generally moderate effects. Few accuracy differences were observed on the Binomial Tests, though some measures demonstrated differential accuracy for demographic-based or word-reading-based estimates.

Do viewers stray from their personal preferences when co-viewing? Are there characteristics of a co-viewer that might make a viewer more or less likely to stray to from their typical media fare? This dissertation attempts to answer some of these questions by exploring the roles of mood, co-viewers\u2019 relationship, and gender in the selection of comedic and tender films. Results suggest that viewers anticipate being least comfortable watching both tender films and comedies when co-viewing with an acquaintance. Further, viewers are more likely to assume when their co-viewer wants to watch a tender film if that co-viewer is a woman, and therefore more likely to select a tender film.

I will argue that this activity is revealed to be the gathering of multiplicities (\u2018parts\u2019) into the intelligible unities (\u2018wholes\u2019) which we experience. This gathering occurs in accord with the &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953; in which the soul has been educated; that is, it is on the basis of our &#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#943;&#945; that we gather the \u2018many\u2019 of bare perceptual experience into the meaningful \u2018ones\u2019 of our world. Attention to this characteristic &#7956;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#957; constitutes the root of virtue. \n\tAttending to this activity will reveal that, initially and for the most part, humans find themselves in a state of internal multiplicity, conflict, and cognitive dissonance. This internal dissent is not to be ultimately explained with reference to \u2018parts\u2019 of the soul. I will argue that the Phaedo reveals this internal multiplicity to be far greater than a \u2018tri-partite\u2019 theory can explain. Rather, we need to attend to the disharmonious nature of the &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953; to which we adhere, and through which we gather the world into an intelligible order such that we are called to act. Ethical responsiveness to the world will be shown to be rooted in ontology. That is, it is in light of the way the world appears to us as a meaningful environment that we are called to act and respond ethically. \n\tWhen this world is fractured by internal dissent \u2013 that is, specifically, by conflicting opinions within the soul as to what is best \u2013 ethical action becomes difficult, and self-mastery is necessary. This self-mastery, however, is only necessary in the absence of internal harmony; when the self has undergone a process of gathering itself to itself \u2013 into a unified whole oriented toward the good \u2013 the soul as a unity is drawn toward the good, akrasia appears impossible, and the violence of self-mastery becomes unnecessary. \n\tThe first step in the development of this harmony is a recognition of the essential, defining activity of the &#968;&#965;&#967;&#942;. Only on this basis is it possible to \u2018care for the soul.\u2019 This basic ontology of the &#968;&#965;&#967;&#942; must first be understood; the centrality of the condition of the soul to the way we experience the world must be recognized. On this basis we can begin to examine the &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953; through which we gather the world, and our own selves, into intelligible unity; only then can we begin the difficult process of developing a harmony in these &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953; which can give rise to unified, ethically and rationally directed actions and responsiveness to the world. The initial step in the development of the defining human &#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#942; is turning the soul toward itself.\n\tThe development of this ontology, self-knowledge, and harmony of the self is the essential defining work of the philosopher; it is only on the basis of this proper ontology of the soul, and subsequent development of self-understanding, that care of the self can be grounded. That is: In order to know the self, it is essential to understand the nature of the &#968;&#965;&#967;&#942;; to understand the nature of the &#968;&#965;&#967;&#942;, it is essential to understand its defining activity.

The system relied on centrifugally generated pressures to deform a 0.02 in. (5.08 x 10^-4 m) thick titanium leading edge cap. This leading edge cap was protected from erosion by a titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN) coating. Six pneumatic diaphragms were installed beneath the titanium leading edge. The diaphragms were normally deflated under vacuum against the surface of the blade and were inflated when the ice accretion thickness reached a critical value. The deformation of the leading edge introduced transverse shear stresses at the interface of the ice layer that exceeded the ice adhesion strength of ice to the TiAlN coating (126 psi, 8.68 x 10^5 Pa) promoting instantaneous ice debonding. The applied input pressures to the system (+/- 3.7 psi, +/- 2.55 x 10^4 Pa) were representative of the pressures generated centrifugally by a medium size helicopter rotor system. With these pressures, the maximum deformation of the leading edge was quantified to be 0.2 in. (5.08 x 10^-3 m). The aerodynamic performance degradation effects related to the leading edge deformation were quantified during low speed (Re=1,000,000) wind tunnel testing. Results were compared to the previously recorded aerodynamic performance degradation data due to ice accretion. It was measured that the penalties related to the deployment of the pneumatic diaphragms were 35% lower than the aerodynamic drag penalty due to ice accretion. The lower aerodynamic penalty of deploying the proposed de-icing concept with respect to that of ice accretion case indicated that the system would not introduce any aerodynamic penalty while removing accreted ice. The system was tested under representative rotor icing conditions at the Penn State Adverse Environment Rotor Testing Stand (AERTS). The system was subjected to centrifugal loads that ranged from 110 to 514 times the force of gravity. The de-icing system successfully promoted instantaneous shedding of ice thicknesses ranging from 0.06 in. to 0.1 in. (1.52 x 10^-3 m to 2.54 x 10^-3 m) and for varying icing conditions within the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 25/29 Appendix C Icing Envelope.\nA finite element model (FEM) was developed to predict the de-icing capabilities of the pneumatic system. The cohesive zone method was selected to model the ice/leading edge interface. This modeling approach was mesh-dependent and the cohesive interface parameters needed to be determined for the final converged mesh density and testing conditions. Two bench top tests were conducted and modeled to empirically quantify the failure criteria used in the FEM.\nAll experimental tests were conducted under the same freezer icing conditions. Aluminum with the same surface roughness was used across all three tests. The experimental shear adhesion strength criterion for this aluminum was quantified to be 39.94 psi (2.75 x 10^5 Pa). The experimental peel adhesion strength failure criterion was gathered in a mixed-mode test. The force require to delaminate an ice patch at the root of a plate in bending was quantified. This loading condition which induces ice delamination was used in tandem with the FEM to determine the necessary cohesive zone properties. The pneumatic de-icing system installed on the wind tunnel experimental model was also used to validate the FEM predictions during freezer ice testing. This wind tunnel specimen was modeled in Abaqus and predictions were made to determine the delamination behavior of ice patches placed at different chordwise locations of the leading edge cap. Five locations were modeled and predictions indicated that 4 of the 5 locations would fully delaminate. Only the aft-most position would fail to completely delaminate. These predictions were validated with experimental results.\nFinally, the FEM was used in conjunction with the Penn State AERTS Rotor Icing, Shedding, and Performance code to investigate the relationship between input pneumatic pressures vs. impact ice delamination using a pneumatic de-icing system. This code predicts natural ice shedding and was modified to determine ice delamination using a pneumatic de-icing system. The model was initially used to determine the critical ice adhesion area required to achieve ice shedding. A percentage of the ice shape becomes delaminated when the pneumatic de-icer is activated. The remaining area must then carry all of the shear loads to resist shedding. Once a critical ice adhesion area was reached, ice shedding was predicted. Based on a theoretical study for a generic rotor setup - 55.5 in. (1.41 m) radius rotor, 280 RPM, 16 in. (0.406 m) chord NACA 0012 - having a leading edge surface roughness of 26 +/- 0.9 Ra \u03bcin., the critical ice adhesion area was determined to be 61% of the original ice/leading edge interfacial area. The modeled icing environment had a liquid water concentration of 2 g/m^3, a median volume water droplet diameter of 25 \u03bcin, and a temperature of -14 \u030aC. These modeled testing conditions were chosen to match the low centrifugal forces at the root of a full-scale rotor and the ice/leading edge interfacial properties gathered in the experimental results obtained in this research effort. Two pneumatic de- icing designs were created and the ice adhesion surface length was determined depending on input pneumatic pressure. The first design represented the NACA 0012 design used during wind tunnel testing. The second design removed two of the pneumatic diaphragms and reinforced the area behind the leading edge with solid aluminum for increased ballistic protection. The critical pneumatic pressure to induce ice shedding was determined to be 1.0 psi (6.89 x 10^3 Pa) for the design tested in this research and 1.1 psi (7.58 x 10^3 Pa) for the improved design suggested for future research. These pressures were well within the available pressure supplied from centrifugal pumping (3.7 psi, 2.58 x 10^-4 Pa).", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9992], "author_name_tesi": "Bailey, Matthew John", "last_name_ssi": "Bailey", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Palacios"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Palacios, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Deicing", "Deicer", "Icing", "Pneumatic", "Rotorcraft", "AERTS", "Helicopter", "Centrifugal"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Probiotic Effects On Bacterial Community Structure And Antibiotic Resistance Of Gut Microbiota In Broiler Chickens Raised Under Three Different Dietary Conditions\n", "id": "25308", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11238", "abstract_tesi": "Antimicrobial resistance of bacterial pathogens has developed into a global issue and has become an imminent threat to both human and animal health. The sub-therapeutic levels of antimicrobial supplementation in food animal feed are consistently argued to contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Not only do poultry producers use antimicrobials as feed additives, but they also utilize probiotics as a live microbial feed supplement. Probiotic supplementation positively affects the chicken by improving its intestinal balance and can be used as an alternative to antimicrobial supplementation during poultry production.\n\tThe United States (U.S.) is the world\u2019s largest poultry producer and the second largest poultry exporter, with broiler chickens comprising over four-fifths of U.S. poultry production. Because broiler producers in the U.S. use antimicrobials for disease therapy, prophylaxis, and growth promotion, it is important to understand the contribution of antimicrobial use to the emergence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria and their associated genes as well as changes in resident microbiota. The effect of supplementing commercial broiler diet with probiotics, including conventionally-fed broiler chickens, is an important concept, as the resident microbiota may be significant for the prevention of such colonization. \n\tUsing a field-based trial approach, the gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes in broiler chickens fed with three commercial diet types: conventional (antibiotic-supplemented with and without probiotics), natural (antibiotic-free and probiotic-supplemented) and organic (antibiotic-free with organic standard probiotics), were compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction assay using the Comparative Ct method. To determine phenotypic validation of antimicrobial resistance, microbial DNA recovered from broiler chicken feces was utilized for DNA library construction. Genotypic presence of resistance genes was compared among diet types using the Comparative Ct method. \n\tIt was hypothesized that the microbiota of conventionally-fed broiler chickens would be significantly different than both the microbiotas of chickens fed natural or organic diets. Furthermore, it was also hypothesized that there would be an increased amount of antimicrobial resistance genes found among broiler chickens that had been fed  conventional diets when compared to broiler chickens fed a natural or organic diet.\n\tAt variable levels, antimicrobial resistance can be found among every microbiota from each diet type (conventional with and without probiotics, natural, and organic). The antimicrobial resistance found in both the antibiotic-free diets (organic and natural) was not a result of the supplementation of antimicrobials in feed. However, even with antimicrobial resistance found within each broiler chicken microbiota from each diet type, chickens fed with conventional diets contained more resistance genes in feces than chickens fed with natural and organic diets suggesting the addition of antimicrobials in diet may influence the microbial community structure and increase the antibiotic resistance gene repertoire in the commercial broiler gut.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10780], "author_name_tesi": "Bailey, Megan Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Bailey", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Subhashinie Kariyawasam"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Subhashinie Kariyawasam, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microbiota", "Probiotic", "Organic", "Conventional", "Antimicrobial Resistance"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Development and Validation of a Diet Screening Tool for Older Adults\n", "id": "7880", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5223", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The proportion of older adults in the United States is increasing dramatically. Unfortunately the aging process is associated with chronic diseases. Taken together, these trends will place significant demands on the healthcare system. Thus, it is important to identify modifiable factors that may help lessen the burden of chronic diseases of aging. Diet is a well-established modifiable factor that is directly related to risk and treatment of the major causes of death in adults over the age of 65: cardiovascular disease, cancer, and stroke. Identification of individuals that are at nutrition risk may be an effective intervention strategy to lessen the burden of morbidity.\nA variety of tools have been developed to assess risk of inadequate dietary intakes for specific dietary components.  However, no known total dietary screening tools exist for older adults. Therefore, the overall purpose of this study was to evaluate a newly developed population-specific diet screening tool (DST) to identify community-dwelling older adults that may be at nutritional risk.\nThe overall hypothesis of this study was that a diet screening tool could be used to identify individuals at nutrition risk. In this study, a population-specific diet screening tool was developed and the subsequently tested. Psychometric evaluation of the screening tool revealed strong test-retest reliability and adequate sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. The screening tool had the ability to differentiate between individuals at varying degrees of nutrition risk, and DST scores were related to dietary intakes estimated from multiple 24-hour recalls and well as biomarkers of nutritional status.\nThe tool was developed on a cross-section of the Geisinger Rural Aging Study (n=179). Extensive secondary dietary pattern analysis revealed several food groups that were related to nutrition risk and thus would be ideal targets for the questionnaire. The first draft of the screening tool was subjected to cognitive interviewing in a new sample of older adults (n= 17). \nAfter cognitive interviewing feedback, the DST had 37 items: 28 food specific questions, 5 yes and no questions, and four behavior-related questions. The total point range was 0 -100. A new sample was recruited to test the DST (n=204 with a mean age of 78.5 \u00b1 4 SD).  All participants attended a local medical clinic where they completed a battery of questionnaires (including the DST), had height and weight measured, and provided a fasting blood sample.\n Individuals were classified by DST scores as follows: scores <55 were at nutrition risk (the lowest 25th percentile), scores in the range of 55-75 (the middle 50-75th percentile) were at moderate nutrition risk, and scores > 75 (highest 25th percentile) were not likely to be at nutrition risk. No energy differences were noted among the groups; however, percent of energy from fat and saturated fat, dietary fiber intake, and indicators of diet quality were significantly different among all groups. Biomarker differences were also observed among the groups in the expected directions; but, no differences in anthropometry were observed.\nNutrition plays an integral role in the management of multiple chronic diseases. However, dietary assessment in clinical treatment of older adults is not a routine practice. Older adults are vulnerable to nutrition risk. Any strategies to help combat age-related chronic disease and improve quality of life for older adults are essential. The clinic setting provides an ideal place to screen older adults and the DST is a simple and practical diet screening tool that can help detect nutrition risk in older adults. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5198, 5199, 5200, 5201], "author_name_tesi": "Bailey, Regan Lucas", "last_name_ssi": "Bailey", "middle_name_ssi": "Lucas", "first_name_ssi": "Regan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Helen Smiciklas Wright", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Sherry Lynn Willis", "Frank R Lawrence, Ph D"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Helen Smiciklas Wright, Committee Chair", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "Sherry Lynn Willis, Committee Member", "Frank R Lawrence, Ph D, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["screening", "older adults", "nutrition"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Smithsonian Institution's Heritage as Gristmill of Hegemonic Power on the National Landscape\n", "id": "25010", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8228", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nViewed concretely, the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s main museums, gradually raised along the promenade of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., are centralized processing and display units whose contents are curated from the vast array of cultural and natural history collections and archives housed by the institution.

Some local food participants come to the local food system already holding these perspectives, while for others engagement with the local food system may be a learning process that gradually shifts how participants think about food.  Little was known about the learning process within the local food system and whether this learning or the practice of eating locally constituted social action. The purpose of this study was two-fold: (a) to examine how Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) shareholders learn to eat locally grown foods and (b) to explore how this learning explains engagement, a social consciousness about the food system, and related activism.  This study was theoretically informed by situated learning in adult education and collective action from social movement literature. A mixed methods study design was employed in Pennsylvania to explore these issues.  Local food eaters were identified through their CSA farm, considered an entry point to the local food movement.  The qualitative phase consisted of interviews with participants (N = 11) and identified food centric and social change orientations.  These findings were confirmed through a cross-sectional survey that also identified significant differences in social change orientations among participants (N = 121) that were associated with identifying as a local food movement member.

This accident scenario involves depressurization of helium from the reactor vessel due to a rupture in the primary coolant pipe, followed by the exchange of the helium with the air driven by the density difference. This ingress of air could potentially lead to oxidation of graphite structure in the reactor and ultimately to a release of radioactive fission products. The present study performs scaled adiabatic separate-effects experiments using air and helium as working fluids to highlight the hydrodynamic effects in the process of air ingress. A scaling analysis is performed to design a test apparatus using the Gas Turbine Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR) as the reference prototypic reactor. The scaling is performed to preserve the exchange time ratio between the scaled and prototypic case to be close to unity. The test vessel is made of a carbon steel cylinder with 60.96 cm (24 in) in diameter and 182.88 cm (72 in) in length. It is sealed at the top and bottom with flat plates via flanges. It is designed to accommodate three break locations, namely, two horizontal breaks on the side and one vertical break on the top of the vessel. These represent the horizontal primary coolant pipe and the vertical refueling standpipe, respectively. To investigate the geometric effects on the ingress phenomenon, the break locations are designed to accommodate pipe breaks of various length-to-diameter ratios (L/D) and break angles. In the present study, the air ingress via two horizontal side breaks is investigated with a pipe break of L/D = 3. The oxygen concentration is measured with an oxygen analyzer at several axial and radial locations within the test apparatus. It is found that the majority of the local data follows the same general trend. Oscillations are observed in the data for locations within close proximity as a result of the helium-air interface. The transient behaviors of both the local and the averaged oxygen concentration data show characteristics of hydrodynamic effects on the air ingress.

The innermost structure, the nucleocapsid, contains the viral genome.  The outermost structure is a host-derived lipid envelope coated with virally-encoded membrane proteins, many of which are glycosylated.  Located between the two regions is the tegument, of which UL11 is a member.\nUL11 is a small (96 amino acid) protein that is membrane bound via two covalently attached fatty acids.  Myristate is 14-carbons long and is added co-translationally to UL11 via a non-reversible amide bond, whereas palmitate is 16-carbons in length and is added post-translationally via a reversible thioester bond.  Myristylation is a prerequisite to palmitylation; however, the former provides only weak membrane binding strength whereas the latter penetrates deeper into the lipid bilayer to form a more stable protein/membrane interaction.  The addition of both fatty acids to UL11 is required for membrane trafficking and the subsequent accumulation at the site of virus assembly, where UL11 is predicted to function during the envelopment step, albeit via an unknown mechanism.\nThe studies in this dissertation were designed to better understand what role UL11 plays during virus envelopment, and specifically to what extent the acylations of UL11 are required for such functions.  As a first step, the ability of UL11 to localize to lipid rafts, or detergent resistant membranes (DRMs), was analyzed.  Dual acylation of proteins with myristate and palmitate is a classical DRM targeting signal, and UL11 was found to be no exception.  These studies also demonstrated the importance of two additional motifs within UL11 for DRM accumulation.  The \u201cdi-leucine\u201d (LI, leucine-isoleucine) and acidic cluster (AC) motifs are involved in targeting UL11 from the plasma membrane (PM) to the site of virus assembly, the trans-Golgi network (TGN).  Mutants of UL11 that lack the palmitate moiety were reduced for DRM association and mutants that lack both myristate and palmitate were further reduced to background levels.  Removal of only a single trafficking motif (LI or AC) did not alter the ability of UL11 to associate with DRMs, but mutants of UL11 that lack both the LI and AC had increased DRM association.  Taken together, these data suggest that UL11 has highly dynamic membrane-trafficking properties, and that UL11 may require trafficking through DRMs prior to accumulation at the TGN to ensure proper function during virus envelopment.\nTo directly examine the hypothesis that UL11 requires both myristate and palmitate for function during virus envelopment, recombinant viruses were created to express variants of UL11 with different acylation patterns.  The mutants included a non-acylated UL11 (no myristate or palmitate), a partially-acylated UL11 (myristate only), or one of two UL11 chimeras that contain acylation signals from non-HSV proteins (myristylated only or myristylated and palmitylated).  The results showed that only WT UL11 (with both myristate and palmitate moieties) fully rescued the growth properties of a UL11-null virus.  However, it was very surprising that the non-acylated UL11 (no myristate or palmitate) rescued some growth defects of the UL11-nulll virus.  These experiments demonstrated that although not essential, the acylations are important for the function of UL11 during virus envelopment.\nThe studies detailed within this dissertation provide new insights into how the UL11 protein functions during virus assembly and envelopment.  With further studies, it should be possible to elucidate the exact mechanism(s) by which UL11 functions during the assembly and envelopment of HSV-1.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4643], "author_name_tesi": "Baird, Nicholas Lindsay", "last_name_ssi": "Baird", "middle_name_ssi": "Lindsay", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Warren Wills", "John Warren Wills", "Richard James Courtney", "David Joseph Spector", "Leslie Joan Parent", "Ira Joseph Ropson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Warren Wills, Dissertation Advisor", "John Warren Wills, Committee Chair", "Richard James Courtney, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Member", "Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lipid Rafts", "Myristylation", "Palmitylation", "Tegument", "UL11", "Herpes"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Evaluating avulsion controls on fluvial sand body architecture and connectivity\n", "id": "27175", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11777", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Various scales of heterogeneity affect fluvial reservoir performance and are typically difficult to predict.

The well-exposed Wasatch Formation (Paleocene/Eocene, Piceance Basin, Colorado, USA) exhibits three distinct styles of fluvial sand bodies and serves as the study area for this work.

As aggradation and model width increase, reservoir area decreases while compartmentalization increases. High quality reservoirs are dominated by vertical stacking for low and high-net scenarios.

I investigate how a leader\u2019s decision to initiate a costly military conflict is constrained by domestic audiences, how the level of domestic constraints systematically changes over the course of tenure, and how the changing pattern differs between democracies and dictatorships. More specifically, I argue that leaders are highly constrained to initiate a costly conflict when the domestic audience's replacement attempt is credible ex ante, i.e., when the replacement attempt is less costly and more likely to succeed. Early in the tenure a democratic leader's political survival is well protected by institutions and domestic consent, so that a replacement attempt is more costly and less likely to succeed than later in the election period; dictators, however, are vulnerable to violent domestic challenges before consolidating dictatorial power, so that a replacement attempt is less costly and more likely to succeed early than later. I hypothesize that the likelihood of conflict initiation decreases in a democratic leader's tenure but increases in a dictator's tenure. I conduct a series of empirical tests and find strong empirical evidence for the hypotheses. \nMy dissertation also examines whether a similar theoretical logic can be applied to only democracies. More specifically, I examine how a democratic leader's sensitivity to potential electoral punishment changes over the course of tenure. I argue that democratic leaders are highly sensitive to domestic electoral punishment when they have strong electoral incentives and when the electoral outcome is highly uncertain. I demonstrate in a game-theoretic model that a leader\u2019s sensitivity systematically affects his or her conflict behavior through audience costs and the costs of war. Equilibrium concepts show that highly sensitive leaders are less likely to initiate a military conflict than less sensitive leaders. Using a fine-grained monthly dyadic data set on the U.S. presidents between 1953 and 2001, I find that presidents tend to be less likely to initiate a military conflict when their personal electoral fate is at stake and the electoral outcome is highly uncertain, and that presidents in the second term are more likely to initiate a conflict than those in the first term. \t\nFurther, I turn my attention to authoritarian regimes. In particular, this research examines how authoritarian time horizon, i.e., how long an authoritarian leader expects to stay in office, affects an authoritarian leader\u2019s conflict behavior. I develop a simple formal model of autocratic leaders\u2019 predatory behavior in the shadow of domestic constraints in terms of the risk of leadership failure and post-tenure punishment. The model suggests that the likelihood of unsafe or irregular leadership failure be negatively related to the level of domestic predation, which challenges and supplements the conventional Olsonian perspective. Assuming that a military conflict initiation is a type of autocrats\u2019 predatory behavior that enriches their private goods, I run empirical tests on the relationship between the likelihood of different types of leadership failure and the number of militarized dispute initiations. Two-stage models with nonparametric bootstrapping show significant empirical support for my hypotheses, implying that when autocrats are concerned about unexpected and violent domestic challenges, they are highly constrained to use force externally. \nThe overall theme of my dissertation is the relationship between a leader\u2019s tenure and the propensity of international conflict initiation. The major implications of the theoretical arguments and empirical findings are: a) leader is a unit of analysis whose foreign-policy interests and decision-making power systematically change over the course of tenure; b) a threat to leadership survival is a major source of domestic constraints rather than a diversionary motive; and c) democratic leaders are not always more constrained by domestic audiences in their foreign policy than dictators.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8372], "author_name_tesi": "Bak, Daehee ", "last_name_ssi": "Bak", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Daehee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Glenn Hunter Palmer", "Glenn Hunter Palmer", "David Scott Bennett Jr.", "Christopher Jon Zorn", "Joseph Wright", "Alessandro Bonanno"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Glenn Hunter Palmer, Dissertation Advisor", "Glenn Hunter Palmer, Committee Chair", "David Scott Bennett Jr., Committee Member", "Christopher Jon Zorn, Committee Member", "Joseph Wright, Committee Member", "Alessandro Bonanno, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Leader", "Tenure", "Domestic Constraints", "International Conflict", "Predation", "Time Horizon", "Game Theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Role of Institution, Ideology, Interests, and Information in the Decision to Departmentalize in Elementary Schools\n", "id": "11724", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "603", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nGiven escalating accountability requirements under No Child Left Behind (NCLB), educators and administrators face intensified pressure to significantly increase student achievement in their schools.  Changing how schools and classrooms are organized for instruction, as a strategy for school improvement, has been one response to this pressure.  Departmentalizing in the elementary school serves as one example of such an organizational change.  Very little research, however, specifically addresses elementary-level departmentalization.  Without a strong research basis for their decision to departmentalize, how are schools making this choice in an era in which evidence-based decision making is demanded?  \nThis qualitative study explored the decision-making process involved in determining whether or not to departmentalize in the elementary grades through an in-depth case study of one small, rural Pennsylvania district, where the choice to departmentalize has been made. Specifically, the study sought to provide insight into the involvement of individual stakeholders in the decision; the influence of these stakeholders\u2019 ideologies, interests, and access to information on the decision; and the impact of the institution on the decision.  The benefits and limitations of elementary departmentalization were also described.  \nData collection occurred over a two-month period and included individual conversational interviews with 3 administrators and 13 teachers, 3 parent focus group interviews, and analysis of a variety of relevant documents.  Extensive analysis was primarily accomplished through pattern coding, based on the research questions.  The research resulted in a thick, rich description of the district\u2019s long-standing experience with departmentalization in the sixth grade and its recent decisions to expand departmentalization to the fifth grade and to explore departmentalization in fourth grade.  \n\tTwo broad conclusions were drawn from the research.  For one, the institution exerted a significant influence on the decision-making process and on the ultimate decision.  This institutional context influenced the individuals\u2019 perceptions of their own interests, ideologies, and knowledge used in the decision-making process.  The second conclusion drawn from the research suggested that semi-departmentalization may effectively reduce many of the limitations typically associated with a departmentalized approach by balancing a student-centered approach with content specificity.  A number of recommendations for practice and for further research were also provided.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [599], "author_name_tesi": "Baker, Betsy A.", "last_name_ssi": "Baker", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Betsy", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nona Ann Prestine", "Nona Ann Prestine", "Preston Green", "James F Nolan Jr.", "Roger C Shouse"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nona Ann Prestine, Dissertation Advisor", "Nona Ann Prestine, Committee Chair", "Preston Green, Committee Member", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["departmentalize", "horizontal organization", "self-contained", "elementary", "departmentalization", "elementary departmentalization"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "PUBERTAL TIMING, TYPE OF MOTIVATION, AND PERCEIVED ATHLETIC COMPETENCE AS PREDICTORS OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS\u2019 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY", "id": "8601", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "715", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examined biological, social, psychological factors that predict adolescent girls\u2019 physical activity.

Three article manuscripts comprise the body of the dissertation.\nThe relationship between pubertal timing and subsequent physical activity was examined in the first manuscript (Chapter 2). Girls with more advanced pubertal status at age 11 were less physically active at age 13.\nType of motivation was the focus of the second paper (Chapter 3). Self-determination theory was used to guide the analyses in this chapter. Results from logistic regression analyses indicated that age 9 perceived athletic competence and parental autonomy granting were positively related to girls\u2019 intrinsic motivation for physical activity across ages 9-13 and negatively related to girls\u2019 extrinsic (weight related) motivation for physical activity across ages 9-13. Intrinsic motivation was, in turn, positively related to girls\u2019 accelerometer-measured physical activity at age 13. \nThe role of perceived athletic competence in predicting physical activity was examined in the third manuscript (Chapter 4). Results indicated that both age 11 perceived athletic competence and the change in perceived athletic competence between ages 11 and 13 were significant predictors of age 13 physical activity. Age 11 perceived athletic competence was predicted by age 9 sport participation and body fat percentage while the change in perceived athletic competence between ages 11 and 13 was predicted by age 9 breast development. Taken together, these studies highlight the complexity of factors related to adolescent girls\u2019 physical activity. Findings from these three papers suggest that puberty and perceived athletic competence are related to adolescent girls\u2019 physical activity. In addition, the importance of examining both point estimates and changes across time is illustrated by the results from these studies. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [709], "author_name_tesi": "Baker, Birgitta L", "last_name_ssi": "Baker", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Birgitta", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Leisure Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan R Graefe", "Kirsten Davison", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Leann L Birch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan R Graefe, Committee Chair", "Kirsten Davison, Committee Chair", "Andrew Justin Mowen, Committee Member", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Member", "Leann L Birch, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adolescents", "physical activity", "motivation. perceived  athletic competence", "puberty"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THREE ESSAYS ON BMI TRAJECTORIES BY GENERATION DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD\n\n", "id": "11590", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1770", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Immigrants tend to be healthier than their native born peers on many factors, including obesity.  However, to date, research has produced contradictory results about the potential contributors of this relationship as well as the magnitude of this phenomenon.  This research examines weight assimilation, using both a pooled sample and a Mexican-American specific sub-sample of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort, as adolescents transition to adulthood.  The negative health assimilation hypothesis states that overtime, there is convergence in the health between immigrant generations and natives.  Examining this relationship longitudinally, using growth curve models, I find continued divergence rather than convergence.  Immigrant generations weigh less at the beginning of the study period and gain less weight as they enter adulthood compared to native generations (1).  In addition to documenting this phenomenon descriptively, this research also examined the different contexts that could contribute to this relationship, concentrating specifically on emerging young adult socioeconomic status and residence.  Inequality in socioeconomic status contributes to health disparities, such that those with lower socioeconomic status have worse health than those with higher socioeconomic status.  Immigrant children and children of immigrants often have lower origin socioeconomic status than children of natives and they tend to make great strides over the educational attainment of their parents.  In addition, increases in educational attainment mean that children of immigrants spend an extended period of time in one of the most influential socializing institutions they will encounter during this phase of their life, college.  Using OLS regression when the respondents are in between the ages of 24 to 28, I find that own emerging socioeconomic status, measured as education, is important to all generations, but this is especially true among the second generation, even controlling for family of origin socioeconomic status (2).  Lastly, I examine the relationship between parental co-residence and weight using growth curve models.  Strong immigrant families are suggested as one of the potential sources that allow immigrants and their children to overcome many of the disadvantages they face, such as disorganized neighborhoods and poverty.  Also, immigrant children and children of immigrants are more likely to remain in their parents home longer and the implications this has on their adult outcomes differs from those found for children of natives.  I find that non-parental co-residence is associated with weight gain among all generations, but only among the first and second generation is this weight gain not accounted for by partnering and childbearing (3).  Other factors, perhaps related to acculturation and assimilation, drive this relationship for children of immigrants.  These findings suggest that weight assimilation is a complex process, influenced by factors experienced in childhood, as suggested by the immigrants continued divergence in weight gain, and their immediate environment, as suggested by the importance of own emerging socioeconomic status and parental co-residence.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1755], "author_name_tesi": "Baker, Elizabeth Helene", "last_name_ssi": "Baker", "middle_name_ssi": "Helene", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Lynne Van Hook", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook", "Michelle Lynn Frisco", "Nancy Landale", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Dissertation Advisor", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Committee Chair", "Michelle Lynn Frisco, Committee Member", "Nancy Landale, Committee Member", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["obesity; immigrant assimilation; Mexican-American;"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Parental Beliefs and the Socialization of Child Emotion: The Role of Child Risk and Parent Gender\n", "id": "7701", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2753", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examined links between parental beliefs regarding emotion (attitudes, priorities, and perceptions), and parental socialization of emotion behaviors.

Fathers were found to be less emotion supportive than mothers as per self-report, but not in terms of observed behavior. Based on developmental status-group assignment at either age 3 or 5 years, parental emotion-coaching attitudes were positively related to several supportive parenting behaviors for parents of typically developing children, and for fathers of children with delays. Mothers of children with delays did not show any significant belief-behavior links when the child age-3 status assignment was considered, but links between priorities and parenting emerged with consideration of the age-5 years assignment. Priorities did not exhibit many simple relations to parenting, but attitudes moderated some priority-behavior links. Support was generated for the existence of diagnostic overshadowing within families of children with delays, but no differences were found in the behavior of these parents as compared to families of typically developing children.

Insomnia, which is characterized by difficulty falling and/or staying asleep and associated daytime functioning impairment, is the most prevalent sleep disorder. Insomnia is not just a disruption of an individual\u2019s normal sleep but rather impacts both physical and mental health and, in adults, insomnia with objective short sleep duration has shown to be a more biologically severe form of the disorder. This insomnia phenotype has been associated with activation of the stress system, inflammation and adverse cardiometabolic, neurocognitive and psychiatric outcomes. It is also known that this insomnia phenotype is highly persistent throughout adulthood; therefore, it is important for clinicians to identify this phenotype early during development. Our primary aim in this project was to test whether objective short sleep duration, as measured by polysomnography (PSG), played a key role in predicting the association of insomnia symptoms with inflammation in adolescents. Given that PSG is not readily available for clinicians, we examined in secondary analyses whether the persistence of insomnia symptoms since childhood also helped predict the association of insomnia symptoms with inflammation in adolescents. Subjects were participants in the Penn State Child Cohort (PSCC), a population-based sample of 421 adolescents who underwent 9-h PSG followed by a single fasting blood draw to assess plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other inflammatory markers via ELISA. Insomnia symptoms were defined by a self-report of difficulty falling and/or staying asleep on the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire, while objective sleep duration was defined as \u2265 8 hours, 7-8 hours, \u2264 7 hours of sleep based on the quartiles of PSG-measured total sleep time. Multivariable-adjusted general linear models tested the association between insomnia symptoms, objective sleep duration and their interaction on CRP levels. Adolescents reporting insomnia symptoms had significantly higher CRP levels compared to controls and a significant interaction (p<0.01) showed that objective sleep duration modified this association. Elevated CRP was present in adolescents with insomnia symptoms who slept \u2264 7 hours (1.8 mg/L) as compared to controls or adolescents with insomnia symptoms who slept \u2265 8 hours (0.9 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L, respectively) or controls who slept \u2264 7 hours (0.74mg/L; all p-values <0.01). These findings indicated that, as in adults, objective short sleep duration identifies a phenotype of insomnia at greater risk of morbidity via chronic low-grade inflammation. Secondary analyses based solely on self- and parent-reported data revealed that adolescents whose parents reported persisting insomnia symptoms since childhood had significantly higher CRP levels (1.2 mg/L, p=0.046) compared to controls or to adolescents with new-onset insomnia symptoms (1.0 and 0.8 mg/L, respectively). This finding suggests that a childhood onset of insomnia symptoms may be a useful tool to screen for those adolescents at greater risk of inflammation. Together, our findings indicate that chronic low-grade inflammation may be a common final pathway towards morbidity in adulthood in the insomnia with objective short sleep duration phenotype as early as adolescence.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14003, 14033], "author_name_tesi": "Baker, Joshua Henry", "last_name_ssi": "Baker", "middle_name_ssi": "Henry", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Bixler", "Julio Fernandez-Mendoza", "Patricia McLaughlin "], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Bixler, Thesis Advisor", "Julio Fernandez-Mendoza, Committee Member", "Patricia McLaughlin , Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Insomnia", "Adolescence", "Inflammation", "C-reactive protein", "Penn State Child Cohort"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Characterization of ExbB Transmembrane Domains for Tonb-dependent Energy Transduction in Escherichia coli", "id": "16188", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8096", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "  In Gram negative bacteria, the TonB system serves as an energy conduit, connecting cytoplasmic membrane (CM) proton motive force (pmf) to active transport of ligands at the outer membrane (OM) through TonB-gated transporters. In Escherichia coli, CM proteins TonB, ExbB, and ExbD form a complex which links pmf energy to transport of important nutrients vitamin B12 and iron-siderophore complexes into the cell. TonB and ExbD have a similar topology with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, one transmembrane domain (TMD) and a large C-terminal periplasmic domain. In contrast, ExbB has three TMDs and large cytoplasmic loop and tail domains. Because the majority of TonB/ExbD and ExbB occupy different cellular compartments, important interactions are thought to occur through the TMDs. \n  Characterization of functionally important residues in the TMDs and periplasmic domains of TonB and ExbD have provided mechanistic insight for TonB system function. However, the functional role of ExbB is undefined. Currently, ExbB has three speculative functions, as a scaffolding protein, as a signal transducer and as a proton translocator. Mutagenic studies in the large cytoplasmic loop and tail domains have concluded that these regions are essential for ExbB function. In addition, Cys substitutions in the C-terminal tail identified residues important for signal transduction from the cytoplasm to periplasm. The ExbB TMDs have not been well-studied and it is unclear if all TMDs are essential for ExbB function. \n  This study addressed the functional importance of the ExbB TMDs for TonB-dependent energy transduction. New predictions of ExbB TMD boundaries replaced three prior incongruent ExbB TMD predictions. Substitution of each half ExbB TMD with alanine determined that all TMDs were essential for activity. Additional substitution of individual ExbB TMD residues identified ExbB scaffolding and signal transduction functions.  Substitution of all protonatable residues in the TMD ruled out the hypothesis that ExbB residues function in proton translocation. This knowledge was then applied to characterize ExbB \u2206120-129-mediated proton leakage via addition of TMD substitutions. The proton leakage rate was reduced by substitution of important ExbB TMD residues, suggesting proton conductance was occurring through ExbB. However, substitution of non-essential ExbB residues had the most profound effect on the ExbB \u2206120-129-mediated proton leakage. This implied that the proton leakage was occurring through a non-native ExbB mechanism.  The mutagenic studies presented here, reinforce the proposed ExbB scaffolding and signal transducer functions and refute a proton pathway formed through the ExbB TMDs.

Yet many stigmatization reduction messages are brief, and therefore cannot include numerous characters. For this reason, such messages often include only the individual with the stigmatized condition as the primary character. However, non-stigmatized individuals who choose to associate with stigmatized others (empathic individuals, referred to as \u201cthe wise\u201d by Goffman, 1963), may be powerful role models in brief narratives designed to reduce stigmatization.

To this end, this experimental research (N = 170) explores the effect of positive, transitional, and negative protagonists in brief narrative messages designed to reduce stigmatization of persons diagnosed with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), a rare genetic condition that leads to pulmonary and liver disease. Results indicated that positive and transitional protagonists are more effective in reducing stigmatization than negative protagonists. Exploration of the psychological processes mediating this reduced stigmatization, operationalized as reduced social distance, revealed that positive character appraisal of the protagonist, not character identification with the protagonist, was the primary mechanism that led to reduced stigmatization. Further, different processes mediated stigmatization reduction for positive/transitional and negative protagonists. Neither empathy with the protagonist nor empathy with the character diagnosed with AATD led to significant stigmatization reduction.

Virus filtration is an integral part of the overall strategy for viral clearance of cell culture-based proteins.  Virus filtration membranes provide a robust size-based removal of viruses through a multi-layer structure that is uniquely designed to provide high levels of viral clearance and significant recovery of the protein products.  The objective of this thesis is to develop a more complete understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing protein transport and fouling, as well as virus retention, during virus filtration.  This includes the role of solution conditions, protein concentration, and membrane structure on protein transport, membrane fouling, and the observed decline in virus retention during virus filtration.\nExperimental studies were performed using three very different virus filters, the Pall Ultipor\u00ae DV20, the Millipore Viresolve\u00ae Pro, and the Millipore Viresolve\u00ae 180 membranes operated in both the standard and reverse flow orientations.  The Viresolve\u00ae membranes have an asymmetric structure with a retentive skin layer on top of a more open substructure.  In contrast, the Ultipor\u00ae DV20 membrane has a fairly homogenous (isotropic) pore structure.  The decline in filtrate flux through the Viresolve membrane was primarily due to concentration polarization, with the extent of polarization dependent upon solution pH due to the pH dependence of the protein mass transfer coefficient.  In contrast, the dominant mechanism of flux decline with the DV20 membrane was protein fouling due to the constriction of the membrane pores.  \nSeveral novel approaches were developed to probe the pore morphology and retention characteristics of the virus filtration membranes.  First, a dextran sieving test was developed that was appropriate for the large pores in virus filters.  The dextran sieving profiles depend on both the pore size and the asymmetric structure of the virus filter.  For example, the dextran sieving profiles for the Ultipor\u00ae DV20 membrane were slightly different in the two orientations, demonstrating that the DV20 membrane had a slightly non-homogeneous pore structure, in contrast to the highly asymmetric structure of the Viresolve\u00ae membranes.  Second, a confocal scanning laser microscopy method was developed to directly visualize the capture of fluorescently labeled bacteriophage within the pore structure of the virus filters.  Third, transmission electron microscopy was used to visualize the capture of nanometer-sized gold particles.  \nSeveral different hypotheses were examined to describe the reduction in virus retention including: small pore plugging, virus polarization, virus breakthrough, and virus internal polarization.  Experimental data for retention of PP7 bacteriophage through the DV20 membrane were consistent with predictions of the internal virus polarization model, in which the accumulation of viruses within the membrane matrix (but in the liquid phase within the porous structure) leads to the observed reduction in virus retention.  These results provide important insights into the key factors controlling the performance of virus filtration membranes for bioprocessing applications.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4444], "author_name_tesi": "Bakhshayeshirad, Meisam ", "last_name_ssi": "Bakhshayeshirad", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Meisam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney", "Andrew Zydney", "Themis Matsoukas", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr.", "Brian Dempsey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Chair", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Member", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Virus Retention", "Fouling", "Membrane", "Virus Filtration"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Enhancing Pga Golf Management Internships- A Social Perspective ", "id": "cj82k728n", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10765", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The internship experience is a critical component that is necessary for one to be successful in industry.

In addition, research is needed to determine the critical components that can lead to a positive attitude one has towards their internship experience. Given the social nature of the golf industry, which includes constant communication and interactions between employees and customers, this study examined the role of social variables (i.e., coworker socializing, supervisor instrumental support, supervisor emotional support, fun activities, networking and job challenge) on job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion and commitment to the industry. A sample of 268 PGA Golf Management interns were surveyed to determine the extent these social factors relate to a successful internship experience. The results demonstrated that networking and coworker socializing had a significant impact on job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, and commitment to the industry. In addition, job challenge was found to have a significant impact on job satisfaction and commitment to the industry; and supervisor instrumental support was found to have a significant negative relationship with commitment to the industry.

However, the production of Black masculinity in rap has relied increasingly on problematic cultural tropes, particularly variations of images such as the thug and the playa. Geographic space is also used in this cultural construction.  The cultural industries have long conflated \u201cauthentic\u201d Blackness with the Northern urban ghetto, particularly in cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. However, the expansion of the cultural industries in the U.S. South and images of Southern Black masculinity in popular media even rival \u201cthe North\u201d in terms of exposure and sales, and Time Warner, Sony and Universal have invested millions in producing Southern-based rappers.

And how can such constructions in the dialectical push and pull of \u201ckeepin it real\u201d in a context of corporate capitalism be understood?\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the construction and production of Southern Black masculinity in hip-hop, with an emphasis on two particular rappers in Atlanta, at the intersection of 1.) corporate interests that control the production and dissemination of these representations; 2.) the ideologies that shape the discourse on Black masculinity and manhood; 3.) the impact of location as a factor in performance; and 4.) the rapper\u2019s self-conceptualization. How does the convergence of these four factors influence particular representations of Southern Black masculinity in rap music videos?

Users of these new media often forget their immediate physical surroundings and experience a sense of \u201cbeing there\u201d in the mediated environment. This idea of \u201cbeing there\u201d, referred to as the sense of presence, has received much attention from scholars from diverse disciplines.

The present study examines spatial presence formation as a function of navigability affordances to fill this gap in literature. To this end, the study begins by explicating the concept of navigability to define it as well as identify its components. The concept of spatial presence is explicated to clarify its meaning, define the boundaries of its meaning and to identify factors affecting it. After explicating the two key concepts, various theoretical mechanisms by which navigability components affect spatial presence  are discussed and specific hypotheses proposed. The impact of navigability on spatial presence is examined through a controlled experiment (N=240) in a large screen, passive stereo virtual reality display. Narrative transportation is added as a user-centric variable in the experiment to examine whether user-centric characteristics can compensate for, or interact with technology affordances. Findings reveal that steering control, which affords locomotion through the virtual environment, is a strong predictor of spatial presence with greater steering control and maneuverability leading to greater spatial presence. Contrary to expectation, narrative transportation had a negative impact on spatial presence. Findings indicate support for heuristic processing of spatial cues and revealed capacity limitations in processing spatial cues. The study also revealed boundary conditions for the role of spatial situation models in formation of spatial presence. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

However, not much is known about its part in orchestrating the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. The present study examined the potential of this nuclear receptor in delaying the progression of chronic hepatocellular injury-induced liver cancer. In hepatitis B virus (HBV) transgenic mice, which develop progressive inflammation and cellular injury at the early stages (2-3 months of age), followed by hyperplasia, neoplasia and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma at later stages (12-18 months of age), long-term ligand activation (8 months) with PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 ligand (GW0742), displayed a significant attenuation in tumor multiplicity and the average number of liver foci, which was not observed in HBV mice not treated with GW0742. Further, this attenuation in tumorigenesis was accompanied by a reduction in hepatic steatosis and markers of cellular proliferation CYCLIN D1 and c-MYC as well as an increase in a marker of apoptosis, cleaved PARP. Ligand activation of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 attenuated mRNA expression of hepatic inflammatory cytokine Tnfa and serum ALT at the early stages of disease pathogenesis in these mice. Ligand activation of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 attenuated LPS-induced mRNA expression of Tnfa in primary Kupffer cell cultures from wild-type but not in Kupffer cells from Ppar\u03b2/\u03b4-null mice. LPS-induced mRNA expression of Tnfa was also found to be attenuated in Ppar\u03b2/\u03b4-DBM (DNA binding mutant form of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4) Kupffer cells treated with GW0742, indicating that the anti-inflammatory effects of ligand activated PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 occurs independent of the nuclear receptor binding to its PPREs. These effects were not observed in hepatocytes. Further, co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed interaction of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 with p65 subunit of pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-\u03baB in LPS and GW0742 activated KC13-2 Kupffer cells. In the hepatitis C virus (HCV) transgenic mice expressing the core protein of the virus, preliminary histopathological analyses did not yield a conclusive role for PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 in modulating hepatic inflammation and steatosis. However, PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 was found to significantly increase the life span of HCV wild-type mice compared to that of HCV Ppar\u03b2/\u03b4-null mice, independent of ligand activation of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4. Protein microarray displayed a consistent increase in Cofilin 1 and a decrease in SODD, SOCS2 and p27Kip1 expression levels, as well as a decrease in phosphorylation of PKC\u03b3 in livers of 18-month-old HCV Ppar\u03b2/\u03b4-null mice compared to that of HCV wild-type mice. Combined, the present study confirms a hepatoprotective role for PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 in mouse models of chronic hepatocellular injury-induced liver cancer and its potential as a possible therapeutic approach to treat hepatocarcinogenesis is promising and warrants further investigation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11337], "author_name_tesi": "Balandaram, Gayathri ", "last_name_ssi": "Balandaram", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gayathri", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Gary H Perdew", "Andrew David Patterson", "Connie Jo Rogers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Andrew David Patterson, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4", "liver", "liver cancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Shape-Control of Colloidal Metal Nanocrystals: Insights from Molecular Simulation", "id": "15051tub179", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15051", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The shape-control mechanisms within the solution-phase synthesis of Ag nanocrystals are investigated using atomistic simulations. We study the interfacial layer containing a structure-directing agent called polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), a solvent which is ethylene glycol (EG), and the Ag metal surface, in which this interfacial layer is commonly found in Ag nanocrystals syntheses. The presence of PVP has been shown to be crucial for the formation of shaped nanostructures, but the role of PVP remains elusive.\n\nIn our work, we show that the PVP film can alter the flux of Ag atoms onto surfaces, such that the predicted kinetic Wulff shape is a cube. This is consistent with the formation of Ag nanocubes in PVP-assisted syntheses. PVP regulates the flux by preferentially binding onto {100} facets, impeding the growth {100} facets, resulting in the expression of the {100} facets in the final shape. The adsorption of PVP enables its structure-directing capabilities, in which we investigate the effect of EG solvent on PVP's adsorption thermodynamics. Our results show that PVP adsorption is weaker in EG solvent because it is stabilized by EG molecules in the bulk solution phase. We also find that the entropy change due to binding is slightly positive, which is because the configurational and rotational entropy losses of PVP binding are offset by the entropic gain from the displacement of solvent molecules. Finally, we probe how the PVP film influences the oriented attachment of Ag nanoplates. The PVP chains prefer to bind to large flat surfaces compared to the edges of the Ag nanoplates, which led to a smaller free-energy barrier for the lateral attachment compared to vertical attachment. This is consistent with experiments where Ag nanoplates tend to laterally attach to each other.\n\nOur work directly contributes to the fundamental understanding of the interfacial phenomena. This understanding empowers engineers and scientists to design and develop more robust shape-control strategies, which can bring forward nanocrystal applications such as selective catalysts and biosensors.

Despite the wide variety of both healthy (e.g. increase vegetable intake) and unhealthy (e.g. use of diuretics) weight control behaviors that can considered part of \u201cdieting,\u201d it is unclear what children and adolescents are doing when they report dieting. The purpose of the present research was to extend our knowledge of predictors and patterns of girls\u2019 self-reported dieting behavior in late childhood and adolescence. Participants included 197 non-Hispanic white girls and their biological parents in central Pennsylvania followed from age 5y-15y. Data were collected across the 10-year period, with assessments every 2 years. The aim of study 1 was to examine the influence of parental encouragement to diet on the emergence of early (by 11y) and adolescent (between 11y and 15y) dieting. All measures of parental encouragement to diet (maternal, paternal, combined) predicted the emergence of early dieting, but not adolescent dieting. In addition, parental encouragement to diet predicted increases in girls\u2019 BMI percentiles between the ages of 9 and 15, but only among girls who reported dieting. In Study 2, latent class analysis was used to identify patterns of weight control behaviors in the current sample at age 15. Four patterns were identified, Non-dieters, and three dieting groups: Lifestyle, Dieters, and Extreme Dieters. The Non-dieters did not endorse using any weight control behaviors, and the three dieting groups increased in the number and severity of their weight control behaviors, from the Lifestyle group who only reported increasing exercise and fruit and vegetable intake, to the Extreme Dieters who reported using all the behaviors, with over half reporting use of at least one unhealthy behavior. The three dieting groups were also different on a number of concurrent individual characteristics (e.g. BMI, depression), with differences between the groups observed as early as 5y. One of the intended purposes of dieting is to influence dietary intake. Thus, different patterns of weight control behaviors may be associated with different changes in intake. When dietary intake was examined, girls in the Extreme Dieters group had the lowest self-reported intake but consumed significantly more in the laboratory.  The aim of Study 3 was to extend the findings of Study 2 to examine the association between patterns of weight control behaviors and family, friend, and media factors.  Significant family factors included family functioning, priority of family meals, and maternal weight-teasing. Significant friend factors included weight-teasing and dieting. Sensitivity to media was significant. When all the factors were examined in a combined model, family functioning, friends\u2019 dieting, and media sensitivity remained significant predictors of membership in a dieting group relative to the Non-dieters. Overall, the results of the present study indicate that for adolescent girls, dieting is an umbrella term for a wide variety of behaviors, and that types of dieters (e.g. Lifestyle, Dieters, and Extreme Dieters) are different on a number of individual characteristics and family, friend, and media factors. Taken together, these findings emphasize the need for a multidimensional prevention and interventions, addressing risk factors for dieting and use of unhealthy and extreme weight control behaviors at the individual, family, friend, and community (e.g. media) levels.

The forecasters, supplied by only a few AQ model products, end up relying heavily on self-developed tools.  To help US AQ forecasters, this study explores surface ozone MDA8 forecasting tool based solely on statistical methods and standard meteorological variables from the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models.  The model combines self-organizing map (SOM), a clustering technique, with a stepwise weighted quadratic regression using meteorological variables as predictors for ozone MDA8.  The SOM method identifies different weather regimes, to distinguish between various modes of ozone variability, and groups them according to similarity.  In this way, when a regression is developed for a specific regime, data from the other regimes are also used, with weights based on their similarity to this specific regime.  This approach, regression in SOM (REGiS), yields a distinct model for each regime taking into account both the training cases for that regime and other similar training cases.  To produce probabilistic MDA8 ozone forecasts, REGiS weighs and combines all of the developed regression models based on the weather patterns predicted by a NWP model.  REGiS is evaluated over San Joaquin Valley in California and northeastern plains of Colorado.

How this immunomodulatory capability of vitamin D could influence the outcome of an immune response in the event of an infection forms the crux of this review. A better response to an infection increases the host resistance to that infection. A robust response could be looked upon as the one that not only helps in effective and timely clearance of that infection, but also leaves a good memory repertoire in the event of a secondary infection. The immunomodulatory function of this vitamin can be addressed in two phases: Its effect on innate immunity and its effects on the adaptive immunity.

Photosystem I participates in one of the most efficient conversions of light to chemical energy. This energy conversion requires the involvement of cofactors that are embedded in a complex, multi-protein matrix. In particular, the three terminal iron sulfur clusters FX, FA and FB are crucial for the electron transfer from the photochemical reaction center to Ferredoxin: NADP oxidoreductase (FNR). The biogenesis and assembly of these iron-sulfur clusters are poorly understood. In order to understand these processes, I have characterized the role of three proteins, SufR, SufA, and IscA, which are thought to involved in the biogenesis and assembly of iron sulfur clusters. \nUsing reverse genetics, RT-PCR, and recombinant protein characterization we show that SufR is a [4Fe-4S] protein that functions as a repressor regulator for the suf genes. Based on the results, I propose that SufR controls the transcription of the suf genes through alteration of the properties of its [4Fe-4S] cluster. \nSufA and IscA are iron-sulfur cluster proteins that until now have been implicated in a scaffold function for the transient assembly of iron-sulfur clusters. Using reverse genetics and RT-PCR, I have shown that SufA and IscA are, in fact, response regulators that modulate the expression of proteins involved in iron-sulfur cluster assembly in response to both redox stress and oxidative stress.\nWhen all the cofactors are assembled in Photosystem I, efficient electron transfer can occur. I have used transient absorption spectroscopy to study the thermodynamics of charge recombination between the cofactors in order to determine the mid-point potentials of these cofactors and the extent to which iron-sulfur clusters influence the midpoint potential of the quinone, A1. Using site directed spin labeling and transient EPR techniques, I have also addressed the issue of directionality of electron transfer in Photosystem I, i.e., whether electron transfer takes place through one or both of the two arms of cofactors. This experimental study using an observer spin concept is the first attempt to study and characterize an interacting three-spin system in a Photosystem.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5377], "author_name_tesi": "Balasubramanian, Ramakrishnan ", "last_name_ssi": "Balasubramanian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ramakrishnan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John H Golbeck", "Donald Ashley Bryant", "B Tracy Nixon", "Squire J Booker", "Juliette T J Lecomte"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John H Golbeck, Committee Chair", "Donald Ashley Bryant, Committee Chair", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Juliette T J Lecomte, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electron transfer", "iron-sulfur clusters", "cyanobacteria", "Biogenesis", "Photosystem I"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Charge Nonuniformity on Submicron Particles", "id": "18651", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8536", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Distribution of zeta potential on the surface of a colloidal particle has been previously modeled for spherical, ellipsoidal and spheroidal particles3.

This consolidation has been in response to fundamental changes in regulation and technology. The banking and finance literature is abound with research attempting to quantify and evaluate a wide range of outcomes arising from consolidation. After more than three decades of microeconometric empirical analysis on bank consolidation, researchers remain unable to provide clear evidence on: (1) how the rate of consolidation is measured, (2) if there is a relation between efficiency gains and size heterogeneity in the banking sector, and (3) how commercial banks managed their risk and responded to the very recent subprime crisis.\nOne of the problems with studying banks is that the bank is a unique microeconomic entity that does not conform to standard definitions of a firm or production entity. The literature has not been able to reconcile the econometric results of many studies with what is actually being observed in the banking world. This is not surprising, as standard econometric analyses require assumptions on the underlying distribution of the data. In practice, the underlying distribution is rarely, if ever, known.  Despite voluminous prior work in this area, none have sought to consolidate bank consolidation with risk management or estimating efficiency gains within an information theoretic approach. \nThese issues are addressed through three essays employing the Federal Reserve\u2019s Call Report Data.  The first essay focuses on the impact of banking policy legislation and reforms, bank specific profitability measures and the macroeconomic environment on the measurement and rate of US commercial bank consolidation. The modeling approach focuses on employing a Generalized Maximum Entropy (GME). \nThe second essay explicitly models both size and variance heterogeneity simultaneously. Since the one-sided error structure does not conform to standard distributional assumptions, we adopt a maximum entropy estimation procedure to estimate both cost frontier, as well as the second moments of the one-sided inefficiency term. We find that non-performing loans, federal insurance premium, legal expenses and director fees drive bank inefficiency as the bank becomes larger. Moral hazard, bank management and a \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d doctrine are likely explanations for the results we see.\nThe final essay is an initial study establishing a direct link between bank efficiency, mortgage-backed securities usage, and residential loan holdings and monitoring the quality of banks. This study calculates an efficiency measure of commercial bank efficiency in a multiple input and output framework and evaluates the effects of mortgage-backed securities, residential loans and monitoring indices on performance of commercial banks as measured by these efficiency indicators for states that have the highest level of bank capitalization.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3860], "author_name_tesi": "Balasubramanyan, Lakshmi ", "last_name_ssi": "Balasubramanyan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lakshmi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou", "Jeffrey Stokes", "James William Dunn", "N Edward Coulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Stokes, Committee Chair", "James William Dunn, Committee Member", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Productivity", "Commercial Banking"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Relevance of the Beautiful in Martin Heidegger", "id": "21069", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9426", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation attempts to elucidate the relevance of the beautiful in Western society today by appealing to Martin Heidegger's historical interrogation of the relationship between being, truth, and beauty. The motivation for this inquiry is two-fold. First, it departs from the characterization of beauty at present as a subjective and critically defunct value, noting that such a perspective is made problematic when one considers beauty's more universal status in mass culture. Second, it is observed that while Heidegger has often been recognized as one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century, his critique of Western aesthetics has prompted many critics to suggest that he is not a thinker of the beautiful. In response to these observations, I argue that Heidegger helps elucidate the deeper significance of beauty today by showing how it belongs to the illuminating and erotic experience of understanding.\n\nMore specifically, I contend that while Heidegger's philosophical project is typically understood in light of its interrogation of the question of being, this inquiry is situated in a wider retrieval of the early Greek and Christian unity of the Transcendentals - those basic concepts such as truth, beauty, and goodness that help support being\u2019s disclosure. In particular, through his reading of figures like Heraclitus, Sophocles, and Plato, Heidegger indicates that beauty belongs to the ancient Greek notion of al\u0113theia or unconcealment. For Heidegger, this broader notion of disclosure shows that beings do not simply lay around as already present entities or ideas, but come into being in generative events of understanding, events that erotically draw us into their claim and illuminate the world anew.\n\nIn considering the role of beauty in this experience more carefully, Heidegger suggests that it belongs to both the in-apparent generation of a given appearance, as well as the radiant quality of the resulting appearance. He argues, however, that this complex character of beauty is effaced in the ensuing Western tradition of aesthetics. For beginning with Plato, and continuing into modernity with figures like Kant and Hegel, beauty becomes associated simply with the sensuous world of appearances and the feeling that it produces in the human subject. This development comes to a head, however, in Heidegger's reading of Nietzsche and the will to power of modern technology. For Heidegger shows that it is precisely the historical development of the aesthetic interpretation of beauty that helps motivate the uncontrollable production of new forms and appearances today, and that threatens to turn natural and human life into aesthetic resources.\n\nOver against this dangerous consolidation of the aesthetic interpretation of beauty, I conclude by examining Heidegger's claim that a re-interrogation of art, and particularly of figures like H\u00f6lderlin, C\u00e9zanne, and Klee, may help show beauty's more originary unity with truth and being. Significantly, however, in this suggestion there is also a potential recovery of the good. For I propose that in the recognition of beauty's more significant role within the experience of understanding, there is the possibility for a more concerned attunement toward the various appeals made upon us by mass culture.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9220], "author_name_tesi": "Balay, Joey Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Balay", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Joey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Schmidt", "Leonard Richard Lawlor", "Veronique Marion Foti", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis Schmidt, Dissertation Advisor", "Leonard Richard Lawlor, Committee Member", "Veronique Marion Foti, Committee Member", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aesthetics", "Art", "Beauty", "Being", "Heidegger"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Effect of Dietary Interventions on Ruminal Biohydrogenation and Milk Fat Depression in Lactating Holstein Cows ", "id": "14044mzb228", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14044", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reduced milk fat still represents an issue on many dairy farms. Inhibition of milk fat synthesis is normally caused by bioactive trans fatty acids (FA) formed during ruminal biohydrohenation (BH), and this condition is called BH-induced milk fat depression (MFD). Contemporary lactating diets rich in corn feeds increase risk of BH-induced MFD. This may be because corn is rich in linoleic acid (LA), the parent compound for the formation of trans FA the cause MFD. This dissertation first demonstrates that considerable variation in LA concentration exists amongst commercially available corn hybrids. The variation was mainly attributed to hybrid and selection should focus on LA as a percentage of total FA, as this trait was not correlated with other nutrients important to the cow. Secondly, it was demonstrated that MFD is a multifactorial condition and that important interactions exist between dietary risk factors, individual cow effects, and feed additives. Supplementation with the methionine analog 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoate (HMTBa) maintained higher milk fat when high producing cows received diets with increased risk of BH-induced MFD. Low producing cows did not undergo MFD, nor did their milk fat respond to HMTBa supplementation. Thirdly, it was demonstrated that an in vivo BH assay utilizing a perturbation tracee approach performed by bolusing FA through the rumen cannula was appropriate to assess the rate and extent of ruminal unsaturated FA BH as well as flux through specific BH pathways. Lastly, decreased BH-induced MFD with HMTBa supplementation was replicated and using the in vivo assay developed it was shown that the mechanism by which HMTBa prevents ruminal formation of bioactive trans FA is, at least in part, due to increased BH capacity. In conclusion, this dissertation presented opportunities to combat MFD by selection of corn hybrids low in LA and supplementation with HMTBa. Additionally, this work sets the framework for further research on milk fat by presenting an experimental design that efficiently investigates the interactions between risk factors and a novel in vivo assay appropriate to study ruminal BH.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13823], "author_name_tesi": "Baldin, Michel ", "last_name_ssi": "Baldin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Michel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin J.

While soil water retention has been widely studied, a catchment-wide characterization of soil water retention parameters has not yet been commonly done.  In this study, I report the spatial patterns of soil water retention parameters, obtained through in situ monitoring data, as a function of soil type, landform unit, and soil depth in the forested Shale Hills catchment in central Pennsylvania.  Soil water matric potential and volumetric moisture content were collected in 2005-2010 at 61 sites throughout the catchment and at depths of 10, 20, 40, 80, and 100 cm.  These data were fitted with the van Genucthen, Campbell, and Gardner soil water retention equations.   Parameters from these curves were then analyzed in connection to soil-terrain attributes.  Based on various statistical analyses, topographic wetness index, depth to bedrock, and curvature were found to have significant influence on soil water retention parameters across this catchment.    \nThe spatial relationship of the van Genuchten parameters across the catchment at 10, 20, 40, 80 and 100 cm depths were quantitatively analyzed and compared.  An increase in spatial variance from near surface 20 cm to the deeper 80 cm was evident in saturated moisture content as the semi-variogram range increased from 14.3 meters to 31.2 meters.  Moisture retention parameters were estimated across the catchment at all available depths with regression kriging using Bayesian statistics to optimize spatial model parameters.  These maps would be used to inform hydrologic modeling and ecological studies for the Shale Hills catchment.   \nA foundation for delineating functional units of the catchment with similar hydrological, pedogenic, and topographic properties (called Hydropedological Functional Units or HFUs) was established in this study through analyzing:  1) soil moisture profile storage maps spanning 2008 through 2010, 2) catchment-wide eletromagnatic induction surveys from wet and dry seasons, 3) maps of topographic variables, and 4) landscape-scale soil retention parameters and other basic soil properties. Five apparent HFUs were identified based on the spatially and temporally extensive datasets: 1) Regression-kriged maps of depth to bedrock and solum total moisture storage at saturation were used in a combined principal component and fuzzy c-means clustering to quantitatively delineate three hillslope HFUs; and 2) Two additional HFUs were delineated using slope value, elevation, and upslope contributing area.  Total five HFUs were then compared with soil series map and landform units delineated using Park and vande Giesen\u2019s method (2004).  All three delineation methods were compared with observed soil moisture data.  Results showed that the HFUs out-performed the soil series map and the landform units in depicting soil solum moisture storage in general linear models.  \nThis study shows that catchment-wide characterization of saturated moisture content can be integrated with topography and depth to bedrock to delineate Hydropedological Functional Units. Delineated HFUs generally predict soil moisture patterns more accurately than soil series and landform units.  This research confirms that the delineation of sub-catchment units with soil depth, topographic variables, and soil properties can sufficiently separate a catchment into units with similar topography, soil properties, and hydrologic functions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1335], "author_name_tesi": "Baldwin, Douglas  C", "last_name_ssi": "Baldwin", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry Lin", "Hangsheng Lin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry Lin, Thesis Advisor", "Hangsheng Lin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["soil water retention", "functional units", "catchment-scale"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "IMPROVING ESTIMATES OF ROOT ZONE SOIL MOISTURE TO UNDERSTAND ECOSYSTEM DROUGHT SENSITIVITY", "id": "1j92g7448", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12868", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Extreme droughts can drastically inhibit the growth of terrestrial forest ecosystems, limiting their ability to assimilate and sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, an important ecosystem service.  Temperate forests in particular are an important component of Earth\u2019s terrestrial carbon \u2018sink,\u2019 but ecosystem carbon (C) flux monitoring since the 1990s shows that C uptake in temperate forests is more vulnerable to drought than previously estimated.  Climate models typically project that drought events will become more frequent and intense across temperate regions in coming decades.  As a result, soil moisture is an increasingly crucial variable to monitor for diagnosing and forecasting drought occurrence and severity.  Advancements in satellite technology now facilitate more precise and accurate daily retrievals of global near-surface soil moisture content but satellite data must be downscaled to finer resolutions before it can be used in hydrologic models to estimate subsurface root zone soil moisture content over broad spatial extents.  This dissertation explores how a combination of ground based measurements, satellite data, and hydrologic modeling can be used to generate high-resolution predictions of root zone soil moisture content.  Root zone soil moisture observations are also used to evaluate the sensitivity of temperate forest growth, estimated by eddy flux towers, to drought in multiple locations in northern temperate forests in the United States.   \n\tThe opening chapter reviews research that connects root zone soil moisture to plant water stress and the development of hydrologic models that estimate root zone soil moisture across large areas using satellite soil moisture data.  Chapter two demonstrates how an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation algorithm can be integrated with a physically based hydrologic model that predicts root zone soil moisture with satellite data.  This model system can produce root zone soil moisture predictions close to observed in situ measurements.  The model is also rigorously tested in a \u2018perfect model test\u2019 experiment before its application with in situ data.  The spatial extension of this model from point locations to a watershed-scale gridded surface was developed and tested with field observations at the Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (Chapter 3).  The integration of a distance decay function with distance metrics calculated with high resolution LiDAR data into the algorithm approximated a spatial pattern of root zone soil moisture content that was comparable with the geostastical regression kriging approach.  Ecosystem C flux modeling in Chapter 4 identifies potential critical points where temperate forests may become net carbon sources in high growth conditions under a range of temperate and root zone soil moisture states.  There is evidence that soil physical properties and hydric regime (i.e., percentage of wetlands) influence these critical points.\n\tThis dissertation uncovers new research challenges associated with large-scale root zone soil moisture mapping and drought limitations on temperate forest growth.  Soil survey and terrain data are crucial for high precision estimation of satellite soil moisture, but the classification of soil-landscape units and subsequent root zone soil moisture mapping at other watersheds and regions should be investigated.  The analysis in Chapter 4 shows that relatively old temperate forests with coarse textured soils can be sensitive to drought, but growth rates can also drop exponentially in relatively young forests beyond a temperature and root zone soil moisture threshold.  This analysis should be extended to other temperate forests to gain a greater understanding of their drought limitations, which can then be used to improve C sequestration processes in global carbon cycling models. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12240], "author_name_tesi": "Baldwin, Douglas  C", "last_name_ssi": "Baldwin", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Erica A H Smithwick", "Erica A H Smithwick", "Alan MacEachren", "Kenneth Davis", "Klaus Keller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Erica A H Smithwick, Dissertation Advisor", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Chair", "Alan MacEachren, Committee Member", "Kenneth Davis, Committee Member", "Klaus Keller, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Soil moisture", "Bayesian", "MCMC", "Root zone", "Remote sensing", "Kalman filter", "Drought", "Carbon"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Narrative Rehabilitation: Disability and Ideology in Mid-Nineteenth-Century Fiction", "id": "14664emb257", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14664", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation identifies a pattern of engagement with rehabilitative discourse in the novels of mid-nineteenth-century authors.

Data from the magnetometer evinces a highly disordered, non-repeatable domain wall interaction potential, which we determine to be a result of an elastic stretching mode of domain wall motion.

We then take higher resolution data of the stretching mode specifically, and use it to extract domain wall pinning site strength, energy, and density.  We also observe much higher domain wall mobility in the stretching mode than has been previously measured at larger domain wall displacements, a property which may be useful for future spin based device applications.

A leader\u2019s direct ties are important determinants of team task performance and subordinate satisfaction. These ties can be with the subordinates, the leader\u2019s manager, or to other employees. \nTo investigate the relationships between the leader\u2019s social network and team task performance, I studied multiple work groups in India and the United States of America. All these work groups were composed of educated knowledge workers who were co-located with their leaders. In total, I surveyed 363 respondents belonging to 69 teams to collect data concerning social networks, satisfaction with team leaders and other variables. Further, data about team task performance were gathered by surveying the team leaders\u2019 supervisors. Fifteen of the teams were based in the U.S.A with the remaining 54 based in India. \nFindings revealed that high performing teams have leaders who play a brokerage role in the team, bridging across disconnects between people. Alternatively, high-performing team leaders are connected to the informal team leaders in the advice network. The results do not support the notion that the leader\u2019s prominence in the team advice network is associated with team performance. The results also do not show that leaders connected via the advice network to organizational boundary spanners are more productive. Similarly, I did not find support for the hypothesis that leaders who were disliked by their subordinates tended to receive lower performance ratings from their supervisors. However, the results do highlight the importance of a leader\u2019s advice tie to the leader\u2019s supervisor. A leader who was sought for advice by the leader\u2019s own supervisor tended to have teams who were satisfied with the leader.

The approaches are based on a perturbative technique which uses estimates of horizontal wave numbers to determine sound speed profiles.  This technique is appropriate for the highly variable shallow-water environment as horizontal wave numbers can be measured semi-locally (1-2 km aperture) and their values are a direct measurement of the local environmental properties.  In all previous applications of this technique, this inversion scheme has been used to estimate sound speed in the seabed at a number of discrete depths while assuming water column properties are known.\n\nCompared to past applications of perturbative inversion, the accuracy of the solution is improved by implementing more suitable constraints to address issues of stability and uniqueness associated with solving the ill-posed inverse problem.  One such improvement uses qualitative regularization which allows for discontinuities in the sediment sound speed profile to be resolved.  The resulting solution is a more accurate representation of the layered structure of the seabed.  Another advancement makes reliable inversion for water column properties possible.  This is accomplished using approximate equality constraints to address the solution's instability in portions of the waveguide for which the wave number data are insensitive.  A further enhancement uses a synthesis of qualitative regularization and approximate equality constraints to provide a mechanism to efficiently invert for sediment and water column sound speed profiles simultaneously.

Variations in patient response and toxicities have been observed; however, no underlying cause has been identified for these differences. A mechanism that could be responsible for the observed differences is altered drug metabolism. A major mode of SAHA metabolism is by glucuronidation via the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family of enzymes. \n\nThe UGT superfamily of enzymes catalyzes the glucuronidation of a variety of endogenous compounds such as bilirubin and steroid hormones, as well as xenobiotics such as drugs and environmental carcinogens. These enzymes are located in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells and make xenobiotics and endogenous compounds more water soluble through their conjugation to glucuronic acid in a reaction with the hydrophilic co-substrate, UDPGA. This conjugation alters the biological properties of the compound to enhance its excretion in the urine or bile and typically converts substrates into products that are less pharmacologically active. These enzymes have been associated with altered drug metabolism and correlated with patient response and toxicity. \n\nThe primary goals of this thesis include: identification of the UGTs responsible for SAHA glucuronidation, characterization of the UGTs that are most active against SAHA, in vitro studies of UGT genotype/SAHA glucuronidation phenotype association, and characterization of the promoter region of the UGT1A10 gene. To identify and characterize the UGTs active against SAHA, homogenates from UGT-overexpressing HEK293 cell lines were used. The hepatic UGTs 2B17 and 1A9 and the extra-hepatic UGTs 1A8 and 1A10 exhibited the highest overall activity against SAHA as determined by Vmax/KM (16\u00b16.5, 7.1\u00b12.2, 33\u00b16.3, and 24\u00b12.4 nL.min-1.mg UGT protein-1, respectively), with UGT2B17 exhibiting the lowest KM (300 &#956;M) for SAHA of any UGT in vitro. While the UGT1A8p.Ala173Gly variant exhibited a 3-fold (P<0.005) decrease in glucuronidation activity for SAHA as compared to wild-type UGT1A8, the UGT1A8p.Cys277Tyr variant exhibited no detectable glucuronidation activity; a similar lack of detectable glucuronidation activity was observed for the UGT1A10p.Gly139Lys variant. To analyze the effects of the UGT2B17 gene deletion variant (UGT2B17*2) on SAHA glucuronidation phenotype, human liver microsomes (HLM) were analyzed for glucuronidation activity against SAHA as well as for UGT2B17 genotype. HLM from subjects homozygous for UGT2B17*2 exhibited a 45% (P<0.01) decrease in SAHA glucuronidation activity and a 75% (P<0.002) increase in KM for SAHA as compared to the HLMs from subjects homozygous for the wild-type UGT2B17*1 allele. Further stratification of the HLM glucuronidation data by gender, identified a significant difference in SAHA glucuronidation between males and females, with females having significantly less glucuronidation. Characterization of the promoter of one of the most active glucuronidators of SAHA, UGT1A10, led to the identification of a novel deletion which was able to cause differential induction of luciferase reporter activity in colon derived cell lines. These data suggested that tissue specific regulation of UGTs may ultimately determine glucuronidation levels in specific tissues. Overall, these results suggest that several UGTs play important roles in the metabolism of SAHA and that females and UGT2B17-null males could potentially exhibit altered SAHA clearance rates and differences in overall response to the drug.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5240], "author_name_tesi": "Balliet, Renee Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Balliet", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Renee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip Lazarus", "Philip Lazarus", "Laura Carrel", "Lisa M Shantz", "Christopher Herzog"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Philip Lazarus, Dissertation Advisor", "Philip Lazarus, Committee Chair", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member", "Christopher Herzog, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["SAHA", "pharmacogenetic", "UGT"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Motivated by Grace?

A latin square of order $n$ is an $n\\times n$ array consisting of $n$ distinct symbols such that each of $n$ symbols occurs precisely once in each row and column. Two latin squares are said to be orthogonal if no two cells contain the same ordered pair of symbols when the squares are superimposed. There are many generalizations of latin squares, and in these generalizations there is a natural notion of orthogonality. In particular, we can view a latin square as a coloring of a graph. We say that two colorings of a graph are orthogonal if, whenever two vertices share a color in one coloring, then they have a different color in the other coloring.\n\nIt is well known that there cannot be more than $n-1$ pairwise orthogonal latin squares of order $n$. Given a graph, $G$, we seek a bound on the maximum size of a set of pairwise orthogonal colorings of $G$. We derive several upper bounds based on parameters of the graph such as the number of vertices and edges, the maximum degree of a vertex, or the existence of large cliques. As a consequence we establish upper bounds on the maximum cardinality of a set of pairwise orthogonal colorings for several latin structures including latin rectangles, row latin squares, single diagonal latin squares, and double diagonal latin squares. We show that these bounds are the best possible.\n\nQuestions about the extendability of latin squares are related to obtaining a latin square from a partially filled latin square. A partial latin square of order $n$ is an $n\\times n$ array consisting of $n$ symbols such that each of $n$ symbols occurs at most once in each row and column. It is an NP-complete problem to determine whether a partial latin square can be completed to a latin square of the same order. In 1974 Alan Cruse derived necessary and sufficient conditions to extend a partial latin rectangle to a latin square. Here we provide an alternate proof of Cruse's Theorem. Then we use the tools of this new and different proof to prove an analogous theorem for frequency squares. A frequency square of type $F(n;\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_k)$ is an $n\\times n$ array filled with $k$ symbols if the symbol $i$ occurs in each row and column precisely $\\lambda_i$ times. \n\nA partial transversal of size $r$ in a latin square is a set of $r$ cells representing distinct rows, columns, and symbols. We show that the questions of orthogonality and extendability overlap with the question of the existence of a (partial) transversal of latin squares.  The problem of finding a (partial) transversal in a latin square can be recast in terms of extending portions of a latin square or in terms of the parameters of the graph obtained from a coloring that defines the latin square. We extend the well known conjectures of Bualdi and Ryser on the existence of (partial) transversals and propose a few tools for tackling these conjectures.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7043], "author_name_tesi": "Ballif, Serge Chadwick", "last_name_ssi": "Ballif", "middle_name_ssi": "Chadwick", "first_name_ssi": "Serge", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Lee Mullen", "Gary Lee Mullen", "James Allen Sellers", "Woodrow Dale Brownawell", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Lee Mullen, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary Lee Mullen, Committee Chair", "James Allen Sellers, Committee Member", "Woodrow Dale Brownawell, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["orthogonal latin squares", "graph coloring", "latin square extension problem", "transversals"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Development and Evaluation of a Self-Study Process for Critical Friends Groups", "id": "7757", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1751", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     This study explores the development and evaluation of a reflective tool and process to support critical friends groups (CFGs) in a self-study.

This dissertation examines these topics by analyzing spontaneous conversational data consisting of sociolinguistic interviews with New Mexican Spanish-English bilinguals. The measure of phonetic interaction is voice onset time (VOT) realization of /ptk/ in Spanish and English.\n\nThe first study tests the hypothesis that code-switching results in increased phonetic interaction between languages by utilizing a novel measure, time elapsed from code- switching. In the study, the average VOT duration values in New Mexican bilingual Spanish fall within the range typical of non-contact varieties, while VOT in New Mexican bilingual English displays overall lower values compared to non-contact varieties. This asymmetry is repeated when the effect of the distance from code-switching is considered. In Spanish, code-switching has no observable effect on VOT duration values. In English, close proximity to code-switching (within 2.5 seconds) is associated with a significant reduction in VOT duration. Additionally, English VOT values, but not Spanish ones, are shorter for New Mexican bilinguals who self-report slightly higher Spanish proficiency. This finding highlights the importance that small variations in language background and experience can have on bilingual phonetics. While the findings on code-switching distance do not establish switching as a causal mechanism of long- term phonological convergence, they would be consistent with such a hypothesis. Importantly, unlike the convergence hypothesized for morpho-syntax in US Spanish varieties, it appears that English, not Spanish, phonetics are affected by code-switching.\n\nThe second study tests the hypothesis that cognate words, which overlap in form and meaning across a bilingual\u2019s two languages, lead to increased language interaction that is reflected in phonetic realization. Cognate and non-cognate words beginning with /ptk/ are compared in Spanish and English in the same New Mexican bilingual speakers. While in the aggregate, cognate status shows a small impact on VOT duration values in New Mexican Spanish only, the effect is not significant. However, in Spanish, cognate words are impacted by the presence of code-switching within the same Intonational Unit (IU), while non-cognates are not. Specifically, Spanish cognates display increased VOT duration (in the direction of English) when code-switching is present. In both Spanish and English, background factors such as context of acquisition and self-rating impact cognates, but of the non-cognates, only English non-cognates are affected by Spanish rating. These findings suggest that cognate status becomes important in the context of code-switching in spontaneous speech, and that cognates may be differentially impacted by individual speakers\u2019 background traits compared to non-cognates.\n\nFinally, the observation that code-switching impacts VOT duration in New Mexican bilinguals\u2019 English only, while cognate status impacts the same measure in New Mexican bilinguals\u2019 Spanish only, suggests that the precise mechanisms of cross-language interaction in each of these bilingual phenomena may differ.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9954], "author_name_tesi": "Balukas, Colleen Patricia", "last_name_ssi": "Balukas", "middle_name_ssi": "Patricia", "first_name_ssi": "Colleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rena Torres Cacoullos", "Rena Torres Cacoullos", "John Lipski", "Marianna Nadeu", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "Eleonora Rossi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rena Torres Cacoullos, Dissertation Advisor", "Rena Torres Cacoullos, Committee Chair", "John Lipski, Committee Member", "Marianna Nadeu, Committee Member", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member", "Eleonora Rossi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bilingualism", "code-switching", "phonetics", "phonology", "language contact", "Spanish", "English"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "An investigation into the methods to facilitate understanding of the use of energy simulation program by architects in the early design stage ", "id": "9493", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5775", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Energy modeling or simulation is the practice of using computerized simulation programs to model the energy and environmental performance of an entire building or the systems within a building.

Although attendance is necessary for curriculum uptake, it is not sufficient; beyond attendance, engagement during each program session is important for each participant to achieve outcomes. We examine whether engagement systematically changes over the course of an intervention and examine the role of parent and family characteristics to predict level and change in engagement over the seven sessions of this intervention. Methods: 309 parents provided information on all predictor variables and were randomized to the Strengthening Families Program: For Parents and Youth Ages 10-14 (SFP) and a modified version of the curriculum. Engagement ratings were made by group leaders for each parent at each session he/she attended. Results: We find that engagement in SFP begins high, and changes over time with a linear increase and quadratic leveling-off. Parents experiencing different versions of the SFP curriculum demonstrated different linear increases in engagement. Parents with higher levels of family tension responded to higher-than-usual family tension differently than parents with lower levels of family tension. As indicated by the significant random effects, parents varied in their initial levels of engagement, the relation between family tension and engagement was different across parents, groups of parents who participated together varied in initial levels of engagement, and the linear and quadratic change in engagement differed across groups. Conclusion: Engagement is a dynamic construct that should be rated at each session for each parent in the context of other interventions in order to capture its dynamics. Future work on engagement should recognize that groups of parents may differ in their engagement trajectories, with parents in the same group having more similar trajectories, and individual parents may differ in their trajectories of engagement. Specific to SFP, efforts to maximize each parents\u2019 engagement should focus on reducing family tension during tense sessions for parents whose families experience high levels of tension, and should focus on initial sessions where engagement is lower, on average.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8490], "author_name_tesi": "Bamberger, Katharine Theresa", "last_name_ssi": "Bamberger", "middle_name_ssi": "Theresa", "first_name_ssi": "Katharine", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["J Douglas Coatsworth, Ph D", "Gregory M Fosco"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["J Douglas Coatsworth, Ph D, Thesis Advisor", "Gregory M Fosco, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["participant engagement", "quality of participation", "implementation", "growth curve", "multi-level model", "group delivery"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "How Interventions Work for Families: Parents' change processes in a family prevention program", "id": "28662", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12298", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Interventions designed to produce positive changes in parents and families usually test change with assessments at baseline and post intervention. However, the relatively long intervals between baseline and post intervention make detection of mechanisms of change difficult and miss the micro timescale trajectory of change. This dissertation consists of three interrelated studies focusing on more frequent assessment during this period of change.\nStudy I used data from the Strengthening Families in Pennsylvania Project (SFP in PA), an RCT of the Strengthening Families Program (SFP 10-14). Study I aimed to elucidate whether mothers\u2019 attendance and engagement in the intervention, assessed weekly, predicted their post-intervention benefit. Results showed no significant effect of mothers\u2019 attendance or engagement on their program benefit and this did not vary by fathers\u2019 attendance. Future research should use more thorough measures of parents\u2019 daily engagement with more immediate measures of change to better understand how parents influence this change process.\nStudy II presents a rationale for using intensive longitudinal methods (ILM) in the evaluation of family interventions. ILM are assessment protocols with rapid in situ measurement that capture aspects of participants\u2019 daily lives and momentary experiences. ILM are sensitive to micro timescale change and provide valid assessments of momentary experiential constructs. Thus, ILM are particularly suited to investigating patterns and processes of change as well as interaction-level or daily-level family functioning outcomes. Study II suggests future research questions that can be informed by ILM.\nStudy III examined the trajectories of micro timescale change in parents\u2019 outcomes for a subset of parents in the SFP in PA trial. Parents completed daily assessments of mindful parenting and affective quality of the parent-youth relationship throughout the intervention. Using heterogeneous variance multi-level models, Study III tests two hypotheses: incremental increase in functioning, indicating behavior change, and increased day-to-day variability, indicating disruption in homeostasis of the family system, for parents experiencing more exposure to intervention sessions (i.e., attendance). Affective quality showed evidence of both patterns of change for more-exposed parents.

The prediction model is an essential element in a holistic management program used to manage the vast network of existing pipeline infrastructure system.\nThe research was conducted using the commercial finite element program, ABAQUS. In the program, the user subroutine, UMAT, was developed to take into consideration the material properties of pipe-soil system. The developed UMAT was validated using available database. The numerical analysis was performed for various environmental conditions including different backfill materials and native soils, groundwater table, loading types, and nonuniform support conditions due to presence of void around the pipes.\nResults of analysis provided soil pressure distributions along pipe periphery, hoop stress, thrust, and internal moment in the pipe wall, and cracking behavior under various environmental conditions. From these data, the performance of buried concrete pipe was evaluated. Based on the results of analysis, conclusions in terms of serviceability of buried concrete pipes are drawn. Among the more notable conclusions are (1) pipes embedded in silty clay trench material surrounded by a native sandy soil will last longer than pipes in other materials, while other influence factors being constant; (2) pipes under uniform surface loading will have shorter service life than under longitudinal and transverse loading of the same intensity; (3) submergence of pipes in groundwater will shorten service life; (4) presence of void around pipes will reduce service life; (5) voids at lower haunch area have greater effect on pipe service life than voids at invert. This finding emphasizes the importance of compaction at lower haunch area during pipe installation. Along with these conclusions, recommendations were made. An important recommendation is that field testing is essential for validating the developed prediction model. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2372], "author_name_tesi": "Ban, Hoki ", "last_name_ssi": "Ban", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hoki", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mian C Wang", "Derek Elsworth", "Andrew Scanlon", "Sunil K Sinha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mian C Wang, Committee Chair", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Andrew Scanlon, Committee Member", "Sunil K Sinha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cracking behavior", "concrete pipe", "soil pressure"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Tin Sulfide Phase Exploration: Dependence of Optoelectronic Properties on Microstructural Growth and Chemical Variations in Thin Film Material", "id": "26291", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11402", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Herzenbergite tin (II) monosulfide (alpha-SnS) is of growing interest as a photovoltaic material because of its interesting optoelectronic properties and Earth abundance. It has several stable phases due to the dual valency of tin. As a layered material, alpha-SnS has the ability to form varying microstructure with differing properties.  For this dissertation, films were RF sputtered from a SnS and SnS2 target to produce films with varying microstructure. Growth of high energy phases including beta-SnS and amorphous SnS2 were possible through sputtering. Films of mixed or strained phase resulted from both targets. Pure phase alpha-SnS was made by annealing amorphous SnS2 films. Microstructure was measured using grazing incidence XRD and field emission SEM. The impact of microstructure was seen for both optical and electronic properties. Films were evaluated using spectroscopic ellipsometry as well as unpolarized UV-Vis transmission and reflection measurements. Optical modeling of the films is sufficient for developing models corresponding to specific microstructure, enabling it to be an inexpensive tool for studying the material. Absorption coefficient and band gap were also derived for these films. Films deposited with the SnS target had resistivity values up to 20,000 Ohm-cm.  Annealing of amorphous films deposited from the SnS$_2$ target resulted in alpha-SnS films with much lower resistivity (<50 Ohm-cm) values. This method for producing alpha-SnS offered better control of the phase, microstructure and therefore optoelectronic properties. While SnS films made from either target were typically p-type, sputtering of the SnS2 target with substrate heating resulted in n-type SnSx of a potentially new phase similar to SnS2 but with a 2:3 tin-to-sulfur ratio. Resistivity of those films typically ranged from 1 to 40 Ohm-cm. Both p- and n-type films made from the SnS2 target had high carrier concentration of 10$^17 to 10^20 cm^-3, but films had low Hall mobility such that conductivity type was not determined.

Previous work in geographical analogs either only computed on numeric information, or manually considered qualitative information.  Current and emerging technologies, such as electronic document collections, the Internet, and the Semantic Web, make it possible for people and organizations to store millions of books and articles, share them with the world, or even author some themselves.  The amount of electronic and online content is expanding at an exponential speed.  Analysts are increasingly overwhelmed by the sheer volumes of accessible information.  The dissertation explores techniques from knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence,  information sciences, linguistics and cognitive science, and proposes a novel, automatic methodology that computes on  online/offline textual information, and graphically and statistically combines the results  with those of numeric methods.  \nU.S. cities with populations larger than 25,000 people are selected as a test case.  Places are evaluated based on their numeric characteristics in the County and City Data Book and qualitative characteristics from Wikipedia entries.  The dissertation recommends a way to convert Wikipedia entries into the Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontologies, which computer algorithms can read, understand and compute.  The dissertation initially experiments with Mitra and Wiederhold\u2019s semantic measure to quantify similarity between places in the qualitative space.  Many shortfalls are identified, and a series of experimental enhancements are explored.  The experiments demonstrate that good semantic measures should employ a comprehensive stop-words list and a complete, but succinct vocabulary.  A semantic measure that can recognize synonyms must understand the intended senses of words in a place description.  Furthermore, analysts need to be careful with two styles of descriptions:  descriptions of places that are (1) created by following a template, or (2) laden with statistical statements can result in falsely high similarity between the places.\nIt is illustrated that scatter plots of numeric similarity scores versus semantic similarity scores can effectively help analysts consider similarity between places in two-space.

Two basic motility patterns (modes) exist to control these transport phenomena: propulsive wave-like propagations  peristalsis) for axial transport, and rhythmic contractions of short segments of the gut segmentation) for radial transport to the surface for absorption. Once nutrients are advected to the  surface, however, they must diffuse through a low-velocity fluid layer known as the \u201cunstirred (water) layer (UL).\u201d The thickness of this layer has been reported up to ~1000 (micro)m, which, however, is physiologically unrealistic. More realistic studies have reported thicknesses of less than 50(micro)m, suggesting that a \u201chighly efficient stirring mechanism\u201d may be present in vivo to produce such small UL thicknesses.\nWe hypothesize that finger-like projections (villi) on the intestinal surface, under active muscular control, generate a \u201cmicro-mixing-layer (MML)\u201d which, when coupled with macro-scale mixing, can provide highly efficient stirring. We develop a physiologically accurate computational model to investigate the hypothesis. We use the lattice Boltzmann framework (LBM) to predict fluid and scalar motions, with moving boundary conditions, and zero-passive-scalar concentration at the epithelial surface to model rapid nutrient\nabsorption. Using simpler gut models of flow generated by peristaltic and segmental motility\n(developed to establish technology needed for the combined multi-scale model), we show that the fluid mechanics-driven absorption dynamics of the small intestine is much more complex and interesting than has been previously reported. Contrary to common wisdom, over the physiological range of occlusion ratios (Rmin/Ravg, where Rmin and Ravg are minimum and average radius, respectively), both peristalsis and segmentation significantly promote nutrient absorption. Segmentation has long been associated with the absorption process, but peristalsis has been generally explained as only necessary for axial transport. We show that the propulsive mechanisms generated by peristalsis for axial transport also create high nutrient gradients near the surface. These nutrient gradients lead to absorption\ncharacteristics of peristaltic motility that can be comparable to, or even exceed those of\nsegmental motility. However, we also show that to maximize absorption while minimizing the power required by the muscle contractions necessary for gut motility, segmentation is optimal over the range of physiologically relevant occlusion ratios. A three-dimensional, multi-scale lattice Boltzmann model was developed to study the\neffects of coupled macro-scale deformations and pendular villous motility on absorption. We\nshow that active movements of the villi can enhance absorption by ~25% beyond passive villous movements induced by macro-scale motility patterns alone. Increasing the length or the frequency of oscillation enhances the effect. Consistent with the findings of our simplified 2D and 3D villous motility models, we show that the presence of coordinated counter-oscillating groups of villi is a key mechanism in generation of the MML, and\nsignificantly promotes absorption. Azimuthally moving counter-oscillating groups of villi\nprovide the most advantageous absorption characteristics. Because the azimuthal movements are perpendicular to the fluid patterns induced by the macro-scale motility, the interaction produces 3D fluid motions that further enhance mixing and increase the absorption in the gut.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2026], "author_name_tesi": "Banco, Gino G.", "last_name_ssi": "Banco", "middle_name_ssi": "G.", "first_name_ssi": "Gino", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Gordon Brasseur", "James Gordon Brasseur", "Keefe B Manning", "Eric M Mockensturm", "James S Ultman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Gordon Brasseur, Dissertation Advisor", "James Gordon Brasseur, Committee Chair", "Keefe B Manning, Committee Member", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member", "James S Ultman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fluid dynamics", "fluid mechanics", "small intestine", "lattice boltzmann", "computational fluid dynamics (cfd)"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ONLINE LIVESTREAM CAMERA CALIBRATION FROM CROWD SCENE VIDEOS", "id": "14820aib5487", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14820", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary goal of this work is to analyze crowd scene videos to perform camera calibration using a data-driven method.

Several scholars have argued that heritage tourism may be important in creating national identity. As ethnically diverse societies have the tendency for fragmentation, heritage tourism has arguably emerged as a privileged tool for states to disseminate a shared cultural identity with their citizens. The increasing popularity of heritage creates conflicts over its representation. So, there are disputes\nover whose heritage should be preserved and made available for touristic consumption. Thus, heritage tourism is highly political in which dominant narratives of history, culture and identity are always disputed.\nSince India\u2019s independence in 1947 from Britain, the Governments of the country have tried to build a sense of \u2018nation\u2019 by uniting the diverse groups of the country. However, identity in India has centered around smaller groups based on religion, culture and language, of which, religion is the most prominent. Although several\nscholars have claimed that the representation of heritage encompasses several agents who interact to co-construct a representation of the past, with a few valuable exceptions, scholars have only considered one voice in investigations of tourism representations. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore: 1) What heritage\nof six major religions (i.e., Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Jain) in India\nis represented to domestic tourists by the three Indian tourism representations (i.e.,\nIndian Government, Indian Trade, and Indian Public)? and 2) What are the differences,\nif they exist? A three year time frame from March 2002 \u2013 June 2005 was selected for\nthis study. The data were examined using content analysis.\nThe study produced several insights into how tourism is interconnected with\nsocio-political dynamics governing India\u2019s contemporary state and society. There were\nfour similarities in the three representations. First, all representations celebrated India\u2019s\nglorious past as a Hindu \u201cGolden Age.\u201d Second, the blend of different religions was heavily emphasized. Third, all representations portrayed the suffering from Muslim tyranny. Fourth, all representations highlighted atrocities of Colonial rulers. However, there was one difference in the three representations. The Indian Government resisted the Colonial influence but the other two representations did not. The Indian Government and Indian Tourism Industry harmoniously represented the heritage of India. As there was no significant difference in the three representations, it can be argued that the mythmaking by the Indian Government promotes dominant nationalist ideologies, which are well accepted by the tourism industry that needs these myths to sell heritage attractions. This study revealed that the Indian government\u2019s\nefforts to build an Indian national identity are inextricably linked to a Hindu national identity. Thus, it can be argued that political identity building in the name of religion is\nmore important in India than national identity building.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5429], "author_name_tesi": "Bandyopadhyay, Ranjan ", "last_name_ssi": "Bandyopadhyay", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ranjan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Leisure Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Garry Chick", "Dr Duarte B Morais", "Dr Harry Zinn", "Jeffrey Cohen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Garry Chick, Committee Chair", "Dr Duarte B Morais, Committee Member", "Dr Harry Zinn, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Cohen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["India", "national identity", "heritage tourism", "politics of representation"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Essays in Applied Microeconomic Theory\n", "id": "6120", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5918", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nEssay 1: Endogenous Market Thickness and Honesty: A Quality Trap Model.\nIn this essay I use a dynamic framework to study the problems facing emerging or transition economies in which institutional arrangements (like ISO certification) to credibly signal product quality are absent. I use a two-sided asymmetric information model to analyze this where a seller's discount factor and a buyer's valuation for quality are private information. Sellers face a tradeoff between producing high quality which gives low one period profits but increases survival in the market for future periods and low quality which gives higher one period returns but bars the seller from future market activity. Hence, a seller's choice is based on expected present and future demand. However, demand itself is endogenous and depends on expected quality. Hence, market thickness (buyer-seller ratio), product quality and the distribution of seller types get endogenously determined and multiple steady states may emerge. I find that a sufficient number of sellers need to be patient or profits from investing in high quality must exceed a cutoff value for multiple steady states to exist. With endogenous prices, at least one type of buyer is left with no surplus. Prices also play a role in equilibrium selection. Introducing technology involving 'learning by doing' may cause market segregation. Importantly, expectations about market thickness in determining quality matter only if sellers believe that market thickness will be less than one.\nEssay 2: Party Formation and Coalitional Bargaining in a Model of Proportional Representation. (with Mandar P.Oak)\nWe study a game theoretic model of a parliamentary democracy under proportional representation. In our model, 'citizen candidates' form parties prior to the election, voting takes place and then governments are formed. If no single party has an absolute majority, coalition governments may emerge and we study the underlying coalition building process. The type of government that is formed in equilibrium depends on the parties' seat shares, the size of the rents that ruling parties can extract from holding office and their ideologies. We show that, depending on the relative magnitudes of these factors, a variety of coalition governments may result. Coalitions may be minimal; each member of the coalition is necessary to retain the majority or may contain some redundant parties. Moreover, coalitions may be comprised of parties that are not adjacent in terms of their ideology, that is, there may be a coalition government made up of leftists and rightists from which centrists are excluded. We then look at how the outcomes of the coalition formation game affect the incentives for voter groups to strategically form parties. We compare the results of party formation under proportional representation with that under the plurality rule. We show, in particular, that Duverger's hypothesis that proportional representation leads to more political competition than does the plurality rule may not hold. Our model explains the diversity of electoral outcomes observed empirically under proportional representation and also contributes to the literature on political competition by integrating models of political entry with models of coalitional bargaining\nEssay 3 : When neighbours report crime: Effects of incentives for crime reporting on crime rates.\nWe examine the incentives for people to report crime in their immediate vicinity using a framework where only immediate neighbours can observe crime, crime affects the immediate neighbours, and reporting crime is a costly activity. As a result, each citizen would rather have her neighbour do the reporting. Ceteris paribus, an increase in the number of complaints erodes the effectiveness of the police force. Being investigated is also costly to the non-criminals since they have to put up with unpleasant police interrogation. Police choose a level of (costly) effort which determines, for a given number of reports, its success in apprehending criminals and also affects the crime rate. If the cost of interrogation is not too high, multiple equilibria are possible, there are equilibria involving reports only by neighbours of criminals and criminals themselves and there are equilibria in which everyone makes reports regardless of their identity. Moreover, increasing the incentives to report could increase equilibrium crime rates. Hence, from a policy perspective increasing incentives for neighbours to report suspicious activities may prove to be counterproductive.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5912], "author_name_tesi": "Bandyopadhyay, Siddhartha ", "last_name_ssi": "Bandyopadhyay", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Siddhartha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Tomas Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m", "William Graham Bond", "Susanna Esteban", "Abdullah Yavas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Tomas Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Committee Chair", "William Graham Bond, Committee Member", "Susanna Esteban, Committee Member", "Abdullah Yavas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["crime reporting", "coalitions", "product quality"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Interfacial Chemistry of Organic Materials on Commercial Glass Surfaces", "id": "23310", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10562", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The hydrolytic stability of glass is dependent on its composition. Glasses are exposed to water during their processing and in many applications; therefore, their surface or interface with other materials must withstand hydrolytic attack. Multi-component silicate glasses are widely used but have been the least studied. In coatings-based applications, these glasses come in contact with organosilanes and organic molecules where the adsorption may be affected by surface water. For example, the influence of glass composition on the wet strength of a glass/polymer composite material is unclear, but it is presumed to be driven by the hydrolytic stability of the interfacial chemistry. Organosilanes are critical for increasing the performance of composite materials in humid environments but the precise manner by which the improvement occurs has not been verified. The current school of thought is that the application of silane coatings on a multi-component glass surface transforms the chemically heterogeneous surface into a homogenous and hydrolytically stable surface.\n\nIn this study, multi-component silicate glass surfaces were silanized by both aqueous and non-aqueous methods. The effect of glass composition and surface hydration on silane coverage was quantified by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The monolayer-level adsorption results showed that the low-sodium content glasses had greater coverage than a high-sodium content glass in dry conditions in contrast to an equivalent coverage in wet conditions. The hydrolytically-stable coverage on multi-component silicate glass surfaces by both silanization methods was found to be sub-monolayer.\n\nA thin film model in conjunction with XPS and Infrared Spectroscopy was used to probe the interfacial region of a fiberglass insulation material containing a sodium-rich multi-component silicate glass and an acrylate resin binder. Upon the application of the aqueous binder, the leaching of sodium from the glass promoted the formation of sodium carboxylate salts that were found to be detrimental to the hydrolytic stability of the interfacial region. The silanization of the glass improved the hydrolytic stability of the interfacial region by the mitigation of sodium carboxylate salt formation.

Numerous policy measures have been implemented on these private properties to arrest this degradation. These policies include both economic and non-economic instruments which instruct landowners to change their land uses such that it is beneficial for the protection of ES.  The subject matter of this dissertation deals with economic instruments for ES conservation. The key feature of these instruments is that they pay landowners for adopting prescribed pro-conservation land uses on their properties. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is an example of one such economic conservation policy implemented by the USDA.  Of these economic payment schemes, of particular interest are those which include market based instruments such as uniform rate payment schemes and auction based schemes. The term Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes is commonly used for these schemes. \n\nPES schemes can be employed to attain different conservation goals. This dissertation is focused on the study of PES schemes that incentivize landowners to produce spatial patters of conservation land uses on their properties. This objective is not trivial as often degraded habitats exist across multiple property boundaries. Creation of these patterns will require the cooperation of neighboring property owners. The Agglomeration Bonus (AB) subsidy scheme has been proposed in the economic literature on PES schemes to achieve this spatial objective. It is a simple two-component payment scheme that can incentivize spatially coordinated land management by neighboring landowners and hence is ecologically effective. \n\nThe ecological effectiveness of the scheme suffers in agricultural landscapes where participants are not certain about their neighbors' conservation attitudes and hence their commitment to participate in the conservation programs. These uncertainties discourage spatially coordinated participation. The first essay in this dissertation initiates an experimental examination of spatial coordination under the AB scheme in a new network setting in the presence of these participation doubts. The experimental methodology provides the means to test the performance of the scheme in big and small networks. For the experiments the AB is structured as a spatial coordination game with subjects arranged around a circular grid whose size varies across experimental sessions. On this grid every subject can coordinate with the same number of neighbors whose identity is different for different individuals. This type of strategic environment is novel to the study of the AB and provides insights that are useful for policy implementation. In line with past experimental predictions spatially coordinated land management is found to be tougher in bigger groups than in smaller ones. This is the key result of the study. When participation in the conservation scheme is characterized by doubts about conservation attitudes, then instances of coordination failure will be much higher within a large group of landowners than a smaller group even if the number of neighbors of the landowners is the same. The second finding from the experiments is that while spatial coordination is tougher in bigger groups, localized spatial patterns appear on the circular landscape indicating partial policy success. \n\nThe second essay in this research presents the structure of a reverse auction for the procurement of spatially coordinated pro-conservation land uses from neighboring landowners. The study of auctions is especially important to the economic performance of PES schemes as these schemes are limited by a fixed budget from which landowner payments have to be made. Thus environmental benefits from spatially coordinated land uses should be procured at the lowest possible cost. Auctions are a popular mechanism to address this cost efficiency objective especially because the conservation agency does not have information about landowners\u2019 costs. The second essay presents the structure of a simple iterative descending price auction with full information feedback about results that is designed to select bids from spatially adjacent landowners. The auction structure employs a benefit-cost ratio scoring metric like the CRP to evaluate different combinations of bids to make a final selection. Lab experiments are conducted to test the performance of the auction in settings which vary on the basis of the information available to subjects as well as the cost-benefit parameters associated with the projects for which bids are submitted in the auction. The experimental data provides insights about the ecological effectiveness and economic efficiency of the iterative auction. The chief result of the study is that the ecological effectiveness in the presence of information about the spatial goal is not significantly different from when this information is not present. However cost efficiency of the mechanism is significantly different. Thus when subjects know that their bids relative to their neighbors\u2019 bids influence their chances of winning, they submit higher bids. This implies that in the presence of information, procurement of the same amount of environmental benefits is costlier. Since the PES budgets are limited, increase in the costs of conservation indicates a reduction in cost efficiency of the mechanism. The study also provides an analysis of bidding behavior of subjects in the final iteration of the auction. This analysis is relevant to the study of rent seeking in conservation auctions  as well as to highlight the difference in bidding behavior of the winners and losers in the auction. \n\nOverall the objective of this dissertation is to address both economic efficiency and ecological effectiveness of PES schemes when spatial patterns of land uses are important for ES conservation. The results of this study have consequence for the performance of PES schemes on real landscapes with landowners who have various economic characteristics. It also presents the need for more research on both auctions and subsidies for spatially coordinated land management. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5918], "author_name_tesi": "Banerjee, Simanti ", "last_name_ssi": "Banerjee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Simanti", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle", "James Samuel Shortle", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica", "Edward C Jaenicke", "Robert P Brooks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle, Dissertation Advisor", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Chair", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Chair", "Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Member", "Robert P Brooks, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spatial", "Ecosystem Services", "Experimental Economics"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "REDIRECTING PHOSPHOLIPID BIOSYNTHESIS TO THE REPLICATION ORGANELLE OF AN RNA VIRUS", "id": "14617sxb1004", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14617", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "        Positive-strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes in tight association with the host membranes. These virus-induced structures have been referred to as the \u201creplication complex\u201d or \u201creplication organelles\u201d. To this date, all the reviews on RNA virus replication organelles/ complexes describe the virus-induced ultrastructures visible in an infected cell as the virus replication sites. This study identifies the existence of two spatiotemporally distinct organelles during the virus infection cycle. The replication organelles appear early during infection prior to the onset of viral genome replication and are demarcated by PI4P-enriched membranes. The organelles that appear later during infection are closely related to the traditional vesicular cluster. The temporal appearance of these organelles do not match the kinetics of RNA synthesis, and a defect in their formation correlates with a defect in virus production, indicating that these late organelles might function as assembly organelles. We suggest that virus-induced membrane remodeling is a dynamic process, where the early replication organelles morph into the late assembly organelles. The P3 protein, 3CD, dictates the dynamics and pace of this morphogenesis.\n\tIt is becoming increasingly clear that RNA viruses hijack cellular lipid biosynthetic pathways to create membranes with lipid composition distinct from any found in uninfected cells.  Presumably, these virus-induced membranes are essential for structure, function and/or dynamics of the replication organelle.  Picornavirus replication sites are enriched with PI4P and the kinase that generates this phosphoinositide. We have used poliovirus (PV) as our model system to elucidate mechanisms that lead to induction of phosphatidylinositiol-4-phosphate (PI4P).  It is well known that PI4P induction by poliovirus requires the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, PI4KIII\u03b2.  Many studies have debated the process by which PI4KIII\u03b2 is recruited to membranes in picornavirus-infected cells, leading to conclusions that stray from the known cellular pathway.  Our study shows that expression of PV 3CD is sufficient to induce PI4P.  We have exploited this observation to interrogate the mechanism of 3CD-dependent PI4P synthesis.  We find that 3CD hijacks the cellular pathway.  3CD protein uses its 3D-encoded PI4P-binding activity to bind to PI4P-containing membranes.  3CD facilitates the recruitment of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GBF1, to the membrane.  GBF1 causes exchange of GDP for GTP in the Arf1 GTPase.  In a second 3CD-dependent step that requires the 3C domain, PI4P is produced.  This step may be the recruitment of PI4KIII\u03b2. Furthermore, we show that 3CD is capable of upregulating the synthesis of two other phospholipids namely, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) via mechanisms that are independent of PI4P induction. In summary, this study presents 3CD as a modulator of three distinct phospholipids.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15522], "author_name_tesi": "Banerjee, Sravani ", "last_name_ssi": "Banerjee", "first_name_ssi": "Sravani", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig E.

We consider the impact of a single soft error on the widely used preconditioned conjugate gradient method (PCG), an important kernel in such scientific simulations.  We first show that a single error in PCG can propagate through a sequence of sparse matrix vector multiplication (SpMV) operations that form the core computations in PCG. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single soft error in PCG can lead to performance degradation by factors of 200 or more. Next, we consider the Community Earth System Model (CESM), an extensively used coupled climate model that allows simulation of the earth's climate system. Our experimental results indicate that although the soft errors cause variations in the output of the models, these variations are within the allowable range of perturbations. However, the models are not robust enough and fail upon soft errors in the pointer data structures. These results indicate the need for further study of the impact of soft errors on scientific simulations and the need to develop methods for detection and mitigation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6046], "author_name_tesi": "Bangalore Srinivasmurthy, Sowmyalatha ", "last_name_ssi": "Bangalore Srinivasmurthy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sowmyalatha", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Padma Raghavan", "Padma Raghavan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Padma Raghavan, Thesis Advisor", "Padma Raghavan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sparse matrix", "iterative linear solvers", "soft error"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF FAMILY SUPPORT AND CAREGIVING", "id": "x059c7329", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12801", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Both in the anticipation and in the context of age-related decline, elderly adults depend on family members for emotional, social, and practical support.

This dissertation seeks to utilize a novel scaffold synthesis technique to examine the synergy of scaffold geometry, fiber alignment and diameter, improved interface design, and mechanical stimulation to better understand the tendon cell niche.\n\nWith the number of people requiring treatment for tendon, ligaments, or joint capsule injuries increasing each year, the poor healing capability of tendons, the significant pain and dysfunction associated with tendon injuries, and revision surgeries required due to failed tendon replacements, an improved graft option is necessary.  To begin to address and understand this issue, a hierarchical approach was developed\u2014nano:micro:macro.

The present study aims to examine possible predictors of Whites\u2019 enjoyment of stereotype entertainment when Black and Whites are the target. According to disposition theory, this study argued that negative attitudes towards Blacks through the lens of White racial superiority would predict greater enjoyment of Black disparagement. As a competing hypothesis, distinctiveness theory would imply that White audiences may be more likely to report enjoyment of stereotype, regardless of the target. However, these findings are argued to be influenced by a contemporary form of racism, aversive racism, such that in the case that audiences enjoy Neutral or White stereotype more than Black stereotype, this could be explained by higher motivations to control prejudice reactions.  Consistent with similar research, findings reveal no significant effects of sense of racial superiority. However, Whites\u2019 perceived cultural competence emerged as an important indicator of enjoyment of Black entertainment. Findings suggest that viewers who are low in cultural competence experience less positive affect when exposed to stereotype, and more strongly prefer entertainment devoid of stereotype than those with a higher sense of cultural competence. While preferences for neutral clips were significantly greater than preferences for Black and White stereotype, motivations to control prejudice reactions did not emerge as a significant predictor of this relationship.

In order to more accurately depict the daily stress process, perception of control over specific stressors is an important factor to include in conjunction with trait measure of control.  The present research consists of three papers investigating event-specific control in the stress process and one potential biomarker of stress, salivary cortisol.  Participants for all three studies come from the initial set of respondents participating in the second wave of the National Study of Daily Experiences (NSDE, N = 1,265).  Participants for the NSDE come from a subsample of the National Survey of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS II).\n\t\nThe first paper examines daily variation in event-specific control (ESC) and how it is associated with trait measures of control.  Results indicated more within-person variation in ESC than between-person variation. The second study is a methodological paper focused on salivary cortisol, a hormone known to be a specific physiological outcome of interest in the stress process.  The discussion centers on challenges researchers face when collecting salivary cortisol in large field studies where researchers have no face-to-face interaction with participants and the resultant implications on the validity of measured salivary cortisol diurnal rhythm parameters.  Study three combines findings from papers one and two to investigate the predictive nature of event-specific control on salivary cortisol.  Results indicate that ESC is a significant predictor of the daily decline slope of salivary cortisol and that this relationship is moderated by age.

Retroviruses encode a very limited genome and the most simple retroviruses carry out all of the functions needed to replicate using only three proteins: Gag, the viral structural protein that orchestrates the assembly of nascent virus particles using the genomic RNA as a scaffold; Pol, the reverse transcriptase and integrase; and Env, the envelope glycoprotein that studs the outside of virus particles.  Because retroviruses encode such a limited genome, they are dependent on host factors to mediate or facilitate many aspects of the virus life cycle including transcription of viral RNAs, assembly of nascent particles, and targeting viral proteins to the plasma membrane where budding occurs.  However, the host factors involved in many aspects of retrovirus replication are poorly characterized.  Our goal was to understand the intracellular trafficking pathways of retroviral Gag and RNA during the late (post-integration) phase of replication to identify cellular factors implicated in genome encapsidation, particle assembly, and plasma membrane localization of Gag.\n\tAfter integration, full-length retroviral RNA is transcribed by cellular machinery and exported from the nucleus.  This full-length RNA serves two roles in retroviral replication, acting as an mRNA to direct the translation of the Gag, Gag-Pro, and Gag-Pro-Pol structural proteins, and as a genomic RNA (gRNA), which is encapsidated into nascet virus particles.  The requirement for retroviruses to efficiently assemble virus particles suggests that a mechanism exists to separate full-length RNA to be used for translation from identical RNA molecules destined for encapsidation.  However, the mechanisms that retroviruses use to separate RNA molecules destined for these two fates have remained an enigma.  We hypothesized that cellular RNA-binding proteins interact with the viral RNA and/or Gag to target a population of viral RNA for encapsidation.\n\tTo test this hypothesis, we chose mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) as a model system.  MMTV assembles complete, immature capsids in the cytoplasm, so we reasoned that sites of capsid assembly might also be the location where Gag first interacts with the viral genome.  Therefore, by studying cellular factors associated with these sites of assembly, we could gain insight into cellular proteins that target viral RNA for encapsidation.  As part of an unbiased screen to identify cellular proteins that interact with MMTV Gag, we identified ribosomal protein, large 9 (RPL9) as a Gag-interacting partner.  A single RPL9 protein is present in each large ribosomal subunit and, strikingly, overexpression of RPL9 induced the accumulation of Gag and RPL9 in nucleoli where ribosome subunit assembly occurs.  Furthermore, Gag interacted with RPL9 in nucleoli and under steady state conditions we identified a population of Gag within nucleoli.  Depletion of extraribosomal RPL9 using siRNA resulted in decreased MMTV virus production, suggesting that Gag interacts with RPL9 in the nucleolus to facilitate virus production.  Although the mechanism by which RPL9 influences virus production is not known, because RPL9 is an RNA-binding protein one possibility is that RPL9 interacts with Gag to help Gag identify viral genomes for encapsidation.\n\tSeveral other cellular proteins have also been reported to facilitate encapsidation of viral RNAs and assembly of virus particles.  For example, the Gag protein and genomic RNA of the yeast Ty3 retrotransposon, which follows an assembly pathway similar to MMTV, interact with a conserved set of cellular mRNA-binding proteins associated with stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs) to facilitate Ty3 replication.  These observations led us to conduct parallel experiments in MMTV to test whether SG and PB proteins also influenced MMTV particle assembly.  We found that specific SG- and PB-associated proteins colocalized with MMTV Gag in the cytoplasm in translationally-repressed complexes.  Furthermore, a subset of these proteins interacted with MMTV Gag through an RNA-dependent mechanism and colocalized with a subviral RNA reporter.  To our surprise, the viral RNA appeared to recruit SG-associated proteins and Gag into complexes, suggesting that SG and/or PB proteins may bind the viral RNA and serve as a \u201clandmark\u201d used by Gag to identify viral RNAs for encapsidation.  Indeed, reducing the expression of specific SG or PB-associated proteins using siRNAs resulted in decreased virus production, indicating that SG- and PB-associated proteins play an essential role in efficient virus production.  Together, these data led to a model where SG- and/or PB-associated proteins repress the translation of a portion of viral RNA, thereby targeting this RNA for encapsidation.\n\tAfter selecting a genome for encapsidation all retroviral Gag proteins must traffic to the plasma membrane to bud from the host cell as a virus particle.  Gag proteins of many retroviruses recognize the plasma membrane by the presence of the plasma membrane-specific phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2].  The Gag protein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) transiently traffics through the nucleus and then, in contrast to MMTV, localizes predominantly to the plasma membrane, which serves as the site of virus particle assembly.  However, previous reports indicated that RSV Gag localized to the plasma membrane through a PI(4,5)P2-independent mechanism.  By contrast, we found that enzymatic depletion of PI(4,5)P2 caused the mis-localization of RSV Gag from the plasma membrane to an intracellular compartment.  Strikingly, we found that mutants of RSV Gag deficient in nuclear trafficking were also less sensitive to the depletion of PI(4,5)P2, suggesting a previously unknown role of nuclear membrane-free PI(4,5)P2 in RSV replication.  Together, these data shed light on novel ways in which retroviruses interact with cellular proteins to locate the viral genome, assemble virus particles, and achieve plasma membrane localization required for budding.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8639], "author_name_tesi": "Bann, Darrin V", "last_name_ssi": "Bann", "middle_name_ssi": "V", "first_name_ssi": "Darrin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leslie Joan Parent", "Leslie Joan Parent", "Sarah Bronson", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "Jeffery Thomas Sample", "David Joseph Spector"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leslie Joan Parent, Dissertation Advisor", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Chair", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Member", "Jeffery Thomas Sample, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Retrovirus assembly", "RNA trafficking", "Live-cell imaging", "Mouse mammary tumor virus", "Rous sarcoma virus", "Virus-cell interactions"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "C*-algebras in Kirillov Theory", "id": "26712", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11848", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, I study connections between C*-algebra theory and the representation theory of simply connected nilpotent Lie groups, specifically the Kirillov theory.

I formulate the conjecture that they are isomorphic, prove the conjecture in the case of Heisenberg group (which is the crucial building block for general nilpotent Lie groups) and examine the prospects for the conjecture in other cases.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11301], "author_name_tesi": "Bannangkoon, Pichkitti ", "last_name_ssi": "Bannangkoon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pichkitti", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nigel David Higson", "John Roe", "Nathanial Patrick Brown", "Martin Bojowald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nigel David Higson, Dissertation Advisor", "John Roe, Committee Member", "Nathanial Patrick Brown, Committee Member", "Martin Bojowald, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Kirillov theory", "C*-algebras", "unitary representations of nilpotent groups", "regular representation", "nilpotent Lie groups"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "CORRELATED-k METHOD FOR SOLVING ATOMIC RADIATION PROBLEM IN HYPERSONIC NONEQUILIBRIUM FLOWS\n\n", "id": "9878", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "566", "abstract_tesi": "Radiative heat loads from nonequilibrium shock-layer are of great concern in the design of modern spacecrafts. Simulation of shock-layer radiation requires accurate modeling of spectral absorption and emission coefficients of high-temperature  plasma, and solving the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) at thousands of wavelengths. Although the line-by-line solution of the RTE is very accurate, it is computationally very expensive to couple a line-by-line model with flow-solvers. This thesis discusses a full-spectrum k-distribution spectral model that allows efficient evaluation of radiative heat loads in a hot plasma dominated by radiation from the atomic species N and O. Application of the new spectral model to shock-layer plasma radiation is demonstrated by solving the radiation transfer equation along the Stardust stagnation-line flow-field. The full-spectrum k-distribution method is reasonably accurate compared to the line-by-line method. For more extreme gradients in species concentrations and temperature, k-distributions were found not to be correlated. Challenges posed by the extreme nonequilibrium gas conditions were overcome by sorting atomic lines into a number of nonoverlapping groups. The detailed methodology of the grouping scheme is presented. \n \n \n   Although the full-spectrum k-distribution approach make it possible to evaluate radiative fluxes at a fraction of the cost needed for line-by-line calculations, it is not very efficient to construct them from raw line-by-line absorption coefficient data. An accurate and compact narrow-band k-distribution database is developed for the lines of N and O. It was observed that the overlap between the two atomic species N and O is almost insignificant. This is a very important observation as it allowed databasing k-distributions from the two species independently. The database allows users to calculate desired full-spectrum k-distributions through look-up and interpolation. The accuracy of the database was tested by comparing narrow-band mean absorption coefficients and narrow-band emissivities with those obtained from line-by-line calculations.

The objective of this Dissertation is to collect state-of-the art spectroscopic data for the evaluation of spectral absorption and emission coefficients of atomic\nand molecular gases, develop efficient and accurate spectral models and databases, and\nstudy the effect of radiation on wall heat loads and flowfield around the spacecraft.\nThe most accurate simulation of radiative transport in the shock layer requires calculating\nthe gas properties at a large number of wavelengths and solving the Radiative\nTransfer Equation (RTE) in a line-by-line (LBL) fashion, which is prohibitively expensive\nfor coupled simulations. A number of k-distribution based spectral models are\ndeveloped for atomic lines, continuum and molecular bands that allow efficient evaluation\nof radiative properties and heat loads in hypersonic shock layer plasma. Molecular\nradiation poses very different challenges than atomic radiation. A molecular spectrum\nis governed by simultaneous electronic, vibrational and rotational transitions, making\nthe spectrum very strongly dependent on wavelength. In contrast to an atomic spectrum,\nwhere line wings play a major role in heat transfer, most of the heat transfer in\nmolecular spectra occurs near line centers. As the first step, k-distribution models are\ndeveloped separately for atomic and molecular species, taking advantage of the fact that\nin the Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atmosphere the radiative field is dominated by atomic species (N and O)\nand in Titan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Mars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 atmospheres molecular bands of CN and CO are dominant.\nThere are a number of practical applications where both atomic and molecular species\nare present, for example, the vacuum-ultra-violet spectrum during Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reentry conditions\nis marked by emission from atomic bound-bound lines and continuum and simultaneous\nabsorption by strong bands of N2. For such cases, a new model is developed for\nthe treatment of gas mixtures containing atomic lines, continuum and molecular bands.\nFull-spectrum k-distribution (FSK) method provides very accurate results compared\nto those obtained from the exact line-by-line method. For cases involving more extreme gradients in species concentrations and temperature, full-spectrum k-distribution model\nis relatively less accurate, and the method is refined by dividing the spectrum into a\nnumber of groups or scales, leading to the development of multi-scale models. The\ndetailed methodology of splitting the gas mixture into scales is presented. To utilize the\nfull potential of the k-distribution methods, pre-calculated values of k-distributions are\nstored in databases, which can later be interpolated at local flow conditions. Accurate\nand compact part-spectrum k-distribution databases are developed for atomic species\nand molecular bands. These databases allow users to calculate desired full-spectrum\nk-distributions through look-up and interpolation.\nApplication of the new spectral models and databases to shock layer plasma radiation\nis demonstrated by solving the radiative transfer equation along typical one-dimensional\nflowfields in Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Titan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Mars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 atmospheres. The k-distribution\nmethods are vastly more efficient than the line-by-line method. The efficiency of the\nmethod is compared with the line-by-line method by measuring computational times for\na number of test problems, showing typical reduction in computational time by a factor\nof more than 500 for property evaluation and a factor of about 32,000 for the solution of\nthe RTE.\nA large percentage of radiative energy emitted in the shock-layer is likely to escape\nthe region, resulting in cooling of the shock layer. This may change the flow parameters\nin the flowfield and, in turn, can affect radiative as well as convective heat loads.\nA new flow solver is constructed to simulate coupled hypersonic flow\u00e2\u20ac\u201cradiation over a\nreentry vehicle. The flow solver employs a number of existing schemes and tools available\nin OpenFOAM; along with a number of additional features for high temperature,\ncompressible and chemically reacting flows, and k-distribution models for radiative calculations.\nThe radiative transport is solved with the one-dimensional tangent slab and P1\nsolvers, and also with the two-dimensional P1 solver. The new solver is applied to simulate\nflow around an entry vehicle in Martian atmosphere. Results for uncoupled and\ncoupled flow\u00e2\u20ac\u201cradiation simulations are presented, highlighting the effects of radiative\ncooling on flowfield and wall fluxes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12771], "author_name_tesi": "Bansal, Ankit ", "last_name_ssi": "Bansal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ankit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael F.

Even though material constants for piezoelectric ceramics are for the most part described under free conditions, these measured properties are not legitimate specifically when devices work under externally applied high mechanical or electrical loads. The properties of these materials are liable to the conditions in which they are measured. In this way, an essential point of examination right now is the behavior of these ceramics under such external conditions. DC bias stress and electric field are of specific significance for study because the actuators and transducers are frequently utilized as a part of these conditions to balance out or improve the operation performance. Apart from working under externally applied loads, piezoelectric materials are utilized as a part of diverse high power applications, for example, ultrasonic motors and submerged sonar transducers. In these devices, the piezoelectric materials are driven under high voltages and currents. At high power conditions, the materials go astray from their linear constitutive conditions because of non-linearity and hysteresis in physical parameters. The hysteresis manifests in terms of loss and consequently, heat generation in piezoelectric materials. In this way, the properties must be measured in practically identical high power testing situations to accomplish significant estimations. Thus, investigation of the loss mechanisms is essential for the determination of heat generation.\nThis thesis means to illuminate the loss mechanisms in piezoelectric ceramics in the perspective of the late advancements in high power piezoelectric devices affected by externally applied DC bias field. Under a high mechanical excitation condition at the resonance of a piezoelectric specimen, measured by edge vibration velocity (RMS), the mechanical quality factor Qm degraded by 22% per 0.1 m/s of the vibration velocity increment for the soft PZT, while 17% per 0.1 m/s for the hard PZT under a DC bias field of 300 V/mm. However, it increased by 3.1% per 100 V/mm for the soft and 1.7% per 100 V/mm for the hard PZT with the applied positive DC bias field under a constant vibration velocity of 0.3 m/s. The high-power properties deviated significantly from the ones measured under low power conditions (15% increase in elastic compliance whereas Qm degraded by a factor of 2 under a DC bias field of 100 V/mm). Therefore, this study concludes that the deterioration of the mechanical quality factor Qm with an increase in vibration velocity can be recovered by externally applying positive DC bias field. The DC bias field 200 V/mm exhibits an almost equivalent \u201copposite\u201d change rate to the vibration velocity of 100 mm/sec.\nAlso, to investigate the loss mechanisms, the three losses (dielectric, elastic and piezoelectric losses) were determined under low and high power conditions. Mechanical loss tan \u03c6\u2019 displayed a change of 2.5% per 100V/mm for soft PZT and 1.1% per 100V/mm for the hard PZT, whereas the dielectric loss showed a change of nearly 1.5% per 100V/mm for soft PZT and 0.4% per 100V/mm for hard PZT. It is notable that the piezoelectric loss tan \u03b8\u2019 can be decreased most effectively under the positive DC bias field (3.1% per 100 V/mm for the soft PZT and 1.9% per 100 V/mm for the hard PZT), than the elastic or dielectric losses. Another noteworthy point is the two-step mechanism observed in hard PZT, a bend of the slope is observed in the elastic loss tan \u03c6\u2019 on the vibration velocity change, while a bend of the slope in the dielectric constant is observed on the DC bias field change. This may suggest a sort of threshold value in terms of mechanical stress or electrical field for stabilizing/unstabilizing the domain wall motions.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14834], "author_name_tesi": "Bansal, Anushka ", "last_name_ssi": "Bansal", "first_name_ssi": "Anushka", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Qiming Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino, Thesis Advisor", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Piezoelectrics", "DC Bias Field", "PZT", "High Power Characterization", "Losses in Piezoelectrics", "Burst Drive Method"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "CONDUCTING IN-SITU COMBUSTION TUBE EXPERIMENTS USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS", "id": "9104", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6733", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs), also known as expert systems, have become an increasingly important part of the petroleum industry for performance analysis of reservoirs. ANNs work similar to the biological brain which can make predictions based upon past experiences. ANNs used as a screening tool offer a low cost alternative to commercially available simulators that may require extensive data collection in order to build an effective model.  The ANN serves to pare down the analysis so that a more focused data set and corresponding model can be developed. This screening tool consists of data sets usually referred as knowledge base and set of algorithms capable of predicting fact based results for an unexposed part of the input data set.  \n\tArtificial neural networks are widely used in the optimization of the reservoir parameters.  These include operating conditions and reservoir performance, instantaneous and cumulative production, cyclic injection of fluids into the reservoir in order to maintain reservoir pressure for better recovery, field development and well stimulation, among others. The expert system developed during this research models in-situ combustion which is a technique utilized in heavy oil recovery. In in-situ combustion process oil is ignited in the porous matrix of the reservoir to improve the mobility of viscous oil using the heat generated. It is a complex process as the reaction parameters are unknown at the reservoir conditions, but the ANN is able to predict reliable results without a formal analysis of the mechanisms at work.\n\tThe ANN developed in this study is able to predict the cumulative production profile of oil, water and gas in a laboratory scale experiment utilizing the technique of in-situ combustion under simulated reservoir conditions.

However, because of their complex nature, it is uneconomical to produce from of these resources with the current state of technology. In addition, these resources are relatively new (from the development point of view), thus, it is difficult to completely characterize these resources in the absence of their respective analogs. This study focuses on tight oil reservoirs. Characterization of these resources is a complex problem as tight oil systems are discontinuous hydrocarbon sources. Developing these resources by identifying the location to drill, estimating well performance and suggesting a completion strategy will be a challenge in the absence of a representative reservoir model. \n\tAn inexpensive and field-deployable expert systems-based tool has been proposed in this study to characterize such unconventional reservoirs. A group of inter-assisting expert systems are developed, where the individual capabilities lie in suggesting completion parameters and predicting quarterly cumulative production of oil, water and gas for a two-year period. These expert systems are grouped together to suggest the best infill drilling location in the field with a forecast of their respective cumulative productions by the end of two years. The predictions from the expert systems-based tool are found to be in good agreement with field performance. Production surfaces generated by these expert systems are found to reflect the actual productions obtained in the field. In addition, a hybrid optimization method is also developed in this work. The method is used to optimize the well completion parameters in a tight oil reservoir. \n\tThe tools developed in this work will help in a quick evaluation of tight oil reservoirs.

With developing nations such as India and China increasing their need for energy, it has moved the energy issue to a front line topic.  The high cost of energy has started to hit home to many people with the recent increase in the cost of fossil fuels, specifically gasoline.  Gas prices have been steadily on the rise for the last decade.  Recently the environmental repercussions of the use of fossil fuels have been headlined in the media.  From the oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico to the mine collapses across the world the danger of going after these natural resources has become evident.  Global warming has also become an issue not only in the scientific community but also in the political.  With these factors in mind a search for a renewable source of energy has begun in earnest.  Renewable energy sources could help alleviate the worlds thirst for energy and reduce the emissions that contribute to global warming.\nSolar technology has been lauded as one of the renewable energy sources that has the most promise to contribute to the current energy crisis.  Solar energy has the potential to produce all the energy the world needs, however there are many issues to overcome.  Inorganic, primarily silicon, solar cells have been in use for decades at this time but are too expensive to effect the global market.  A current area of research interest is in the area of organic photovoltaics (OPVs).  OPVs show promise to have a lower cost than inorganic solar cells, however they currently suffer from very low efficiencies and lifetimes.  Current OPVs have too low efficiencies in order to be integrated into the energy production methods.  Research is being done in order to improve solar technologies in hopes to provide a significant amount of energy for the world.\nTwo of the issues involved in OPVs are charge carrier mobility and recombination.  This study focuses on these two issues using two complementary experiments.  First being the Charge Carrier Extraction by Linear Increasing Voltage (CELIV) experiment that allows for the determination of the mobile charge carriers present in the sample.  The complementary spectroscopic technique is a visible pump infrared probe transient experiment that allows for the determination of all the charge carriers present with a sample.  By examining these two techniques information can be drawn about the charge trapping that takes place with the system.  Understanding these issues are the first steps to overcoming them and bring forth OPVs as a viable energy source.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3479], "author_name_tesi": "Banyas, Kyle Mark", "last_name_ssi": "Banyas", "middle_name_ssi": "Mark", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John B Asbury", "John B Asbury", "John V Badding", "Mark Maroncelli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John B Asbury, Thesis Advisor", "John B Asbury, Thesis Advisor", "John V Badding, Thesis Advisor", "Mark Maroncelli, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CHARGE CARRIER RECOMBINATION", "CHARGE CARRIER TRAPPING", "ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAICS"]}]
