Changes in RNA structures have been shown to affect gene expression in all domains of life.  In plant systems survival is dependent on stress responses to changing environmental conditions, including drought stress.  Increases in ionic strength, K+, and osmolyte concentrations in response to stress affect RNA folding thus RNA structure that can refold under such conditions has the potential to have a regulatory effect.  The objective of this work is to investigate RNA folding in the model plant system Arabidopsis thaliana under normal and stress conditions and to evaluate the potential for RNA-mediated gene regulation using bioinformatics, biochemistry, and biology.\nG-quadruplex sequences (GQS), which require K+ for formation, have been shown to regulate gene expression in H. sapiens.  Using computational methods, I found that GQS of varying motifs are present in Arabidopsis thaliana and that the distribution of GQS varies with sequence motif.  Using a Markov modeled genome we determined that GQS with three G-tracts (G3) are significantly underrepresented in the genome.  Functional analysis was performed on GQS present in RNA indicated that GQS are overrepresented in genes encoding proteins of certain functional categories, including enzyme activity.  I also found that genes differentially regulated by drought were significantly more likely to contain a GQS.  Circular dichrosim (CD)-detected K+ titrations and UV thermal denaturation performed on representative RNAs verified that quadruplexes formed at physiological K+ concentrations. Results from this study indicate that GQS are present in unique locations in A. thaliana and that folding of RNA GQS may play important roles in regulating gene expression.  In vitro folding of GQS under normal and drought stress conditions was investigated using biochemical techniques.  We found that RNA GQS form with folding parameters that depend on loop length, sequence and G-tract length.  Folding parameters for RNA GQS were determined using CD-detected K+ titrations and indicated that RNA sequences with G3 had a modest dependence on K+ concentration and folded with negative cooperativity.  Native gel analysis and RNase T1 protection assays revealed that G3 GQS are associated with populated intermediate folding states.   GQS with two G-tracts (G2) had a steep K+ dependence, folded with a high cooperativity factor, and did not significantly populate intermediate states.  In a plant system under unstressed conditions, the more stable G3 sequences were predicted to fold, however the less stable G2 sequences were only predicted to have a favorable folding free energy at high K+ concentrations, which are found during drought stress.  GQS in the RNA have the potential to switch structure in response to high K+ conditions and thus regulate gene expression as a drought stress response.\nSome heavy metals, including Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe2+ are essential for plant metabolism and normal function; however they are toxic in high concentrations.  Heavy metal interactions with DNA GQS were monitored by CD.  Results from the analysis indicate that Cu2+ interacts with DNA GQS more strongly than other heavy metal ions and destroys the quadruplex structure.  Additionally, RT-PCR results indicated that expression of some copper transport genes that contain a GQS is up-regulated when in plants grown on Cu2+-supplemented media.  This response could be a mechanism to survive an excess of heavy metal ions in the local environment.\nFinally, a study of the structure of the 3\u2019UTR of the abscisic acid (ABA) catabolism gene CYP707A4, was conducted to characterize structure and potential binding interactions with ABA.  ABA, a plant hormone that mediates the drought stress response in Arabidopsis, increases in concentration to \u00b5M levels under drought stress.  The AU-rich 3\u2019UTR of CYP707A4 has an ion-dependent structure and undergoes an RNA refolding event with Mg2+ and K+, as determined using UV-detected thermal denaturation, CD, and hydroxyl radical footprinting.  Isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism, and equilibrium dialysis were used to test for ABA binding to the 3\u2019UTR of CYPY707A4.  Results from these techniques suggest at most a weak and non-specific interaction with ABA.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3948], "author_name_tesi": "Mullen, Melissa Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Mullen", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

In addition to employing molecules with tailored interactions, I exploited self- and directed assembly techniques to fabricate, to register, and to functionalize chemical surface structures at the supramolecular 1-50 nm scale.  In this dissertation, I describe how patterned self-assembled monolayers where specifically tuned molecules were designed, custom self-assembly processing techniques were utilized, and the resulting chemical surface structures were characterized on both the ensemble and the molecular scales. \n\nI enhanced microcontact printing, a common soft-lithographic technique, by printing onto preexisting monolayers with tailored intermolecular interactions and defects.  In microdisplacement printing, labile monolayers of 1-adamantanethiolate were used to prevent the lateral spreading of patterned surface features.  The 1-adamantanethiolate monolayers were displaced by other thiolated molecules in the stamped regions through competitive adsorption.  In microcontact insertion printing, 1-octanethiolate monolayers were employed as the preexisting monolayer, where patterned molecules insert into the defects of the 1-octanethiolate monolayer only in the stamped regions.  The extent of displacement and insertion were explored as a function of contact time, concentration of the patterned molecules, and quality of the preexisting monolayer.  Complex patterns were fabricated by multiple stamping steps of both microdisplacement printing and microcontact insertion printing.  \n\nI utilized the solution displacement of 1-adamantanethiolate self-assembled monolayers and selective electrochemical desorption to fabricate nanoscale-separated self-assembled monolayers not possible by other assembly methods.  The molecular structure and order of these monolayers were characterized at each processing step with scanning tunneling microscopy and cyclic voltammetry.  Differences in the electrochemical processed domains and preexisting domains were observed and attributed to the electrochemical processing of the Au substrates.  I extended this selective electrochemical desorption strategy to microdisplacement-patterned self-assembled monolayers and fabricated both chemical and metallic films.  The electrochemical blocking properties of 1-adamantanethiolate self-assembled monolayers were investigated and compared to the blocking properties of 1-dodecanethiolate self-assembled monolayers and unfunctionalized Au substrates.\n\nI investigated the dynamics and origins of solution-phase displacement of 1-adamantanethiolate self-assembled monolayers on Au{111} by 1-dodecanethiolate molecules on both the ensemble and molecular scales.  Employing scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry, I observed complete displacement of the preexisting 1-adamantanethiolate self-assembled monolayers by nucleation and growth, where each surface-analytical technique determined the fractional 1-dodecanethiolate coverage independently.  The energetics of both the Au-thiol density and the intermolecular interactions within the self-assembled monolayers involved in the displacement process, as well as the parameters that influence the dynamics of displacement were discussed.\n\nI utilized microcontact insertion printing to fabricate functional capture surfaces based on electrostatic interactions, biomolecular interactions, and DNA base pairs interactions.  Ionic capture surfaces were created to immobilize individual Ba^2+ ions on a surface without altering their electronic structure and were characterized with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  Small-molecule probe surfaces were fabricated by pattering precursor tether molecules and subsequently functionalizing them with serotonin and dopamine.  To determine their ability to be recognized by large biomolecules, these surfaces were exposed to primary and fluorescently-labeled secondary antibodies associated with the small-molecule probes and were characterized with brightfield fluorescence microscopy.  DNA surfaces were created by stamping single-stranded DNA molecules and hybridizing them with fluorescently-labeled complementary single-stranded DNA molecules.  These surfaces were characterized with brightfield fluorescence microscopy, confocal microscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy and were optimized by tailoring the intermolecular interactions and structures of the stamped molecules.\n\nAs our understanding and control of nanoscale self- and directed assembly increase, the stringency of the underlying patterning will diminish, enabling wider access to and larger utilization for a greater number of applications.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6185], "author_name_tesi": "Mullen III, Thomas Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Mullen III", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss", "Nicholas Winograd", "Anne M Andrews", "Vincent Henry Crespi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss, Committee Chair", "Nicholas Winograd, Committee Member", "Anne M Andrews, Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Self-Assembled Monolayer", "Chemical Patterning", "Microcontact Printing", "Scanning Tunneling Microscopy", "Alkanethiol"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Variation in Post Exposure Prophylaxis of Rabies in Patients Presenting with an Animal Exposure to the PennState Hershey Emergency Department", "id": "mw22v5449", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13010", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nRabies infection is caused by the RNA virus, Lyssavirus Rhabdoviridae. Rabies leads among infectious diseases in mortality by victimizing an estimated 40,000 \u2013 60,000 people globally every year. There is no standard protocol for patients presenting with an animal exposure and suspected rabies infection to the emergency department.  Routine treatment for animal bites includes cleaning and irrigation of the wound, debriding the wound, imaging for residual matter, and suturing followed by a tetanus booster and antibiotics. Rabies PEP is administered on a case-by-case basis. The Penn State Hershey Medical Center Emergency Department currently issues rabies post exposure prophylaxis at a rate of eleven times that of the national average of actual cases of rabies per year.  Few studies have been conducted regarding the variation among emergency medicine providers as compared to the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices. This study aims to detect variation between providers and their adherence to Advisory Committee Immunization Practice guidelines in patients presenting to the Penn State Hershey Medical Center Emergency Department for a complaint of an animal exposure between January 1, 2011 and January 1, 2016. Participant charts were reviewed and data was abstracted according to four collection instruments specific to patient demographics, the involved animal, wound care, and rabies post exposure prophylaxis compliance. The data was analyzed (n = 400) as a binary outcome variable and the probability of a \u201cyes\u201d event (provider adherence to the ACIP protocol) was estimated along with its 95% confidence interval. Of the 400 patients examined, providers disagreed with the ACIP directives at a rate of 13%, in which an important discrepancy was error in immunoglobulin dosage.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12564], "author_name_tesi": "Muller, Alison ", "last_name_ssi": "Muller", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alison", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vernon Michael Chinchilli", "Brian Jeremy Kipe", "Kristen H Kjerulff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vernon Michael Chinchilli, Thesis Advisor", "Brian Jeremy Kipe, Committee Member", "Kristen H Kjerulff, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rabies", "emergency medicine", "animal bite", "rabies post exposure prophylaxis", "Rabies Human Immunoglobulin"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "IDENTIFICATION OF FUNDAMENTAL DEFORMATION AND FAILURE MECHANISMS IN ARMOR CERAMICS", "id": "12395", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "286", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Indentation of a surface with a hard sphere can be used to examine micromechanical response of a wide range of materials and has been shown to generate loading conditions resembling early stages of ballistic impact events. Cracking morphologies also show similarities, particularly with formation of cone cracks at the contact site. The approach in this thesis is to use this indentation technique to characterize contact damage and deformation processes in armor ceramics, as well as identify the role of cone cracking and inelastic behavior. To accomplish these objectives, an instrumented indentation system was designed and fabricated, extending depth-sensing capabilities originally developed for nano-indentation to higher forces. This system is also equipped with an acoustic emission system to detect onset of cone cracking and subsequent failure. Once calibrated and verified the system was used to evaluate elastic modulus and cone crack initiation forces of two commercial float glasses. As-received air and tin surfaces of soda-lime-silica and borosilicate float glass were tested to determine differences in elastic and fracture behavior. Information obtained from load\u2013displacement curves and visual inspection of indentation sites were used to determine elastic modulus, and conditions for onset of cone cracking as a function of surface roughness. No difference in reduced modulus or cone cracking loads on as-received air and tin surfaces were observed. Abraded surfaces showed the tin surface to be slightly more resistant to cone cracking.\nA study focusing on the transition from elastic to inelastic deformation in two transparent fine-grained polycrystalline spinels with different grain sizes was then conducted. Congruent experiments included observations on evolution of damage, examinations of sub-surface damage and inspection of remnant surface profiles. Indentation stress\u2013strain behavior obtained from load\u2013displacement curves revealed a small difference in yielding and strain-hardening behavior given the significant grain size difference. Directly below the indentation sites, regions of grain boundary cracking, associated with the inelastic zone, were identified in both spinels. Comparison of Meyer hardness and in-situ hardness showed a discrepancy at low loads, a result of elastic recovery. Elastic-plastic indentation behavior of the two spinels was then compared to behavior of a transparent large-grained aluminum oxinitirde (AlON) and a small-grained sintered aluminum nitride (AlN). Subsurface indentation damage revealed transitions from intergranular to transgranular fracture in the two spinels, AlON showed a transition from multiple cleavage microcracks to transgranular fracture while AlN exhibited only intergranular fracture. Analysis of indentation stress-strain results showed a slight difference in yielding behaviors of the two spinels and AlON whereas AlN showed a much lower yield value comparatively. Slight differences in strain-hardening behavior were observed. When comparing indentation stress\u2013strain energy density and work of indentation a linear correlation was observed and a clear distinction could be made between materials. Therefore, it is suggested by the work in this thesis that instrumented spherical indentation could serve as a useful method of evaluating armor materials, particularly when behavior is described using indentation stress and strain, as this is a useful way to evaluate onset and development of inelastic deformation under high contact pressures and self-confining stresses. Additionally, it proposes that comparison of the work of indentation and indentation strain energy density approaches provide a good foundation for evaluating and comparing a materials penetration resistance. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [283], "author_name_tesi": "Muller, Andrea Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Muller", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Andrea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David John Green", "David John Green", "John Richard Hellmann Jr.", "Christopher L Muhlstein", "Albert Eliot Segall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David John Green, Dissertation Advisor", "David John Green, Committee Chair", "John Richard Hellmann Jr., Committee Member", "Christopher L Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spherical Indentation", "Ceramic Armor", "Spinel", "AlON", "AlN"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Interpretive Uncertainty and the Evaluation of Symbols and A Taxonomy of Symbol Evaluation Methods and Mobile Evaluation Tool", "id": "23626", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9901", "abstract_tesi": "From \"Interpretive Uncertainty and the Evaluation of Symbols and  A Taxonomy of Symbol Evaluation Methods and Mobile Evaluation Tool\": Uncertainty is a complex topic that affects data and those seeking to use data. This research explores a dimension of uncertainty often passed over in the geography and cartography literature; how uncertainty is introduced through the process of interpreting a symbol, referred to herein as \\textit{interpretive uncertainty}. This research is grounded in an extensive analysis of research questions and methods, to re-frame and relate existing research to interpretive uncertainty, with a specific focus on the point symbols. This analysis shows that questions asked in existing literature have some ties to interpretive uncertainty, but lack metrics to enable proper understanding. Two participant-reported metrics --- certainty and confidence --- are recommended for use in measuring interpretive uncertainty. The analysis also shows that the experimental methods used to evaluate map symbols are equally appropriate for evaluating interpretive uncertainty. Modifications to these methods are suggested for incorporating metrics that measure interpretive uncertainty as a component of more general symbol evaluations.\n\nFrom \"A Taxonomy of Symbol Evaluation Methods and Mobile Evaluation Tool\": Practicing cartographers are often limited in the time and resources available to evaluate the effectiveness of the symbols they design and use.

Because local SkBF responses can be modified by vasoactive neurotransmitters released from sensory nerves, changes in sensory nerve function in aged skin may contribute to alterations in local thermoregulatory and inflammatory SkBF responses in older individuals.  Capsaicin (CPZ) acutely stimulates and chronically desensitizes a specific population of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent (CSPA) sensory nerves in the skin, making it a useful pharmacological tool for investigating their function.  The purpose of this study was to examine age-specific CSPA function and determine the involvement of these nerves in the SkBF response to local heating of the skin.

The second part of the study consisted of two separate local heating protocols: 1) rapid heating in which local skin temperature (T<sub>loc</sub>) was raised from 33oC to 40oC over ~2 min and maintained at that Tloc for an additional 50 min and 2) a slow heating protocol in which Tloc was increased in a step-wise manner from 35oC to 42oC at a rate of 1oC/5 min and clamped at 42oC for an additional 30 min.  Both heating protocols were performed on control and CPZ pretreatment days, separated by one week of repeated topical capsaicin (RTC) applications.  RTC pretreatments were used to desensitize CSPAs in the skin so that their role in the SkBF response to local heating could be evaluated by comparing SkBF before and after desensitization.  SkBF was measured with a laser Doppler imager (LDI), utilizing multiple scans for the acute capsaicin and slow heating experiments, and a continuous single-point measurement for the rapid heating experiments.  Results were expressed as % of maximal cutaneous vascular conductance (%CVCmax) and % of area that was vasodilated (%AVD).  There was a significant (P < 0.001) age-specific difference in the CVC response to acute CPZ treatment.  In the older group, %CVCmax was less than half of that measured for the younger group at all concentrations of CPZ, with the most significant reduction (32.4 \u00b1 6.5 vs. 79.8 \u00b1 9.0 %CVCmax, P < 0.001) occurring at the 10.0% CPZ site.  This attenuated CVC in the older group was due to both a decreased %AVD (P < 0.001) and a decreased CVC within the area that was vasodilated (P < 0.001).   RTC caused a significant reduction in CVC compared to the control day in both the middle-aged and older groups (P < 0.05) during the slow heating protocol.  The decrease in SkBF in the middle-aged group was due to a reduced %AVD (P < 0.05), while in the older group, decreases in both %AVD and CVC within the vasodilated area (P < 0.05) were responsible for the attenuated response.  For the rapid heating protocol, RTC significantly reduced (53.9 \u00b1 4.4 vs. 74.4 \u00b1 7.4 %CVCmax, P < 0.05) the initial sensory nerve-mediated rise in SkBF only in the young group.  The attenuated neurogenic vasodilation due to acute capsaicin stimulation in older individuals suggests a reduced sensory nerve function in aged skin.  These results also indicate that CSPA activity contributes modestly to the overall SkBF response to local heating of the skin in an age- and temperature-specific manner.  Thus, capsaicin desensitization causes reductions in SkBF during local heating that is dependent upon the age-specific contribution of CPSAs to the overall response.  These findings suggest that there are age-specific differences in the ability of sensory nerves to modify local thermoregulatory and inflammatory SkBF responses in human skin.

Each open-pit mine is unique, based on the physical characteristics of the ore deposit and on the operational parameters of the extraction method; therefore, the most profitable way to exploit a mineral deposit requires considerable evaluation and planning. However, all operations share the same priorities, the maximization of the return on the investment and the maximization of the recovery of the resource. Both are linked to the optimization of profits, which in mineral operations is done by optimizing the ore cutoff grade, considering the block model geometry. \n\nThe Coriorcco Gold Project refers to an open-pit mining operation at pre-feasibility stage located at about 4100 meters above sea level in the Peruvian Andes. This mining project is currently owned by the company Management Environmental Solutions (MESSA) and is intended to begin operations before the year 2019. To have a better understanding of the project, a general description and a technical overview of the main parameters related to the development will be addressed, including, but not limited to:  the open-pit design, production rate, tailing facility construction, haul road construction, blasting design, and material handling equipment selection.\n\nThe present study is intended to develop the economic assessment and mine production optimization of the Coriorcco Gold Project, based on the iterative cutoff grade analysis approach. This approach represents a win-win situation for all major players in the mining industry. The company benefits from better economic results due to a 40.79% higher Net Present Value (NPV) and 24.5 % higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The government and nearby communities benefit from a smaller environmental and social impact, as an optimized cutoff grade reduces the mine life from 23.25 to 15.73 years, and therefore, the presence of the company in the region. \n\nFurthermore, the economic viability of the project will be thoroughly analyzed in distinct operational and economic scenarios. Three different sensitivity analysis regarding alternative values of processing capacities, gold prices and dilution rates will be evaluated.

The process is flexible enough to be used in a wide variety of cases with different constraints. Mission designers will be able to use this process to not only identify the most cost-efficient tracking methods for any particular mission, but also to learn about the characteristics of a cost-efficient solution.\nIn the process, complete tracking solutions are generated, tested, and compared. Tracking solutions combine a tracking schedule, defining when and for how long a spacecraft is tracked, and an antenna configuration, defining which antennas are used. A representation of tracking schedules is used that defines all schedules as a function of the number of tracking intervals and the grouping of these intervals into sets. This representation allowed a wide range of potential solutions to be tested while also being simple enough to offer easy identification of trends in the final data.\n\tThe process presented in this thesis consists of selecting a range of the variables defining each tracking solution, identifying constraints that limit the choices for these variables, and testing and comparing the efficiency of each of the available solutions. The tracking efficiency, a variable defined in this thesis, is used to compare the solutions. It is a measure of how well the observations of a tracking solution are converted to measurable decreases in the uncertainty in the estimate of the spacecraft\u2019s state. \nIn order to demonstrate the results of this process, a representative lunar trajectory is examined. This demonstration includes the selection of the range of independent variables to test, the specific parameters of the trajectory to be tested, and the simulator that will be used. Several cases, each with different constraints, will be considered in the demonstration.\nThe results of the process allow for quick identification of the most cost-efficient solution. They also show trends in the independent variables that show the sensitivity of cost-efficiency to each of the variables. These trends allow the mission designer to understand the trade-offs in their selection of the variables. By identifying these trends and patterns, more customizable searches can be used to obtain more specific results.

The World Health Organization\u2019s 2016 Global Report on Diabetes indicates that the number of people with diabetes is increasing dramatically, currently affecting an estimated 422 million people worldwide1.  The majority of individuals suffer from type 2 diabetes mellitus; insulin insensitivity is considered an early hallmark of type 2 diabetes, partly related to obesity but \uf062-cell function declines gradually over time already before the onset of clinical hyperglycemia.  Approximately 60-70% of individuals with diabetes experience some form of neuropathy.  A common manifestation of autonomic neuropathy includes disordered motility of the gastrointestinal (GI) system which is experienced by the majority of diabetic patients, and are often caused by intestinal motility abnormalities including esophageal dysmotility, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastric dysmotility, intestinal neuropathies which may cause constipation, obstipation, chronic diarrhea, and/or fecal incontinence, all of which may be the result of enteric neuropathies.\n\n\tThe NONcNZO10/LtJ (NONc10) mouse strain was utilized as a model of type 2 diabetes and to characterize changes in the enteric nervous system during the development of hyperglycemia and diabetes2. We also assessed whether the effects of obesity and hyperglycemia can be reversed in NONc10 diabetic mice utilizing a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) procedure.    \n\n\tThe effects of diabetes were assessed on the total number of myenteric neurons, using protein gene product 9.5 (PGP)-immunoreactivity (-IR) as a marker of all neurons, as well as on inhibitory nitrergic (NOS-IR) and excitatory cholinergic (ChAT-IR) myenteric neurons in the fundus, corpus, duodenum, ileum, and colon of NONc10 mice before (pre-transition), during (transition), and after (diabetic) development of diabetes (n=3-5 per time-point). \n\n\tNONc10 mice that were used for immunohistochemical studies and classified as diabetic increased in body mass controls (36\u00b10.6g vs 45\u00b12.4g vs 39\u00b10.9g for pre-transition vs transition vs diabetic, P<0.05) and blood glucose levels (144\u00b16.1mg/dl vs 220\u00b124.2mg/dl vs 388\u00b128.0mg/dl for pre-transition vs transition vs diabetic, P<0.05) relative to age-matched control mice, NONcNZO5/LtJ (NONc5). Diabetic NONc10 mice showed a decrease in number of PGP-IR myenteric neurons in the fundus, duodenum, ileum, and colon, and a trend towards a decrease in neuronal numbers even at the transition stage, when blood glucose levels first begin to increase. The number of NOS-IR neurons decreased in the fundus, duodenum, ileum, and colon in diabetic mice although the proportion of NOS-IR neurons was unaltered, suggesting a loss in nitrergic neurons. This decrease in NOS-IR was observable in the duodenum and ileum even as mice transitioned towards the development of diabetes; since the number of PGP-IR neurons was not decreased at this stage, these results suggest a loss if NOS-immunoreactivity, prior to overt neuronal loss. No changes in number of ChAT-IR neurons was observed in any gastrointestinal (GI) region studied at any time-point. \n\n\tAn additional study was performed to investigate whether vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) could reverse the increase in body mass, hyperglycemia, and loss of myenteric neurons observed in diabetic NONc10 mice. A total of 24 mice underwent VSG surgery, and 8 mice were used for immunohistochemical studies. VSG surgery decreased body mass and lowered blood glucose levels as early as 1 week post-surgery; these alterations were maintained at 3 weeks and 3 months post-surgery. VSG also reversed the loss of PGP- and NOS-IR observed in the duodenum, but not the ileum or colon, at 3 week and 3 months post-surgery, with no changes being noted in ChAT-IR at any time-point.\n\n\tThe present studies demonstrate that the enteric nervous system is disrupted; specifically nitrergic neurons are lost, in the NONc10 mouse model of type 2 diabetes. These changes were observed in the duodenum and ileum even prior to the development of overt hyperglycemia, suggesting that alterations in the enteric nervous system precede diabetes, and may not be due to the hyperglycemia or obesity per se. Our studies also demonstrate that VSG surgery decreases body mass, restores normoglycemia, and reverses the loss of nitrergic neurons in the duodenum, implying that bariatric surgery may reverse some, but potentially not all, diabetes-associated damage to the enteric nervous system and gastrointestinal functions. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15508], "author_name_tesi": "Munden, Regina Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Munden", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Regina", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Laboratory Animal Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tiffany Whitcomb", "Kirsteen Browning", "Andras Hajnal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tiffany Whitcomb, Thesis Advisor", "Kirsteen Browning, Thesis Advisor", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["type 2 diabetes", "NONcNZO", "vertical sleeve gastrectomy"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "SITUATED ARGUMENTATION, LEARNING AND SCIENCE EDUCATION: A CASE STUDY OF PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS\u2019 EXPERIENCES IN AN INNOVATIVE SCIENCE COURSE", "id": "5950", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1652", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-03-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Various authors have called attention to the significance of argumentation in science education.  Nevertheless, argumentation practices have been considerably rare in science classrooms.  Moreover, little is known about how people engage in argumentation as science learners to construct knowledge about the natural world and about science.\n\nThis study was conducted in a science course for prospective teachers (PTs) offered in the College of Education at a large university in the northeastern United States.  The course was structured around three instructional units (modules), focusing on evolution, light, and global climate change.  In each module, PTs were confronted with scientifically-oriented questions, and working in pairs, they built evidence-based arguments.  Various types of technology tools were used to support PTs in the process.  The study addresses the experiences of four prospective teachers through a case study research design informed by grounded theory and phenomenology theoretical frameworks.  The research questions were: (1) How do prospective teachers (PTs) perceive the experience of engaging in the process of situated argument construction as students in a innovative science course? (2) What factors account for PTs\u2019 experiences in situated argument construction? and (3) What are the participants\u2019 perceptions of learning that emerged from the context of the process of argument construction in SCIED 410? The primary sources of data for the study were electronic artifacts constructed by PTs and interviews with participants conducted after each unit, plus a follow-up interview.  The structure of the participants\u2019 arguments was analyzed to determine the extent to which the PTs explored multiple explanations, provided relevant evidence to support their conclusions, explained how evidence and conclusions were related, and recognized limitations in explanations. Interviews were analyzed using methods from grounded theory.  Open and axial codes were generated through comparisons of data to develop concepts that reflected the participants\u2019 perceptions of the process of argument construction and perceptions of learning emerging in the context of this process.\n\nThe results indicate that situated argument construction for PTs involved two major processes: argument building as legitimization (or the use of the argument structure to make one\u2019s argument valid and acceptable) and argument building as means to understand (or the use of argument in facilitating or inhibiting the process of development of explanations to better understand a problem).  In the first case, the focus is on gaining authority; in the latter, the focus is on gaining ability to construct explanations.  These processes were not mutually exclusive as participants experienced them in the same investigation at different stages and in different situations.  Nevertheless, argumentation as legitimization prevailed.  \n\nThe participants\u2019 perceptions of learning were, in part, considerably homogeneous.  PTs tended to see learning as the acquisition of information, and as distinguishing accurate from inaccurate answers.  However, the participants perceived the role of the instructors differently.  On one hand, some PTs expected the teachers to give them answers, whereas others saw the teacher as a facilitator who should provide guidance for the students to find answers on their own. \n\nMultiple factors were identified as accounting for the variation in PTs\u2019 experiences with argument construction: (1) the context of the school, including characteristics of task, resources, and power relations; (2) the learner orientation, including PTs\u2019 understandings of the process of knowing and of what is to be known; (3) the context of science, including PTs\u2019 dispositions toward science, proficiency with science, and definitions of science.  All these factors interacted with each other to produce diverse experiences with argumentation in SCIED 410.\n\nVarious conclusions were drawn from the study.  First, knowledge of the importance of assessing participants\u2019 perceptions in constructing more robust understandings of learning experiences was generated.  Second, a much more complex notion of the experience of argumentation in science education, which involves multiple processes and embedded networks of interactions, was developed.  Finally, through exploring these complexities and the situated nature of argumentation, new dilemmas and new goals for science education were identified.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1638], "author_name_tesi": "Munford, Danusa ", "last_name_ssi": "Munford", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Danusa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent Norman Lunetta", "Barbara Allen Crawford", "Ian E Baptiste", "Carla Zembal Saul"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent Norman Lunetta, Committee Member", "Barbara Allen Crawford, Committee Member", "Ian E Baptiste, Committee Member", "Carla Zembal Saul, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["teacher education", "argumentation", "science education", "learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Using Quantitative Approaches to Estimate Space-use, Population Dynamics, Behavior, and Climate Change Adaptive Potential for the Red-backed Salamander Plethodon Cinereus", "id": "26259", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11528", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The red-backed salamander, Plethodon cinereus, is a common woodland amphibian that is found throughout much of eastern North America.

Therefore, consistent methods of density estimation are required. In the first chapter, I review spatial capture-recapture, a modern modeling tool that incorporates spatial information to reliably estimate population density without the need for the ad-hoc methods that render other density estimates incomparable. It can also be used to make inferences on space-use, population dynamics, and connectivity. I then demonstrate the versatility of spatial capture-recapture using P. cinereus mark-recapture data collected from my study sites in central Pennsylvania. For the second chapter of this thesis, I use spatial capture-recapture and other modeling approaches to test hypotheses about P. cinereus climate change adaptive capacity. This salamander is a convenient model for understanding dispersal-limited species, so I tested eight hypotheses to see how behavioral plasticity and fitness were affected by climate variability. Based on previous evidence, I also tested whether a common color polymorphism is a useful visual cue for predicting within-population variation in climate tolerances. Using four years of mark-recapture information from Maryland, I found the color morph is not a useful indicator, but overall, the population did show strong climate preferences, indicating that population persistence could be threatened by warmer and drier conditions predicted in the future.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11037], "author_name_tesi": "Munoz, David Jonathan", "last_name_ssi": "Munoz", "middle_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Miller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Population ecology", "Capture mark-recapture", "Study design", "Adaptive Capacity", "Climate Change"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Rumination mediates the relationship between neuroticism and cognitive function\n", "id": "12154", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1737", "abstract_tesi": "Although recent research has found a negative association between trait neuroticism and cognition, no studies have directly examined the mechanisms that underlie this relationship.

Three hundred-forty six adults (Mage = 49.43) completed five attention-demanding cognitive tasks (i.e., working memory, episodic memory, fluid intelligence, primary memory, and processing speed) as well as self-report measures of rumination, negative affect, and trait neuroticism.

Further, studies on stress and cognitive function are comprised of primarily non-Hispanic white participants precluding considerations of how the observed associations operate among racially and ethnically diverse adults. This dissertation brings together findings from two studies to address these knowledge gaps in the stress and cognitive aging literature. \nUsing data from a repeated measurement-burst design, Study 1 examined the longitudinal association between perceived stress and cognitive slowing among 116 older adults between the ages of 67 and 96. Bursts of six daily cognitive assessments were repeated every six months over a two-year period with measures of perceived stress provided at the start of every burst. Applying a double-exponential learning model to account for learning effects, two parameters were estimated: 1) asymptotic level (peak performance), and 2) asymptotic change (the rate in which peak performance changed across bursts). A latent growth curve analysis demonstrated that greater reports of perceived stress across the study period were associated with asymptotic cognitive slowing across time. \nUsing data from a multi-center epidemiological study of Hispanic/Latino adults, Study 2 examined whether the negative stress-cognition association reported in the literature also holds for Hispanics/Latinos (N = 3,132) between 45 and 75 years of age . Applying epidemiological data analytic techniques to account for the study\u2019s complex sampling design, this study found a negative association between self-reported chronic stress and cognitive performance as well as between self-reported acculturation stress and cognition. Tests of multiple indirect effects showed that negative repetitive thought and depressive affect differentially accounted for the stress-cognition associations.\nOverall, this dissertation demonstrates the key role of psychological stress on poor cognitive function and change among middle aged and older adults and shows that Hispanics/Latinos may experience culture-specific stressors that elevate their risk for poor cognitive function. This dissertation also shows that repetitive thought and depressive affect are candidate mechanisms of the association between stress and cognitive function in aging adults.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10949], "author_name_tesi": "Munoz Diaz, Elizabeth ", "last_name_ssi": "Munoz Diaz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Martin John Sliwinski", "Martin John Sliwinski", "David Manuel Almeida", "Lesley Anne Ross", "Jennifer Elise Graham Engeland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Martin John Sliwinski, Dissertation Advisor", "Martin John Sliwinski, Committee Chair", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Member", "Lesley Anne Ross, Committee Member", "Jennifer Elise Graham Engeland, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Stress", "Cognition", "Aging"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Quality Improvement to Assess and Audit Complexity in Translational Research", "id": "26350", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11420", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The large gap between proven clinical knowledge and its implementation in clinical practice is a pressing challenge faced by the health community. It has been estimated that adults in the U.S. receive only about half of their recommended care. This is in part, due to the complexities and current inability of translating knowledge to effectively impact health outcomes. Moreover, the lack of understanding of the complexities involved in translational research have resulted in a poor allocation of resources. As an effort to accelerate the rate at which new discoveries become clinical practice, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) explicitly made translational research a central priority and has invested heavily in developing an infrastructure through the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs). The arc of this dissertation is in alignment with this priority. \nTranslational research experts have argued that the existing models in translational research have not been able to fully capture the complexities, dynamisms, and fragmentations of this long process. In response, data-driven tools and robust frameworks are expected to help analyzing, and hence, accelerating this knowledge translation. These frameworks are needed for assuring an efficient and effective decision-making process that support the tactical and strategic allocation of healthcare resources. \nAlthough Quality Improvement (QI) approaches have been found to be promising to solve a wide variety of problems in healthcare, their implementation in translational research has not been fully explored. Moreover, in healthcare fields, QI has been mostly associated with Lean and Six Sigma techniques. However, in order for QI techniques to address translational research challenges, a wider QI scope is needed. In response to these challenges, a comprehensive QI research approach is used in this dissertation to provide frameworks that inform healthcare decision makers, and hence, have a positive impact on translational research. The frameworks presented are applied to different case studies that use them to generate evidence for professional applications. \nThe main body of this dissertation is divided into three parts. The first part proposes a combined Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) framework for assessing the complexity of translational research. Specifically, this framework is used to identify and quantify the importance of the different operational steps and corresponding technical requirements along the translational research process. This framework was applied to a case study of a primary care-based weight control intervention. The second part proposes a Social Network Analysis (SNA) approach for evaluating collaboration and multidisciplinarity networks. The evaluation includes the identification of collaboration patterns, leaders, influencers, bridgers of knowledge, and research clusters. A case study that analyzes collaboration on obesity research at the intra-institutional level is presented to illustrate the potential benefits and applicability of this framework. Finally, a goal programming (GP) model and a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) approach is proposed to guide the proposal selection problem and estimate the potential impact of healthcare interventions respectively.

It appears that mid-level relative humidity, absolute vorticity, and the distribution of convection relative to the storm center all play a role in determining whether a given ensemble member intensifies or not. In addition, although differences in deep-layer shear among ensemble members are difficult to discern, many of the ensemble members that do not intensify fail to do so because of apparent dry air intrusions that wrap around the centers of the storms, particularly in the 700-500 hPa layer. In the presence of moderate shear, this dry air is able to penetrate the cores of the cyclones, thereby preventing further development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8160], "author_name_tesi": "Munsell, Erin Brooke", "last_name_ssi": "Munsell", "middle_name_ssi": "Brooke", "first_name_ssi": "Erin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fuqing Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fuqing Zhang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tropical Cyclones", "Predictability", "Erika"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Dynamics and predictability of tropical cyclones evaluated through convection-permitting ensemble analyses and forecasts with airborne radar and sounding observations", "id": "c247ds096", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12781", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The dynamics and predictability of various aspects of tropical cyclone track and intensity forecasting are explored through the use of real-time convection-permitting ensemble forecasts generated by a regional-scale model that employs advanced data assimilation techniques.

The primary cell wall of plants display interesting mechanical properties such as stiffness to resist the turgor forces generated by the living cell and extensibility to allow it to grow.

Heat treatment of plant tissues for brief periods (<15 min) resulted in an increase in the stiffness of the tissues in the linear viscoelastic region of up to 46% compared to controls. Heat treatment of tissues containing little or no xyloglucan (celery parenchyma and xxt1/xxt2 Arabidopsis mutants) result in higher stiffness after heating of up to 60% which leads to the thought that XG rearrangement may not be the major cause of the stiffness. Rearrangement of the pectin / cellulose matrix is the major factor.

X-ray spectroscopy also revealed no aggregation of cellulose microfibrils occurring during heating. \n\tMicroelectromechanical System (MEMS) testing was accomplished on heat treated onion epidermal cell wall to distinguish if the stiffness was primarily caused at the tissue level or at the single wall level. Results indicated that the wall section became less stiff after heat treatment, which implicates the tissues and possible the middle lamella in the stiffening. The cell wall sections however show greater strength at break of 46% than controls and have a higher strain of 67%. This indicates that the cell wall structure is undergoing rearrangement during heating, and that no one factor is decisive in the observed stiffening. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10171], "author_name_tesi": "Munson, Paul Jonathan", "last_name_ssi": "Munson", "middle_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Danny Glynn Sykes", "Nicole Robitaille Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Danny Glynn Sykes, Thesis Advisor", "Nicole Robitaille Brown, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Primary Cell Wall", "DMA", "Pectin", "Binders", "MEMS"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Exploring Mobile Phone Usage And Potentials For Enhancing Higher Education Ghana, West Africa", "id": "21865", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9819", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As a result of the high diffusion of mobile phones in Ghana, almost all students in high schools and colleges own and use them quite frequently in and outside classrooms.  The Ghana Education Services in 2010 suggests that the use of mobile phones among high school students is destructive in their learning process; therefore, the use of mobile phones has been forbidden in all high school campuses [Imoro 2012]. It seems to be assumed that the prohibition of mobile phone usage in high school may help the students to focus on their studies instead of concentrating on their  mobile phones. However, it could be presumed that this ban may limit students\u2019 exposure to the modern technology, hence, limiting the learning experiences that could occur outside of the classroom setting.  However, students are permitted to use mobile phones in the university environment. \n\nToday, nearly all students  in most universities have mobile phones and use them primarily for communicating with families and friends and for everyday business purposes.  Mobile phones can be viewed as potential resource tools for learning rather than seen as a classroom distraction.  In order for mobile phones to become useful as platforms for learning in the educational environment, it is imperative for educators and curriculum developers to know how students use mobile phones in their current educational settings. Also, given the high level of mobile phone usage among university students in Ghana, it can be assumed that some of the students may use their mobile phones for learning purposes. Hence, it is important to examine this phenomenon and to ascertain how mobile phones are currently used and to examine how mobile phones can be used to enhance the learning process among students in Ghana. In examining the current and possible use of mobile phones in the educational setting in Ghana, consideration was also given to Transactive Memory Theory and how the constructs of this theory could be used to better understand and enhance the learning process of university students in Ghana. \n\n\tThis qualitatively driven mixed methods study investigates five specific questions: (1) Do students in universities in Ghana use their mobile phones for the purpose of learning?  (2) If they do, what factors influence their use of mobile phones for learning, and if they do not, then why?  (3) What kinds of mobile educational tools do they use and why?  (4) How do students use their mobile phones to further enhance their learning process. (5) How and why do mobile phones relate to and support transactive memory in the context of learning in Ghana? In order to answer these questions, students are asked to complete a survey with some open-ended questions on their use of mobile phones, and how the phones impact their learning processes. The survey was conducted via crowdsourcing, on campus labs, and through the traditional printed copies. \n\nThese questions are addressed by using Transactive Memory Theory (TMT) and the concept of mobile learning as the bases for the interpretation and discussion of the student responses. While the survey analysis suggests that university students in Ghana use their mobile phones for learning purposes, this study also suggests ways in which mobile phones can be used as educational tools among higher education students in Ghana. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9560], "author_name_tesi": "Muntaka, M ", "last_name_ssi": "Muntaka", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "M", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lynette Marie Yarger", "Ladislaus M Semali", "Eileen M Trauth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lynette Marie Yarger, Thesis Advisor", "Ladislaus M Semali, Thesis Advisor", "Eileen M Trauth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mobile phone", "Higher Education", "Ghana", "Transactive Memory Theory", "Mobile learning", "m-learning", "Learning process"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EFFECT OF VARIED ENHANCEMENT STRATEGIES (CHUNKING, FEEDBACK, GAMING) IN COMPLEMENTING ANIMATED INSTRUCTION IN FACILITATING DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES", "id": "8230", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4523", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the instructional effectiveness of different levels of chunking (simple visual/text and complex visual/text), different forms of feedback (item-by-item feedback, end-of-test feedback and no feedback), and use of instructional gaming (game and no game) in complementing animated programmed instruction on a test measuring different educational objectives. \nPrevious research suggested that chunking of information helped reduce cognitive load, concentrating on important information. Feedback is an essential part of any type of instruction designed to help students learn more effectively. However, no one best type of feedback has been found to be most effective for computer-based education. Games have the potential of facilitating different types of learning outcomes by motivating students and allowing them to rehearse without cognitive load. This interactive information rich environment could cause cognitive overload if game factors such as clear goals, challenges and immediate feedback are not identified and designed clearly. That is why we need better models in order to understand what kinds of games, what types of feedback and chunking facilitate achievement of different types of learning objectives. \nA total of 360 subjects participated in this study. A Posttest-Only 2 x 3 x 2 factorial experimental design was employed. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of twelve treatments (1) simple chunks + item-by-item feedback + game with programmed instruction with animation; (2) simple chunks + item-by-item feedback + no game with programmed instruction with animation; (3) simple chunks + end-of-test feedback + game with programmed instruction with animation; (4) simple chunks + end-of-test feedback + no game with programmed instruction with animation; (5) simple chunks + no feedback + game with programmed instruction with animation; (6) simple chunks + no feedback + no game with programmed instruction with animation; (7) complex chunks + item-by-item feedback + game with programmed instruction with animation; (8) complex chunks + item-by-item + no game with programmed instruction with animation; (9) complex chunks + end-of-test feedback + game with programmed instruction with animation; (10) complex chunks + end-of-test feedback + no game with programmed instruction with animation; (11) complex chunks + no feedback + game with programmed instruction with animation; and (12) complex chunks + no feedback + no game with programmed instruction with animation. \nMultiple Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was used to determine whether the mean post test scores of the treatment groups differed significantly from one another, whether the factors: A (simple visual/text and complex visual/text chunking); B (item-by-item feedback, end-of-test feedback, no feedback); C (game, no game) interacted significantly with one another with respect to each of the criterion measures being investigated, and specific items which were enhanced by different strategies. The enhanced items were categorized as follows: EIC = Identification questions enhanced with chunking, EIG = Identification questions enhanced with gaming, ETC = Terminology questions enhanced with chunking, ETF = Terminology questions enhanced with feedback, ETG = Terminology questions enhanced with gaming, ECC = Comprehension questions enhanced with chunking, ECF = Comprehension questions enhanced with feedback, ECG = Comprehension questions enhanced with gaming.\nThere were no statistically significant interactions among the different strategies on the different criterion measures (identification, terminology, comprehension and total). There were no statistically significant main effects with respect to the use of chunking strategies (simple visual/text and complex visual/text), and different types of feedback (item-by-item, end-of-test, and no feedback) in complementing programmed instruction with animation among the 12 treatment groups. There were statistically significant main effects with respect to the use of gaming among treatment groups on terminology and comprehension tests. There were also statistically significant main effects when focusing on items enhanced by different strategies when gaming was a factor on the terminology and comprehension tests. \n\tThe research findings indicated that gaming was an effective and motivational method to rehearse the information without causing cognitive load. Contrary to previous studies, chunking strategies were not statistically significant in this study. This might be related to the way chunking strategies were presented and their location in the instructional unit. Presenting chunking strategies along with additional strategies required the participant to process more information in a short amount of time. This could also cause information overload. In addition, feedback was important but, like in previous studies, this study did not indicate any statistically significant difference among the different types of feedbacks.  Providing different types of feedback without knowing how learners would perceive, process and interpret the information might have caused cognitive load and performance of learners. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4492], "author_name_tesi": "Munyofu, Mine ", "last_name_ssi": "Munyofu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Francis M Dwyer Jr.", "Wei Fan Chen", "Priya Sharma", "Pui Wa Lei", "Susan M Land"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Francis M Dwyer Jr., Committee Chair", "Wei Fan Chen, Committee Member", "Priya Sharma, Committee Member", "Pui Wa Lei, Committee Member", "Susan M Land, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["instructional strategies", "chunking", "feedback", "gaming", "animation", "programmed instruction"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ANALYSES OF THE FUNCTION OF THE PALMITOYL TRANSFERASES GODZ AND SERZ-BETA IN KNOCK-OUT MICE\n", "id": "8917", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5847", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Type A GABA receptors (GABAARs) are the major sites of fast synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system (CNS) and mediate the therapeutic effects of many clinically important drugs. The efficacy of synaptic inhibition is critically dependent on the postsynaptic accumulation of GABAARs. Golgi-specific DHHC zinc finger protein (GODZ; aka, DHHC3) and SERZ-beta (aka, DHHC7) have been identified as palmitoyl acyl-transferases (PATs) of the gamma2 subunit of GABAARs. In addition, the cell adhesion molecule neuroligin 2 (NL2) is localized at GABAergic synapses and implicated in GABAergic synapse formation. Previous analyses of GODZ by RNAi in cultured neurons had suggested that they are important for postsynaptic accumulation of GABAARs at inhibitory synapses. In addition these studies pointed to a novel possible role of GABAARs in the assembly of GABAergic inhibitory synapses.\nA first objective of this doctoral thesis was to elucidate the function of GODZ and SERZ-beta in vivo. In order to achieve this purpose, global and conditional knock-out (KO) mice were generated for both GODZ and SERZ-beta. Genetic deletion of GODZ and SERZ-beta was confirmed by genomic Southern blotting, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence analyses. Global GODZ and SERZ-beta KO mice were found to be viable, whereas GODZ and SERZ-beta double knock-out (DKO) mice showed a partially penetrant perinatally lethal phenotype. Male, but not female, GODZ KO mice exhibited a small but significant reduction in body weight compared to wild type (WT) littermate controls. A more dramatic reduction in body weight was evident in DKO mice, as quantified in females but also overtly evident in males. Compared to WT littermate controls, GODZ KO mice showed complex behavioral alterations characterized by excessive jumping in response to handling, hindleg clenching upon suspension by their tail, hyperlocomotion in an Open Field test, as well as enhanced Prepulse Inhibition of acoustic startle responses. However, GODZ KOs showed normal anxiety related behavior in Free Choice and Elevated Plus Maze tests. Immunofluorescence analyses of cortical neuron cultures prepared from GODZ KO or GODZ/SERZ-beta DKO mice revealed unaltered numbers of postsynaptic clusters of gamma2 subunit containing GABAARs and the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin. Similarly, the number of clusters of the corresponding presynaptic marker glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIATT) were also unchanged. Consistent with unaltered clustering in pure DKO cultures, the surface expression levels of the gamma2 subunit and NL2 assessed by biotinylation was unaltered in DKO compared to WT cultures. However, when mutant neurons were co-cultured with an excess of WT neurons, punctate staining for postsynaptic GABAAR clusters and presynaptic inhibitory synaptic markers of GODZ KO and DKO neurons was dramatically reduced compared to neurons of pure WT cultures. Similarly, gamma2 subunit heterozygous neurons co-cultured with an excess of WT neurons showed a significant reduction in inhibitory synapse formation, suggesting that gamma2 subunit-containing GABAARs contribute to normal GABAergic innervation. In addition, electrophysiological analyses of DKO neurons co-cultured with WT neurons revealed unaltered GABA-induced whole cell current but significant deficits in the frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) compared to WT neurons. These results suggest that GODZ and/or SERZ-bata are dispensable for normal surface expression of GABAARs in pure cultures but necessary for postsynaptic clustering of GABAARs and normal formation and function of inhibitory synapses under competitive conditions.  \n\tAs a second objective I further analyzed the role of GABAARs in GABAergic synapse formation. Preliminary immunofluorescence analyses of GABAAR gamma2 subunit  KO neurons had revealed a dramatic loss of postsynaptic NL2 at inhibitory synapses, indicating that perhaps the gamma2 subunit was required for normal expression of a synaptic adhesion molecule, which in turn was required for GABAergic inhibitory synapse formation. To test this idea and to analyze the surface expression of GABAARs in gamma2 subunit KO neurons I performed a series of biotinylation assays, comparing the surface expression of NL2, alpha and beta subunits of GABAARs in WT and gamma2 subunit KO cultures. Although the total amount of NL2 and beta2/3 subunit expressed in gamma2 KO cultures was unaltered, the surface expression level of NL2, alpha1 and beta2/3 subunits was greatly reduced in gamma2 KO compared to WT neurons. This indicated that the gamma2 subunit is necessary for the surface expression of both NL2 and GABAARs. Previously, co-aggregation assay in transfected HEK293T cells provided evidence that NL2 interacts with alpha and/or beta subunits, but not the gamma2 subunit, in the plasma membrane. These results together suggest a mechanism in which GABAAR-dependent presentation of NL2 at the cell surface promotes interaction of the postsynaptic apparatus with GABAergic presynaptic terminals, thereby ensuring apposition of functionally matching pre- and postsynaptic elements.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5844], "author_name_tesi": "Murakami, Shoko ", "last_name_ssi": "Murakami", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shoko", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher", "Bernhard Luscher", "Richard W Ordway", "Robert Paulson", "Gong Chen", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher, Dissertation Advisor", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Chair", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Gong Chen, Committee Member", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["knock out", "trafficking", "Neuroligin 2", "GABAA receptor", "palmitoylation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Reducing Interference in Memory Hierarchy Resources Using Application Aware Management", "id": "12150", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5994", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Aggressive technology scaling has resulted in an increase in number of cores being integrated on-chip. While on-chip cores are increasing at a fast rate, the memory hierarchy resources are scaling at a much slower pace. The memory resources, such as different levels of on-chip cache and the off-chip memory bandwidth, are costly and are often shared across multiple on-chip cores. \nThis leads to multiple applications contending for access to these common resources. In the process, these applications can harmfully interfere with one another, and, this interference can result in significant degradation of both system throughput and individual application performance. Therefore, intelligently managing the shared memory resources by mitigating inter-application interference is vitally important in emerging multicore systems. \n\nThis dissertation makes three key contributions towards addressing the above problem of interference in shared memory resources. First, this dissertation considers the last-level shared cache and the off-chip memory as instances of shared memory resources, and, studies the causes and different ways in which applications interfere with one another while contending for a resource.\nSecond, this dissertation studies the negative impact of resource contention on application and system performances. Third, this dissertation proposes novel schemes to mitigate inter-application interference and thereby improve system and application performance. These schemes aim to efficiently manage the resources in an application aware manner with the goal of mitigating the overall inter-application interference. An application aware resource management scheme considers the memory access characteristics of all the contending applications and uses this information to manage the shared resource. The resource management decisions are based on two key principles: 1) isolating  applications/threads that harmfully interfere from each other by partitioning the resources between the interfering applications, and, 2) deciding the size of the resource partition that an application gets based on its memory access characteristics and requirements.\nThe trend of integrating increasing number of cores on a single chip is projected to continue into the future. This continued scaling is propelling the parallel computation capability of emerging multicore systems. Efficient management of shared memory hierarchy resources will become ever more important in the future if we are to ensure that applications extract the maximum possible parallelism from these multicore systems. This dissertation takes an important step towards addressing this problem by proposing novel schemes to efficiently manage multiple memory hierarchy resources. These schemes are very effective in practice, improving both system performance and individual application performance.

PPARa is a specific pharmacological target for dyslipidemia in humans, but prolonged administration of PPAR&#61537; agonists causes peroxisome proliferation and hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents.  Proliferation and cancer is not observed in humans suggesting divergence between mouse and human PPAR&#61537; activation.  The central hypothesis of this work is that PPARa is differentially regulated by LXXLL motif-containing coactivators and the forkhead box O subclass of proteins.  The interaction of LXXLL motifs and PPARs was assessed utilizing fusion proteins containing the core motif in a mammalian expression vector.  These experiments demonstrated the ability of fusion proteins to differentially block transcriptional activation of mouse PPAR isotypes and the human PPARa.  Species specific PPARa activation was also caused by co-activators.  Real time RT-PCR analysis of target genes with PPARa-null, human PPARa transgenic, and wild type mice suggested that these receptors differentially regulate target genes.  Thus, PPARa activation can be traced to inherent species differences in the receptor dependent on both LXXLL motif recruitment and specific ligand activation.\nThe forkhead box protein subclass O (FOXO) is a transcription factor implicated in crosstalk with nuclear receptors.  FOX proteins are transcription factors containing a conserved 100 amino acid DNA binding domain that interacts with the insulin responsive sequence as a monomer.  FOXO1A is potentially involved in crosstalk with PPARs due to the regulation of gluconeogenesis, and the present set of experiments examines this crosstalk.  PPARs and FOXO1A were co-expressed revealing mutual co-repression of PPARs and FOXO1A in a reporter system.  One-hybrid analysis of FOXO and PPARa or RXR revealed that the FOXO1A-mediated repression of PPARa is independent of heterodimerization.  Immunoprecipitation of FOXO1A and PPARa failed to demonstrate direct interaction between these proteins.  Repression of PPARa mRNA message cells was able to prevent PPARa ligand treatment from repressing endogenous FOXO activation of a specific target gene.  These two nutritionally-regulated pathways are involved in crosstalk suggesting the activation of one pathway may repress the transcriptional activation of the other.

Although these PIPs have always existed in paper records, there is an increasing need to focus on PIPs in electronic records due to the tremendous growth in the use of health information technology (HIT).\n\nResearchers in the Medical Informatics and Human-Computer Interaction communities are currently studying what causes these PIPs in hospitals, and the impacts that PIPs can have on the patient-care workflow. Additionally, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work researchers are exploring how the collaborative nature of hospital work affects the information management activities of patient-care teams. Yet, there is still limited research on how patient-care team members actually identify and then manage the PIPs that they encounter during their work. After all, if these PIPs are not identified and properly fixed, they can result in medical decisions being made on wrong or outdated information, or even result in the occurrence of medical errors that could harm patients.\n\nIn this dissertation study, I address this limitation in existing research by conducting an ethnographic field study in a hospital\u2019s emergency department and in-patient ward.

Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an ideal tool to study the alteration layers because this technique provides structural and (indirectly) compositional information.

Experimental conditions such as glass composition and form (powder versus fiber) have been shown to influence the composition and structure of the alteration layers.  After formation, the alteration layers continue to interact with solution species due to an established dynamic equilibrium.  Through isotopic labeling and solution swapping experiments, recondensation of aqueous silicon onto the powder surface was observed at short and long equilibration periods.

This study sought to document what has happened to extracurricular programs during such periods. \n\nIn this research, the case study method was chosen to address this topic. A typical school district in Pennsylvania characterized by an average pupil population, reasonable expenditures per pupil, and mixed results in both curricular and extracurricular affairs was selected for examination. The study sought to identify and explain what was happening to student activities, co-curricular programs such as band, choir, and vocational education, and organized scholastic athletic programs during an unprecedented era of reform. Further, the study identified processes being used by school officials to evaluate the value assigned to and support for these programs and documented those involved in the decision-making process.

The process of virion assembly that gives rise to these structures occurs within multiple cellular sites.  Herpesvirus assembly initiates within the nucleus, where the capsid assembles and incorporates the viral genomic DNA.  Upon completion of capsid assembly, the initial layer of tegument is added to the capsid within the nucleus.  Additional tegument proteins are added to the capsid after it exits the nucleus and travels through the cytoplasm.  Although the addition of tegument proteins to the capsid (tegumentation) occurs in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, the majority of the tegument proteins are incorporated into the virion during secondary envelopment at trans-Golgi network (TGN)-derived vesicles.  Packaging of the individual tegument proteins, during secondary envelopment, is dependent upon complexes of tegument proteins and glycoproteins, which assemble on the TGN-derived vesicles. \n\tThe molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the addition of tegument proteins into nascent herpesvirus particles are poorly understood.  To gain a better understanding of the tegumentation process, we initiated studies that focused on the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) tegument protein pUL46.  The UL46 gene encodes two proteins that are packaged into the virion; therefore, pUL46 is also designated as virion polypeptides 11 and 12 (VP11/12).  In addition to the structural role they play, several tegument proteins also perform regulatory functions once the virion is uncoated within the cytoplasm.  pUL46 enhances the trans-activation of immediate-early (IE) promoters, an event primarily orchestrated by VP16.  Despite reports of an interaction between pUL46 and VP16, the mechanism for enhancement of VP16 activity is currently unknown.  Since deletion of UL46 from alphaherpesvirus homologues does not inhibit viral replication, this function of pUL46 is not required for completion of the viral life cycle.  In addition to being non-essential for replication, pUL46 is packaged into the virion at relatively high levels and because of these two attributes; we chose pUL46 as the centerpiece of our studies.   \nInclusion of a tegument protein into the virion is dependent upon the protein trafficking to the site of virus assembly; therefore, experiments were designed to compare the cellular localization of pUL46 in the absence and presence of HSV-1 infection.  Regardless of the conditions used, the majority of pUL46 localizes within the cytoplasm as punctate structures, which is similar in appearance to the membrane-associated tegument protein VP22.  To determine if pUL46 also associates with membranes, we performed membrane flotation experiment, which showed that pUL46 associates with membranes in both the presence and absence of other HSV-1 proteins.  The membrane flotation results also showed that expression of pUL46 during infection results in hyperphosphorylation of pUL46, which is infection-specific.  In an effort to identify the residues that facilitate association of pUL46 with membranes, we constructed plasmids encoding pUL46 truncations and then analyzed these proteins for their ability to associate with membranes.  The results indicate that the amino terminus of pUL46 (residues 1-446) associates with membranes at levels equivalent to that of the full-length protein (residues 1-720).  In comparison to full-length pUL46, the carboxy terminus (residues 447-720) associates with membranes at decreased levels, which suggests the amino terminus contains the domains that facilitate membrane association.       \nBecause pUL46 associates with cellular membranes, we expected the protein to associate with the inner surface of the virus envelope. Despite the propensity for pUL46 to associate with membranes, the majority of pUL46 associates with capsids upon removal of the envelope from extracellular virions.  This ability of pUL46 to bind capsids was subsequently confirmed by an in vitro capsid pulldown assay, in which purified pUL46-GST specifically interacts with capsids purified from the nuclear fraction of HSV-1 infected cells.  Because of these results, we hypothesize that pUL46 displays a dynamic interaction between cellular membranes and capsids.\n\tSince the amino terminus of pUL46 facilitates its association with membranes, we proposed that the same region of the protein is critical for its packaging into the virion.  Initial studies, using plasmid-based expression of truncated pUL46, showed that the carboxy terminus of pUL46 is dispensable for virion incorporation.  However, the carboxy terminus (residues 447-720), when expressed from a plasmid, is packaged into the virion at levels comparable to full-length pUL46.  In order to pursue these studies in a more relevant context, we constructed multiple viruses that encode various truncations of pUL46.  Analysis of these recombinant viruses showed that residues 1-446 are sufficient to facilitate packaging of this truncated protein at levels comparable with full-length pUL46.  In contrast to the plasmid-based assay, residues 447-720 are not packaged into virions, despite their relative abundance within infected cells.  Confocal microscopy of both transfected and infected cells showed that residues 447-720 accumulate within the nucleus, while residues 1-446 accumulate within the cytoplasm.  Surprisingly, the use of these recombinant viruses also revealed that infection with a virus that encodes full-length pUL46 results in the release of virions that contain both full-length pUL46 and a form that is truncated from the amino terminus.  Based upon these results, we propose that a population of pUL46 is truncated during virus assembly and that removal of the amino terminus targets the truncated protein to the nucleus, where the protein enhances the activity of VP16.\n\tIn summary, the studies described within this dissertation provide novel insights into the packaging of tegument proteins that occurs during HSV-1 assembly.  Analysis of pUL46 has revealed the protein\u2019s use of packaging mechanisms that are common among other tegument proteins, as well as, mechanisms that may be unique to pUL46.  The identification of these unique mechanisms provides a basis for future dissection of the pathways that result in packaging and truncation of pUL46.    \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3946], "author_name_tesi": "Murphy, Michael Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Murphy", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard James Courtney", "Richard James Courtney", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "David Joseph Spector", "John Warren Wills", "Vincent Chau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard James Courtney, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard James Courtney, Committee Chair", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member", "Vincent Chau, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HSV", "Tegument", "Virus Assembly", "UL46", "VP11/12"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Skewed Steel Bridge Cross-frame Response to Truck Loading", "id": "15168", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5549", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cross-frame members in highly skewed steel bridges experience increased load levels compared to straight bridges.

Healthcare providers are also using the Internet to deliver various types of health interventions, including stress management courses, breast cancer coping groups, anti-smoking treatments, and weight loss therapy. These trends have led to a surplus of patient data on the web, including patients\u2019 descriptions of their experiences of different ailments and the effects of treatment.\nSentiment analysis and social network analysis are powerful computational tools with which to make sense of this ever-growing corpus of medical data that is accumulating in online communities and social media. With sentiment classification algorithms, researchers can aggregate thousands or even millions of pieces of text to perform tasks such as predicting stock market movements, aggregating product reviews, and even gauging national mood. These same methods can also be applied to healthcare to improve the quality of healthcare services. Some researchers are already advocating for more data mining in the healthcare domain, arguing that this will create a new \u201cdigital epidemiology\u201d that will improve the healthcare system.\nNevertheless, there are significant technical challenges involved in mining social media data. This data is often difficult for text mining systems to parse due to its disorganized nature and the presence of slang, and developing useful features to accurately classify texts in this domain is an open problem. Additionally, before measuring the sentiment of online texts about healthcare, it is important to understand whether these messages represent attitudes or descriptions of personal experiences.\nThis thesis examines a relatively unexplored supervised machine learning task in the\nhealthcare domain, automatic identification of social media messages pertaining to cancer-related personal experiences. We demonstrate that supervised learning methods can be used to accurately predict whether Twitter posts contain descriptions of personal experiences using four datasets of tweets about breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and diabetes. Despite the unbalanced nature of this classification problem (of 4,821 labeled tweets, fewer than 20% of Twitter posts contain descriptions of personal experiences), these methods are able to classify with high F- Measure (>70%). We also show that content-based are more effective than context-based features.\nThis thesis also discusses novel data filtering techniques and natural language processing- based feature engineering methods that significantly improve classification of these short Twitter messages. These features take advantage of slang and other information that is typically ignored by text mining systems. Finally, this thesis demonstrates that this personal experience identification task is amenable to a transfer of learning approach, as knowledge about social media post content from one type of cancer can be transferred to another type of cancer or another type of chronic disease.\nThis technology has a number of applications in today\u2019s information-driven healthcare industry, including aggregating experiences with different treatments and medications, which could lead to more patient-centric delivery of healthcare.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9723], "author_name_tesi": "Murphy, William P", "last_name_ssi": "Murphy", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Yen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Yen, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["machine learning", "social media", "data mining", "health informatics"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Study Evaluating a Cognitive Behavioral Play Intervention for Kindergarten Students with Externalizing Behaviors", "id": "25813", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11386", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Children with high rates of externalizing behavior in early school years can be at a disadvantage for the rest of their time in school.

The first study looks at lossy polymeric infills introduced into metallic honeycombs with the goal that the resulting filled honeycombs simultaneously have high stiffness and an appreciable loss factor. This will be of interest in applications where structural damping is important. The second study looks at creating a bistable cellular structure, using the honeycomb as the basis for the unit cell. Morphing structures is the  area where a bistable structure could be of most use.\n\nFor the filled honeycomb a finite element analysis is conducted with the honeycomb walls modeled with beam elements and the polymeric infill modeled with shell elements. Soft (10 MPa) and stiffer (100 MPa) fillers are used, and the filled honeycombs are oriented to deform along the x- and the y-directions. The honeycomb is modeled as being made of aluminum. This thesis presents a discussion on the cell geometries that yield highest stiffness and loss factor, for loading in the different directions.  When the honeycomb is loaded, the Poisson's contraction of the cell walls in the transverse direction squeezes and increases the strain energy in the polymer, to levels significantly greater than that in an isotropic polymer sheet subject to the same global strain.  From the results in the study, it was observed that filled Aluminum honeycombs can achieve a Young's Modulus in the range of 2-7 GPa while simultaneously having a loss factor in the range of 5-10% for positive cell angles. Auxetic cells of the same material can achieve a Young's Modulus range of 6-10 GPa while simultaneously having a loss factor in the range of 5-10%. An experiment was conducted to validate the finite element model with the stiffness of both unfilled and filled honeycombs. The experimental results compared favorably with the unfilled honeycombs. The filled honeycomb illustrate the trends expected as the cell geometry is changed.\n\nThe bistable honeycomb is analyzed using a nonlinear finite element model. The walls of the honeycomb are modeled using beam elements. The honeycomb is assumed to be aluminum, however the material is assume linear. The design variations and modifications required to develop the bistable cell are explained. The final result is a modified honeycomb, which is bistable. The inclined walls are replaced with a sinusoidal curve that has zero slope at the midpoint and the endpoints. A horizontal bar has been added across the honeycomb, connecting the midpoints of the vertical walls. This bar and the vertical walls are considerably thicker than the sinusoidal wall to prevent buckling. The analysis of the bistable honeycomb is broken up into two parts. First the sinusoidal wall is isolated from the rest of the honeycomb, with a spring element standing in for the horizontal bar. The geometric properties are varied to determine the effect on important quantities. This allows for direct observation of the parameters that effect whether the system is bistable or not. Then the unit cell's geometric parameters are varied and the effect on the force-displacement curve is examined. From these two studies, conclusions about how the geometric parameter affect the bistable honeycomb are drawn. The concept is extended to multiple cell honeycombs, a sheet made up of unit cells. It is found that the unit cell results can be successfully extended to that of the sheet. A gradient stiffness of the bistable elements along the morphing direction is examined for controlling the load at which the rows snap-through. This arrangement allows a global load control to reliably transition the rows in a predetermined order, at a predetermined load.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2039], "author_name_tesi": "Murray, Gabriel Jon", "last_name_ssi": "Murray", "middle_name_ssi": "Jon", "first_name_ssi": "Gabriel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi", "Farhan Gandhi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi, Thesis Advisor", "Farhan Gandhi, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["bistable system", "Cellular Structures", "damping"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Structural and Aerodynamic Considerations of an Active Piezoelectric Trailing-edge Tab on a Helicopter Rotor", "id": "17657", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8429", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Rotorcraft have a unique ability not typically shared with their fixed-wing brethren, namely the ability to hover, maintaining position over a fixed point on the Earth in a zero-wind environment. The rotation of the rotorcraft's wings (rotor blades) allows them to experience apparent wind, even if the rotorcraft is not moving relative to the surrounding air. However, this ability comes at a cost, namely a more complex operating condition for the rotor. One of the consequences of this complex environment is increased noise and vibrations compared to airplanes. Research has been focused on this issue for some time, considering myriad methods of achieving noise and vibration reduction.\n\nThis dissertation is concerned with an active tab for use on a rotorcraft for noise and vibration reduction. The tab is located at the trailing edge of the airfoil. The tab consists of a shim sandwiched by layers of the piezoelectric actuators, macro fiber composites, of varying length. This configuration is similar to a bimorph. The modus operandi is similar to that of a trailing edge flap. The actuators deform the tab, bending it to achieve a tip displacement. This provides a change in the lift, moment, and drag coefficients of the airfoil. By actuating the system at 3/rev to 5/rev, reductions in noise and vibration can be realized. The system was examined and designed around using the UH-60 Blackhawk as the model rotorcraft. The tab is envisioned to operate between 65\\% to 85\\% of the main rotor span. The tab's chordwise dimensions considered were 20% and 15% of the blade chord.\n\nIn order to assess the potential of the tab to change the lift and moment coefficients of the airfoil-tab system, a steady computational fluid dynamics study was conducted. The results were generated via the University of Maryland's Transonic Unsteady Navier-Stokes code. Various tab deflection angles, Mach numbers, and angle-of-attack values were computed. These results were compared to a trailing edge flap of similar size. The comparison shows that the tab produces lift and moment increments similar to that of the trailing edge flap. The moment increment of the tab is consistently larger than the moment increment of the trailing edge flap. The 15% chord tab produces a smaller increment in lift and moment for a given tip deflection than the 20% chord tab. The longer tab has a lift coefficient on average 1.18 times the shorter tab and a moment increment 1.15 times that of the shorter tab. The design of the tab---composed of both active piezoelectric actuators and passive materials---was conducted using finite element analysis. The objectives were to maximize the tip deflection due to the actuators, while minimizing the deformation due to inertial and aerodynamic forces and loads. The inertial loads (acceleration terms) come from both blade motion, such as flapping and pitch, as well as the rotation of the rotor (centrifugal force). All of these previously mentioned terms cause the tab to undergo undesirable deflections. The original concept consisted of a bimorph configuration with a single layer of macro fiber composite the entire length of the 20% chord tab. The final design has three, tapered actuator layers on either side of a shim. Also, the length of the tab was reduced to 15% of the chord. A multitude of designs were compared via their performance objectives as well as how the design variables changed performances relative to the objectives. The result of this detailed analysis was the selection of several configurations that were investigated in detail.\n\nWith several designs selected, they formed the basis to build a prototype tab. This prototype was based on a 15% chord tab. Due to the available commercial actuator lengths, a two layer system was ultimately built. The tab tip displacement was measured with both static and harmonic inputs. Various input voltages, both with and without a DC offset, were tested, up to -500 V to 1500 V. The input frequency was varied between 0 Hz to 17.2 Hz. Also, a frequency response of the tab was generated. High voltage static tip displacement compares well with the expected result. The first bending natural frequency was measured at 138 Hz and compares well with the computed range of 135 Hz to 142 Hz, depending on bond layer thickness. The results of dynamic inputs uncovered an unexpected reduction in tip displacement of 60% to 65% of the static result, for high voltages. It is suspected that the actuator suffers from a time-dependent response, with quick initial displacement followed by a slow creeping to the final displacement value. This phenomena has also been observed in the literature, although it is not prevalent. \nUsing the experiment as a guide to quantify the time-dependent behavior, the overall viability of the system is discussed. The maximum dynamic tip deflection (accounting for time-dependent behavior) of a 15% chord tab is 4 deg. The tab is able to generate lift coefficient increments up to 0.413 and moment increments of -0.068 for positive tab deflections. Deflections due to aerodynamic loads range from 0.3 deg. to 2 deg. Deflections due to blade motions are less than 0.5 deg. and due to the centrifugal force, 0.78 deg. This system can be stiffened, reducing the dynamic tip deflection to 3.25 deg. and limiting the aerodynamic response to 1 deg. Overall, by designing the tab to modest deflections, moderate reductions in vibration are possible, but are limited by actuator authority.

First, revengers come from within an intimate circle of family and friends; second, the desire for revenge is maintained, and the act of revenge later justified, through story-telling within this circle. Crimes ostensibly committed against an individual affect those nearest to the injured party, particularly close friends and family. Consequently, the revenger almost always comes from one of these two groups. While the revenger obviously seeks to punish the wrongdoer, he or she can not stop there, for punishment is not enough; the wrongdoer must understand that he or she is paying the penalty for a previous misdeed.

The basaltic field has previously been classified as a northern portion of the Payenia Volcanic Complex, the more southerly parts of which are interpreted to have resulted from adiabatic melting associated with changes in slab dip during the late Oligocene through Miocene.  The retro-arc basalt samples are alkaline basalts, enriched in fluid mobile elements such as Cs, Ba, Pb, Sr, and Li, with moderate relative depletions in Nb and Ta.  These characteristics are typical of rear-arc basalts from subduction zones.  We propose that these basalts should be classified as retro-arc basalts associated with the Quaternary volcanic arc rather than as an extension of the more extensive Payenia Volcanic field to the south.  \nIt has been well documented that arc lavas in the NSVZ have distinctly higher 87Sr/86Sr and lower \u03b5Nd values than arc magmas found south of 34.5\u00b0S.  This chemical distinction has been interpreted as indicating a significant crustal contribution to rising magmas within the NSVZ.  The mechanism for this crustal contribution, however, has been largely debated.  Two models have been proposed to explain the driving force for this increased crustal signature:  1) increased assimilation of crustal material with elevated 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios and lower \u03b5Nd values due to thicker, older crust in the NSVZ, or 2) the subducting Nazca plate is eroding crustal material with elevated 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios and lower \u03b5Nd values and subducting it beneath the arc, where it mixes with and alters the composition of the mantle wedge, i.e. subduction erosion.  If the elevated 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios and lower \u03b5Nd values observed in the arc front lavas from the NSVZ were due to crustal contamination of the mantle source from subduction erosion, it can reasonably be expected the isotopic evidence for crustal contamination would be observable in the retro-arc basalts of the NSVZ, located a few tens of kilometers west of the arc front.  Conversely, if the isotopic evidence for crustal contamination were due to assimilation of thicker, older crust beneath the arc, then one would not expect to see similar isotopic evidence for crustal contamination in the retro-arc basalts.  The retro-arc basalts from this study have 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios of 0.7037 \u2013 0.7043, which is statistically different than 87Sr/86Sr  isotope ratios found in arc lavas of the NSVZ (87Sr/86Sr  = 0.7046-0.759).  Similarly, \u03b5Nd values retro-arc basalt samples from this study (\u03b5Nd = 1.4 to 4.4) is statistically different than \u03b5Nd values found in arc lavas of the NSVZ (\u03b5Nd = -1.8 to -0.19). This evidence suggests that the mantle beneath the NSVZ does not contain the elevated 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios and lower \u03b5Nd values observed in arc lavas of the NSVZ. Therefore, subduction erosion cannot be the driving mechanism for crustal contribution to ascending magmas in the NSVZ.  Instead, assimilation of crustal material within the older, thicker crust beneath the NSVZ must be the driving force for elevated 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios and lower \u03b5Nd values observed in NSVZ arc lavas. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9021], "author_name_tesi": "Murray, Timothy Talmadge", "last_name_ssi": "Murray", "middle_name_ssi": "Talmadge", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maureen Feineman", "Tanya Furman", "Peter Christopher Lafemina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maureen Feineman, Thesis Advisor", "Tanya Furman, Thesis Advisor", "Peter Christopher Lafemina, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Northern Southern Volcanic Zone", "NSVZ", "retro-arc basalts", "Sr isotopes", "Nd isotopes", "Hf isotopes", "Pb isotopes", "Payenia", "Andes"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Making of a God: Culture, Religion, and Sacral Monarchy in Duke Cosimo dei Medici's Florence\n", "id": "9454", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2122", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In 1537, the brutal murder of the heirless Duke Alessandro dei Medici brought the young and relatively inexperienced Cosimo dei Medici to the ducal chair of the most tumultuous city of the age: Renaissance Florence.

This dissertation illustrates that process in prehistory must be viewed both quantitatively and through the use of evolutionary models.  Using the general topic of agricultural intensification, I illustrate that studies of agriculture in prehistory must emphasize process over event, and quantitative over qualitative analysis.\n\nThe location of my research is the Classic Maya site of Caracol, Belize, which exhibits the clearest evidence for agricultural intensification in the Maya lowlands.

We transformed to near completion the 4850 members of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion collection of unessential genes in the 96-well format with a plasmid encoding a reporter protein, Trm1-II-GFP, which normally resides at the INM.  We found that deletion of genes encoding subunits of the N-terminal acetyltransferase, NatC, cause mislocation of Trm1-II-GFP from the INM to the nucleoplasm.  Mass spectroscopic analysis indicates that Trm1-II-GFP is N-acetylated.  N-terminal mutations of Trm1-II-GFP predicted to ablate N-acetylation cause nucleoplasmic location, whereas a variant with an N-terminal alteration predicted to allow N-acetylation by NatC is located at the INM, providing genetic support that Trm1p-II N-acetylation is necessary for its subnuclear INM location.  However, because N-acetylation appears not to be sufficient for INM targeting, it may provide a necessary role for INM targeting by affecting Trm1-II-GFP structure and exposure of cis-acting INM targeting motifs. We also discovered that YIL090W/Ice2p, an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, is necessary for efficient targeting of Trm1p-II-GFP to the INM.  YIL090W/Ice2p may serve as a tether for INM proteins or as a regulator of INM tethers.

The Mexican government aims at incorporating healthy food habits among school children through a National School Lunch Distribution Program, thereby reducing obesity-related health costs.

One of the most important strategic problems to be addressed is to design the location of distribution centers for the supply chain.\n \nThe objective of this thesis is to develop a facility location model to locate the distribution centers for a food supply chain based on the idea of Mexican School lunch program. A multi-commodity distribution network comprising farmers, distribution centers (DCs) and central preparation kitchens (CPKs), is formulated using a mixed integer linear program for this application. The CPKs are identified by grouping schools using clustering analysis based on their proximity. The facility location model is then solved using Benders Decomposition algorithm for different trial values with a maximum of 50 farmers, 50 DCs, 50 CPKs and 10 commodities. The solution technique is implemented using MATLAB and the results are analyzed. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5399], "author_name_tesi": "Murugaswamy, Rajeev ", "last_name_ssi": "Murugaswamy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rajeev", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Paul Griffin", "Dr Paul Griffin", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "Vittaldas V Prabhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Paul Griffin, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Paul Griffin, Thesis Advisor", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Thesis Advisor", "Vittaldas V Prabhu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Food Supply Chain", "Facility Location problem", "Benders Decomposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "DETECTING AND UNDERSTANDING THE PERSISTENCE OF A PREDOMINANT LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENES CLONE IN A COMMERCIAL FRESH MUSHROOM SLICING AND PACKAGING FACILITY", "id": "13335lxm977", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13335", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A longitudinal survey of non-food-contact surfaces in a commercial mushroom slicing and packaging facility was conducted to determine the prevalence, distribution, and potential routes of transmission of L. monocytogenes. Samples were taken at 3 sampling occasions over a 13- month period. Multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) was used to identify persistent and transient L. monocytogenes clones. The longitudinal study demonstrated that L. monocytogenes was present in 18.8% of samples. A trench drain and a wet porous concrete floor were identified as harborage sites for L. monocytogenes.\nMVLST identified 4 different virulence types (VTs) of L. monocytogenes in the facility: VT11, VT107, VT105, and VT56. Of these clones, VT11 predominated and was persistent at 2 sampling sites during all sampling periods over 13 months. Improvements made in sanitation practices and facilities maintenance between the second and third sampling periods decreased the prevalence of L. monocytogenes; however, complete elimination of the pathogen was not achieved. Therefore, the persistent and transient clones were further evaluated for their ability to tolerate quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) sanitizer, adherence to stainless steel (SS) and concrete coupons, and growth rate and peak cell density in mushroom broth.\nQAC tolerance among clones was investigated by growing them for 20-h (peak cell density) and 7 days (long-term-survival, (LTS), phase) at 35\u00b0C using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and survival (tolerance) assays. The MIC value of QAC for all L. monocytogenes clones was 9.1 ppm. However, VT11 and VT107 grew to a significantly (P \u2264 0.05) higher OD600 at sub-lethal QAC concentrations than VT105 and\niv\nVT56. In addition, LTS phase cells of VT11 were significantly (P \u2264 0.05) more tolerant (2.6 to 220 times) to in-use QAC concentration of 200 ppm compared to other clones. Clones did not differ significantly (P \u2264 0.05) in their ability to firmly adhere to concrete. However, on SS coupons, VT11 populations significantly (P \u2264 0.05) decreased more rapidly than the other clones (after 5 and 7 days) suggesting the former dispersed earlier from the surface. Concrete coupons harbored more cells (2.12 to 8.06 log CFU/cm2) than SS (1.14 to 6.12 log CFU/cm2) and were significantly (P \u2264 0.05) more protective of L. monocytogenes when treated with 200 ppm QAC.\nFive different fresh mushroom broth (MB) dilution levels, 30%, 10%, 5%, 0.5% and 0.05%, were used to determine growth rate and peak cell density of L. monocytogenes clones at 35\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C. The results showed that all L. monocytogenes clones were able to grow and/or survive in each of the MB dilutions. The generation time of L. monocytogenes clones in MB ranged between 38.45 and 207.06 min at 35\u00b0C and from 9.27 to 28.42 h at 10\u00b0C. However, VT11 grew rapidly to a significantly (P \u2264 0.05) higher peak cell density in 0.5% and 0.05% MB dilutions compared to other clones. The results indicate that VT11 may have a growth and survival advantage over other clones in nutrient-limited environments.\nOverall, the results suggest that the observed predominance and persistence of VT11 in the surveyed mushroom slicing and packaging facility can be at least partially explained by 1) higher peak cell density at low mushroom nutrient levels, 2) higher growth at sub-lethal QAC concentrations, 3) higher tolerance to in-use QAC concentration in the LTS phase, and 4) a more rapid dispersal from surfaces allowing colonization of new areas in the mushroom processing environment. Based on these\nv\nresults, a model was proposed to explain how several complex factors provide a competitive advantage for VT11 and thus the observed predominance and persistence within the mushroom processing facility. These results can be used to provide guidance on targeted interventions for reducing or controlling L. monocytogenes contamination in mushroom and other fresh produce processing facilities.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13413], "author_name_tesi": "Murugesan, Latha ", "last_name_ssi": "Murugesan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Latha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen John Knabel, Luke F Laborde", "Luke F Laborde", "Sara Rose Milillo", "Edward G Dudley", "Maryann Victoria Bruns"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen John Knabel, Luke F Laborde, Dissertation Advisor", "Luke F Laborde, Committee Chair", "Sara Rose Milillo, Committee Member", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Member", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Listeria monocytogenes", "persistence", "sanitizer tolerance", "adherence", "growth in mushroom broth", "prevalence", "fresh mushroom facility"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Extended Producer Responsibility Program For Household Hazardous Waste Management And Human Health Risk Assessment In Developing Countries: Ulaanbaatar City, Mongolia \n", "id": "27478", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12145", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "                                                  ABSTRACT\n\n\tOver two decades ago, the European Union developed and started implementing the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policy to prevent household hazardous waste (HHW) pollution and its environmental and human health risks. Because of the increase in population, rapid urbanization, and the amount of importing hazardous waste in developing countries, appropriate solid waste management and disposal are needed especially for HHW treatment. \n\tAs a developing country, Mongolia does not have specific regulations and treatment requirements for HHW. Unlike developed countries, the mandatory EPR policy run by government will be necessary for Mongolia because small and family-owned businesses are not willing to handle waste voluntarily due to the cost of collection, recycling, and final disposal. Moreover, a Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO) will face difficulties if advanced recycling fees and end-of-life fees from consumers fund the organization, since the country`s GDP per capita in 2014 was only US $11,508.98 (Trading economics). Therefore, under the EPR program, cooperation between a municipality and PROs is necessary and mutually beneficial, especially in waste collection and transporting.\n\tThis is especially important because of the potential health risks resulting from incineration of HHW. Due to open burning fluorescent bulbs in the central waste facility, it is estimated that 69,637kg Hg/yr could be released into the atmosphere directly. Human health risks from mercury exposure, using a traditional risk characterization procedure, showed potential neurological concerns (hazard quotient: 14.42, exposure time: 12hr/d) for children who live within 500m of this municipal waste incineration. In contrast, renal effects due to lead exposure (82.28kg Pb/yr) from lead-acid vehicle battery recycling factories showed a low health risk for children.  To prevent this children`s neurological effect implementation of the mandatory EPR program for HHW such as automobile batteries, fluorescent bulbs, and used tires is necessary in developing countries because most of MSW facility are designed poorly to capture emissions of hazardous substances.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11552], "author_name_tesi": "Murun, Temuulen ", "last_name_ssi": "Murun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Temuulen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Pollution Control", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shirley Elizabeth Clark"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shirley Elizabeth Clark, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Household Hazardous Waste", "Extended Producer Responsibility policy", "Human health risk assessment", "Heavy metals exposure"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Testing Geometric Properties  of Two-Dimensional Figures and Images ", "id": "14440mzm269", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14440", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We conduct a systematic study of sublinear-time algorithms for geometric properties of images.

B. bronchiseptica arnT, which encodes a protein that modifies the lipid A by adding glucosamine, was shown to be required for resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides.  Although arnT does not alter TLR4 agonist activity, the presence of arnT was necessary for transmission of B. bronchiseptica between hosts in the mouse model.

The decrease in caspase-1 is mediated through induction of autophagy.  This mechanism suggests a novel interplay between a recently characterized bacterial secretion system and inflammasome signaling and hints at a bacterial virulence strategy to manipulate potentially damaging immune responses.

The separator performance is determined from the predicted and measured values of pressure loss and particle collection efficiency.  The effectiveness of different louver and collector configurations are studied using a two-dimensional computational model matched to engine conditions at constant Reynolds number for a range of sand sizes.  An experimental method is developed to quantify the performance of two separator configurations that differ only in louver geometry.  Two- and three-dimensional computational models matched to lab experiment conditions predict the separator performance over a range of Reynolds numbers and sand sizes.\nTwo-dimensional predictions matched to engine conditions indicated that the orientation of the flow circulation in the collector was critical to successfully capturing the particles.  Two- and three-dimensional computational predictions matched to lab experiment conditions were within 10% of measured collection efficiencies.  The separator performance was measured to be consistent with predicted low pressure losses.

Segmentation of kidney images, especially into three primary tissue types- medulla, cortex, and pelvis is useful in computer-aided kidney surgery and disease diagnosis. \nSimilarly, the study of disorders in brain is aided by accurate segmentation of the tissues in magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. The three main tissues in the brain- cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter (GM), and white matter (WM) must be segmented as accurately as possible in order to assist in neuroscience and neuro-medicine studies.\nHowever, due to unknown noise, intensity inhomogeneity, heterogeneity among the tissues (prevalent in kidney MR images), and weak boundaries, segmentation of kidney and brain MR images is quite a challenge. Therefore, this thesis presents segmentation algorithms that use image processing, pattern recognition, and soft computing techniques for identifying different tissues in kidney and brain MR images.\nThis thesis integrates intuitionistic fuzzy sets, rough sets, and the concept of histon for the segmentation of kidney MR images. To reduce the uncertainty and vagueness in the kidney data, a novel membership function is proposed. This membership function is used to construct intuitionistic fuzzy representation for kidney MR images, which is in turn used to compute intuitionistic fuzzy roughness index. The intuitionistic fuzzy roughness index determines the significant peak and valley points, which provide accurate thresholds to segment the kidney MR image into medulla, cortex, and pelvis.\nThe membership function proposed in this thesis is also used to construct an intuitionistic fuzzy representation for the brain images. For the brain images too, intuitionistic fuzzy roughness index determines the significant peak and valley points. Using these valley points, brain MR images are segmented into three classes- cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey matter (GM), and white matter (WM). But prior to segmentation, extra-cranial tissues such as skull, meninges, and blood vessels are discarded using a skull-stripping algorithm.\nThe algorithms proposed for the segmentation of kidney and brain MR images are compared with the existing algorithms in their respective areas on the basis of quantitative indices such as under segmentation (UnS), over segmentation (OvS), incorrect segmentation (InS), Jaccard Similarity (JS), and Dice Coefficient (DC), which indicates better performance of the proposed algorithms for kidney and brain image segmentation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15627], "author_name_tesi": "Mushrif, Shreyas ", "last_name_ssi": "Mushrif", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shreyas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aldo Morales", "Susan Eskin", "Christopher Sica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aldo Morales, Thesis Advisor", "Susan Eskin, Committee Member", "Christopher Sica, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set", "Rough Sets", "Intensity Inhomogeneity", "Restricted Equivalence Functions", "Histon"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Reliability and Power Analysis of FinFET-based FPGAs", "id": "8699", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4518", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents the results of exploring hitherto unchartered territory for the emerging FinFET device: FPGAs. As the inexorable descent to lower technology nodes continues unabated, the resistance to soft errors and process variations on the one hand, and reduced sub-threshold leakage on the other, are features of increasingly critical importance. While the FinFET has been earmarked as the most likely successor to planar bulk CMOS given its relative robustness to soft errors and process variations and its reduced leakage figures, it has yet to be exploited for the reconfigurable architectures increasingly encroaching into the mainstream from the relatively obscure niches they had occupied in the past. While FPGAs have traditionally lagged behind microprocessors in terms of the prevalent technology node, they have already begun to be blighted by leakage issues in particular, in addition to the process variation and soft error vulnerability that are a part and parcel of smaller transistor sizes. The work featured in this report focused on comparing and contrasting FinFET-based FPGA architectures with bulk CMOS-based ones for the aforementioned problem areas. For sub-threshold leakage and process variation control, the Independent Gate Control feature of the FinFET device was explored, in contrast to body biasing for CMOS. The approach involved providing transistors turned off with a negative bias to the back gate for leakage control, and providing transistors turned on with varying positive biases to reflect the variation in their threshold voltages. Various granularities and bias values were explored for both devices in the search for the optimal ones. Results indicate that The FinFET-based fabric emerged as the superior FPGA architecture from a soft error perspective. Results further drive home the fact that CMOS body biasing, as expected, becomes less efficacious as technology scales. In contrast, FinFET-based FPGAs emerge as superior alternatives from a process variation perspective, requiring almost no correction, foregoing the use of the independent gate feature. Finally, leakage control utilizing the reverse bias approach turns out to be far more efficacious for FinFET-based fabrics, with a tiny reverse bias value serving to bring the leakage down drastically. Potential performance loss due to the switching from a reverse to a forward bias value emerges as a non-issue for the FinFET-based fabrics, unlike the CMOS-based ones.

The impact resistance was assessed through the use of both instrumented and uninstrumented impact testing conducted on two-way, simply supported panels.

The blast specimens consisted of six foot square by 6.5 inch deep concrete slabs exposed to 75 lbs of TNT at a standoff distance of 3.2 feet.  The results of both dynamic tests indicate the addition of carbon fibers significantly improves the blast and impact resistance of concrete.\nIn addition to dynamic testing, static testing was also conducted to determine the material properties of the carbon fiber reinforced concrete.  These tests included tensile, compressive and flexural testing.  Tensile testing was conducted using split cylinder testing as well as a direct tensile test developed through this testing program.

Applications include thin-film transistors (TFTs) utilized in flat \npanel displays and solar cells, oxides in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors \n(MOSFETs) for microprocessors and memory-cell access devices, low-dielectric constant \n(\u03ba) interlayer dielectrics which separate back-end of line interconnects, and several others. \nLike other systems, reducing performance limiting defects within amorphous systems is \ncritical for microelectronic integrated circuit (IC) development and improvement. Perhaps \nthe most powerful analytical tool for studying point defects in electronic materials is \nelectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). However, EPR is not sensitive enough to measure \ndefects in state-of-the-art microelectronic devices, since its sensitivity is limited to 1010 \ntotal defects. Additionally, EPR spectra of defects within amorphous systems often are \noften featureless due to the inherent disorder of these systems. This work utilizes an EPR\nbased approach, electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR), to study defect \nchemistry in amorphous semiconductors and dielectrics even when featureless spectra are \npresent. EDMR is the electrically detected analog of EPR in which EPR induced changes \nin device current are detected. In this study, EDMR is detected via changes in amorphous \nsemiconductor or dielectric tunneling current via spin-dependent trap assisted tunneling \n(SDTAT) events. Due to the nature of SDTAT, defects detected are directly linked to \nelectronic transport; an additional benefit of EDMR relative to EPR. Unlike EPR, \nSDTAT/EDMR may also be detected at any field/frequency combination without loss of \nsensitivity. As will be explained, this field/frequency independence allows for a distinction \nbetween EDMR line width contributions from electronic g tensor components or electron\niv \n \nnuclear hyperfine interactions, thus providing insight into defect chemistry when \nfeatureless spectra are present. Additionally, performing EDMR measurements at multiple \nbiases and comparing with MIS band diagrams allows for a rudimentary understanding of \ndefect energy levels. Finally, we utilize EDMR to understand near-zero-field \nmagnetoresistance (MR) phenomena, which are of interest for spin-transport applications \nsuch as spin-valves and magnetometers.  \n The EDMR techniques utilized in this study are relatively new, and have not been \nexploited to study a wide range of electronic materials. Thus, in Chapter 4, baseline EDMR \nmeasurements are provided in relatively simple amorphous systems including a-Si:H and \na-C:H. We find that EDMR spectra in a-Si:H and a-C:H systems are due to silicon and \ncarbon dangling bonds, respectively. Additionally, we utilize multiple frequency EDMR \nto provide additional information regarding contributions of line width due to the breadth \nof g tensor components in the featureless a-Si:H and a-C:H EDMR spectra. By providing \na measurement of g tensor breadth, \u0394g, we develop a baseline for distinguishing between \nsilicon and carbon dangling bonds in more complex systems, such as low-\u03ba dielectrics a\nSiOC:H and a-SiCN:H, in which silicon and/or carbon dangling bonds may be present.  \n Low-\u03ba dielectric constant materials are critical for reducing parasitic capacitances \ndue to the scaling of back-end of line interconnects. In Chapter 4, we first utilize \nconventional EPR measurements to study a variety of porous low-\u03ba dielectric powders. Via \nconventional EPR on these low-\u03ba powders, we are able to analyze the effects of UV \nradiation and remote hydrogen plasma upon the low-\u03ba systems. Our results indicate that \nUV treatments, which are utilized to eliminate sacrificial porogens to introduce pores, \nsignificantly increase defect density. Remote hydrogen plasma (RHP) treatments are found \nv \n \nto decrease dangling bond concentration. However, due to the featureless EPR spectra, we \nare unable to provide insight into defect chemistry via conventional EPR. Thus, we utilize \nmultiple field/frequency EDMR in these low-\u03ba systems, and compare \u0394g measurements \nwith previous baseline measurements, to provide insight into defect chemistry which was \npreviously unavailable. We find a multitude of silicon and carbon dangling bonds in a\nSiOCH and a-SiCN:H dielectrics. Defect chemistry seems to depend upon precursor \nchemistry. Additionally, EDMR measurements confirm that UV treatments in low-\u03ba \nsystems introduce silicon dangling bonds, suggesting that these treatments may be \ndamaging the Si-O-Si network in a-SiOC:H systems. Finally, we perform EDMR \nmeasurements at multiple biases to get a general understanding of defect energy levels in \nthese systems. Band gaps are calculated via reflected electron energy loss spectroscopy \n(REELS), and band offsets are calculated via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We \nfind that carbon dangling bonds in a-SiOC:H systems have levels near the middle of the a\nSiOC:H band gap, and silicon dangling bonds in a-SiCN:H systems have levels near the \nupper-middle part of the a-SiCN:H band gap. \n In Chapter 5, we analyze silicon nitride (a-SiN:H) thin films, which are widely \nutilized in the electronics industry as gate dielectrics for TFTs. However, defects and \nelectronic transport in these systems are not fully understood. We utilize multiple \nfrequency EDMR and variable bias EDMR to better understand defect chemistry and \nenergy levels in a-SiN:H systems. It is found that K centers, which have been previously \nobserved in a-SiN:H via EPR and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), are \nprimarily responsible for transport in these systems. Additionally, we find that K centers \nvi \n \nare about 3.1 eV above the a-SiN:H valence band edge, in agreement with previous \ntheoretical calculations. \n In Chapter 6, we illustrate that near-zero field MR phenomena are ubiquitous in \namorphous semiconductors and dielectrics. We link the MR and EDMR responses by \nmeasuring response amplitude for each technique versus bias. The observed EDMR and \nMR versus bias trends are nearly identical, suggesting that the defects responsible for each \ntechnique correspond to similar energy levels. Though circumstantial, our measurements \nprovide strong evidence that the defects whose chemistry is plausibly identified via \nmultiple frequency EDMR are primarily responsible for MR in the amorphous \nsemiconductors and dielectrics in this study.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14010], "author_name_tesi": "Mutch, Michael James", "last_name_ssi": "Mutch", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick M.

The study of reflexes in humans has focused on the idea that these circuits serve as a mechanism for regulating the mechanical properties of the limb while performing tasks in various dynamical\nenvironments. Consistent with this idea, task-dependent modulation of reflex responses has been documented over multiple studies. The general interpretation of these findings has been that modulation of reflex responses is one way in which the nervous system alters limb impedance that is presented to various loads that might act on it. However, most of these studies have examined conditions in which the maintenance of a stable posture is emphasized, perturbations used to elicit reflexes are predictable and the goal of the task remains fixed. Such predictability is rarely a feature of everyday movements, and whether and how reflex responses can be modulated during movement under unpredictable task conditions remains poorly understood. Moreover, whether reflex modulation is limited to occur within a limb, or whether reflexes can be flexibly organized across limbs remains an open question. In a series of three experiments, we investigate whether modulation of upper-limb reflex responses can occur during the course of movement. Our results show that reflex responses can be significantly tuned during movement. This modulation occurs in response to changes in task goals and is sensitive to the direction but not the amplitude of the change in goal. Moreover, reflex modulation can occur not just within a limb, but also across limbs when achievement of the task goal requires cooperation between them. Importantly, the modulation is such that reflex responses are enhanced when they assist in achievement of the task goal, but reduced when they resist goal achievement. Thus reflex circuits appear to be tuned in a goal-optimal manner. These results significantly enhance our understanding of the modulation of reflex responses and demonstrate the immense flexibility available within the central nervous system even as a movement is being performed.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4890], "author_name_tesi": "Mutha, Pratik K", "last_name_ssi": "Mutha", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Pratik", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert L Sainburg", "Robert L Sainburg", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Jinger Gottschall", "Byron C Jones"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert L Sainburg, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert L Sainburg, Committee Chair", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Member", "Jinger Gottschall, Committee Member", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Movement", "Reflex", "Modulation", "Humans", "Sensory information"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Prediction of Performance Measures for Buses: A System-Based Approach\n", "id": "7414", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4822", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Heavy vehicles transport people and freight in an efficient manner and form the backbone of any developed economy. Historically, heavy vehicle standards (called Design Based Standards-DBS) have relied primarily on placing limits on vehicle weights and dimensions. Ease of implementation and lack of complete understanding of the complex relationships between vehicle design parameters and vehicle performance are the primary reasons such standards have been in place for decades. However, recently there has been a realization that such indirect control of vehicle performance can lead to a wide gap between intended performance and actual performance. A concept called Performance Based Standards (PBS) that assigns numerical limits to performance measures but leaves open ways of achieving the performance has now gained attention. However, for an effective implementation of PBS and for an optimal design of vehicles capable of achieving such performance, it is imperative that vehicle designers, test engineers and regulatory authorities alike have a sound understanding of the complex relationships that exist between vehicle design parameters and vehicle performance.\n \nThe primary goal of this thesis was to establish and validate methods of analysis that can be used to investigate the relationships between vehicle design and performance. The other main goals include development of a reliable means of predicting the useful range of values for vehicle design parameters that would result in a vehicle with desired performance objectives (one or more) and evaluation of the effectiveness of PTI (Pennsylvania Transportation Institute) testing with an aim to suggest ways for further improvement. The thesis discusses four performance measures, namely fuel economy, acceleration and gradeability, pass-by noise and vehicle reliability primarily because PTI data were readily available for these measures. However, as the methods developed in this thesis are very general in nature, they can be used for analyzing other vehicle performance measures as well, provided reliable and accurate data are available. \n \nIn this thesis, a two-stage system based model was implemented. In the first stage, functional relationships between vehicle design parameters and vehicle performance under laboratory/test track conditions were modeled using a vehicle transformation, F. In the second stage, the interdependence between test-track performance and real-life traffic performance was modeled using a traffic transformation, G. PTI data on fuel economy, acceleration and gradeability, pass-by noise and reliability for 124 diesel two-axle transit buses were used to model the vehicle transformation, F. On the other hand, the traffic transformation, G, was modeled using in-use data (at transit agencies) on fuel economy and reliability obtained from the National Transit Database (NTD). \n\nModeling was done using two artificial neural network (ANN) based methods \u2013 N2PFA/REFANN proposed by Setiono et al. and RF5 proposed by Saito and Nakano. Both approaches have built-in rule generation capabilities and an automatic means for selection of the number of hidden neurons. Hence the problem of ANN being a black box is alleviated with either approach. A two-step method of input selection was used in this study. Firstly, correlation coefficients were evaluated between all pairs of input variables. Based on the assumption that a low correlation coefficient (< 0.7) can be used as a measure of linear independence, inputs that are least correlated to other inputs were selected. In the second step, an information theory based approach was used to narrow this input set down to a still smaller subset that contains most of the original information and is a good predictor of the output (vehicle performance measure) under study.\n \nOften it is also of interest to know vehicle configurations that can achieve desired vehicle performance objectives. To this effect, a means for generating an inverse model based on non-linear programming is also presented. In this thesis, inversions were obtained starting from each known bus (the ANN training set) as a reference point. The final solution (inversion) selected was the one closest in terms of Euclidean distance to an existing bus. The main idea behind using such an objective function was ease of manufacture. However, one can easily modify the objective function as per one\u2019s requirement and achieve corresponding optimal solutions. Engineers often face the issue of determining a vehicle configuration that can simultaneously achieve more than one competing objectives. This study shows that Gembicki\u2019s Goal Attainment method for multi-objective optimization can be very effective for this purpose.\n         \nThe results from the fuel economy and acceleration models validate the accuracy of the two ANN-based methods used in this study. This opens the way for use of these two methods for modeling other performance measures wherein knowledge may be inadequate. The two methods not only corroborate well with each other with respect to most relevant and least relevant inputs but also seem to perform better than two of the commonly used modeling methods, namely regression and decision tree. Further, unlike regression, the two methods make no assumption on the nature of the functional relationship being modeled.\n \nThe nonlinear effect of vehicle weight on fuel economy of a bus is clearly brought out in this study. This is in contrast with existing literature that suggests a linear dependence. With regards to whole vehicle pass-by noise models, the methods used in this study were able to generate models that are very close in accuracies with the best such model (+/-1.1 dB(A)) described in literature while using only 1.2% of the number of data samples. This study confirms the importance of vehicle weight in determining reliability and also brings forth the possible case for vehicle height as an important determining factor.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4799], "author_name_tesi": "Muthiah, Saravanan ", "last_name_ssi": "Muthiah", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Saravanan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Litzinger", "Dr Mirna Urquidi Macdonald", "Timothy William Simpson", "Sean N Brennan", "Shelley Marie Stoffels"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Litzinger, Committee Chair", "Dr Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Committee Chair", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "Sean N Brennan, Committee Member", "Shelley Marie Stoffels, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["acceleration and gradeability", "fuel economy", "Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)", "Transit buses", "Performance Based Standards (PBS)", "pass-by noise", "reliability", "multi-criteria optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF KINESIN-2 MECHANOCHEMISTRY\n", "id": "8285", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2158", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Kinesins are biological motors with the remarkable capability of coupling chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into structural changes that generate force and directed motion along microtubules.  Serving as a model protein, findings from single molecule kinesin biophysics provide general insights into mechanobiology.  Kinesin comprises of 14 families that vary in structure, function and biophysical properties.  The goal of this project is to elucidate details of the chemomechanical coordination between the two heads of the Kinesin-2 motor family, during their processive stepping and relate their in vitro biophysical properties to their in vivo behavior.  Kinesin-2 motors are involved in intraflagellar transport as well as cytoplasmic transport of melanosomes.\n\n\tUnderstanding protein behavior at the single molecule level requires developing techniques to image and manipulate them.  In chapter 2, development of quantum dots as fluorescent tags to enhance spatial and temporal resolution of imaging is discussed.  Kinesin-1 was tagged with biotinylated quantum dots and viewed using epifluorescence and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM).  Both techniques exhibited similar image resolution and the velocities and run lengths obtained compared favorably with values in literature.  \n\n\tOptical tweezers open avenues in mechanobiology by enabling the application of mechanical loads and manipulation of single molecules. An optical tweezer was constructed with back focal plane interferometry detection, and detailed calibration was performed.  Preliminary data of motor stepping with 8 nm step sizes at low motor velocity was demonstrated.  This optical trap was used to conduct bead assays at minimal loads to study the processivity and velocity of Kinesin-1 and Kinesin-2 motors.  Mouse KIF3A/B was compared to homodimeric chimeras, KIF3A/A and KIF3B/B, and to conventional Kinesin-1 motors.  At saturating ATP, KIF3A/B moved at 436 \u00c2\u00b1 129 nm/s and the homodimers moved at similar speeds, while Kinesin-1 moved at 703 \u00c2\u00b1 136 nm/s.  The run lengths of all three KIF3 motors were approximately 600 nm, while the run length for Kinesin-1 was three-fold higher.  When the ATP concentration was reduced from 1 mM down to 1 \u00c2\u00b5M, Kinesin-1 run lengths were constant, consistent with previous reports.  This implies that Kinesin-1 waits in the same chemomechanical state regardless of the time it takes for ATP to bind.  In contrast, the run length of KIF3A/A increased nearly three-fold when the ATP was lowered from 1 mM to 1 \u00c2\u00b5M.  This implies that during the time the motor waits for ATP to bind at limiting ATP levels, the motor transitions to a different chemomechanical state, resulting in a lower probability of detachment following ATP binding.

This goal is typically achieved by placing authorization hooks at appropriate locations in server code. The goal of authorization hook placement is to completely mediate all security-sensitive operations on shared resources while satisfying optimality guarantees with respect to an access control policy.\nTo date, authorization hook placement in code bases, such as the X server and postgresql, has largely been a manual procedure, driven by informal analysis of server code, and discussions on developer forums. There is even lack of consensus on basic concepts, such as the definition of what constitutes a security-sensitive operation.\nIn this thesis, we propose that program analysis techniques may be used to infer security-sensitive objects and operations in programs and automatically identify a hook placement that satisfies certain optimality guarantees. To support this thesis, we first discuss an approach that uses graph cuts to solve information flow errors. We show how this approach can be used to solve errors in both programs and distributed system deployments. However, this approach is not effective enough to deal with all aspects of the authorization hook placement problem, specifically inferring security specification.\nNext, We designed an approach to identify security-sensitive objects and operations that is motivated by a novel observation \u2014 whenever a user makes deliberate choice of objects from a collection of objects and requests a specific operation to be performed on the object, this operation must be authorized. We have built a tool that uses this observation to statically analyze the server source. Using real-world examples (the X server and postgresql), we show that hooks placed using our approach are just as effective as hooks that were manually placed over the course of several years.\nFinally, we propose a formal approach to reason about optimal hook placements with respect to placement choices that programmers have to make. We demonstrate how constraints on authorization policies can help minimize authorization hook placeements. We also show that using our hook placement approach reduces the number of manual choices programmers have to make.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9192], "author_name_tesi": "Muthukumaran, Divya ", "last_name_ssi": "Muthukumaran", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Divya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Trent Ray Jaeger", "Patrick Drew Mcdaniel", "Adam Smith", "John Joseph Hannan", "Stephen George Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Trent Ray Jaeger, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick Drew Mcdaniel, Committee Member", "Adam Smith, Committee Member", "John Joseph Hannan, Committee Member", "Stephen George Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Static Analysis", "Authorization"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Legitimate or not \u2013 learning the status of online pharmacies", "id": "hd76s004z", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13007", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous research has indicated the presence of illegitimate online pharmacies on the World Wide Web, which may be involved in sales of counterfeit or substandard products which have the potential for drug abuse.

Following the training all nine special education teachers increased the number of evocative communication opportunities provided to students with CCN.

The very manifestation of these common deleterious effects means that the occurrence of drought across the region constitutes a disruption to the proper operation of pastoralism\u2014one of the major primary livelihood upon which region\u2019s economies are buttressed. Like similar livelihood in the region, nomadic Maasai-pastoralism (NMP) has suffered the brunt of droughts. The manifestation of these common deleterious effects is likely to intensify as the climate continues to change. Although, extensive research undertakings and academic discourses have addressed the patterns and processes of precipitation for Africa; and the effects of drought on pastoralism are widely documented for Kenya, and indeed for all the countries of the GHA, information about this hazard and its effects on NMP has never been discussed alongside concerns of climate change and cross-scale social and biophysical factors. So far, the interplay among these factors on NMP is not well understood, the exact mechanism of how drought-vulnerability of NMP evolves is unknown, and whether the occurrence of frequent droughts, coupled with these factors will accommodate NMP has not been explored. This dissertation uses an integrated approach to examine the effects of drought on the NMP, and to define key factors affecting the drought-adaptive capacity of the Maasai pastoralists of Kajiado District, Kenya. The study argues that drought-adaptive capacity of the Maasai is as much a socially constructed and existing condition, as it is a biophysically generated one, is embedded in Maasai\u2019s regular livelihood, and is scalar. The empirical evidence from the current study shows that drought is a common occurrence in the district. It also reveals that pressures from variable and historically contingent social and biophysical conditions and happenings are hampering the adaptive operation of NMP; and that drought occurrence is only partially responsible for the presently inadequate drought-adaptive capacity of the Maasai. Taken together, the findings of the study suggest that efforts toward enhancing drought-adaptation and drought-adaptive capacity of the Maasai should be based on a holistic understanding of the social-biophysical landscapes within which NMP is entrenched.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8049], "author_name_tesi": "Mwangi, Margaret ", "last_name_ssi": "Mwangi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Margaret", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan H Taylor", "Alan H Taylor & C Gregory Knight", "Karl Stephen Zimmerer", "Michael Gregory Jacobson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan H Taylor, Dissertation Advisor", "Alan H Taylor & C Gregory Knight, Committee Chair", "Karl Stephen Zimmerer, Committee Member", "Michael Gregory Jacobson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Maasai", "Kenya", "Drought", "Adaptations", "Impacts", "Climate Change", "Africa"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "BLACK AFRICAN INTERNATIONAL ADULT STUDENTS\u2019 EXPERIENCES IN HIGHER EDUCATION: A QUALITATIVE STUDY\n", "id": "8174", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6632", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\nMaking the decision to attend higher educational institutions in the United States is a major life event that affects non-traditional-age, adult international students. Much has been written on international students in psychology and sociology but hardly any literature exists addressing non-traditional-age or adult international students per se. This lack of literature on adult international learners in adult and higher education is an indication that this population of learners and their contributions to higher education has been overlooked. Even more lacking are literature addressing Black African adult international students. \nThe purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of adjusting to U.S. culture among non-traditional-age, adult Black African international students while attending predominantly White higher education institutions. This study explored how the role of race as well as cultural background informs their experiences as Black African adult international students, thus distinguishing them from other international students. In order to explore the lived experiences of these students, a qualitative research method drawing largely on heuristic phenomenology as well as insights from critical race theory as applied to research was employed. Purposive sampling was used to identify participants for this study and in-depth personal interviews as well as a focus group interview were the primary means of data collection.\nThe theoretical framework for the study is drawn from three intersecting areas. Critical Race Theory and sociocultural theories drawing from John Ogbu, Franz Fanon, and scholars from adult and higher education inform the educational aspects of this study. These theoretical approaches are relevant to the study since they explicitly attend to culture, ethnicity, race, class, and gender that affect adult Black African international students in the U.S. system of higher education.  Given the emphasis on international students\u2019 adjustment, Jandt\u2019s (2004) acculturation model also informs this study\nFive themes emerged from this research that constituted the experiences of Black African international adult students. First, the perceived motivations that influenced Black African adult international students to study in the United States are highlighted to give background to the study. The second set of findings focus on the challenges encountered by participants as a result of facing a new educational system. The third set of findings focus more specifically on participants\u2019 growing awareness of race, while the fourth set deal with the realities of being in a new culture. The last set of findings center on post-arrival experiences in the United States\u2019 educational journey.\nThe study provides key implications for adult education and also recommendations for faculty and higher education administration working with Black African adult international students on American university campuses.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6630], "author_name_tesi": "Mwaura, John N.", "last_name_ssi": "Mwaura", "middle_name_ssi": "N.", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Senel Poyrazli", "Peter Jones Kareithi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Chair", "Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Member", "Senel Poyrazli, Committee Member", "Peter Jones Kareithi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["international students", "adult students", "nontraditional students", "Black africans", "phenomenology", "heuristic"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Team Temporal Leadership: Construct Development and Validation\n", "id": "11439", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "391", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recently, researchers have called for an increased emphasis on time\u2019s role in team and leadership research.

Plants as bioindicators of ozone are commonly used to detect phytotoxic levels of tropospheric ozone where physical/chemical/electrical monitoring equipment cannot be utilized due to expense, electrical needs, or availability of instruments. Asclepias syriaca (Common Milkweed) has been effectively used as a bioindicator for ozone. Visual ozone injury on Common Milkweed is characterized as purple stippling of the upper surface of older leaves as the season progresses, the purple coloration of the upper leaf surface may encompass most of the leaf surface. While sensitivity to ozone has been documented on Common Milkweed, less is known about the ozone sensitivity of other Asclepias species and little is known regarding the concentration dose response of Common Milkweed to ozone and timing of visual symptoms. \nOf the Asclepias species evaluated Tropical Milkweed (A. curassavica) had the greatest ozone injury throughout the experiment, suggesting that the species might be a more sensitive bioindicator to ozone than Common Milkweed. However, high levels of leaf loss during the season may negate its usefulness as a bioindicator. Levels of ozone injury on Swamp Milkweed (A. incarnata) were not significantly different from the standard Common Milkweed, and with the exception of the afore mentioned, ozone injury values were typically greater than observed on Common Milkweed. This suggests that ozone injury on Swamp Milkweed develops more quickly or at a greater amount than on Common Milkweed. However, because the injury values were not significantly different, Swamp Milkweed may be a useful ozone-sensitive bioindicator species in the field. The other milkweed species Showy Milkweed (A. speciosa), Prairie Milkweed (A. sullivantii), and Spider Milkweed (A. viridis), developed distinguishable ozone injury symptoms (including dark stippling), and non-significantly different injury ratings from Common Milkweed, suggesting that these species are comparable and may be useful as field bioindicators in addition to or in lieu of Common Milkweed. \nThe amount of injury on Common Milkweed rose at an increasing rate over time and with higher levels of ozone (e.g. 60-90 ppb). Plants exhibited phytotoxic injury at 60 ppb, below the current NAAQS of 70 ppb ozone, which may indicate that the current standard may not be strict enough. Plants exposed to 90 ppb ozone developed injury, although less severe, at the same time as those plants exposed to 90ppb ozone. This result combined with the curvilinear relationship described above indicates that Common Milkweed remains a viable indicator at this level of phytotoxic ozone.

Employing these methodologies in the field of artificial photosynthesis could be a tractable solution to the often difficult synthetic challenge of linking donors and acceptors together in a systematic fashion. Successful application of these techniques would provide a wide ranging\nlibrary of metals and ligands to fine tune compounds by which excited state energy or electrons may be passed from one complex to another, ultimately to do work, e.g. catalyze a reaction. This thesis describes the design and synthesis of peptide sequences capable of binding transition metal ions to self-assemble heterometallic complexes and the resulting photophysical effects of that complexation.\n\nTris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) complexes were derivatized with aminoethylglycine (aeg) backbones that are arranged in a \u201chairpin\u201d configuration. Pendant bipyridine (bpy) ligands are complementary to each other and addition of transition metal ions (copper (II), zinc (II), or\npalladium (II)) form [M(bpy)2]2+ complex(es) through intra-molecular ligand coordination.  Peptide coupling chemistry was used to design and synthesize sequences that bind solution metals\nin a predetermined fashion. To accomplish this, advances in peptide coupling techniques were improved greatly through application of solution phase syntheses that produced gram scale quantities of di-and tri-peptides, a significant advancement over milligram scale yields through\nsolid-phase supported syntheses. Metal binding of Cu2+ ions was measured through fluorescence quenching measurements (steady state and transient) that indicated stoichiometric metal binding to the peptide scaffolds. Through peptide coupling chemistry, we successfully increased the\ndonor-acceptor (Ru-Cu) distance to provide information as to whether energy or electron transfer dominated the emission quenching event. \n\nTo answer unexpected observations of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ quenching by Zn2+, the effects of metal ion binding on the peptide scaffold and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ were measured through NMR spectroscopy. The Ru-hairpin structure was assigned using two-dimensional NMR techniques and indicated two major conformations at room temperature in dimethylsulfoxide solutions thus complicating the spectra. A model compound was synthesized excluding sources of hindered rotation to paint a clearer picture and the effect of Zn2+ binding was measured through NMR titrations that indicated a significant change in chemical environment of Ru-coordinated bpy ligands.  \n\nAn advantage of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexes is bpy ligands maybe be charged with a varying number of reactive acyl chloride groups. Reaction of these with amine-terminated peptides can easily increase the number of aeg strands. To demonstrate this, the number of hairpins was also\nincreased from one to two or three placing [Ru(bpy)3]2+ at the center of a multimetallic complex and imparting metal coordination in three dimensions. These complexes were compared with\nsingle hairpin complexes capable of binding two Cu2+ centers to further emphasize peptide dictation on [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photophysical properties. These complexes also served as a starting point to synthesize a tri-heterometallic complex. \n\nThe peptide scaffold also offers the unique possibility of linking known donor-acceptor\npairs to determine if photocatalysis is possible on our peptides. [Ru(Me2 bpy)3]2+ is liked with\none, two, and three [(bpy)Pd(CH3)(CH3CN)]+ complexes through the aeg backbone, that when\nirradiated with light (> 455 nm) are able to photocatalyze the dimerization of \u00e1-methyl styrene. These compounds represent the first example of a photocatalytic reaction performed on our scaffolds.\n\nFinally, a series of compounds is presented that demonstrate the modularity of these species along with a discussion of transient absorption spectroscopy measured for single hairpins. The complexes presented are designed and synthesized with the specific intension of exploiting the modularity in metal complex coordination chemistry and peptide coupling chemistry to\nincrease spectroscopic complexity, complex rigidity, and metal identity.

These three plays serve as a case study revealing this interplay in the theatrical genres of comedy, tragedy, and romance. Specifically, music serves as the chief expressive and communicative tool that unites the mortal and divine realms. In each play, the literal and aesthetic qualities of music create a forum for the human and supernatural realms to interact and intertwine, thereby irrevocably transforming their individual identities into a shared existence. \n\tIn A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, both the fairies and humans ultimately lay aside their frivolous and childish ways and, through musical exchange, step into a mature shared existence. In Macbeth, however, the evil witches use music to confuse and manipulate Macbeth and use the physical and metaphorical attributes of music to draw humanity into self-destruction. Finally, in The Tempest, physical and ethereal lines are blurred as Prospero uses the musical talents of his subjects in conjunction with his own magical powers to manipulate his enemies. \n\tCommonalities between these plays abound. First, music is continually linked with figures of authority, either supernatural or human. Music appears in conjunction with mystical surroundings, such as a lush forest or thunder and lightning. Music also serves the purpose of entertainment through manipulation. Lastly, music has a communicative and expressive power to affect the listener in unparalleled ways.

Using the framework of Waldman and Spangler\u2019s Determinates of Individual Job Performance and the Job Demands\u2013Resources (JD\u2013R) Model to guide the research, findings from this study enhance the fields of workforce development and academic advising by enhancing understanding of employee engagement and the factors that influence it, specifically in the field of academic advising. This study brought together existing literature and research related to three areas that laid the foundation for this study: employee engagement, academic advising, and performance. The narrative inquiry method was used to examine the factors that influence the work engagement of academic advisors. The research questions were: (1) What defines the professional academic advisers\u2019 work engagement experience; (2) What factors contribute to the manifestation of highly engaged academic advisers; (3) What self-reported issues negatively impact the work engagement of academic advisers; and (4) What, if any, coping strategies do academic advisers employ to address those issues? A semi-structured interview instrument was developed and trialed using the assistance of 2 individuals serving as participants. Data collection consisted of 15 interviews with 5 professional academic advisors from across the country. Collected data were coded using a line-by-line coding technique. Analysis of data resulted in the development of six themes: Theme 1: Positive Experiences with Advisors; Theme 2: Desire to Help Others; Theme 3: Strategies for Handling Stressful Times; Theme 4: Additional Duties and Responsibilities; Theme 5: Leadership Support and Understanding; Theme 6: Training and Development Opportunities. Findings from this will help leaders of all organizations but especially those in educational institutions that employ professional academic advisors. The information collected could be used by universities administrators, managers, front-line supervisors, and all those with a vested interest in employee engagement and organization success.

Children diagnosed with disabilities such as ADHD are often associated with disruptions in family functioning and\nincreased levels of caregiver strain. Parenting of children with ADHD varies with gender and race/ethnicity; however, little work has investigated any differential impact that these and other factors can have on the amount of stress reported by parents of children with ADHD.\nMethods: Data from the 2003 National Survey of Children\u2019s Health was used to examine caregiver strain among parents of children diagnosed with ADHD. Latent Class Analysis\nwas used to identify risk profiles related to caregiver strain among parents of children with ADHD. LCA is a statistical technique used to identify subgroups of individuals who\nshare a similar pattern of responses to a set of observed items. Latent class analysis with covariates was then used to identify variations in parent associations to each of the latent classes based on race/Ethnicity, child gender, household income and education.\nResults: Among the 6,513 children with ADHD, 80.1% were white, 11.5% African-American, and 8.4% Hispanic and 72.1% were boys. The analysis revealed four unique classes of caregiver strain within the population; High Strain (21.5%), Moderate \u2013\nRelating (43.7%), Moderate \u2013 Giving and Caring (18.3 %), and Low Strain (16.5%). White caregivers are more than twice as likely to belong to the Moderate and High Strain classes compared to the black caregivers. Caregivers of boys are more likely to be in one of the Moderate Strain classes, caregivers of girls are slightly more likely to belong to the High Strain class. Caregivers with an education less than high school are more likely to\nbelong to the Low Strain class, and caregivers in households with income less than 300% FPL are more than three times as likely to belong to the High Strain class.\nConclusions: These results identify a significant influence of child gender, race/ethnicity, household education and income on the type of strain reported by caregivers of children diagnosed with ADHD.

In order to use symbols to refer to something, one must recognize that other minds do not necessarily share one\u2019s own knowledge of, intentions for, or interpretation of symbols. \n\nThe current study examined the development of this component of symbol understanding in 6- to 9-year-old children. Children made a map to communicate to a symbol-user about hidden toys. Additionally, they evaluated whether maps made by other children communicated effectively. In both tasks, the resemblance between the symbol and referent was manipulated \u2013 children either received iconic symbols that somewhat resembled the referents, or they received abstract symbols that did not resemble the referents. \n\nIt was predicted that children\u2019s success on these symbol-communicative tasks would be related to their awareness that other minds construe meaning in many different but equally valid ways (interpretive mind). In particular, success should depend upon children\u2019s recognition that even when symbols resemble their referents, resemblance alone is not sufficient to convey meaning to a na\u00efve symbol-user. This is particularly true in a context (such as the one used here) in which the same symbol might reasonably have been assigned to represent a different referent. \n\nResults showed that all children relied primarily on notations (words or pictures) rather than symbol resemblance to communicate meaning. Older children were especially sensitive to the information that the symbol-user needed to know, and were more likely than younger children to attempt map keys to communicate this knowledge. Specifically, older children were more likely than younger children to create categorical representations, using one type of symbol to represent one type of toy. Furthermore, interpretive theory of mind predicted children\u2019s success on the symbol-communication tasks above and beyond chronological age, global intelligence, or memory. \n\nOverall, this study shows that 6- to 9-year-olds\u2019 symbolic development is associated with their ability to recognize that people actively interpret and assign meaning to symbols. Elementary school-aged children gradually come to understand that graphic symbols do not have inherent, fixed meaning, but rather reflect the intentions and decisions of the people who create them. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3756], "author_name_tesi": "Myers, Lauren Jeanette", "last_name_ssi": "Myers", "middle_name_ssi": "Jeanette", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lynn Susan Liben", "Richard Alan Carlson", "Rick Owen Gilmore", "Carol Anne Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lynn Susan Liben, Committee Chair", "Richard Alan Carlson, Committee Member", "Rick Owen Gilmore, Committee Member", "Carol Anne Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cognitive processes", "developmental psychology", "symbol", "symbolism", "theory of mind", "graphic representation", "map", "cognitive development", "communication"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Aerodynamic Experiments on a Ducted Fan in Hover and Edgewise Flight\n\n", "id": "9585", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3820", "abstract_tesi": "Ducted fans and ducted rotors have been integrated into a wide range of aerospace vehicles, including manned and unmanned systems.  Ducted fans offer many potential advantages, the most important of which is an ability to operate safely in confined spaces. There is also the potential for lower environmental noise and increased safety in shipboard operations (due to the shrouded blades).  However, ducted lift fans in edgewise forward flight are extremely complicated devices and are not well understood. \nFuture development of air vehicles that use ducted fans for lift (and some portion of forward propulsion) is currently handicapped by some fundamental aerodynamic issues.  These issues influence the thrust performance, the unsteadiness leading to vehicle instabilities and control, and aerodynamically generated noise.  Less than optimum performance in any of these areas can result in the vehicle using the ducted fan remaining a research idea instead of one in active service.\nThe Penn State Department of Aerospace Engineering initiated an experimental program two years ago to study the aerodynamics of ducted lift fans.  The focus of this program from its initiation was to study a single lift fan subject to an edgewise mean flow.  Of particular concern was the transitional flow regime from hover to a relatively high forward speed in which a major portion of the vehicle lift is produced by the aerodynamic forces on the body.  We refer to this as ducted fan edgewise flow. There are four obvious consequences of operating a ducted lift fan in edgewise (forward) flow.  First, separations off the leading portion of the duct can reduce the inflow and thus the thrust of the fan.  Second, the separated flow will lead to unsteadiness which will undoubtedly decrease the control authority of the vehicle.  Thirdly, the outer surface of the fan shroud is likely to be fairly blunt.  This body shape, together with the strong momentum drag of the lift fan outflow, produce excessive drag forces that increase the requirements of the propulsion devices.  Finally, increased turbulence of the inflow will also result in increased production of aerodynamic noise. \nThe goals of this project are to conduct detailed experiments on several configurations of ducted lift fans in hover and edgewise flow.  Single ducted lift fan configurations involve different shrouded duct shapes and rotor shapes.  Rotors are tested with a range of solidities and tip clearances.  Including inlet duct vents over the forward portion of the duct shroud, has the potential of reducing the problem of separated flow over the forward portion of the duct inlet, and potentially reducing the drag of the vehicle in forward flight.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3797], "author_name_tesi": "Myers, Leighton Montgomery", "last_name_ssi": "Myers", "middle_name_ssi": "Montgomery", "first_name_ssi": "Leighton", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis K Mc Laughlin", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Experimental Aerodynamics", "Ducted Fan"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Investigation of the Flow-field of Two Parallel Round Jets Impinging Normal to a Flat Surface", "id": "26610", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11567", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The flow-field features of dual jet impingement were investigated through sub-scale model experiments.  The experiments were designed to simulate the environment of a Short Takeoff, and Vertical Landing, STOVL, aircraft performing a hover over the ground, at different heights.  Two different dual impinging jet models were designed, fabricated, and tested.  The Generation 1 Model consisted of two stainless-steel nozzles, each with an exit diameter of approximately 12.7 mm.  The front convergent nozzle was  operated at NPR = 1.89 (Mj = 1.0), TTR = 1.0, while the rear C-D nozzle was generally operated over a range of NPR = 1.89 to NPR = 2.93 (Mj = 1.34), TTR = 1.0.  The nozzles were embedded in a rectangular flat plate, referred to as the lift plate, which represented a generic lifting surface.  The lift plate was instrumented with 36 surface pressure taps, which were used to examine the flow entrainment and recirculation patterns caused by varying the stand-off distance from the nozzle exits to a flat ground surface.  The stand-off distance was adjusted with a sliding rail frame that the ground plane was mounted to.  Typical stand-off distances, (ground plane separation), were H/D = 2 to 24.\n\nA series of measurements were performed with the Generation 1 model, in the Penn State High Speed Jet Aeroacoustics Laboratory, to characterize the basic flow phenomena associated with dual jet impingement.  The regions of interest in the flow-field included the vertical jet plume(s), near impingement/turning region, and wall jet outwash.  Other aspects of interest included the loss of lift (suckdown) that occurs as the ground plane separation distance becomes small, and azimuthal variation of the acoustic noise radiation.  Various experimental methods and techniques were used to characterize the flow-field, including flow-visualization, pressure rake surveys, surface mounted pressure taps, laser Doppler velocimetry, and acoustic microphone arrays.\n\nA second dual impinging jet scale model, Generation 2, was designed and fabricated with a 50% increase in nozzle exit diameter.  The primary design improvement is the ability to quickly and easily exchange the nozzles of the model.  This allowed experiments to be performed with rapid-prototyped nozzles that feature more realistic geometry to that of tactical military aircraft engines.  One such nozzle, which was designed and demonstrated by previous researchers to reduce jet noise in a free-jet, was incorporated into the model.

The nitrogen is present in the organic N (ON) and NH4+ forms. It is most commonly broadcast applied and suffers losses from volatilization up to 70%. Currently the most effective method of reducing ammonia emissions is to incorporate the slurry to reduce volatilization. \nThis incorporation, while reducing ammonia losses, does not allow for no-tillage and its benefits to be realized. The other option is to inject manure with equipment that allows minimum tillage and manure incorporation. \nThe Aerway allows aerating tines to open small holes in the soil and manure to be injected into them. This system has a tine arrangement with five different angled positions (0\u00b0, 2.5\u00b0, 5\u00b0, 7.5\u00b0, and 10\u00b0) available for aeration.

On the one hand, the resources involved provide numerous benefits. These benefits range from food, employment, income to people and regional development, to important ecosystem services, biodiversity and other non-market values. On the other hand, management of such systems usually involves limiting and, in many cases, competing resources. It also implies understanding of species\u2019 biology, interactions and linkages with their habitat and interactions with other species, as well as the properties of the system under consideration. My dissertation captures all the above dimensions, applying them to two ecologically and commercially important marine resources, for the largest estuary in United States, the Chesapeake Bay.\nThe first essay of my dissertation investigates the role of harvest sanctuaries and reserves in the management of a sedentary fishery. An optimal control bioeconomic model is developed and optimized for native oysters in the Chesapeake Bay that incorporates two positive externalities generated by oyster stocks: nutrient removal and provision of habitat for other benthic species. The model incorporates four management regimes that currently exist in the Bay: public grounds, aquaculture on leased grounds, sanctuaries that are never harvested, and reserves that are infrequently harvested for short periods. We find that if harvest effort in public grounds can be controlled, then that management regime unambiguously provides the highest social welfare. However, if harvest effort in public grounds cannot be controlled, then reserves provide the highest social welfare. Sanctuaries are part of the optimal mix of regimes only when harvest effort on public grounds cannot be controlled and a pulsed harvest is not feasible.\nThe second essay examines how optimal management of a fishery can contribute towards the achievement of environmental goals. An optimal control bioeconomic model is applied to oysters in public grounds in Chesapeake Bay, taking into account nitrogen removal by oyster both through harvest and denitrification. The ecological target is achievement of nitrogen Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) goal, which is taken to be reached primarily through Best Management Practices (BMPs) in watersheds draining to the Bay. Optimal management of harvests in the Bay reduces the cost of attaining the TMDL goal by between 4 and 6 percent. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that the cost savings in BMPs from managing oysters accounting for both denitrification and nitrogen removal through harvest are small, compared to a na\u00efve management of the stock under cheap BMPs, but become larger as the cost of BMPs increases. Between the two, denitrification is a much more important parameter to be considered in management decisions related to Bay\u2019s nitrogen TMDL target, and managing a stock taking into account that, can result in cost saving of BMPs between 5 and 8 percent. \nThe third essay of my dissertation investigates habitat-fisheries interaction between two important resources in the Chesapeake Bay: blue crabs and Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV). A habitat can be essential to a species (the species is driven to extinction without it), facultative (more habitat means more of the species, but species can exist at some level without any of the habitat) or irrelevant (more habitat is not associated with more of the species). An empirical bioeconomic model that nests the essential-habitat model into its facultative-habitat counterpart is estimated. Two alternative approaches are used to test whether SAV matters for the crab stock. Our results indicate that, if we do not have perfect information on habitat-fisheries linkages, the right approach would be to run the more general facultative-habitat model instead of the essential-habitat one. Failure to do so can result in model misspecification and biased estimates of the impact of habitat on species productivity. With our data we fail to reject the null hypothesis that SAV is irrelevant for crabs in the Bay. \nMy dissertation work provides a significant contribution to the research area dealing with reduced water quality due to cultural eutrophication and stock decline of keystone species in the Chesapeake Bay, the implications of spatially explicit management systems and quantification of habitat-fisheries interactions, thus helping to set the stage for more involved and cohesive research in these areas. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8974], "author_name_tesi": "Mykoniatis, Nikolaos ", "last_name_ssi": "Mykoniatis", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nikolaos", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard C Ready", "James Samuel Shortle", "David Gerard Abler", "Timothy Reluga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard C Ready, Dissertation Advisor", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Member", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "Timothy Reluga, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["harvest regimes; bioeconomics; Chesapeake Bay; oyster management"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Communication about Emotions Using AAC During Storybook Reading: Effects of an Instruction Program for Parents of Children with Down Syndrome", "id": "26413", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11708", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Children with Down syndrome often have more restricted emotion expression and recognition skills than their peers who are developing typically. Some individuals with Down syndrome have limitations in producing speech and in understanding of the speech and language of others.  Effectively designed interventions may help facilitate optimal communication and functioning. However, due to a lack of awareness and resources, parents and professionals usually provide limited opportunities for these children to discuss emotions.  Children who are unable to use spoken language effectively to meet their communication needs often benefit from aided Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), meaning that well-designed communication tools may help children with Down syndrome communicate about emotions. \nThe current study used a single-subject multiple-baseline across participants design with three parent-child dyads in order to investigate the effect of an instructional program on parents\u2019 provision of opportunities for emotion communication using aided AAC. The parents learned to ask open-ended questions (i.e., questions that cannot be answered by yes or no) relating to the type (e.g., angry), reason (e.g., It\u2019s broken), and solution (e.g., Ask for help) for a book character\u2019s emotions during shared reading activities with their children.  This was done in order to provide the children with opportunities to converse about emotions in a familiar context. The parents also designed and used emotion communication picture boards for use during the activity. \nThis investigation provides evidence that the Strategies for Talking about Emotions as PartnerS (STEPS) instructional program is effective for improving parents\u2019 provision of opportunities for discussing emotions during storybook reading with children who have Down syndrome. All participating parents used the emotion communication strategy immediately following a one-time instructional session and continued to use it for the remaining phases of the study. The children participated more actively in the discussion by making comments about emotions when parents provided more opportunities to their children. All parents indicated that they would use the strategy during future storybook reading activities.

When there is one strong\nand two weak players, we show that the strong player never forms a\ncoalition with a weak one in an elimination contest in which the\nonly one who survives takes the whole prize.

Chapter 1 traces the evolution of double bass reduction, including how the performance practice relates to compositional and notational conventions; that is, how shared basso continuo parts necessitated the practice, and how the gradual increase in notational specificity and development of principles of orchestration led to its decline. Chapter 2 compares different methods of reduction and classifies examples in terms of function, rhythmic profile, and pitch content, as well as drawing on less explicit sources to supplement eighteenth-century evidence of the extemporaneous performance convention. Chapter 3 is a case study of double bass reductions in Beethoven\u2019s works, including those Beethoven introduced himself in divisi cello and double bass parts, as well as those suggested by double bassists in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. By investigating the practice across a wide geographic and temporal span, I aim to elucidate how and when historical double bassists reduced their parts, and to promote a more widespread implementation of the practice in modern historically informed performances.

We have developed a strategy for the synthesis of the N-heterocycle 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) using Pd-catalyzed C\u2013H functionalization reactions. Beginning from an alkyl picolinamide, a picolinic acid (PA)-directed, Pd-catalyzed sp3 C\u2013H arylation reaction yields a 3-arylpropylpicolinamide intermediate. This intermediate is then cyclized via a sequence of ortho sp2 C\u2013H iodination followed by C\u2013N cross coupling. We explored two methods for this critical iodination: a directed electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) method, and a Pd-catalyzed C\u2013H iodination reaction. To demonstrate the scope of this strategy, a variety of substituted THQ scaffolds were synthesized, including (+)-angustureine.

User anthropometry (body dimensions) play a key role in these accommodation analyses, since they are known to have a significant influence on users' preferred styles of interacting with products. DfHV's regression-based approach (RBA) is used to study the influence of user variability (in terms of anthropometry, capabilities, and demographic variables such as age and gender) on the variability of preference within the target population. Results of such studies may be used to make informed design decisions. In contrast, the area of discrete choice analysis (DCA) is replete with methodologies aimed at predicting users' choices from among given sets of alternatives. Variables used in these choice-prediction models may be alternative-specific (e.g., design specifications, pricing) and/or user-specific (income levels, family size).\n\nThis research draws on the individual strengths of both the RBA and DCA preference modeling approaches in an effort to develop a more robust design decision-making methodology. The basis of this methodology is the division of the design process into independent analyses of safety and comfort accommodation of the target population. RBA models are recommended for safety accommodation problems while a hybrid of DCA and RBA methods is suggested for the analysis of comfort accommodation. The inclusion of appropriate anthropometric variables in the set of user-specific predictors in DCA models is shown to help enhance the reliability of the models.

The more specific goals were: a) to allow for the use of easily- and widely- available body dimensional information in the form of descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, and/or by-percentile values of anthropometry), b) to more objectively compare the variation of relevant body measures across the populations of interest, c) to utilize observations from these comparisons in guiding the selection of appropriate strategies for top-down global product design, and d) to implement virtual fitting techniques and provide specific design recommendations within the framework of the selected strategy.\n\nThe anthropometry-based global design (AGD) methodology was formulated to satisfy these goals. It consists of three phases. Phase A focuses on anthropometry synthesis using the existing regression-based approach and the newly-developed percentile combinations datasets (PCD) method. The main strength of the PCD method is in its ability to use descriptive statistics as inputs in accurately ``reverse engineering'' the underlying anthropometric database. The ability to synthesize such comprehensive databases enables better utilization of numerous papers and reports that provide descriptive statistical information for a variety of populations; this allows for more thorough, multivariate anthropometric analyses through the use of detailed data.\n\nPhase B of the AGD methodology involves the application of the newly-developed anthropometry range metric (ARM) in assessing anthropometric variation across the populations of interest. This variation is studied for each relevant body measure between the 1st and 99th percentiles, and results in the categorization of the body measure into regions of low, medium, and high variability. Guidelines are then proposed for the selection of the most suitable technique---sizing, adjustability-allocation, etc.---for the satisfaction of the usage requirements related to that body measure. The guidelines also include suggestions on when to consider incorporating components related to the body measure into a platform, when to build them into modules, and when to offer them as unique variants.\n\nThe selection of the aforementioned techniques is based on the global product design strategy that is chosen as the overarching framework for the top-down design of the new product line. Three strategies are proposed in this research. Non-platformed design involves the creation of a separate design for each group of target markets or user populations. Static platform design entails the development of the product line around a common platform that remains unchanged across the populations of interest. Flexible platform design is aimed at making the platform itself adaptable to the requirements of different population groups; this capability also allows for easier modifications to satisfy temporal changes in requirements.\n\nPhase C of the AGD methodology involves the application of the techniques selected in Phase B. This yields design recommendations that are likely to achieve the desired performance objectives for the populations of interest.\n\nThe proposed methodology is then demonstrated in two case studies, the first of which involves the design of a wheelchair for populations that are largely from the developing world. The second case study is an exploration into three sustainability benefits---increasing raw material allocation efficiency, lengthening the lifetimes of certain kinds of products, and better considering some ethical ramifications of design decision---that could accrue from the application of the AGD method for multiple user populations.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7663], "author_name_tesi": "Nadadur, Gopal ", "last_name_ssi": "Nadadur", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gopal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew B Parkinson", "Matthew B Parkinson", "Timothy William Simpson", "Jeremy J Michalek", "Arvind Rangaswamy", "Ling Rothrock", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew B Parkinson, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew B Parkinson, Committee Chair", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "Jeremy J Michalek, Special Member", "Arvind Rangaswamy, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Anthropometry", "Global Design", "User Populations", "Design Strategies", "Design for Human Variability", "Sustainable Design"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "STRUCTURAL AND THERMODYNAMIC CHARACTERIZATION OF SPERMIDINE AND SPERMINE SYNTHASES", "id": "10156", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6001", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Polyamines are ubiquitous, physiological cations that are essential for a wide range of functions in normal cells, including cell proliferation, differentiation, signal transduction, and apoptosis.  Polyamines interact and stabilize various negatively charged macromolecules such as cellular nucleic acids, alter membrane structure and act as modulators of ion channels.  Cells utilize complex metabolic systems and multiple compensatory mechanisms to ensure polyamine homeostasis and, even though their functions at the molecular level are not completely understood, polyamines are critical to cell survival. \nIn mammals, the polyamines, spermidine and spermine, are synthesized by two aminopropyltransferases, spermidine- and spermine-synthases, respectively.  Both enzymes utilize decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine and produce a second product, 5\u2019-methylthioadenosine. Recent structural studies have revealed that the catalytic domains of these enzymes share a common fold.  However, potentially, they are regulated in different ways.  Spermidine synthase has a gatekeeping loop that is thought to control access to the active site, whereas spermine synthase does not have a gatekeeping loop but contains an additional N-terminal domain that may have a regulatory role.  In the presented studies, several biophysical methods were used to begin to understand how these enzymes are regulated.   Thermotoga maritima spermidine synthase and human spermine synthase were used as model systems.  Specifically, the effect of substrates, products, and inhibitors on spermidine synthase were examined using high-throughput high-resolution deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and isothermal titration calorimetry.  In addition, N-terminal deletions of human spermidine synthase and single point variants, which are found in Snyder Robinson Syndrome, were characterized to investigate their effect on the tertiary structure and domain organization.

The system utilizes Driver Reliability, Auctioning, Utility Function, and Binary Bin Packing (considering Vehicle Capacity) to reduce the search space for each sub-problem. The TSP formulated is then solved using either a Genetic Algorithm (GA) or Distributed Control Algorithm in order to determine the best sequence of routes that must be taken. \nComputational Experiments show that as the number of parcels and the number of drivers increases, the problem becomes too complex to be solved in real-time using the GA. The DATC is used to obtain quicker solution with trade-offs.\nWith 100 drivers, 500 parcels and a condition for all parcels delivery, DATC improves the computation time by up to 18% when compared to GA for low capacity examples. However, there exists a non-linear trade-off between distance traveled and computation time between the two methods.

These variations are caused by many phenomena, but on the finestructure (10 meters to 1 kilometer) scale, the dominant forces in most areas of the ocean are internal waves and thermohaline intrusions. Internal waves are gravity waves (similar to surface waves) that propagate beneath the surface by displacing the stratified constant density surfaces. Thermohaline intrusions (also referred to as spice) are variations in temperature and salinity which compensate each other in their effect on density. Although spice features are independent of density and therefore have a very minimal effect on ocean dynamics, they do affect the sound velocity in the water, and therefore can be very important acoustically.\n\nThis thesis uses data from the Transverse Acoustic Variability Experiment (TAVEX) to study properties of spice in the East China Sea and examine their impact on sound propagation through use of parabolic equation acoustic modeling.

The methodology and assays developed provide a molecular biological toolkit that will significantly contribute to the comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic modification and expression patterns of the LEPR and LEPROT transcripts and provide a foundation for follow-on investigations of the role of these genes in cancer development and progression.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7916], "author_name_tesi": "Nadkarni, Pooja Ganpat", "last_name_ssi": "Nadkarni", "middle_name_ssi": "Ganpat", "first_name_ssi": "Pooja", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sagarika Kanjilal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sagarika Kanjilal, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["leptin receptor", "leptin", "methylation", "epigenetics", "cancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "The 26-27 January Nor'easter (Juno): Radar Analysis and Simulated Sensitivity to Riming Parameterizations", "id": "14881svn5241", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14881", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Northeast winter cyclones (\u201cnor'easters\u201d) can produce snow bands that create large amounts of snow with the potential to economically cripple coastal cities. One uncertainty in snow band prediction is the parameterization of microphysical processes used in numerical models, including riming of ice particles. In the Thompson microphysics scheme, snow mass is converted to graupel mass when the riming growth rate exceeds the depositional growth rate, where the fraction of snow converted to graupel is related to the ratio of the two growth rates. Simulations of the 26-27 January 2015 nor'easter and its associated snow bands test the sensitivity of accumulated snowfall and storm structure to this parameterization using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with five different treatments of riming efficiency in the Thompson microphysics scheme.\nWith an altered riming efficiency, areal coverage of heaviest snowfall varies among the simulations. All simulations have similar radar reflectivity structures, orientations, and translation speeds in the main snow band, with slightly lower reflectivity values and different but comparable snow band translation speeds compared to radar observations. Differences in snow band characteristics and accumulated snowfall among the simulations and observations are diagnosed using thermodynamic profiles, radar variables, flow structures, and two-dimensional histograms of various WRF output variables, including potential temperature budget terms.\nMaps of differences in simulated accumulated snow between the original snow-graupel conversion efficiency in the Thompson microphysics scheme of WRF release 3.7.1 and updated efficiencies show generally increased differences with more aggressive snow-graupel conversion efficiency. One of the simulations with Thompson microphysics that converts snow to graupel more aggressively, THO_new, appears to have the accumulated snowfall distribution closest to observations. This is based on comparing the simulated snowfall maps mentioned above and interpolated observed snowfall maps. The overall changes in simulated snow accumulation and snow band structure indicate that the parameterization of riming efficiency in the Thompson microphysics scheme impacts numerical model simulations of where nor'easter snow bands produce snowfall, thus affecting forecast accuracy of snow bands and their precipitation.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16299], "author_name_tesi": "Naegele, Steven M", "last_name_ssi": "Naegele", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Robert Kumjian", "David Jonathan Stensrud", "Jerry Y Harrington"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Robert Kumjian, Thesis Advisor", "David Jonathan Stensrud, Thesis Advisor", "Jerry Y Harrington, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["winter cyclone", "nor'easter", "snow band", "snow", "riming parameterization", "microphysics", "dual-polarization radar", "Juno", "radar", "graupel"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "STUDY OF BOREHOLE PROBING METHODS TO IMPROVE THE GROUND CHARACTERIZATION", "id": "s4655g578", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12701", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Collecting geological information allows for optimizing ground control measures in underground structures. This includes understanding of the joints and discontinuities and rock strength to develop rock mass classifications. An ideal approach to collect such information is through correlating the drilling data from the roofbolters to assess rock strength and void location and properties. The current instrumented roofbolters are capable of providing some information on these properties but not fully developed for accurate ground characterization. To enhance existing systems additional instrumentation and testing was conducted in laboratory and field conditions. However, to define the geology along the boreholes, the use of probing was deemed to be most efficient approach for locating joints and structures in the ground and evaluation of rock strength. Therefore, this research focuses on selection and evaluation of proper borehole probes that can offer a reliable assessment of rock mass structure and rock strength. In particular, attention was paid to borehole televiewer to characterize rock mass structures and joints and development of mechanical rock scratcher for determination of rock strength. \nRock bolt boreholes are commonly drilled in the ribs and the roof of underground environments.  They are often small (about 1.5 inches) and short (mostly 2-3 meter). Most of them are oriented upward and thus, mostly dry or perhaps wet but not filled with water. No suitable system is available for probing in such conditions to identify the voids/joints and specifically to measure rock strength for evaluation of rock mass and related optimization of ground support design. \n A preliminary scan of available borehole probes proved that the best options for evaluation of rock structure is through analysis of borehole images, captured by optical televiewers.  Laboratory and field trials with showed that these systems can be used to facilitate measurement of the location, frequency and partially condition of discontinuities. Two of the more promising tools have been tested during this project, which are QL40OBI Optical TV and Slim Borehole Scanner (SBS) manufacture by ALT-Mount Sopris and DMT, respectively. The field experiment with QL40OBI showed that the images generated for downward and sub-horizontal boreholes are of good quality and can be used to evaluate the joint conditions. However, this device is not suitable for use inside the upward drillholes. The Slim Borehole Scanner (SBS) manufactured by DMT in Germany has the required features for borescoping the roofbolt holes.  This includes the ease of operation and suitable geometry along with an unwrapped 360-degree picture of the borehole wall. This instrument was concluded to be the best option yet for obtaining images from boreholes with any arbitrary orientation.\nIn addition, a new tool, called Rock Strength Borehole Probe (RSBP), was developed for estimation of the rock strength through scratching the rock surface in the borehole. This device is designed to be a light, flexible, quick, non disruptive, and cost effective alternative to estimate the rock strength inside the boreholes in underground mines and tunnels. An extensive number of laboratory tests under variable conditions were conducted to develop equations to estimate the Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) and Brazilian Tensile Strength (BTS) of the rock from measured cutting forces. In these experiments, 27 different rock types were tested by full scale scratch tests, including the cutting tests by a miniature disc. The results show a good correlation between the normal force and the compressive strength of sedimentary/metamorphic rock if the depth of scratch is known. No significant correlation was observed for igneous rocks, due to the impacts of grain size.\nCurrent studies show promising results for using RSBP. The laboratory and field tests proved the functionality of this tool. This probe is capable of entering boreholes of 45 mm (1\u00be in) diameter in any direction and create a groove on the walls and by measurement of the location and cutting forces, estimate rock strength. Additional testing in various underground operations are needed for fine tune the operational features of this probe and make it more accurate.\nThe combination of rock strength and joint conditions will allow for development of rock mass classification that could be used for 3D imaging of the ground conditions around an underground opening as well as hazard maps for the roof.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12753], "author_name_tesi": "Naeimipour, Ali ", "last_name_ssi": "Naeimipour", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ali", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mining Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamal Rostami"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamal Rostami, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Borehole probing", "Rock Characterization", "Scratch Test", "Instrumented roofbolter", "Geophysics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANALYTICAL\nDESIGN TOOL FOR JOURNAL BEARINGS\n\n\n", "id": "9557", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5227", "abstract_tesi": "Reliable and efficient journal bearings operate with sufficient load capacity, low frictional loss, low heat generation, and a sufficient supply of lubricating oil.  To design such bearings, values of the bearing design parameters are selected and used to calculate bearing performance variables.  The performance variables are then used to describe the operational state of the bearing, aiding the designer in deciding whether the selected values of the design parameters are optimal or not.  In the current design methods, these performance variables are often solved by interpolating and extracting solutions from design tables.  This technique may become tedious and inconvenient, especially when trying to compile a large number of results to generate solution curves of the performance variables.\nThis research develops an improved design method for journal bearings.  The solution is a design tool which uses analytic design modules to calculate the different design considerations of the bearing system.  Each module focuses on a single design aspect and calculates the associated performance variables using a series of analytic equations.  This analytic method is implemented into a computer program and forms a basic CAD package capable of generating solution curves of the performance variables.  These curves aid the designer in selecting the best design parameters for the system.  Thus, this basic analytic design tool produces similar results to the current manual approach but in a manner which is more modern, time-efficient, user-friendly, and cost-effective.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5205], "author_name_tesi": "Naffin, Richard Keith", "last_name_ssi": "Naffin", "middle_name_ssi": "Keith", "first_name_ssi": "Richard", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Liming Chang", "Liming Chang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Liming Chang, Thesis Advisor", "Liming Chang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["journal bearing design"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Combined Generative-Discriminative Learning for Object Recognition using Local Image Descriptors\n", "id": "8181", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "430", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We present a system for scale and affine invariant recognition of vehicular objects in video sequences.

All these movements, however, implicitly assume that firms differ in the ways they understand, create, access, and use knowledge as a resource.  Little has been done to explore the fundamental origins of these differences.  In this dissertation, I explore the roots of these elemental differences in the socio-cognitive schemas, \u201cexecutive knowledge schemes\u201d, of top managers of firms competing in a largely similar objective environment, that is, a single mature industry- the U.S. Metalcasting Industry.  \n\tThe essential thesis on which I base this dissertation is that the primary drivers of interfirm heterogeneity are differences between top managers of competing firms in their fundamental beliefs about knowledge and knowledge related processes in their respective organizations.  To further develop and test this thesis, I adopt a two-stage (divided into four distinct phases) study, with the first stage involving an interpretive study aimed at exploring the cogent dimensions and relationships through which executive knowledge schemes function, and the second involving a large sample investigation of the emergent relationships.  \n\tI find that senior executives of incumbent firms, operating within the same industry, show remarkable variation in their interpretations and evaluations of knowledge, especially in its strategic context. The structure of the executive knowledge schemes that emerged from the study comprises three primary dimensions \u2013 the Competitive Dimension, the Personal Dimension, and the Control Dimension. These three dimensions have five elements or sub-dimensions that together form the pertinent areas of managerial beliefs about knowledge.  \n\tFirst, I find that executive knowledge schemes significantly influence the amount and nature of scanning behaviors that a focal executive engages in. I develop a new approach to conceptualize executive scanning by developing a grounded concept called \u201cScanning Proactiveness\u201d, which entails the specific behaviors that characterize a form of aggressive search for information in a given domain. \n\tI also find that executive knowledge schemes and executive scanning behaviors influence the ways in which a firm adapts and enhances knowledge in its situated practices while facing a problematic situation. These behavioral tendencies, that I term \u201cKnowledgeable Practice\u201d provide a novel approach to conceptualize and empirically measure the specific practices by which knowledge is transformed to create competitive advantage. I find that the nature of knowledgeable practice mediates the relationship between a firm\u2019s human, social, and technological capital (i.e. its tangible knowledge assets) and its innovation capacity. \n\tThis dissertation serves to expand the current theoretical frameworks of the resource based and knowledge based views of competitive advantage by clarifying the role of executive leadership in the definition, interpretation, and firm level application of knowledge as a strategic resource. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5400], "author_name_tesi": "Nag, Rajiv ", "last_name_ssi": "Nag", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rajiv", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Arnold Gioia", "Donald C Hambrick", "Wenpin Tsai", "Robert Carl Voigt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis Arnold Gioia, Committee Chair", "Donald C Hambrick, Committee Member", "Wenpin Tsai, Committee Member", "Robert Carl Voigt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HETEROGENEITY", "EXECUTIVE COGNITION", "KNOWLEDGE"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Communication and Scheduling in Clusters : A User-Level Perspective\n\n", "id": "5880", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5996", "defended_at_dtsi": "2000-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cluster computing has become the preferred model for building high performance\nservers today.
