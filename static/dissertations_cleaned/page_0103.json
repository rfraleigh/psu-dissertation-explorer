Nonetheless, the availability for use in energy facilities is limited by various factors that can be classified as biophysical, social, and economic constraints. This study developed an analytical framework to estimate supply of woody biomass for a potential energy facility location that considers multiple constraining factors using publicly available data and models. The framework is intended to estimate potential supplies based on conducting regeneration harvests. For simplicity, harvests were assumed to be clearcuts done by and integrated harvesting operation that produce sawlogs, pulpwood and woody biomass. Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data are used to represent the forest resource base. Biophysical, social, and economic constraints are assessed to estimate their impact on potential supplies of woody biomass available to the hypothetical energy facility. A case study of siting a hypothetical woody biomass energy facility in Williamsport, Pennsylvania is used to apply the developed framework.\n  The procedure to estimate potential supplies begins with an assessment of forest conditions within the energy facility\u2019s procurement region. A series of analyses are then conducted to provide information about the potential quantity of woody biomass that could be sustainably recovered by harvesting biophysically and socially accessible forestland. Potential costs, both roadside and delivered, for wood harvested from FIA plots are calculated to develop supply curves under different sets of constraint thresholds and scenarios on pulpwood-sized biomass utilization (PU). Results indicate that within a 100-mile radius of the hypothetical energy facility, standing inventory should continue to increase and over-harvesting is not occurring. The supply curves developed for the base-case constraint thresholds and base-case PU scenario indicate that the maximum woody biomass quantity recovered from harvest would be 149.96 million dry tons under both biophysical and social constraints. Up to 69.00 million dry tons can be produced at roadside for a cost of $50 per dry ton. The estimated quantity of woody biomass delivered to the hypothetical energy facility was reduced substantially to 4.60 million dry tons at delivered cost of $50 per dry ton. This translates into about 97,000 dry tons of woody biomass that could be supplied each year at this cost level. As expected, most low-cost supplies came from within a 50-mile radius around the energy facility, indicating that delivered cost, which is largely a function of the transportation cost, limits the procurement range of affordable woody biomass for use by the energy facility.\n  Sensitivity analyses using different combinations of constraint thresholds to simulate high and low supply suggest that social constraints had a greater effect on potential supplies than biophysical constraints in both cases. In the PU scenarios, when all pulpwood-sized biomass was assumed to be used by traditional pulpwood users, at small quantities the supply of low-cost wood chips available for energy use is greater than when some pulpwood-sized biomass is assumed to be unused. This is because more woody biomass that can be used for energy is produced from the tops and limbs of pulpwood-sized biomass, which is a much cheaper material.  When all pulpwood-sized biomass is assumed to be utilized for energy production, less low-cost supply would be available. Thus, when pulpwood demand is high and energy wood demand is low, the two uses are complementary. However, when larger quantities are demanded for energy the use of woody biomass for energy is competitive with conventional users of pulpwood. \n  The procedure proposed and demonstrated in this research can be utilized by organizations interested in assessing and evaluating potential supplies of woody biomass for a proposed energy facility location. Results from this study could be beneficial to policy makers or public agencies to develop better strategies to support the future development of woody biomass energy systems. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8744], "author_name_tesi": "Saadun, Norzanalia ", "last_name_ssi": "Saadun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Norzanalia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marc Mc Dill", "Marc Mc Dill", "James Craig Finley", "Michael Gregory Jacobson", "Gregory Wayne Roth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marc Mc Dill, Dissertation Advisor", "Marc Mc Dill, Committee Chair", "James Craig Finley, Committee Member", "Michael Gregory Jacobson, Committee Member", "Gregory Wayne Roth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Woody biomass", "supply curves", "facility siting", "biomass procurement"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Thermodynamic Modeling of the Reactive Sintering of Nd:YAG\n\n", "id": "8110", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2668", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes the use of thermodynamic modeling to study the reactive sintering of Nd:YAG by evaluating the Al2O3-Nd2O3-SiO2-Y2O3 system. Such modeling predicts the phase equilibria during the high temperature sintering, data that is difficult to directly determine experimentally. To describe the this system, a previous modeling of the Al2O3-SiO2-Y2O3 system is taken as the foundation upon which Nd2O3 is added. This is accomplished by evaluating the three pseudo-binary oxide systems that contain Nd2O3 (Al2O3-Nd2O3, Nd2O3-SiO2, and Nd2O3-Y2O3) using experimental phase equilibria and thermochemical data from the literature and performing first-principles calculations on the compounds in the systems. To complete the modeling of the pseudo-quaternary system, the description of the Gibbs free energy of Nd:YAG is determined by calculating, from first-principles, the enthalpy of mixing of Nd in the Y sublattice of YAG for several compositions. \n\tThe phase equilibria during reactive sintering is then predicted. For a typical composition of Nd:YAG, a liquid phase is present in appreciable quantities (about 10% by mole fraction), supporting the hypothesized role of SiO2 as a sintering aid due to the formation of liquid. Interestingly, SiO2 is also predicted to stabilize a small amount of NdAl11O18 (about 1% by mole fraction), the quantity and stable temperature region of which change with the amount of Nd2O3 and SiO2. \n\tFrom these results, a model is proposed describing the abnormal grain growth observed in YAG. It is theorized that NdAl11O18 particles precipitate in the YAG grain boundaries during sintering. Near temperatures where the particles begin to melt, abnormal grain growth arises because the distribution of the particles fluctuates, allowing a few grains to grow faster than others. Under this model, the CALPHAD evaluation of the phase equilibria predicts the temperature at which abnormal grain growth occurs is around 2000K. Predictions are made as to the size of the particles and how the temperature at which abnormal grain growth occurs changes with the composition of the system.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2662], "author_name_tesi": "Saal, James Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Saal", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu", "Zi Kui Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu, Thesis Advisor", "Zi Kui Liu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CALPHAD", "first-principles", "phase equilibria", "ceramic processing"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Thermodynamic Modeling of Phase Transformations and Defects: from Cobalt to Doped Cobaltate Perovskites\n\n", "id": "11342", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13247", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<p>Strontium-doped lanthanum cobaltate perovskite (La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub>) exhibits the unique property of simultaneous electronic and ionic conductivity, which produces large fluxes of oxygen ions across an oxygen chemical potential gradient,amongst the highest known. However, the doping of LaCoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub> with strontium reduces the stability of the perovskite, resulting in precipitation of unwanted phases under less extreme conditions than in the undoped composition. This a barrier to widespread use of La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub> as cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells and gas separation membranes. The goal of this dissertation is to develop a thermodynamic model capable of predicting the stability of La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub> at arbitrary temperatures, strontium contents, oxygen partial pressures, and gas compositions. Information regarding the defect chemistry responsible for the oxygen nonstoichiometry can also be predicted from the model.</p>\n\n<p>The thermodynamic model is constructed with the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach, where parameterized Gibbs energy functions are fitted to experimentally measured and theoretically predicted thermochemical and phase equilibria data. Complex, multi-component systems can be efficiently and accurately described with this approach by modeling a system's constituent subsystems, where data may be more plentiful, and then extrapolating the Gibbs energy functions of the subsystems into the desired higher-order compositional space, adding more parameters as needed. The Gibbs energy of the perovskite is described with the compound energy formalism. For the case of La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub> perovskite, the two ends of the solid solution, LaCoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub> and SrCoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub>, are modeled independently and are combined to describe the complete system. For LaCoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub>, all experimental data in the literature are used to evaluate the model parameters. For SrCoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub>, on the other hand, such data is not sufficient since the perovskite transforms into brownmillerite and a two-phase mixture of Sr<sub>6</sub>Co<sub>5</sub>O<sub>15</sub>+Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> below about 1200 K. Thermochemical data for these neighboring phases have not been measured, so first-principles calculations, based on density functional theory, are employed to predict their Gibbs energy functions. The model predictions of the combined La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub> are discussed, following an extensive statistical assessment of the published and new experimental oxygen nonstoichiometry data for the perovskite.</p>\n\n<p>Although, the CALPHAD approach coupled with first-principles calculations is fast becoming the norm for metallic alloy systems, it still remains relatively untested in the case of complex oxides. To examine the applicability of these techniques this type of material, a wide range of cobalt-related systems of varying complexity are examined by first-principles density functional theory calculations and CALPHAD modeling. The simplest case is elemental cobalt, where the 0 K magnetic and structural phase transformations with pressure are predicted. The thermodynamics of the second-order magnetic Curie transformation with temperature in FCC cobalt are then examined with a partition function approach, with predictions of the heat capacity and Curie temperature.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Gibbs energy function for several complex cobaltates will be predicted for the CALPHAD modeling of the perovskite, the capability of first-principles methods to predict the vibrational contribution to the free energy for cobaltates is examined for a case where the predictions can be compared to experiments, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinel. A scheme to efficiently predict the vibrational contribution to the free energy is developed, utilizing the Debye-Gr\u00c3\u00bcneisen Model and harmonic phonon calculations with the supercell approach.  It is found that this scheme can predict the heat capacity and entropy of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> with sufficient accuracy for CALPHAD modeling, with error on the order of 2-3 kJ/mol-atom in the Gibbs energy at around 1000 K. The heat capacity, room temperature entropy, and enthalpy of formation of Sr<sub>3</sub>Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> brownmillerite and Sr<sub>6</sub>Co<sub>5</sub>O<sub>15</sub> are then predicted, for use in the CALPHAD modeling of SrCoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub>. However, due to errors in the prediction of the brownmillerite entropy and enthalpy of formation, the stability from for the two phases is incorrect, with brownmillerite more stable at all temperatures. This error is corrected by treating the the enthalpy of formation and entropy as model parameters in CALPHAD with the experimental phase equilibria data.</p>\n\n<p>Following the results of the CALPHAD modeling of the LaCoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub> and SrCoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub> perovskites, several predictions are made. For instance, charge disproportionation of Co<sup>+3</sup> in LaCoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub> is on the of 40% in air. Similarly, the presence of Co<sup>+2</sup>, Co<sup>+3</sup>, and Co<sup>+4</sup> is predicted at around 1200 K. However, the combination of the LaCoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub> and SrCoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub> models, assuming ideal mixing between La<sup>+3</sup> and Sr<sup>+2</sup> ions, predicts oxygen nonstoichiometry that agrees well at lanthanum-rich compositions but gives poor agreement at strontium-rich compositions, particularly at low temperatures. It is speculated that this is due to defect-defect interactions and the formation of complex defect associates for strontium contents near SrCoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub>, suggested by the results of the statistical analysis of oxygen nonstoichiometry data.  Several attempts are made to improve the agreement of the CALPHAD model with the experimental oxygen nonstoichiometry data by including interaction parameters to describe regular and sub-regular interactions between La<sup>+3</sup> and Sr<sup>+2</sup>. Although better agreement is achieved, a limited set of parameters capable of agreement across the entire composition space of La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>3-&#948;</sub> was not found.  More data concerning the nature of defects at strontium-rich compositions is requested.</p>\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12794], "author_name_tesi": "Saal, James Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Saal", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi-Kui Liu", "Long-Qing Chen", "Clive Randall", "Jorge Sofo", "Michael Carolan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi-Kui Liu, Committee Chair", "Long-Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Clive Randall, Committee Member", "Jorge Sofo, Committee Member", "Michael Carolan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ceramics", "thermodynamic modeling", "defect chemistry", "perovskites", "CALPHAD", "density functional theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A Rhetoric of Finance", "id": "22442", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10389", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The problem of finance is presently at the center of two of the most significant crises in the United States.

In the case of 1 adamantanethiolate monolayers, the molecular structure influences lability, enabling alkanethiol molecules in solution to displace the 1 adamantanethiolate monolayers, ultimately leading to complete molecular exchange.  The similar Au-S bond environments measured for both n alkanethiolate and 1 adamantanethiolate monolayers indicate that displacement is not a result of weakened Au&#8722;S bonds.  Instead, it was hypothesized that the density differences in the two monolayers provide a substantial enthalpic driver, aided by differences in van der Waals forces, ultimately leading to complete displacement of the 1 adamantenthiol molecules.  \nAdditionally, it was discovered that displacement occurs via fast insertion of n dodecanethiolate at the defects in the original 1-adamantanethiolate monolayer, which nucleates an island growth phase and is followed by slow ordering of the n dodecanethiolate domains into a denser and more crystalline form.  Langmuir-based kinetics, which describe alkanethiolate adsorption on bare Au{111}, fail to model this displacement reaction.  Instead, a model of perimeter-dependent island growth yields good agreement with kinetic data over a 100-fold variation in n dodecanethiol concentration.  Rescaling the growth rate at each concentration collapses all the data onto a single universal curve, suggesting that displacement is a scale-free process.  \nExploiting the knowledge gained by studying 1-adamantethiolate monolayer displacement, a reversible molecular resist was developed, in which displacement is controlled via external stimuli.  This methodology for the fabrication of controllably displaceable monolayers relies on carboxyl functionalized self assembled monolayers and in situ Fischer esterification.  Using an 11 mercaptoundecanoic acid monolayer as a model system, it was shown that in situ esterification results in the creation of subtle chemical and structural defects that promote molecular exchange reactions to go to completion.  The complementary hydrolysis reaction can be employed to quench the reacted monolayer, significantly hindering further displacement.  The generality of reversible lability was tested by applying the in-situ esterification reaction to the structurally distinct carboxyl functionalized molecule 3-mercapto-1-adamantane-carboxylic acid.  \nIn addition to the studies of manipulating the interactions in self-assembled monolayers, materials with tunable optical and electronic properties were fabricated using atomic clusters as building blocks.  It was shown that materials assembled from the same cluster motif, in this case &#12310;As&#12311;_7^(3-), can result in materials with band gaps that vary predictably between 1.09 to 2.08 eV.  The size and highest occupied molecular orbital of the alkali metal counter-cation used in the assembly was shown to affect the band gap of the cluster-assembled solids.  Furthermore, the dimensionality of the cluster-cluster interactions played a crucial role in determining the resulting properties. \nThese results demonstrate how complex surface assemblies, or novel solid materials, can be fabricated by manipulating the interactions between the individual components within the assemblies, paving the way for the fabrication of next-generation devices and materials.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2219], "author_name_tesi": "Saavedra Garcia, Hector Miguel", "last_name_ssi": "Saavedra Garcia", "middle_name_ssi": "Miguel", "first_name_ssi": "Hector", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss", "Paul S Weiss", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Vincent Henry Crespi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul S Weiss, Committee Chair", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["molecular exchange", "chemical patterning", "soft lithography", "scanning tunneling microscopy", "self assembled monolayers", "cluster assembled materials", "microcontact printing"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A Reconfigurable Accelerator For Neuromorphic Object Recognition", "id": "29520", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12637", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A significant challenge in creating machines with artificial vision is designing systems which can process visual information as efficiently as the human brain. Recent advances in neuroscience have enabled researchers to develop computational models of auditory, visual and learning perceptions in the human brain. Among these models, the two widely accepted algorithms that model the process of attention and recognition in the mammalian visual pathway are - the Saliency based model for visual attention and HMAX model for object recognition. One of the major burdens of these biologically plausible models is their massive computational demands. Real time implemen- tation of these biologically inspired vision algorithms, while challenging, can have a diverse and profound impact in applications like autonomous vehicle navigation, surveillance, robotics and face, text and gesture recognition. To mimic true biological systems, implementations of these algorithms must not only meet real-time performance goals, but also stringent power budgets and small form-factors.\n\nPrevious attempts to parallelize the HMAX model on multi-core processors have been unable to provide real-time performance due to limited parallelism and high computational complexity. Researchers have leveraged graphics processors due to their ease of programmability and high parallelism. However, their excessive power consumption hinders deployment in embedded or low-power systems.\n\nThe focus of this work is on the design and architecture of a reconfigurable hardware acceler- ator for the time consuming S2-C2 stage of the HMAX model.

Specifically, I find that airline firms benefit from negative online user-generated content about competitors at symmetric but moderate and asymmetric but advantageous levels of multi-market competition.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2040], "author_name_tesi": "Sabnis, Gaurav ", "last_name_ssi": "Sabnis", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gaurav", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rajdeep Grewal", "Rajdeep Grewal", "Gary L Lilien", "John C Liechty", "Arvind Rangaswamy", "Gary Bolton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rajdeep Grewal, Dissertation Advisor", "Rajdeep Grewal, Committee Chair", "Gary L Lilien, Committee Member", "John C Liechty, Committee Member", "Arvind Rangaswamy, Committee Member", "Gary Bolton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["competition", "internet", "user-generated content", "time series analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Wiring enzymes to electrodes using biomimetic membranes", "id": "13400pos5030", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13400", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Biomimetic membranes incorporate elements or paradigms inspired by biological membranes or incorporate biological elements themselves. Interest in these membranes has grown rapidly in recent years, from being a science-based inquiry to larger commercialization efforts. My motivation stems from the fact that there are many effective biological elements and mechanisms that provide elegant solutions to current engineering challenges. The ultimate goal of my dissertation research was to design a biomimetic membrane that seamlessly integrates biological and synthetic electronic circuits.\nThe first chapter of the dissertation is a comprehensive review that provides a guide to understand, design and improve electrode interfaces for redox enzyme electron transfer processes in devices. I aimed to understand wiring techniques by finding a biological equivalent system to each engineering system introduced.  The biological examples provide the framework to understand electron transfer mechanisms, kinetics, and scalability of redox enzyme bioelectronics for environmental, biomedical and energy applications. The design of state-of-the-art devices is put in context of biological architectures and processes. The biocompatibility of devices is clearly defined in respect to biological environments. I seek to improve electrode interfaces by presenting and innovating effective biological systems and biomimetic approach suggestions to engineering challenges. The research chapters that follow provide unique solutions to existing problems of wiring enzymes to electrodes (chapters 2 and 3) and more generally to the field of biomimetic membranes (chapter 4). \nI introduce an innovative electrode interface for the utilization of redox proteins, specifically photosynthetic membrane proteins. Electrodes were modified with lipids, biomimetic block copolymers, and conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs). The optimized design interface essentially consists of a block copolymer bilayer on electrodes with intercalated COEs. Stability requirements, for both the interface and interacting proteins, were satisfied by the use of hydrated, crosslinkable, lipid-like block copolymers (BCPs) as the matrix of electrode protein interfaces. I have shown that these block copolymers become mobile in the presence of detergent molecules for application of incorporation of membrane proteins.  I used this finding optimize integration of photosynthetic membrane proteins into block copolymer membranes, which stabilizes the protein function. This design generated a maximum photocurrent of 35.0 \u00b1 3.5 \u00b5A/cm2 upon illumination of the assembled devices with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), among the highest and most stable photocurrents reported so far for such systems. The work in this dissertation is applicable to many fields including environmental and medical biosensors, enzymatic fuel cells and bioelectrosynthesis. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13116], "author_name_tesi": "Saboe, Patrick Owen", "last_name_ssi": "Saboe", "middle_name_ssi": "Owen", "first_name_ssi": "Patrick", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Manish Kumar", "Manish Kumar", "Andrew Zydney", "Phillip E Savage", "John H Golbeck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Manish Kumar, Dissertation Advisor", "Manish Kumar, Committee Chair", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member", "Phillip E Savage, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bio-inspired membranes for energy and the environment"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Modeling Strategic Issues for IPO firms", "id": "14784", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7511", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, I seek to understand the value of marketing actions in case of firms going public and thus demonstrate the value of the \u201cmarketing enterprise\u201d even in the early stages of the firm life-cycle.

For the two essays that form the core of my dissertation, I collect data from multiple sources to collate a unique dataset of firms going public between 2000 and 2004 period to investigate the problem at hand. \n\nIn the first essay, I investigate how pre-IPO customer and competitor orientations (CCOs) affect short-term IPO outcomes and examine the boundary conditions to this relationship. Building on information economics, I argue and demonstrate that orientations influence investors\u2019 sentiments toward an IPO and that IPO-specific variables and facets of the organizational task and institutional environments moderate the influence of CCOs. While the first essay focused on short-term consequences of marketing actions, in the second essay, I examine the long-term value of marketing investments. However, instead of looking at marketing investments, I look at long-term implications of cuts in marketing investments. Specifically, I examine whether owner-managers myopically reduce marketing (advertising and R&D) expenses to inflate short-term earnings to attract investors and the consequences of such actions. I provide theoretical predictions and empirical evidence that organizations make unanticipated cuts in marketing and R&D budgets prior to their IPOs to inflate their earnings.

In particular, I consider a problem of water pollution affecting several jurisdictions (countries or provinces) along a river. Following Banks and Duggan , I model the negotiation as a bargaining game about reduction in emissions and monetary transfers. Players of the game are politically motivated representatives, whose preferences are modeled with the Median Voter Theorem. By restricting the agreement to one accepted by all representatives, and allowing for monetary transfers, I find a sharing rule that makes every representative, and the majority of voters, strictly better off. With the agreement, emissions are reduced and the decision on emission in every jurisdiction is linked to the preference of voters downstream. However, if the median and mean voters value the pollution externality differently the agreement does not assure a Pareto optimum allocation of emissions.\nThe political bargaining game developed in Essay 1 is applied to describe a hypothetical agreement on water pollution in Lerma-Chapala watershed in M\u00e9xico, in a second essay titled: Political Bargaining of an Environmental Agreement: an application to Lerma-Chapala watershed. States involved in the agreement are Estado de M\u00e9xico, Quer\u00e9taro, Guanajuato y Jalisco. The numerical exercise conducted illustrates how an agreement would allocate reductions in emissions and monetary transfers. Due to data limitations, only percentage changes can be calculated. States upstream, Estado de M\u00e9xico and Qu\u00e9retaro, reduce their emissions and are paid by states downstream, Guanajuato and Jalisco. Reductions depend on the magnitude of the marginal damage. I consider two cases, one in which marginal damage reflects income of the mean voter, and other in which marginal damage reflects total income of voters. In the latter case, reductions of emissions create greater benefits, mainly because states upstream can internalize more marginal damage from states downstream. The agreement would be an improvement for the wellbeing of society, because it would make the level of pollution closer to the Pareto optimum, under the assumption that the mean voter values the externality more than the median voter.\nThe title of the third essay in this dissertation is Measuring trade cost: two sources of bias in the Head and Ries index. Measuring trade cost is relevant for the research on trade. Head and Ries  (2001) propose a measure, Head and Ries Index (HR), that uses observed trade data and one parameter. In this essay, two possible sources of bias are analyzed in a theoretical model based on Eaton and Kortum , in which HR is otherwise unbiased. The sources of bias considered are: diffusion of ideas and spatial aggregation of trade data. With diffusion of ideas, the HR may have a positive bias. Whether the bias is different from zero depends on the whole equilibrium. The magnitude of the bias depends positively on the amount of ideas that are diffused. Spatial aggregation of trade data has the opposite effect. The bias in HR is negative. The conclusions are very similar in a model without labor mobility or a model with perfect labor mobility. These two biases may imply that trade costs estimated for United States are more different than it seems. Diffusion of ideas may imply regional trade cost calculated is higher than the true value, while spatial aggregation may imply the international trade cost is smaller than the true value.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8406], "author_name_tesi": "Saborio-rodriguez, Maria ", "last_name_ssi": "Saborio-rodriguez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle", "David Blandford", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica", "Richard C Ready", "Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Claire"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle, Dissertation Advisor", "David Blandford, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member", "Richard C Ready, Committee Member", "Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Claire, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["water pollution", "bargaining game", "Lerma-Chapala watershed; Head and Ries index; trade cost measure"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "High Temperature Heterogeneous Reaction Kinetics and Mechanisms of Tungsten Oxidation\n\n\n", "id": "10974", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2818", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tungsten, a material used in many high temperature applications, is limited by its susceptibility to oxidation at elevated temperatures.  Although tungsten has the highest melting temperature of any metal, it corrodes at much lower temperatures since volatile oxides are formed during oxidation.  Understanding heterogeneous oxidation and vaporization processes may allow for the expansion and improvement of tungsten applications.  \n\nTungsten oxidation was thoroughly studied in the past, and today there is a good phenomenological understanding of these processes.  However, as the design of large scale systems increasingly relies on computer modeling, there becomes a need for improved descriptions of oxidation.  Thermochemical parameters that cannot be measured experimentally, may now be determined theoretically, a tool that was previously unavailable to scientists and engineers.  Additionally, chemical kinetic modeling software is now available for both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions.  \n\nThis study takes advantage of these new theoretical chemical modeling tools, as well as a thermogravimetric (TG) flow reactor developed as part of this study, to learn about mechanisms and kinetics of tungsten oxidation.  Reaction rates were studied with various oxidizers (O2, CO2, H2O) using helium as an inert carrier gas.  Isothermal rates were determined at temperatures up to 1970 K, and oxidizing species partial pressures up to 64.6 torr.  Kinetic parameters such as activation energies, frequency factors, and pressure exponents were determined for each reactive system.  An important contribution of this work was quantifying the effects of CO on the CO2 reaction, and H2 on the H2O reaction.  In both cases the non-oxidizing species significantly reduced oxidation kinetics.  Results have led to new interpretations and thought processes for limiting nozzle erosion in rocket motors.  Combined with the TG analysis, as well recent theoretical interpretations of reaction thermodynamic and kinetics, a new mechanism for tungsten and O2 oxidation has been developed using a one-dimensional model of the TG flow reactor.  Important chemical processes and species are also identified for reaction systems involving H2O and CO2.  In the future, additional studies are needed to improve our understanding of these chemical species and processes so that more advanced kinetic mechanisms may be developed. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2814], "author_name_tesi": "Sabourin, Justin Leo", "last_name_ssi": "Sabourin", "middle_name_ssi": "Leo", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter", "Richard A Yetter", "David Lawrence Allara", "Grant Alexander Risha", "Vigor Yang", "Matthew M Mench"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Chair", "David Lawrence Allara, Committee Member", "Grant Alexander Risha, Committee Member", "Vigor Yang, Committee Member", "Matthew M Mench, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rocket nozzles", "thermogravimetry", "kinetics", "oxidation", "tungsten", "metal oxidation", "graphite"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Coarsening Dynamics of Binary Liquids Under Active Rotation", "id": "23420", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10816", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Active matter comprised of many self-driven units (e.g. colloidal swimmers) exhibits emergent collective behaviors such as clustering, swarming and segregating depending on the nature of the local energy input, the nature of the energy dissipation, and the interactions between the individual units.

The size of these domains R, grows in time as R ~ t1/3 under \u201cweak\u201d rotation with frictional drag as the dominant damping force. This result is in agreement with the classic diffusion-controlled demixing of passive binary liquid mixtures without active rotation.

As a prototype of these biological systems, self-driven active colloidal particles have been of much interest in the context of both theoretical and technological relevance. Consequently, many new propulsion mechanisms and geometry of active particles have emerged over the last decade to develop functional materials with unique nonequilibrium features such as dynamic pattern formation and complex shape changes. Notably, a majority of these swimmers are limited to linear propulsion and simple shapes (\\textit{e.g.}, spherical, cylindrical, and helical) where the actuation relies on the heterogeneity of surface property. This dissertation, in general, focuses on ensembles of self-rotating active particles or spinners where the external energy is harnessed into individual particle rotation. In particular, the study constitutes experimental and numerical investigations of the collective dynamics in a mixture of counter-rotating spinners.\n\n\\par Firstly, the significant advances in the development of self-propelled particles (SPPs) powered by several propulsion mechanisms are briefly summarized. Here, SPPs of different shapes and compositions with both translational and rotational dynamics are reviewed. Afterward, a phenomenological, continuum model is developed to investigate the influence of self-generated flows on the coarsening dynamics of binary liquids comprising counter-rotating spinners. The model combines a convective Cahn-Hilliard equation with a modified Navier-Stokes equation to describe the fluid composition and velocity, respectively. Several new types of collective excitations are predicted by the continuum model including ``active coarsening'' and self-propelled ``vortex-doublets'', many of which can also be qualitatively captured by the microscopic model. The exciting numerical results motivate the need for a simple experimental system to study the collective dynamics in ensembles of counter-rotating spinners. With this goal, chiral particles with rotational symmetry are designed to rotate in MHz acoustic field. The acoustic spinners of opposite chirality ($R/S$) can rotate in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions at the same time depending on their chiral orientation. Importantly, the spinners rotate either toward the concave or convex end of the fins depending on the order of rotational symmetry \\textit{i.e.}, the number of fins. Beyond acoustic propulsion, the concept of shape-directed actuation is further extended for other propulsion mechanisms such as induced-charge electrophoresis and self-electrophoresis to encode any desired dynamics \\textit{via} particle shape.

Drilling can constrain instantaneous stress orientations and magnitudes at the borehole location, but provides limited information about how stress varies in the rock volume around the borehole, or about variations in stress state over time. A high-resolution 3D seismic survey spanning the accretionary wedge and forearc basin of the Nankai Trough offshore SW Japan was used to map a population of normal faults within the forearc basin, in order to constrain the progression of stress states and deformation, and extending observations of the instantaneous, local stress conditions from measurements at boreholes in the basin.\n\nIODP drilling at the Nankai Trough off Kii Peninsula  documented an abrupt change in the orientation of maximum horizontal stress across a major out-of-sequence-thrust fault (OOST).

Faulting has  occurred in three phases. Phases 1 and 2 consist of NW-SE striking faults, which are always cross-cut. Stratigraphic relationships distinguish Phase 1 faults as the oldest group. The NE-SW striking faults are classified as Phase 3. Phase 1 faulting ended between 1.6 and 2.1 Ma. Phase 2 and 3 faults are much more recent, typically penetrating to within a few reflectors of the seafloor, and in some cases cutting to the seafloor. More than 60% of Phase 3 faults exhibit scarps at the seafloor.\n\nInversion for maximum extension direction [Molnar, 1983] shows NE-SW extension, ranging from 027\u00b0/207\u00b0 to 073\u00b0/253\u00b0 for Phases 1 and 2. Phase 3 extension ranges from 153\u00b0/333\u00b0 to 165\u00b0/345\u00b0, nearly parallel to the direction of plate convergence and the shortening direction inferred for the outer accretionary wedge near the trench [Chang et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2010]. Inversions for stress were performed using T-TECTO 3.0 software. Assuming that motion along faults is purely dip-slip, inversion [Angelier, 1984] yields a vertical &#963;1 and sub-horizontal &#963;2 and &#963;3, consistent with a normal faulting regime, and generally consistent with the orientation of maximum horizontal stress inferred from two IODP boreholes in the basin. All phases yield a minimum to maximum stress ratio (&#963;3/&#963;1) of 0.27. Most Phase 1 and 2 subgroups indicate relative stress magnitudes (&#963;1:&#963;2:&#963;3) of 1.0:0.35:0.27. All other phases indicate relative stress magnitudes of 1.0:0.27:0.27, with equal magnitudes of &#963;2 and &#963;3. The principal axes of strain and stress determined from inversion of Phase 3 faults are generally consistent with stresses inferred from borehole breakouts at the two boreholes in the basin. Extension may be a response to gravitational stresses within the upper part of the hanging wall of the megasplay fault, driven by uplift of the seaward edge of the basin associated with coseismic slip. The wide range of fault strikes observed throughout the basin may indicate equal relative magnitudes of stresses in the horizontal plane (&#963;2 = &#963;3), or that the orientations of nearly equal &#963;2 and &#963;3 alternate throughout the seismic cycle in response to fluctuations in the magnitude of stress parallel to convergence.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [118], "author_name_tesi": "Sacks, Alison F", "last_name_ssi": "Sacks", "middle_name_ssi": "F", "first_name_ssi": "Alison", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Demian Saffer", "Demian Saffer", "Donald Myron Fisher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Demian Saffer, Thesis Advisor", "Demian Saffer, Thesis Advisor", "Donald Myron Fisher, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nankai", "normal faults", "stress", "strain", "subduction zones"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "AN INTEGRATED HYDRODYNAMIC / PVT VERTICAL WELLBORE MODEL FOR TWO-PHASE NATURAL GAS / LIQUID SYSTEMS", "id": "7041", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "16", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multiphase flow in the wellbore poses a challenge for production engineers since characterization of prevailing flow regime determines the appropriate pressure drop calculation method.

The common modeling practice of many designers is to create an exterior surround with a flat ground surface with little or no external architectural or landscape elements. In this dissertation, this abstraction and a number of different levels of detail for modeling the exterior surround were investigated by comparing real-life empirical measurements with their corresponding simulation results. A total of 13 different exterior views were each studied under 15 different sky/seasonal conditions to investigate the contribution of the surrounding features to the daylight delivered inside a small office.  These features were classified into one of four different groups - sky, architectural structures, standing vegetation, and horizontal ground. Five of these locations were chosen for daylight simulation by applying six levels of detail to the exterior surround in a simulation model. The results reveal that ignoring exterior surround objects (common practice) yielded an average 67.9 percent error, while a high level of detail (which included high polygon vegetation representations) resulted in only an average 11.3% error. The LM-83 modeling recommendations resulted in an average of 22.8% error. \nThe surround landscape highly influences the quantity and quality of daylight in an interior space, and is often excluded from daylighting simulation mostly due to the complexity of 3D geometry of trees and lack of efficient and validated modeling technics. In this study, different methods of representing trees in a daylighting simulation model are investigated by comparing the simulation output to real life empirical measurements and computing the associated errors. Eight species of tree were studied in a natural and relatively isolated setting by collecting photographic (HDR; High Dynamic Range) and photometric (luminance, illuminance and irradiance) data at 4 sky conditions and 8 view angles. A daylight simulation model was created in which trees were represented with high-poly and primitive geometry using a range of reflectance-transmittance material properties. The results revealed the average simulation error for representing trees as primitive geometry (LM-83 recommendation) was 120.7% (RMSE; Root Mean Square Error). Additionally Plastic and Trans material definitions were considered in the simulation model and a Response Surface Model (RSM) statistical design was chosen for data analysis. The findings showed the simulation error could be lowered to 52.8% with proper material definition for the primitive geometry and 32.9% if a high-poly 3D geometry was applied. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14201], "author_name_tesi": "Sadeghi Nahrkhalaji, Reza ", "last_name_ssi": "Sadeghi Nahrkhalaji", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Reza", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard G.

However, without model calibration, a model may not be a good representation of an actual building. Using Project Creation Wizard (PCW), a custom version of the National Institute of Standards and Technology multizone modeling software CONTAM, two building models were calibrated in previous research.  The calibration increased the quality of the model as measured by the percentage of correct airflow directions. An independent check on quality using ASTM Standard D5157 showed that the models improved when main airflows were corrected but could not evaluate the impact of diffuser airflow changes because tracer gas concentration was observed only in air-handling unit returns. More building models under various conditions were calibrated in this research to investigate the performance of PCW model calibration.\n Four field tests were performed in the Rackley and MBNA buildings on the Penn State campus. Rackley building is a 4-story building with 37,000 ft2 served by variable air volume Air Handling Units (AHUs) and constant air volume Fan Coil Units (FCUs) with a ducted supply and plenum return system. MBNA building is a 3-story office building with 44,000 ft2 served by variable air volume AHUs with a ducted supply and return system. Each building was tested twice: once with all doors closed and once with some doors open. HVAC systems were set to operate as a constant air volume system during the field measurements and CO2 tracer gas release tests.\nModel calibrations improved model quality based on the percentage of correct airflow directions. Similar to previous model calibrations, tuning the model with diffuser airflows negligibly impacted model quality in terms of the percentage of satisfactory ASTM D5157 metrics because most CO2 concentrations were measured in the AHU returns. Two additional field tests, one on the first floor of Rackley building and one on the third floor of MBNA building, were performed to test whether improvement in the percentage of satisfactory ASTM D5157 metrics could be gained by measuring most CO2 concentrations in some zones. Model calibration improved the percentage of correct airflow directions and satisfactory ASTM D5157 metrics, and tuning the model with diffuser airflows resulted in significant improvement to the percentage of satisfactory ASTM D5157 metrics. \nRackley and MBNA model development showed that PCW can save about 30% to 35% of the model development time required using the publicly available CONTAMW interface. PCW also had calibration repeatability, since the model calibration for MBNA building with all doors closed resulted in similar model quality improvement in terms of the percentage of correct airflow directions as the previous study. In addition, models calibrated under one condition were capable of predicting airflow in buildings operating under other conditions. Simulated tracer gas releases with some doors open were conducted using models calibrated with all doors closed, resulting in similar outcomes to the calibrated open door model. \nOverall, calibration improved model quality, but the degree of improvement depended on the measures used in model quality evaluation. Different performance metrics showed different model quality improvement results. In the future, more model calibrations at other different buildings and conditions would be useful. Additionally, the ASTM D5157 standard should more specifically address how to evaluate multizone model quality. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5002], "author_name_tesi": "Sae Kow, Pongpeera ", "last_name_ssi": "Sae Kow", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pongpeera", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William P Bahnfleth", "William P Bahnfleth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William P Bahnfleth, Thesis Advisor", "William P Bahnfleth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multizone Airflow Model Calibration"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The combination of decaffeinated green tea extract and voluntary exercise prevent metabolic syndrome in high fat fed-obese mice", "id": "19346", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9254", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Metabolic syndrome is a significant and growing public health problem because it is a risk factor for chronic diseases including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity-related fatty liver disease (ORFLD).  Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic syndrome.  Studies suggest the beneficial effects of green tea extract for obesity prevention.  Exercise has been reported as an effective aid for weight loss.  Given the reported preventive effects of green tea and exercise on obesity and obesity-related disease, the combination effects of green tea and exercise on obesity may be a more effective means for the prevention of obesity.  Some studies have suggested that the combination of green tea and exercise is more effective than either alone.  Those studies, however, used forced exercise, which induces a stress response that can influence weight reduction, and is less translatable to free-living human subjects.  Therefore, I hypothesize that the combination of decaffeinated green tea extract and voluntary exercise will have greater preventive effects on high fat diet-induced obesity and ORFLD than either treatment alone.  These effects are due to the alteration in the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function as well as the inhibition of macronutrient digestion.\nThis study investigated the combination effects of decaffeinated green tea extract (GTE) and voluntary exercise (Ex) in high fat-fed C57BL/6J mice.  Mice were treated with either a low-fat diet with no Ex (LF), a HF diet (HF), HF diet supplemented with 0.77% GTE (HF+GTE), HF diet and Ex (HF+Ex), or HF diet supplemented with 0.77% GTE and Ex (HF+GTE+Ex).  After 16 wk, HF-fed mice treated with GTE+Ex had significantly reduced final body mass and total visceral fat mass (27.1% and 36.6% respectively) compared to HF-fed mice.  Treatment with GTE+Ex reduced fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, and insulin resistance compared to HF-fed mice.  The plasma levels of inflammatory markers, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), as well as the mRNA expression of EGF-like module containing, mucin-like, hormone receptor-like sequence 1 (Emr1) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (Tnf) in adipose tissue, were significantly decreased inGTE+Ex-treated mice.  Treatment with either GTE or Ex alone had significant, but less potent, effects.  Gene expression analysis by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver showed significant changes in the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function.  In the white adipose tissue, an expression of hormone sensitive lipase (Lipe), patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 2 (Pnpla2), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (Pparg), and peroxisome proliferative activated receptor, gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (Ppargc1a) significantly increased in GTE+Ex-treated mice.  Hepatic gene expression analysis showed a significant increase in peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (Ppara) and liver carnitinepalmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a) and a decrease in the expression of stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase 1 (Scd1) mRNA in GTE+Ex mice.  In the skeletal muscle, the combination of Ex and GTE significantly increased the expression of peroxisome proliferative activated receptor, gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (Ppargc1a), mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 5(mt-Nd5), mitochondrial cytochrome B (mt-Ctyb), and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase III (mt-Co3).  \nBecause GTE and GTE+Ex treatment increased fecal lipid content (65.0% and 132.4% respectively) and fecal nitrogen content (79.7% and 56.7% respectively), I hypothesized that inhibition of digestive enzymes by GTE may play a role in GTE-mediated anti-obesity effects.  The inhibitory effects of GTE against pancreatic lipase (PL), pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and trypsin were investigated in in vitro studies.  GTE dose-dependently inhibited PL, PLA2, and trypsin with 50% inhibition at 87, 13.5, and 113\uf06dg/mL.  Kinetic analysis showed that GTE inhibited PL, PLA2, and trypsin in mixed, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive manner with respect to substrate concentration, respectively.\nIn conclusion, GTE, Ex, or GTE+Ex can ameliorate some symptoms of metabolic syndrome and many effects of GTE+Ex were greater than those of GTE or Ex treatment alone.  This effect may be due to the alterations in the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function, as well as alterations in macronutrient digestion and absorption.  The present research provides data to support the preventive effects of the combination of green tea and voluntary exercise on metabolic syndrome, as well as insight into the underlying mechanisms of action.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9063], "author_name_tesi": "Sae-tan, Sudathip ", "last_name_ssi": "Sae-tan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sudathip", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert", "Ryan John Elias", "Kathleen Loralee Keller", "Connie Jo Rogers", "Mary J Kennett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert, Dissertation Advisor", "Ryan John Elias, Committee Member", "Kathleen Loralee Keller, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member", "Mary J Kennett, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["catechins", "fatty acid oxidation", "mitochondrial biogenesis", "voluntary exercise", "green tea", "gene expression"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A Computational Study of Superconducting Materials: A Case Study in Carbon-Doped MgB<sub>2</sub>", "id": "12386", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "552", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<p>Properties of superconductivity materials below their critical temperature such as critical magnetic field (H<sub>c2</sub>) or critical current density (J<sub>c</sub>) are greatly affected by the structures/compositions determined at high temperature during the synthesis processes. It is well known that different processing conditions can result in different superconducting properties at low temperatures. Therefore, the ability to control the structures/compositions of the superconducting materials made at high temperatures is crucial for the development of the superconducting materials.  Thermodynamics is a very useful tool to achieve control over the structures/compositions of the synthesis processes.  With the improvement in the computational power and advancement in the field of computational thermodynamic and density functional theory, combining the powerful and robust CALculation of PHAse Diagram technique with quantum mechanical first-principles calculations has rapidly become the preferred approach for materials design especially for metallic alloys system in the past few years.</p>\n\n<p>In this work, high temperature thermodynamics of the MgB<sub>2</sub> superconductor will be investigated. With the discovery of the unusually high superconducting temperature in MgB<sub>2</sub>, countless investigations have been carried out on the superconducting properties of single crystal, polycrystal, thin films, or doped MgB<sub>2</sub>. As mentioned earlier, properties of superconductors are affected by the structures/compositions of the superconducting materials processed at temperature much higher than superconductivity transition temperature. It is very important to understand the high temperature properties, so the superconducting properties at low temperatures can be easily controlled. First-principles calculations based on DFT are employed to obtain various thermodynamic and structural properties such as enthalpy of formation, heat capacity, mixing enthalpy, bulk modulus, elastic constants, and thermal expansion for the endmembers of the B<sub>4+x</sub>C sublattice model and various phases present in the Mg-B-C system. The calculated thermochemical data are then used to optimize the Gibbs energy description of each phase in the system during the CALPHAD modeling. Temperature-dependent properties of those structures can be obtained using phonon calculations under the harmonic approximation via the supercell method. In some instances, the Debye-Gr&uuml;neisen model is used instead of the supercell phonon approach to obtain the temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties that are necessary to the CALPHAD modeling because the phase has imaginary phonon frequencies present from dynamically unstable structures. The CALPHAD modeling is then applied to construct the B-C system using the five sublattice model, (B)<sub>11</sub>(B,C)(B,C,Va)(B,Va)(B,C,Va), to represent the solubility in the B<sub>4+x</sub>C phase. The Gibbs energy description of the ternary compound, MgB<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, will be obtained purely from first-principles calculations since there is no experimental data available. By combining three binary systems, Mg-B, Mg-C, and B-C together, the Mg-B-C thermodynamic database including MgB<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and the solubility of carbon in MgB<sub>2</sub> can be created.  This dissertation focuses on the coupling of first-principles calculations with CALPHAD modeling to construct a thermodynamic database for the system which has limited experimental data.  Then, properties such as the carbon solubility in MgB<sub>2</sub> can be predicted. The thermodynamic properties in the region that experimental data are rarely available such as decomposition temperature of MgB<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> can be estimated. With the availability of the Mg-B-C thermodynamic database, the carbon solubility limit in MgB<sub>2</sub> as a function of temperature or pressure can be calculated.  The knowledge obtained from CALPHAD modeling can be very useful for the experimentalist since it provide a guideline on how external variables can effect the solubility of carbon in MgB<sub>2</sub>. The synthesis processes can be modified to obtain the maximum carbon solubility or to avoid the presence of second phase.</p>\n\n<p>By using the predicted results from CALPHAD modeling and the properties calculated from first-principles, the model that predicts the unusual behavior of lattice parameters in carbon-doped MgB<sub>2</sub> thin films, based on the difference in coefficient of thermal expansion and elastic properties in MgB<sub>2</sub> and other phases, is proposed.  First-principles calculations on X-doped MgB<sub>2</sub>, with X being 49 elements substituting the Mg atom, have been performed in order to suggest potential dopants for the MgB<sub>2</sub> superconductor system. Based on the calculations, the solubility in MgB<sub>2</sub> is possible for 24 elements. In those 24 elements, 8 of them introduce positive strain on the MgB<sub>2</sub> lattice, as predicted by first-principles calculations.</p>\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [549], "author_name_tesi": "Saengdeejing, Arkapol ", "last_name_ssi": "Saengdeejing", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Arkapol", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu", "Zi Kui Liu", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Qi Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Zi Kui Liu, Committee Chair", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "Qi Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermodynamic modeling", "density functional theory", "superconductor", "CALPHAD", "MgB<sub>2</sub>"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Root traits for efficient nitrogen acquisition and genome-wide association study of root anatomical traits in maize (zea mays L.)", "id": "19895", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9355", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "By 2050, the world population is predicted to reach 10 billion, almost double the current population. Feeding a growing population will become even more challenging. Since the advent of the Green Revolution in the 20th century, improved crop cultivars, chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides have been extensively used in order to increase agricultural productivity. As a result, agricultural food production was doubled within only four decades. Although several factors contributed to this doubling of world food production, a rapid increase in the use nitrogen (N) fertilizers seems to have played a major role. However, the continuous increase in the use of N fertilizers is causing detrimental impacts to the environment. For example, N fertilizers leached from agricultural areas to natural waters causes severe reductions in water quality by enhancing algal blooms, which disrupt normal functioning of ecosystems. Furthermore, nitrous oxide, which is a potent greenhouse gas, can be released to the atmosphere. Most importantly, the production of N fertilizer requires considerable energy from fossil fuels. As energy costs have risen in recent years, farmers face economic pressure from increasing N fertilizer costs. Therefore, relying on increasing N fertilization is not a sustainable solution for the future. We now need a \u201csecond green revolution\u201d that will benefit resource-poor farmers by developing nitrogen efficient crop varieties that produce more food under low nitrogen conditions. A number of studies have shown that root traits play essential roles in N acquisition. Recently an ideotype of root traits for improved water and N acquisition has been proposed by Lynch (2013). Further research is needed to verify the physiological utility of these traits under low N conditions.\nUnderstanding the genetic control of root traits is also essential for plant breeders to develop breeding strategies that maximize genetic gain at reasonable time and costs. Root anatomical traits influence transport of water and nutrients, root mechanical strength, and interactions between roots and soil biota in rhizosphere. A number of experiments have shown significant benefits of root anatomical traits under biotic and abiotic stresses. Despite the high potential for improving crop performance and yield, few studies have been undertaken to characterize phenotypic variation and identify genetic control for root anatomical traits.\nMy research is focused on the physiological utilities of maize root traits specifically 1) root cortical aerenchyma (RCA), 2) number of crown roots (CN) and 3) root hair length for enhanced nitrogen acquisition. The results suggest that these traits may be promising breeding targets for enhancing nitrogen acquisition from low N soils. Another topic is to study phenotypic variation and genetic control of 20 root anatomical traits of the Wisconsin diversity panel. Single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs), associated with the traits, were identified using Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). Molecular markers associated with these traits may be useful in plant breeding programs using marker-assisted selection. The results of this study will greatly improve our understanding of the phenotypic variation and genetic control of root anatomical traits in maize (Zea mays L.).\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9157], "author_name_tesi": "Saengwilai, Patompong ", "last_name_ssi": "Saengwilai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Patompong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "Dawn S Luthe", "Surinder Chopra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Chair", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member", "Surinder Chopra, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["roots", "anatomy", "nitrogen", "agriculture", "aerenchyma", "root hairs", "crown roots", "GWAS", "QTL", "SNP", "genetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Rotorcraft Simulations with Coupled Flight Dynamics, Free Wake, and Acoustics", "id": "0k225b04p", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12926", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study presents the integration of a flight simulation code (PSUHeloSim), a high fidelity rotor aeromechanics model with free wake (CHARM Rotor Module), and an industry standard noise prediction tool (PSU-WOPWOP) into a comprehensive noise prediction system.

The aeromechanical model calculates blade loads and blade motion that couple to the vehicle flight dynamics with suitable resolution to allow high fidelity acoustics analysis (including prediction of blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise). The blade loads and motion data is sent to PSU-WOPWOP in a post-processing step to predict external noise. \n\nParticular attention is paid to the development of PSUHeloSim and to the enhancement of the closed-loop response characteristics of the coupled simulation. Specifically, is studied the use of reduced-order linear models, derived by linearization of the coupled simulation, in the feedback linearization of the Dynamic Inversion controller in different flight conditions. The different reduced-order models obtained are compared by the use of eigenvalue analysis and frequency response in order to link their differences to physical phenomena occuring in the coupled simulation. A validation of these reduced-order models is provided by performing a frequency sweep of the coupled simulation. Finally their effectiveness in the feedback linearization loop is evaluated by analysing the closed loop time response of the coupled simulation to the coupling.\n\nThe coupled analysis is being used to evaluate the influence of flight path on aircraft noise certification metrics like EPNL and SEL for various rotorcraft in work for the FAA.

The main objective of this thesis is to study the spectral properties of AGNs in X-rays in order to increase our current knowledge of AGN evolution. We are especially interested in high redshift AGNs with z >1.0, because the analysis of their spectra may indicate what parameters show evolutionary trends and provide insight as to which physical processes are markers of AGN evolution. The thesis begins with an introduction and review of the scientific topics that are pursued in this study. The core of my research is presented in chapters 2, 3 and 4 of the thesis.\n\nIn chapter 2, we present results from a statistical analysis of 173 bright radio-quiet AGNs selected from the Chandra Deep Field-North and Chandra Deep Field-South surveys (hereafter, CDFs) in the redshift range of  0.1 < z < 4. We find that the X-ray power-law photon index (Gamma) of radio-quiet AGNs is correlated with their 2-10 keV rest-frame X-ray luminosity (LX) at the >99.5% confidence level in two redshift bins, 0.3 < z < 0.96, and 1.5 < z < 3.3 and is slightly less significant in the redshift bin 0.96 < z < 1.5. The X-ray spectral slope steepens as the X-ray luminosity increases for AGNs in the luminosity range 10^{42} to 10^{45} erg/s. Combining our results from the CDFs with those from previous studies in the redshift range 1.5 < z < 3.3, we find that the Gamma-L_X correlation has a null-hypothesis probability of 1.6x10^{-9}. We investigate the redshift evolution of the correlation between the power-law\nphoton index  and the hard X-ray luminosity  and find that the slope and offset of a linear fit to the correlation change significantly (at the > 99.9% confidence level) between redshift bins of 0.3 < z < 0.96 and 1.5 < z < 3.3. We explore physical scenarios explaining the origin of this correlation and its possible evolution with redshift in the context of steady corona models focusing on its dependency on variations of the properties of the hot corona with redshift.\n\nIn chapter 3, we present results from three Suzaku observations of the z = 3.91 gravitationally lensed broad absorption line quasar APM 08279+5255. We detect strong and broad absorption at rest-frame energies of < 2 keV (low-energy) and 7-12 keV (high-energy). The detection of these features confirms the results of previous long-exposure (80-90 ks) Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. The low and high-energy absorption is detected in both the back-illuminated (BI) and front illuminated (FI) Suzaku XIS spectra (with an F-test significance of >99%). We interpret the low-energy absorption as arising from a low-ionization absorber with log (NH/cm^{-2}) ~ 23 and the high-energy absorption as due to lines arising from highly ionized (2.75 < log xi < 4.0; where xi is the ionization parameter) iron in a near-relativistic outflowing wind. Assuming this interpretation we find that the velocities in the outflow range between 0.1c and 0.6c. We constrain the angle between the outflow direction of the X-ray absorber and our line of sight to be < 36 deg. We also detect likely variability of the absorption lines (at the > 99.9% and > 98% significance levels in the FI and BI spectra, respectively) with a rest-frame time scale of ~1 month. Assuming that the detected high-energy absorption features arise from FeXXV, we estimate that the fraction of the total bolometric energy injected over the quasar's lifetime into the intergalactic medium in the form of kinetic energy to be >10%.\n\nIn chapter 4, we present an expansion of our previous work on the study of X-ray outflows on APM 08279+5255. The main conclusions from our multi-epoch spectral analysis of Chandra, XMM-Newton and Suzaku observations of the z = 3.91 gravitationally lensed broad absorption line (BAL) quasar APM 08279+5255 are: 1) In every observation we confirm the presence of two strong features, one at rest-frame energies between 1-4 keV, and the other between 7-18 keV.  2) The low-energy absorption is interpreted as arising (1-4 keV rest-frame) from a low-ionization absorber with log (NH/cm^{-2}) ~ 23 and the high-energy absorption (7-18 keV rest-frame) as due to lines arising from highly ionized (3 < log xi < 4; where xi is the ionization parameter) iron in a near-relativistic outflowing wind. Assuming this interpretation, we find that the velocities on the outflow could get up to ~ 0.7c.   We also present results obtained from fits to all the long exposure observations of APM 08279+5255 with a new outflow model. This model is based on CLOUDY simulations of a near relativistic quasar outflow. From the analysis of this new model we conclude that the wind is likely to get more powerful as the spectra get softer.  Our results also suggest that changes in the X-ray and UV portions of the spectral energy distribution (hereafter SED) of the central source could be related to changes in the terminal velocities of the outflows.  If this result is confirmed it will imply that radiation pressure is an important mechanism in producing quasar outflows.\n\nIn the final chapter of the thesis, we present the conclusions and future work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1262], "author_name_tesi": "Saez, Cristian ", "last_name_ssi": "Saez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cristian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Eracleous/George Chartas", "George Chartas", "Michael Eracleous", "Stephane Coutu", "Steinn Sigurdsson", "Derek Brindley Fox"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Eracleous/George Chartas, Dissertation Advisor", "George Chartas, Committee Chair", "Michael Eracleous, Committee Chair", "Stephane Coutu, Committee Member", "Steinn Sigurdsson, Committee Member", "Derek Brindley Fox, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["active galactic nuclei", "X-ray astronomy", "AGN", "astronomy", "extragalactic astronomy"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "PERSISTENT VIRUSES IN PEPPERS: THEIR EVOLUTION AND BENEFICIAL EFFECTS", "id": "14791mus303", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14791", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There are many non-pathogenic viruses that are maintained in a persistent lifestyle in plants. Plant persistent viruses are widespread, replicating in their hosts for many generations. The roles of plant persistent viruses have not been studied thoroughly, but their very long-term relationships with their hosts, and their high level of vertical transmission imply beneficial interactions. So far, Endornaviridae is the only family with a single-stranded RNA genome, containing one large open reading frame. Bell pepper endornavirus (BPEV), Hot pepper endornavirus, Capsicum frutescens endornavirus 1 (CFEV 1) have been identified from peppers. Peppers are native to Central and South America, and as domesticated plants human selection accelerated their evolution. Using a collection of 97 different peppers the evolution of pepper persistent viruses was studied. The evolution of endornaviruses in different peppers was investigated using two fragments from the viral helicase (Hel) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains. In addition, by using single nucleotide polymorphisms the pepper host populations and phylogenies were analyzed. The endornaviruses phylogeny was correlated with its Capsicum species host. In this study BPEV was limited to C. annuum species, and the RdRp and Hel phylogenies identified two clades that correlated with the host pungency. No C. annuum infected with CFEV 1 was found in this study, but the CFEV 1 RdRp fragment was recovered from C.chinense, C. frutescens, and C.bacccutum and C. pubescens.\nPartitiviridae is the most common persistent virus family in wild plants. Jalape\u00f1o and Hungarian Wax peppers (Capsicum annuum) have been reported with Pepper cryptic virus 1 (PCV 1) and Pepper cryptic virus 2 (PCV 2), respectively. Both viruses belong to the genus Deltapartitivirus from Partitiviridae family. The evolution of PCV 1 and PCV 2 was investigated using the RdRp and coat protein of both viruses. Both viruses were detected in cultivated and wild peppers. It is shown that these viruses have a remarkably slow evolution rate in comparison with acute RNA viruses. This might be correlated with the strong purifying selection related to the lifestyle of theses viruses, or the replication strategies in double stranded RNA viruses, that use a stamping machine mode of replication. \nFinally, some potential beneficial effects of persistent virus were examined. In wild plants partitivirus infection decreased the likelihood of acute virus infection. I compared the effect of odor cues from PCV 1 infected (J+) and virus free (J-) Jalape\u00f1o pepper on the aphid Myzus periscae, a common vector of acute plant viruses. Pairwise preference experiments showed a stark contrast to insect-plant interactions in acute virus infections: virus infected plants deterred aphids. The acute plant virus Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) manipulates its host's volatile emission to attract aphid vectors and facilitate its transmission. Volatiles of J+ and J- CMV infected plants were more attractive to aphids than J+ and J- mock inoculated plants. However, in pairwise preference between J+ CMV- and J- CMV-infected plants, aphids preferred the J- CMV volatile blend. Also, aphid fecundity on J+ and J- plants was measured as an indicator for the effect of PCV 1 on host quality for aphids. Aphid reproduction on J+ plants was more than two fold lower than J- plants. This study demonstrates a beneficial relationship between PCV 1 and Jalape\u00f1o plants by protecting the plants from the vector of acute viruses. In addition, the effect of PCV 1 on the Jalape\u00f1o's developmental growth was tested by measuring the average time required for seed germination, emergence of first true leaf, first open flower and dried biomass of plants. PCV 1 showed no significant effect on the developmental growth of Jalape\u00f1o plants.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16136], "author_name_tesi": "Safari, Maliheh ", "last_name_ssi": "Safari", "first_name_ssi": "Maliheh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marilyn J Roossinck", "Marilyn J Roossinck", "Cristina Rosa", "David M.

Specifically we present - for the first time - a rigorous analysis of the benefits of estimating the SOC of multiple cells in a series string together along with supporting simulation evidence and discuss the role and benefits of SOC heterogeneity in a string of identical cells.\nWhile our approach applies generally to most battery chemistries, this thesis focuses on Lithium-Ion cells. We show through derivation of a Fisher information (FI) matrix using a linear first order integrator model of a cell that estimate variance decreases as a larger number of series connected cells is modeled together. The same derivation concludes that the presence of cells with a higher open-circuit voltage vs SOC slope can improve estimate variance even in small strings. We then test the results of the derivation in simulation for both an initial condition estimation problem and a state estimation problem representative of online estimation in battery management systems. This process introduces a modified dual polarization type equivalent circuit model of Lithium Ion batteries. This model maps a combination of the diffusion states and the state of charge to the output voltage: a nuance inspired by the output equation of a physics-based battery model. A discussion of model identification and the design of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for a string composed of an arbitrary number of cells follows. For these purposes the initial conditions of all cells are unknown and the string current measurement is assumed to be biased. We then study the performance of the filter as a function of the number of modeled cells, the voltage vs SOC slope of individual cells (achieved by using different initial conditions for some cells), and the statistics of the current sensor. Monte Carlo simulations against a high fidelity physics based model of a Lithium-Iron-Phosphate string of cells show that increasing the number of modeled cells and heterogeneity in cell initial conditions can improve estimator performance in the presence of current noise: a result that extends earlier analyses of the impact of current bias.

The proteoglycan network consists of glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin sulfate (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA), which regulate the interactions between endothelial cells and their microenvironment. It has been shown that the glycocalyx regulates the adhesion of white blood cells (WBCs) on the walls of postcapillary venules. In the past, researchers have infused fluorescently labeled microspheres (0.1 \u00ecm diameter) labeled with lectins specific for polysaccharides on the endothelial surface layer to quantify changes in the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) composition during inflammation. To examine the changes in glycocalyx composition during increased leukocyte adhesion, f-Met-Leu-Phe peptide (fMLP; 10-7 M) was used to simulate inflammation. In response to superfusion of the mesenteric tissue with 10-7 M fMLP, the heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate GAG components of the glycocalyx were shed and there was an increase in WBC adhesion. Previous studies have demonstrated that the shedding of glycans from the endothelial cell (EC) glycocalyx in response to fMLP could be attenuated by doxycycline (Doxy) through the inhibition of matrixmetalloproteases (MMPs). Since, Doxy is a strong calcium chelator, the present studies were undertaken to determine if the calcium chelator EDTA could produce a similar effect. To this end, WBC-EC adhesion and adhesion of lectin (BS-1) coated microspheres in post-capillary venules of the rat mesentery were studied during superfusion of the tissue with Ringer\u2019s solution solution plus EDTA in the presence or absence of fMLP. In the absence of fMLP, with 1mM EDTA sequestration of microspheres steadily increased with time and with 3 mM EDTA, sequestration reached levels 50% greater than without EDTA. In contrast, with 0.5 \u00ecM Doxy alone, microsphere adhesion remained constant with fMLP alone. Calcium chelation at levels (1mM EDTA) did not inhibit fMLP induced WBC adhesion to the same extent as Doxy and caused a disruption of the venular permeability barrier that resulted in increased microsphere sequestration in the venular wall. Thus, the inhibitory effects of Doxy on glycocalyx shedding and WBC adhesion in response to fMLP appear to be caused by the inhibition of MMPs in contrast to the calcium chelation. Thus, this study suggests that MMPs play a significant role in regulating the thickness of the glycocalyx and calcium is important for the WBC-EC adhesion.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5083], "author_name_tesi": "Sah, Rachna ", "last_name_ssi": "Sah", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rachna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herbert Herling Lipowsky"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herbert Herling Lipowsky, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Glycocalyx Divalent Leukocyte Endothelium"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Nitrous oxide emissions in a landscape transitioning to the energy crops Miscanthus and Switchgrass\n", "id": "27117", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11990", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils are an important component of the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of agricultural systems. These emissions are particularly relevant when considering the transition of land under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grassland to energy crop, like switchgrass and Miscanthus. The N2O fluxes are in general spatially and temporally variable, which makes field monitoring of this flux challenging. Using the infrequent chamber-based method requires knowledge of spatial and temporal inequality of N2O flux distribution. This dissertation focuses on estimating N2O flux from energy crops aforementioned in a landscape typical of Ridge and Valley region with soil and hydrologic heterogeneity.\nIn chapter 2, I used simulation models and statistical methods to assess the uncertainties of cumulative N2O flux estimates obtained by different temporal sampling frequencies. As a corollary of this work, a robust rule-based sampling framework was designed that provides better estimates of this flux with a lower number of sampling events than the typical fixed-interval sampling methods. The daily soil N2O flux was simulated for Ames, IA; College Station, TX; Fort Collins, CO, and Pullman, WA. A regular sampling of 4- and 8-day interval is required at College Station and Ames, respectively, to yield \u00b120% accuracy in the flux estimate, while a 12-day interval renders the same accuracy at Fort Collins and Pullman. The uncertainty of the annual N2O flux estimation increased with increasing interval in the fixed interval method, higher in sites with greater flux variability. The rule-based method provided the same accuracy as that of fixed interval with 60% reduction in sampling numbers. The efficiency is higher in sites with greater flux variability.\nIn chapter 3, I examined the effect of land conversion from CRP to energy crops on N2O emissions and how biogeochemical and hydrological factors control the spatial and temporal inequality of N2O flux distribution. The experiment was located in typical Ridge and Valley landscape near the town of Leck Kill, PA. Soil N2O flux, soil mineral nitrogen availability, and profile soil moisture were monitored in shoulder, backslope, and footslope positions under each plot during the growing season of 2013, the second year after land transition. The cumulative N2O flux was significantly (P = 0.009) influenced by vegetation-by-landscape position interaction. Landscape position, nitrate nitrogen, and subsoil soil aeration (\u03b8A) were the most important variables to influence soil N2O emissions. The regression tree identified highest N2O emissions occur when \u03b8A at 20-40 cm depth is < 0.03 m3 m-3, and when there is nitrate in the soil layer. The footslope positions under energy crops were the hot spots of N2O emissions due to prolonged soil saturation and mineral nitrogen availability. The peak emission was triggered by a 100-mm rain event in early June, and contributed 26% of the cumulative flux. Nitrogen fertilization in switchgrass and chisel plowing during Miscanthus establishment caused 48 and 78% higher cumulative flux than the CRP, respectively. The results suggest that land transition only caused significant increase in N2O emissions from the footslope, while the major part of the watershed is at lesser risk of large emissions.\nThe knowledge of hot spots and hot moments of N2O emissions in the landscape is important for its accurate spatial and temporal monitoring, quantification of the emissions, and to minimize the adverse environmental effects of landscape management. A novel application of the concept of inequality (Lorenz curve and Gini coefficients, G) was used to quantify the heterogeneous distribution of N2O in space and time. The G was better correlated (R2 = 0.71, P < 0.001, n = 16) with daily N2O emissions than the coefficient of variation and skewness. The hot moment by 100 mm rain event caused highly heterogeneous distribution (G = 0.70) of N2O fluxes in the landscape; however, had little influence on inequality of soil CO2 (G = 0.39) flux distribution among the vegetation types and landscape positions. Overall inequality of N2O flux distribution followed the trend: footslope (G = 0.75) > backslope (G = 0.67) > shoulder (G = 0.43). Event-based evolution of N2O flux inequality was in accordance with the hydrologic inequality, given the biogeochemical equality prevails in the landscape. The Lorenz curve and G in association with spatial maps are useful tools to guide landscape-scale management strategies to reduce N2O emissions, as well as spatial and temporal monitoring of N2O emissions.\nBased on the critical threshold of \u03b8A < 0.03 m3 m-3 for N2O emissions, I did a detailed study on three dimensional depletion of \u03b8A during a saturating rain event in early June of 2013. This information would surrogate the movement of N2O emission front in the landscape when other conditions for emissions are satisfied. Faster \u03b8A depletion on June 10 was observed in fine textured soils with higher antecedent water content in the western part of the watershed, especially in the subsurface layers. The \u03b8A depleted faster in the subsurface layers than the surface layer. Rocky and porous southern slope shoulder and backslope positions drained fast. The drainage was faster from the surface soil layer on June 11, while it was gradual in the subsurface layers. Due to this, \u224850% of the watershed area located mostly in the footslope and backslope positions, where a coexistence of an aerobic layer on top of anoxic (\u03b8A < 0.03 m3 m-3) subsurface layer occurred. The measured N2O emissions on June 11 also followed the similar footprint, higher emissions when and where the aerobic layer on top of anoxic layer coexists.\nThe findings of this dissertation improves the characterization of the variability of N2O emission, the strategies to manage these fluxes using the discrete chamber-based measurement method, and provides guidance to manage the establishment of energy crops in CRP land in a typical Ridge and Valley landscape of northeastern United States and beyond.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11428], "author_name_tesi": "Saha, Debasish ", "last_name_ssi": "Saha", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Debasish", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Armen Ricardo Kemanian", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Patrick Joseph Drohan", "Erica A H Smithwick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Armen Ricardo Kemanian, Dissertation Advisor", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian, Committee Chair", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Patrick Joseph Drohan, Committee Member", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nitrous oxide", "Energy crops", "Landscape positions", "Sampling frequency", "Cumulative flux", "Inequality"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "RECONSTRUCTION OF A GENOME-SCALE METABOLIC MODEL OF MAIZE METABOLISM\n", "id": "11633", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5359", "abstract_tesi": "The scope and breadth of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions has continued to expand over the last decade.

Unlike A. thaliana, maize annotation is still underway which introduces significant challenges in the association of metabolic functions to genes.The developed model is designed to meet rigorous standards on gene-protein-reaction (GPR) associations, elementally and charged balanced reactions and a biomass reaction abstracting the relative contribution of all biomass constituents.

As many as 445 reactions and 369 metabolites are unique to maize compared to A. thaliana. All reactions are elementally and charged balanced and localized into six different compartments (i.e., cytoplasm, mitochondrion, plastid, peroxisome, vacuole and extracellular).

Here we assemble, update and compare genome-scale models (iCyt773 and iSyn731) for two phylogenetically related cyanobacterial species, namely Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Comparisons of model predictions against gene essentiality data reveal a specificity of 0.94 (94/100) and a sensitivity of 1 (19/19) for the Synechocystis iSyn731 model. The diurnal rhythm of Cyanothece 51142 metabolism is modeled by constructing separate (light/dark) biomass equations and introducing regulatory restrictions over light and dark phases.  Specific metabolic pathway differences between the two cyanobacteria alluding to different bio-production potentials are reflected in both models. In addition to these cyanobacterial species we also develop a genome-scale model for a plant with direct applications to food and bioenergy production (i.e., maize). The metabolic model Zea mays i1563 contains 1,563 genes and 1,825 metabolites involved in 1,985 reactions from primary and secondary maize metabolism. For approximately 42% of the reactions direct evidence for the participation of the reaction in maize was found. We describe results from performing flux balance analysis under different physiological conditions, (i.e., photosynthesis, photorespiration and respiration) of a C4 plant and also explore model predictions against experimental observations for two naturally occurring mutants (i.e., bm1 and bm3). Recently, we develop a second-generation genome-scale metabolic model for the maize leaf to capture C4 carbon fixation by modeling the interactions between the bundle sheath and mesophyll cells. Condition-specific biomass descriptions are introduced that account for amino acids, fatty acids, soluble sugars, proteins, chlorophyll, lingo-cellulose, and nucleic acids as experimentally measured biomass constituents. Compartmentalization of the model is based on proteomic/transcriptomic data and literature evidence. With the incorporation of the information from MetaCrop and MaizeCyc databases, this updated model spans 5824 genes, 8484 reactions, and 8918 metabolites, an increase of approximately five times the size of the earlier iRS1563 model. Transcriptomic and proteomic data is also used to introduce regulatory constraints in the model to simulate the limited nitrogen condition and glutamine synthetase gln1-3 and gln1-4 mutants. In silico results have achieved over 62% accuracy in predicting the direction of change in the metabolite pool under each of the mutant conditions compared to the wild-type condition with 82% accuracy determined in the limited nitrogen condition. The developed model corresponds to the largest and more complete to-date effort at cataloguing metabolism for any plant tissue-type.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10100], "author_name_tesi": "Saha, Rajib ", "last_name_ssi": "Saha", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rajib", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas", "Costas D Maranas", "Andrew Zydney", "Howard M Salis", "Reka Z Albert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas, Dissertation Advisor", "Costas D Maranas, Committee Chair", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member", "Howard M Salis, Committee Member", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Genome-scale model", "Cyanobacteria", "Zea mays", "Cyanothece sp.

Implementation of such a system can be divided into two necessary parts: \u201cLimit Prediction\u201d which detects the impending violation of the limit parameter, and \u201cLimit Avoidance\u201d where a preventive action is taken in the form of pilot cueing or autonomous limiting.  Depending upon the underlying flight control system, implementation of the envelope limiting system was categorized into two different structures: \u201cInceptor Constraint Architecture\u201d and \u201cCommand Limiting Architecture\u201d. <P>\n\n\n\nThe Inceptor Constraint Architecture is applicable to existing rotorcraft with conventional flight control system where control input proportionally affects control surfaces.  The relationship between control input and limit parameter is complex which requires advanced algorithms for predicting impending limit violations.  This research focuses on limits that exceed in transient response.  A new algorithm was developed for predicting transient response using non-linear functions of measured aircraft states.  The functions were generated off-line using simulation data from a non-real-time simulation model to demonstrate the procedure for extracting them from flight test data.  Constraints on pilot control stick were generated using control input sensitivity of transient peak.  The stick constraints were conveyed to the pilot using a softstop cue on an active control stick.  The system was evaluated in real-time piloted simulation for longitudinal hub moment limit avoidance using two different aggressive maneuvers.  Results showed that the prediction algorithm was effective, as the system reduced frequency and severity of hub moment limit violations without significantly affecting the achievable agility of the aircraft.  Pilot comments suggested a borderline objectionable movement of softstop cue.  This was corrected by distribution of constraints between softstop cue and autonomous protection according to the frequency content. <P>\n\n\n\nModern rotorcraft flight control systems are designed to accurately track certain aircraft states like roll and pitch attitudes which are either specified as command inputs in unmanned rotorcraft or mapped to control stick in piloted aircrafts.  In the Command Limiting Architecture applicable to these systems, performance constraints were generated on the command input corresponding to the envelope limit.  To simulate this flight control system, an adaptive model inversion controller was applied to a non-linear, blade element simulation model of a helicopter.  The controller generated fully-coupled lateral, longitudinal, vertical and yaw axis control inputs using a single design point linear model.  An adaptive neural network compensated for inversion errors.  Ability of the controller to accurately track aircraft states was exploited to implement a longitudinal hub moment limiting system.  A torque protection system was implemented with coupled constraints in longitudinal and vertical axis.  Real-time piloted simulation results showed that aircraft was able to achieve maximum rate of climb, maximum forward acceleration or maximum forward velocity without violating the torque limit. <P>\n\n\n\nFor unmanned rotorcraft (UAV) applications, an Inner Loop \u2013 Outer Loop controller was implemented to achieve trajectory tracking.  In this controller structure, inner loop constraints generated by the envelope protection system place saturation limits in closed loop feedback path.  This causes integrator windup in the presence of integral action in outer loop controller.  An outer loop constraint method was implemented to generate constraints on outer loop command corresponding to inner loop constraints.  For outer loop controller with feed-forward gain, the method was evaluated for the coupled longitudinal and vertical axis torque limit using non-linear simulation model.  For controllers without feed-forward gain, it was evaluated using linear model simulations.  Results showed that the outer loop constraint method resulted in smaller transient peaks and small settling times compared to saturation limits on inner loop command.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4585], "author_name_tesi": "Sahani, Nilesh A.", "last_name_ssi": "Sahani", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Nilesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Francis Horn", "Edward C Smith", "Farhan S Gandhi", "Asok Ray"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Francis Horn, Committee Chair", "Edward C Smith, Committee Member", "Farhan S Gandhi, Committee Member", "Asok Ray, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Envelope protection", "Limit avoidance", "Rotorcraft", "Pilot cueing", "Adaptive control", "Integrator windup"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ACTIVITY, EXPOSURE RATE AND GAMMA SPECTRUM PREDICTION FOR NEUTRON IRRADIATED MATERIALS AT RADIATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CENTER\n\n\n\n", "id": "9093", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1612", "abstract_tesi": "Neutron activation analysis (NAA) is a highly precise and accurate method to determine\nmaterial composition [1]. NAA has been used widely for research and industrial applications.\nWhen a target isotope is irradiated with a neutron flux, then a reaction occurs and secondary\nproducts may be emitted from the product isotope if the product isotope is radioactive. These\nsecondary products can be detected using suitable detectors. In order to determine the content of\nan isotope using NAA, knowledge of reactions that occur when the isotope is irradiated, neutron\nflux and the gamma ray energies that may be released are required. If this is known, the product isotope, and its content can be determined. It will be beneficial to know the activity, exposure rate in air and the resulting gamma spectrum before performing an irradiation experiment in order to prevent unnecessary radiation exposure.\nWith this study NAA experiments that are performed in Penn State Breazeale Reactor\n(PSBR) at Radiation Science and Engineering Center (RSEC) were modeled. The programs\ndeveloped in this study can predict the activities and exposure rates of the irradiated samples, prepare necessary activity prediction reports, and predict spectra that would be obtained using the\nspectroscopy system.\nThe irradiations of the samples take place at dry irradiation tubes of PSBR. The flux\nvalues at these locations are measured using cadmium ratio method with gold-aluminum wires\nand cadmium tubing. The maximum thermal neutron flux was 9.83x10E13 n/cm2-s and the maximum\nresonance flux was 5.03x10E11 n/cm2-s.\nA JAVA [TM] [2] software has been written, called Activity Predictor, which analytically\ncalculates the activity and exposure rates of irradiated samples at a given time after irradiation.\nThe photo peak efficiency and Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) was measured for PSBR-RSEC\nNAA system that utilizes a High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector. A National Institute\nof Standards and Technology (NIST) certified standard reference material was used for those\nmeasurements. Activity Predictor uses the experimental flux values, half-life and decay data from Lund/LBNL Nuclear Data Search [3] and energy absorption coefficient data for air from Shultis et al., [4]. This software generates a rough gamma spectrum prediction using a very fast quasi Monte Carlo method. Analytically calculated activity values and gamma cross section values\nfrom XCOM Photon Cross Sections Database [5] are used for spectrum prediction. Integral counts of the photo peaks are obtained with calculated activity, efficiency of the NAA system,\nmeasured neutron flux and nuclear data. Normal distribution with a FWHM dependent variance is\napplied to generate photo peaks. Integral counts in the Compton continuum are determined with\nenergy dependent Compton scattering to photoelectric absorption cross section ratio for\ngermanium. The energies of the Compton scattered photons are sampled via the Klein-Nishina\nmethod. The software was validated with hand calculations and a series of irradiation\nexperiments. Iron, nickel and copper samples were irradiated at dry irradiation tube 1 (DT1) and\ngamma spectrums were collected. It has been found that Activity Predictor calculates the\nactivities with 0.08-0.4% error, and exposure rates with 2.4-4.7% error compared to hand\ncalculations. The predicted spectra agreed partially in visual manners with 4.8% to 51.3% error in photo peak net area values compared to experimental spectra.\nTo generate a more realistic spectrum, Geant-4, code was used to model the spectroscopy\nsystem in detail. The features of the HPGe detector and surrounding lead shielding are modeled. The model was validated with a NIST certified Co-60 source. The energy and efficiency of the spectroscopy system was measured with Co-60 source. The experimental efficiency of the detector did not fit the Geant-4 modeled detector efficiency values at low gamma energies (<300 keV). Therefore, the dead layer thickness of the detector was adjusted until agreement was achieved. After adjustment, the experimental spectrum for Co-60 agreed very well with predicted spectrum and had 8.6-9.3% error in photo peak net area values. Iron, nickel and copper sample spectra was used for further validation of the model. The predicted spectra agreed very well with\nexperimental spectra in visual manners with 12.1-33.6% error in photo peak net area values.\nAlong with the previously developed Activity Predictor software this new model in Geant-4\nprovides a more realistic spectra prediction for NAA experiments.\nImprovements for the Geant-4 model can be achieved by more accurately determining\ndetector dimensions and inactive regions at the front and sides of the detector. Also the normal\ndistribution generation used for spectrum predictions can be improved with introduction of a new variance variable depending on energy and number of counts.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1595], "author_name_tesi": "Sahin, Dagistan ", "last_name_ssi": "Sahin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dagistan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu", "Kenan Unlu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu, Thesis Advisor", "Kenan Unlu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["prediction", "java", "Monte Carlo", "Geant-4", "neutron", "activity", "irradiation", "gamma", "spectroscopy", "neutron activation analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Tracing footprints of Environmental events in tree ring chemistry using Neutron Activation Analysis\n", "id": "16214", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8057", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aim of this study is to identify environmental effects on tree-ring chemistry. It is known that industrial pollution, volcanic eruptions, dust storms, acid rain and similar events can cause substantial changes in soil chemistry. Establishing whether a particular group of trees is sensitive to these changes in soil environment and registers them in the elemental chemistry of contemporary growth rings is the over-riding goal of any Dendrochemistry research. In this study, elemental concentrations were measured in tree-ring samples of absolutely dated eleven modern forest trees, grown in the Mediterranean region, Turkey, collected and dated by the Malcolm and Carolyn Wiener Laboratory for Aegean and Near Eastern Dendrochronology laboratory at Cornell University. Correlations between measured elemental concentrations in the tree-ring samples were analyzed using statistical tests to answer two questions. Does the current concentration of a particular element depend on any other element within the tree? And, are there any elements showing correlated abnormal concentration changes across the majority of the trees? \nBased on the detailed analysis results, the low mobility of sodium and bromine, positive correlations between calcium, zinc and manganese, positive correlations between trace elements lanthanum, samarium, antimony, and gold within tree-rings were recognized. Moreover, zinc, lanthanum, samarium and bromine showed strong, positive correlations among the trees and were identified as possible environmental signature elements. New Dendrochemistry information found in this study would be also useful in explaining tree physiology and elemental chemistry in Pinus nigra species grown in Turkey. \nElemental concentrations in tree-ring samples were measured using Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) at the Pennsylvania State University Radiation Science and Engineering Center (RSEC). Through this study, advanced methodologies for methodological, computational and experimental NAA were developed to ensure an acceptable accuracy and certainty in the elemental concentration measurements in tree-ring samples. Two independent analysis methods of NAA were used; the well known k-zero method and a novel method developed in this study, called the Multi-isotope Iterative Westcott (MIW) method. The MIW method uses reaction rate probabilities for a group of isotopes, which can be calculated by a neutronic simulation or measured by experimentation, and determines the representative values for the neutron flux and neutron flux characterization parameters based on Westcott convention. Elemental concentration calculations for standard reference material and tree-ring samples were then performed using the MIW and k-zero analysis methods of the NAA and the results were cross verified. \nIn the computational part of this study, a detailed burnup coupled neutronic simulation was developed to analyze real-time neutronic changes in a TRIGA Mark III reactor core, in this study, the Penn State Breazeale Reactor (PSBR) core. To the best of the author`s knowledge, this is the first burnup coupled neutronic simulation with realistic time steps and full fuel temperature profile for a TRIGA reactor using Monte Carlo Utility for Reactor Evolutions (MURE) code and Monte Carlo Neutral-Particle Code (MCNP) coupling. High fidelity and flexibility in the simulation was aimed to replicate the real core operation through the day. This approach resulted in an enhanced accuracy in neutronic representation of the PSBR core with respect to previous neutronic simulation models for the PSBR core.\nAn important contribution was made in the NAA experimentation practices employed in Dendrochemistry studies at the RSEC. Automated laboratory control and analysis software for NAA measurements in the RSEC Radionuclide Applications Laboratory was developed.

One of the major impacts of these constraints is the locational price disparities. This dissertation addresses two policy relevant problems in transmission-constrained electricity markets. First, a model is developed for analysis of supply and demand policies considering the potential distributional impacts caused by the transmission constraints. Second, a potential market design is studied for upgrading the transmission system with Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS).\nMany important electricity policy initiatives, such as imposing emissions taxes or providing incentives for renewable electricity generation, would directly affect the operation of electric power networks.  Evaluating such policies often requires models of how the proposed policy will impact system operations.  Predictive modeling of electric transmission systems, particularly in the face of transmission constraints, is difficult unless the analyst possesses a detailed network model.  Such modeling may require data which is not publicly available. Moreover, policy analysis must often be performed under time constraints, which may prevent the use of complex engineering models.\nFirst part of this dissertation develops a method for estimating short-run zonal supply curves in transmission-constrained electricity markets that can be implemented quickly by policy analysts with training in statistical methods (but not necessarily engineering) and with publicly-available data.  My model enables analysis of distributional impacts of policies affecting operation of electric power grid. I develop a fuzzy nonlinear statistical model that uses fuel prices and zonal electric loads to determine piecewise supply curves, each segment of which represents the influence of a particular technology type on the zonal electricity price.  The domain belonging to different technologies can overlap, which means a mixture of two fuels can be marginal. The magnitude of this overlap is a function of the relative fuel prices. My problem thus requires the simultaneous estimation of the slope of each supply-curve segment, thresholds that define the endpoints of each segment and the level of marginal fuel overlap. I illustrate my methodology by estimating zonal supply curves for the seventeen utility zones in the PJM system, a regional electricity market covering numerous different states.  \nThe zonal supply curves are used to study a state-level energy efficiency and conservation legislation in Pennsylvania, within the context of PJM.  My focus is on the distributive impacts of this policy \u2013 specifically how the policy is likely to impact electricity prices in different areas of Pennsylvania and in the PJM market more generally.  Such spatial differences in policy impacts are difficult to model and the transmission system is often ignored in policy studies. For most utilities in Pennsylvania, it would reduce the influence of natural gas on electricity price formation and increase the influence of coal.  It would also save 2.1 to 2.8 percent of total energy cost in Pennsylvania in a year similar to 2009. The savings are lower than 0.5 percent in other PJM states and the prices may slightly increase in Washington, DC area.\nI also analyze the impacts of imposing a $35/ton tax on emissions of carbon dioxide. My results show that the policy would increase the average prices in PJM by 47 to 89 percent under different fuel price scenarios in the short run, and would lead to short-run inter-fuel substitution between coal and natural gas. \nIn the second part of this dissertation I investigate a potential market design for operation of FACTS with the advantages coming from the smart grid technology. Traditionally, electric system operators have dispatched generation to minimize total production costs, assuming a fixed transmission topology within the dispatch horizon. Implementation of smart-grid systems could allow operators to co-optimize transmission topology alongside generator dispatch; the technologies that would enable such co-optimization are still regulated as part of the monopoly transmission system. There are a few proposed mechanisms for compensating transmission owners based on flexible electrical characteristics and availability; and integrating transmission into \u201ccomplete\u201d real-time electricity markets. I discuss why FACTS devices do not fall in the category of natural monopolies. Then, I propose a sensitivity-based method to calculate the marginal market value of Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS). Once the marginal value is calculated, different compensation mechanisms can be set up. I study two different such methods for the market-based operation of FACTS, which allows some control over the electrical topology of transmission lines. The first mechanism, compensates the devices based on differences in locational prices (effectively with Financial Transmission Rights), while the second allows FACTS devices to submit supply offers just as generators would, being paid a market-clearing price for additional transfer capability provided to the system. \nMy problem formulation suggests a number of regulatory implications for flexible transmission architecture. First, inclusion of a price signal in the wholesale electricity markets for the FACTS capacity can lead to a more efficient operation of such devices. Second, the additional transfer capability offered by FACTS devices may effectively clear the real-time market in some circumstances (i.e., the additional transfer capability displaces higher-cost generation), suggesting that FACTS devices have the power to set prices. Third, if FACTS devices are compensated based on locational price differentials, the owners of such devices may not have the right incentive to offer the socially optimal amount of transfer capability to the system. The market structure is explained and marginal value for the FACTS capacity is calculated in a two-node and a thirty-bus system. The results show that the outcomes of both payment structures are equivalent when the congestion is large enough.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8485], "author_name_tesi": "Sahraei Ardakani, Mostafa ", "last_name_ssi": "Sahraei Ardakani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mostafa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack", "Andrew Nathan Kleit", "Dr Anastasia Shcherbakova", "Terry Lee Friesz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Nathan Kleit, Committee Member", "Dr Anastasia Shcherbakova, Committee Member", "Terry Lee Friesz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Policy analysis", "Electricity markets", "Pennsylvania act 129", "Carbon tax", "Supply Curve", "Transmission network", "Topology optimization", "FACTS devices"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "REGULATION OF T HELPER CELL RESPONSES AND ALLERGIC ASTHMA BY TEC KINASES, ITK AND TXK\n\n", "id": "8187", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4744", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Tec family of non-receptor kinases has recently emerged as key players in intracellular signaling pathways of T lymphocytes. Tec kinases associate with and activate numerous proteins and serve as amplifiers of the signals generated downstream of the TCR signaling pathway. Lack of Tec kinase Itk reduces the development of life threatening TH2 responses during allergic asthma in murine models. Hence, the pathways regulated by Itk that control the development of TH2 cells or that regulate their cytokine production could represent good targets for controlling this disease. Therefore, in this work, we attempted to get better insight on the role that Itk plays in TH2 responses during allergic asthma.\nUsing a murine model of allergic asthma, we show here, that in the absence of Itk, there are decreased airway hyperresponsiveness and tracheal responses in addition to decreased airway inflammation and mucous production. We also observed decreased production of effector TH2 specific cytokines in the lungs of these mice. These studies demonstrate that Itk plays an important role in developing all the various symptoms associated with allergic asthma.\nAllergic asthma is dependent on chemokine mediated TH2 cell migration and TH2 cytokine secretion into the lungs. Itk regulates the production of TH2 cytokines as well as migration in response to chemokine gradients.  However, the role of kinase activity of Itk in the development of this disease is unclear. In addition, whether distinct Itk-derived signals lead to T cell migration and secretion of TH2 cytokines is also unknown. Using transgenic mice specifically lacking Itk kinase activity, we show that active kinase signaling is required for control of TH2 responses and development of allergic asthma.  Moreover, dominant suppression of Itk kinase activity led to normal TH2 responses, but significantly reduced chemokine mediated migration, resulting in prevention of allergic asthma. These observations indicate that signals required for TH2 responses and migration are differentially sensitive to Itk kinase activity. \nThe Tec kinases, Txk and Itk are believed to play an important role in regulating the differentiation of T helper cells. Itk is expressed in both TH1 and TH2 cells.  By contrast, Txk is preferentially expressed in TH1 cells. Although Itk is required for TH2 responses in vivo and Txk is believed to regulate IFN-\u00e3 expression and TH1 responses, it remains unclear whether these kinases have distinct roles in TH cell differentiation and/or function. To evaluate this question, we examined TH2 responses in an allergic asthma model system using Itk-null mice overexpressing a Txk transgene. We found that the Txk transgene rescued all symptoms of allergic asthma without notable enhancement of IFN-\u00e3 expression.  These results argue that Txk is not a specific regulator for TH1 responses. Importantly, they suggest that Itk and Txk exert their effects on TH cell differentiation/function at the level of expression.\nTo determine if the effect of Itk in the development of allergic asthma was evident in another model of asthma, we tested these mice using the common allergen, house dust mite. Our results show that the absence of Itk also prevented the development of the disease to various doses of this allergen. These data indicate that Itk mediates TH2 responses to common allergens. The data also suggest that Itk regulates TH2 responses via specific signaling mechanisms which cannot be overcome by increasing the amount of antigenic exposure.\nIt has been suggested that cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 play central roles in the development of allergic asthma, and that Itk regulates the production of these cytokines during the development of the disease.  However, Itk is also believed to play an important role in mediating chemokine specific migration. In order to investigate the various roles of Itk, we determined if exogenously administered IL-4 or IL-13, or chemokine CCL-11 into the lungs of Itk null mice during the development of asthma bypassed the potential defects. Our results show that exogenous administration of IL-4 or IL-13 could rescue the development of allergic asthma in these mice suggesting that generation of these effector cytokines is the key function of Itk during induction of allergic asthma. Furthermore, we also show that addition of chemokine CCL-11 alone is able to partially rescue the symptoms associated with allergic asthma via eosinophil mediated IL-4 secretion. These data suggest that chemokines also contribute to the development of the disease by not only facilitating leukocyte migration but also by inducing effector cytokine production through eosinophils. \nIn summary, these studies demonstrate that Itk plays a crucial role in the development of various symptoms associated with TH2 specific allergic asthma by producing TH2 cytokines and regulating chemokine-mediated migration in a kinase activity dependent manner. Hence, manipulation of Itk\u2019s kinase activity can provide a new strategy to treat allergic asthma by differentially affecting migration of T cells into the lungs, leaving TH2 responses intact.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4709], "author_name_tesi": "Sahu, Nisebita ", "last_name_ssi": "Sahu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nisebita", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Avery August", "Robert Paulson", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Pamela Hankey", "Dr Biao He", "Dr Nadine B Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Avery August, Committee Chair", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey, Committee Member", "Dr Biao He, Committee Member", "Dr Nadine B Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Allergic Asthma", "Tec kinases", "Itk", "T helper 2 cells", "cytokines", "chemokines"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Effect of Manganese Doping on PIN-PMN-PT Single Crystals for High Power Applications", "id": "22485", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9536", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Single crystals based on relaxor-lead titanate (relaxor-PT) solid solutions have advanced the world of piezoelectric materials for the past two decades with their giant piezoelectric properties achieved by domain engineered configurations.

When these ternary PIN-PMN-PT crystals are doped with manganese (Mn:PIN-PMN-PT), they behave like hard piezoelectric materials demonstrating an internal bias field (Ei ~0.8-1.6 kV/cm), leading to low elastic losses and high mechanical Q-factor (Qm >600) compared to the undoped binary crystals (Qm of PMN-PT <150).\n\nAlthough the spontaneous polarization directions for these rhombohedral crystals are in the <111>c directions, the giant piezoelectric effect (d33 >2000 pC/N for PMN-PT) occurs in the [001]c poled crystals, which is attributed to the polarization rotation mechanisms. Hence, domain engineering configurations induced by poling these crystals in orientations other than their polarization axis are critical for achieving large piezoelectric effects. Based on the phase diagram of these solid solutions, with the increase in PT content beyond the rhombohedral phase region, orthorhombic/monoclinic and tetragonal phases are formed. In the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, the spontaneous polarization directions are in the [011]c and [001]c directions respectively. Similar to the \u201c4R\u201d domain configuration achieved in [001]c poled rhombohedral crystals, other domain configurations can be achieved by poling the single crystals in different orientations, leading to multitude of properties that are useful for various specified applications. The unique properties and configurations arise from the large anisotropy of the single crystalline materials and various polarization rotation mechanisms that are associated with these multi-domain configurations. \n\nThis dissertation is focused on the properties of manganese doped PIN-PMN-PT ternary single crystals in the rhombohedral phase. By poling them in either [001]c, [011]c, or [111]c, 4R, 2R or 1R domain configuration can be achieved respectively. Longitudinal vibration mode, d33, or k33 is the most useful mode from 4R configuration. The \u201c2R\u201d domain state is obtained by poling the rhombohedral phase crystal along [011]c crystallographic direction. Investigation of \u201c2R\u201d Mn:PIN-PMN-PT single crystals and their properties lead to unique resonance modes (d32, \u201c2R d15\u201d, and d36\u2019) that are very useful and relevant to practical applications. \n\nConsidering the large anisotropy and various symmetries exhibited by these crystals, full set of dielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic properties are extremely critical to understand different modes and their overall behavior in devices. Inconsistencies in full set of properties may be caused by complex methods involved in performing characterization measurements and also inhomogeneity among samples used for the measurements. Due to the large number of coefficients that need to be determined for full property material data, a methodology combining resonance and ultrasound methods is the most widely used technique for consistent measurement of full set properties for these materials. Full property measurements (elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric) for the \u201c2R\u201d Mn:PIN-PMN-PT single crystal poled into orthorhombic mm2 macroscopic symmetry ([011]c poled crystals) and for \u201c4R\u201d configuration ([001]c poled crystals) were conducted and the data was analyzed based on their macroscopic crystallographic symmetry.  Full property data was measured for the 1R configuration of the Mn:PIN-PMN-PT single crystal to understand the monodomain properties and the orientation dependence of dielectric, elastic, and piezoelectric properties. Domain averaging and matrix transformation was performed with the monodomain data to calculate 4R data and compare with that of experimental 4R data. Orientation dependence of the properties is also presented to understand the crystallographic directions that are best suited for the various applications.\n\nThe high sensitivity of PMN-PT and the high Qm of Mn:PIN-PMN-PT provide designers with soft and hard piezoelectric material choices in the relaxor-PT single crystals family. While much work has been done on PMN-PT crystals, research efforts on the Mn:PIN-PMN-PT crystals are limited. Investigation of the Qm for Mn-doped crystals under high power drive conditions is essential for the practical application of these crystals for devices. High power characteristics of the Mn:PIN-PMN-PT single crystals were measured with emphasis on specific modes (transverse mode, d32, and face shear mode, d36\u2019) based on a constant vibration velocity method using a high power characterization system (HiPoCs), and the degradation of Qm as a function of vibration velocity was studied in order to understand the self heating behavior and device limitations. Practical devices that are useful for various applications were designed and performance of these prototype devices was quantitatively evaluated.\n\nThis thesis work provides a concrete advancement in the understanding of doped ternary relaxor-PT ferroelectric single crystals and the influence of their domain engineered configurations on their properties. The emphasis is on vibration modes related to piezoelectric vibrators with the multi-domain single crystals having macroscopic mm2 symmetry. In the last chapter, limitations and future perspectives are also discussed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9309], "author_name_tesi": "Sahul, Raffi ", "last_name_ssi": "Sahul", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Raffi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wenwu Cao", "Shujun Zhang", "Michael T Lanagan", "Bernhard R Tittmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wenwu Cao, Committee Chair", "Shujun Zhang, Committee Chair", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Relaxor-PT ferroelectrics", "Doped Ternary Single Crystal", "High Power Applications", "Engineered Domain Configurations"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "RESISTANT  STARCH  FROM  NOVEL  RS-CONTAINING  PREPARATIONS: RESIDUAL  SUSCEPTIBILITY  TO  AMYLOLYSIS  AND  GROWTH  OF BIFIDOBACTERIUM  STRAINS \n\n", "id": "10494", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1611", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-01-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Starches differ with respect to both digestion rate and digestion extent in the small intestine. The portion of starch not hydrolyzed by pancreatic &#945;-amylase and absorbed in the small intestine is termed resistant starch (RS). The chemical and physical nature of the starch substrate is a critical factor in whether the starch will be hydrolyzed by pancreatic &#945;-amylase in the small intestine. \nResistant starches differ with respect to both hydrolysis rate and hydrolysis extent in the colon. It is generally assumed that hydrolysis in the colon is due to amylolytic enzymes of the bacterial microbiota. While a number of studies have used in vitro procedures to address the question of which colonic bacterial species are capable of degrading RS-containing materials, there appear to be no in vitro studies designed to address the question of which colonic bacterial species are capable of degrading putative RS obtained from a particular RS-containing material. Although bifidobacteria are believed to play an important role in the breakdown and fermentation of complex carbohydrates that reach the colon, no in vitro studies have been published investigating whether a particular bifidobacterium strain can hydrolyze putative RS in vitro. Due to the lack of experimental data, no information is available on whether the chemical and physical nature of RS may influence RS utilization and fermentability by a particular strain of Bifidobacterium. The goal of the present study was to produce and characterize resistant starch-containing preparations with different susceptibilities to pancreatic &#945;-amylase, and compare the growth of selected strains of Bifidobacterium when prepared resistant starches with different susceptibility to continued pancreatic &#945;-amylase digestion are used as the main source of carbohydrate.\nRS-containing starch preparations were obtained by rehydration (at 1% or 2% starch concentration for 16 hours) in the presence of variable levels of isoamylase (0, 10 or 20U/g of starch) of an ethanol precipitate of either common corn starch (CCS) or high-amylose maize starch (HAMS) that had been molecularly dispersed in 0.5N NaOH. Aspects of physical structure such as crystallinity, helicity, and thermal properties were analyzed using wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD), solid-state 13C CP/MAS NMR, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The molecular composition of the RS-containing preparations was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The molecular composition of the RS obtained from the RS-containing preparations was also analyzed by HPSEC.\nWhen the ethanol precipitate was rehydrated in the absence of isoamylase, the RS content was not enhanced for the CCS preparations, but this treatment did enhance RS levels somewhat for the HAMS preparations. HPSEC profiles of fully debranched starch obtained by this rehydration treatment of the ethanol precipitates of CCS and HAMS were similar to the profiles of the corresponding CCS and HAMS starting materials, indicating proportional coprecipitation of amylose and amylopectin from dispersion. The lack of crystallinity in the WXRD spectra, the sharpness of the C4 peak (~82 ppm) in the NMR spectra, and the broadness of the endotherm at <140\u00b0C in the DSC thermograms suggested the presence of amorphous amylose-amylose double helices and mixed double helices between amylose and amylopectin. Physical structures alone could not explain the difference in enzyme susceptibility. Analysis of the molecular composition of the RS obtained from the RS-containing preparations suggested that the longer double helices in the HAMS samples were more resistant to enzymatic digestion than the shorter double helices in the CCS samples, thus accounting for the difference in RS content between the samples.\nDebranching of starch molecules with isoamylase during the rehydration treatment was effective in enhancing RS levels even for CCS. Chemical characterization of CCS and HAMS samples obtained by debranching of the ethanol precipitate during rehydration indicated preferential co-precipitation of amylose and the longer linear chains generated from amylopectin debranching. A greater percentage of crystallinity as observed by WXRD, and the greater enthalpy of melting as observed by DSC for the debranched samples indicated that greater double helical order resulted. Although little increase in crystallinity resulted from HAMS so treated, for CCS the RS content increased with increasing of crystallinity.\nFor CCS, the sample rehydrated at 2% with 20U isoamylase (2%R-20U) gave the highest starch recovery (48%) and the highest proportion of RS (18%). Therefore, to compare the nature of the preparations obtained, the CCS and HAMS samples rehydrated at 2% starch concentration with 20U isoamylase were used in further studies. For these two samples, the effect of particle size and thermal treatment on RS content was investigated. The thermal treatment consisted in subjecting the samples to a 30 min boiling treatment in buffer prior to adding &#945;-amylase for RS determination. The proportion of RS decreased from 35 to 19% for CCS 2%R-20U and from 42 to 23% for HAMS 2%R-20U, as particle size decreased (from 355<x<550 to x<125 &#956;m). Particle size did not influence the molecular composition of the RS recovered. The proportion of RS after thermal treatment was independent of particle size, about 14% for the CCS sample and 23% for the HAMS sample. Molecular composition of the RS indicated a greater proportion of longer double helices in the thermally treated RS than in RS. This outcome was attributed to melting of the shorter chains during the thermal treatment and to double helical association of the then mobile longer chains during the thermal treatment or during cooling.\n\u201cPutative\u201d RS was isolated after digestion according to the official method for in vitro RS determination (AOAC 2002.02, AACC 32-40). It is considered putative RS because it was obtained by an in vitro method. The time course of digestion of RS-containing starches by pancreatic &#945;-amylase and the residual susceptibility of the putative RS to further pancreatic &#945;-amylase digestion was determined for the selected novel RS-containing preparations (CCS 2%R-20U and HAMS 2%R-20U) and for two commercial RS-containing starches (HAMS and heat-moisture-treated HAMS (HMT)). The time course of digestion data were fitted by using a double exponential decay equation (with 5 parameters) or a triple exponential decay equation (with 6 parameters). Because a limit for pancreatic &#945;-amylase digestion was not reached within the stipulated 16 h digestion of the official method for in vitro determination of RS, the putative RS is susceptible to further pancreatic &#945;-amylase digestion. The putative RS materials differed in the extent of residual susceptibility. Kinetic analysis of the digestion time course showed that the RS from HMT had the lowest residual susceptibility to pancreatic &#945;-amylase digestion among the four samples tested. \nThe presence of residual amylolytic activity associated with the recovered putative RS was observed. The presence of residual pancreatic &#945;-amylase was observed for all four RS investigated. To decrease a possibly artefactual level of associated pancreatic &#945;-amylase, in subsequent work putative RS was recovered without ethanol precipitation. Whether the residual pancreatic &#945;-amylase could make an important contribution to further digestion of RS was investigated by treating the recovered RS as the starch in the official method for in vitro RS determination, except that no additional pancreatic &#945;-amylase was added to the maleate buffer. Each of the four RS tested was to some extent further digested by the residual pancreatic &#945;-amylase. \nRS from HAMS was used to determine whether further digestion of putative RS by the action of two levels of residual pancreatic &#945;-amylase differently influenced growth and survival for three strains of Bifidobacterium (B. pseudolongum ATCC 25526, B. animalis subsp. lactis DSMZ 10140, and B. animalis subsp. lactis BB12) differing in their ability to degrade starch according to a screening procedure. Further RS digestion due to associated pancreatic &#945;-amylase differentially benefited the three strains of Bifidobacterium tested.\nBecause a primary objective of the present thesis was to explore whether bifidobacterium strains could degrade RS, every effort was made to reduce the amylolytic activity associated with the recovered RS without losing integrity of the RS structure. The most effective treatment in reducing the residual amylolytic activity was 24 h incubation at 37\u00b0C of the recovered RS (without ethanol precipitation) in 0.1% EDTA solution. Although this EDTA treatment reduced the residual amylolytic activity of the RS recovered in the supernatant by more than 95%, the total level of residual pancreatic &#945;-amylase associated with the EDTA treated RS could not be quantified. \nFinally, the putative RS from HAMS, HMT, CCS 2%R-20U and HAMS 2%R-20U was recovered, exposed to the EDTA treatment, and used as the main carbohydrate source in MRS medium to evaluate the growth of three strains of Bifidobacterium (B. choerinum ATCC 27686, B. infantis ATCC 15697, and B. pseudolongum ATCC 25526) each of which had been shown to partially degrade RS-containing starch according to prior screening. For all three strains, the putative RS from HMT, having the lowest residual susceptibility to pancreatic &#945;-amylase digestion, had the least favorable effect on viable cell counts. This outcome indicates that the susceptibility of RS to further digestion may influence the ability of specific Bifidobacterium strains to utilize the RS for growth in vitro.\nThis research shows for the first time that Bifidobacterium strains can differently utilize different forms of putative RS in vitro. Although it would be inappropriate to conclude about differences in the extent of colonic degradation of the four starches in vivo, as other amylolytic activities in the colon are likely to act on each RS, this study represents an important advance in the understanding of RS as substrate for Bifidobacterium strains.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1594], "author_name_tesi": "Saibene, Debora ", "last_name_ssi": "Saibene", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Debora", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald B Thompson", "Donald B Thompson", "Robert F Roberts", "John Coupland", "Ming Tien", "Ian L Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald B Thompson, Dissertation Advisor", "Donald B Thompson, Committee Chair", "Robert F Roberts, Committee Member", "John Coupland, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Ian L Brown, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ancreatic alpha-amylase", "Resistant starch", "bifidobacterium", "amylolysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Richard Glendon, Breakthrough Kinesis, and the Impact of the 1920 Olympic Naval Academy Crew on Rowing", "id": "6296", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5554", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThis dissertation is in three parts: the story of the American sporting tradition linked to its British roots; the commitment to surpass Britannia and reign supreme in Naval might at a time in history when sea power was indicative of world political power; and the marriage of philosophy and history in the ethereal fabric of a performance barrier ruptured by \u201cBreakthrough kinesis.\u201d  The question this paper addresses is this: Did Glendon and his 1920 Navy Crew influence rowing and aid nationalism in the Golden Age of sport, and has this crew had long reaching effects on the modern world?

People from all classes in Mumbai use the railway stations, making the spaces that support these stations extremely significant to the city\u2019s public identity. These spaces take urban mobility beyond the role of transportation. Put differently, urban mobility in Mumbai does not correspond to a singular, rigid path; rather, transit pathways intersect the spaces of everyday activities, which interfere with the planned uses of the transit pathways. These everyday activities are temporal and change alongside the needs of the people, creating a socio-spatial phenomenon. This phenomenon is explored through this study as the \u201ctransient multiple claims\u201d of urban spaces.  \n\nThis thesis seeks a more inclusive method of structuring public spaces in the planning of cities in order to create a grounded understanding of contemporary urbanism. It postulates that contemporary practices of urban design and government regulations are moving towards the creation of public spaces with singular use, thereby rendering the spaces privileged public spaces. Aspirations and visions for an ideal city which are created and publicized through images and texts published in newspapers, magazines and government documents of urban design based proposals are analyzed in this study. The impact of those aspirations on the actual use of the urban spaces is documented. Through an analysis of contemporary planning techniques that have emerged in Mumbai since the neo-liberalization of India\u2019s economy in the 1990s, I argue that these gathering spaces have become privileged urban spaces meant for a selective population. Designed with the idea of their having singular uses causes them to lose their role in the socio-economic development of the city. This study emphasis that urban public spaces are places of active contestation and negotiation. To retain this quality, urban designers must see the spaces as spaces that are able to grow and change through use rather than as spaces with rigid, singular purposes.\n\nMy contention is that no urban space of Mumbai can be experienced to its fullest without an understanding that active public life is governed by transient multiple claims and resulting spatial modifications. In deconstructing these socio-spatial events, I devise a method that uses existing spatial practices to develop a more socially sustainable pathway towards new urban design. Using observation of spaces and behavioral mapping, I examine the urban spaces around Bandra local railway station to determine how urban mobility and its accompanying activities are manifested both spatially and socially and how these manifestations affect the resultant urban fabric.\nThe resulting analysis demonstrates a clear need to put urban design in dialogue with existing modes of socio-spatial practices. As designers, we need to retain the plurality of urban spaces by allowing transient multiple claims to engage with the spaces. In this thesis, I begin to provide a conceptual framework for urban design that uses the transient multiple claims and socio-economic networks emerging from the site itself in the process of design. Ultimately, in providing critical analysis of socio-spatial activities in Mumbai\u2019s railway spaces, I aim to create a pathway towards inclusive and adaptable forms of urban civic spaces.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10820], "author_name_tesi": "Sakalker, Amruta Amol", "last_name_ssi": "Sakalker", "middle_name_ssi": "Amol", "first_name_ssi": "Amruta", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexandra Staub"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alexandra Staub, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Public spaces", "Mumbai", "Civic Spaces", "Transient Multiple claim", "Temporal public spaces", "street vendors", "Railway stations"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "IMAGE-GUIDED ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING", "id": "13473aks5800", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13473", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Additive manufacturing is often a complex undertaking involving interaction between an energy source, feedstock, and substrate.

Extensive testing has provided the design and construction of rocket engines which have been very reliable. Safety procedures have been developed for the handling and storage for hypergolic propellants, which all too often are highly toxic. But the condensed phase chemistry for these hypergolic propellants is not very well understood. The models in place for ignition and combustion do not handle the coming together of two liquid streams of these hypergols and the two-phase aspects that are expected once the reactions occur. Moreover, it is not clear what makes a fuel and oxidizer pair hypergolic in nature.\n\nThe coupling of physical and chemical factors that control the ignition of hypergolic propellants makes the direct study of the transient ignition process difficult. The current study presents a novel method to study hypergolic propellants (very fast liquid reactions) using microreactors instead of conventional drop tests, modified versions thereof or impinging jet tests. Planar counterflow microreactors are used to isolate liquid-phase reactions from secondary gas phase reactions that occur later during the ignition process and thus provide valuable insight in to the pre-ignition mechanism. \n\nThe microreactor fabrication, flow field characterization, reactivity results from experiments performed using a variety of fuels and nitric acid as the oxidizer and numerical simulation results of reactive flow in the microreactor are presented in this study. Particle image velocimetry measurements and numerical simulations were conducted to characterize the laminar velocity flow-field in the microreactor and strain rates at the stagnation point along the centerline of the microreactor. Temperature measurements at the stagnation zone, the exit and positions along the length of the microreactor were used as a measure for the extent of the reaction or the heat released from the reaction. For the hypergols, an increase in reactant flow (or equivalently strain rate at the stagnation point) was found to initially increase temperatures at both the stagnation zone as well as along the length of the reactor, but eventually resulted in a decrease in temperature, revealing a maxima in temperature and reactivity.  The trends indicated a reaction that was initially diffusion or heat loss controlled, which transitioned towards kinetic control at higher strain (flow) rates. Numerical simulations of the reactive flow in the microreactor stagnation zone were also carried out in which the reaction zone in the microreactor was treated similar to the reaction zone occurring in a counter-flow diffusion flame. These simulations showed that the flow rates at which the peak in temperature occurred was dependent on the rate of the reaction occurring between the hypergol pairs. The numerical simulations also show that heat loss from the top and bottom surfaces can play a role on the temperature trends seen in the microreactor.

The focus of this research was to further investigate the reactive ball milling process developed by Lueking et al. for combined hydrogen production, storage, and nano-crystalline diamond (NCD) formation [1].  This work investigates the role of metals in the structural evolution of carbon during the process, including the formation of NCD, and the role of the carbon precursor in the structural transformations and hydrogen evolution characteristics.\n\t\nBuck Mountain anthracite (BMT) coal, demineralized BMT (DBMT), DBMT with added iron, and DBMT with added stainless steel were used to explore the role of metals in structural transformations and NCD formation.  In each case, the coal was milled with cyclohexene in a stainless steel planetary mill.  After milling, select samples were annealed at 1673 K; both as-milled and annealed samples were treated with 4M HCl followed by 10 M NaOH.  Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ultra-violet Raman (UVR) probed carbon structure, metal content, and metal- carbon interactions.  The results clearly show that metal is introduced during milling due to attrition of the stainless steel milling components.  Introduced metal is converted to carbides during the thermal anneal, carbon is graphitized, and metals become encapsulated in carbon.  The 4 M HCl treatment leads to further changes in the carbon structure, and this is more pronounced when the thermal anneal is omitted.  The 10 M NaOH treatment leads to changes in the carbon structure.  With the thermal anneal, the 10 M NaOH treatment leads to the formation of both more and less ordered carbon fractions and reduces the amount of iron carbide.  The results support the hypothesis that iron carbide plays a key role in the formation of NCD.  Evidence for a NCD vibration in UVR is found in one sample.\n\nSecondly, Demineralized Summit (DS) anthracite coal, before and after a thermal anneal at 1673 K (DS-HT), along with graphite, were used to assess the role of precursor order on structural transformations induced by reactive ball milling.  Along with TPO, XRD, and UVR, helium density, solvent swelling, and nitrogen adsorption were used to assess structural transformations of the carbons with milling. Reactive ball milling of graphite led to a decrease in crystallite dimensions, the formation of amorphous carbon, and increased surface area made up primarily of mesoporous carbon.  Milled graphite exhibited solvent swelling, an indication of a three-dimensional networked structure.  The least ordered precursor, DS, had no evidence of amorphous carbon after milling in TPO analysis.  XRD indicated milling DS increased the in-plane crystallite size and led to the formation of a \u2018gamma-phase\u2019 which was not evident in the other materials.  UVR indicated an increased sp2 clustering upon milling of DS, an effect which was not observed for the other materials.  Milling of DS led to the most significant increase in N2 BET surface area, and the pores were microporous in nature.  Annealing DS prior to milling increased the metal input during milling, and led to structural changes of the carbon that resembled those of graphite.  Additional studies suggested milling time and cyclohexene addition had little effect on structural transformation relative to carbon precursor and synthesis sequence.  Thermo-gravimetric mass spectrometry (TGMS) of the materials confirmed cyclohexene dehydrogenation during milling, similar to previous studies.  Only milled DS exhibited low temperature hydrogen evolution after extended storage, and the total hydrogen evolution from milled DS exceeded that of milled graphite. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [550], "author_name_tesi": "Sakti, Apurba ", "last_name_ssi": "Sakti", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Apurba", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Angela Lueking"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Angela Lueking, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogen evolution", "structural transformation", "coal", "hydrogen", "nanodiamond", "ball milling"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Cyanobacterial quinomics.

Most studies have focused on measures of subjective well-being or the relationship between objective and subjective well-being.  Beyond the link between subjective and objective well-being, the reality in Peru shows a high rate of internal migration which raises questions about the impact of migration on the perceived changes in subjective well-being of this population.  \nThis thesis attempts to understand the relationship between changes in subjective well-being and internal migration in Peru by comparing outcomes between migrant and non-migrant households.  The study is focused on three populations to reflect household migration status: rural-to-urban permanent migrants, rural temporary migrants, and children growing up in migrant households.  Perceived changes in quality of life is employed as an indicator of subjective well-being for the period 2005-2006 with three possible outcomes: getting better, remaining the same, or getting worse.  \nUsing data from a national household survey in Peru (ENAHO), this thesis proposes three hypotheses for analysis.  First, it is hypothesized that rural households that migrate to Peru\u2019s urban areas perceive that as the economy improves around them \u2013 as happened during the period of this study \u2013 that their subjective well-being lags behind that of urban natives.  Second, it is hypothesized that in rural areas, temporary migration decreases the households\u2019 subjective well-being, as the household becomes more fragmented in order to survive economically.  And third, the \u2018next generation\u2019 young adults in rural-to-urban migrant households perceive that their subjective well-being is more likely to be improving, especially in comparison to their parents.      \nApplying a generalized ordered logit estimation, the results show that migration status is statistically significant only in the permanent migration model when used to explain differences in the perceived changes between permanent migrant households and urban native households.  In the temporary migration model, migration status fails to explain the differences in perceived changes of quality of life between rural households experiencing temporary migration with those rural households with non-migration behavior.  Additionally, the results suggest that factors explaining subjective well-being vary depending on the type of migration considered in the analysis.  Finally, for the third hypothesis, results show that the migration situation of children explains their more positive perception of household quality of life in comparison to children native to urban areas.  In addition, the model results show that household per capita income is an important variable for all households, and that the relative income hypothesis applies in urban areas of Peru.  Changes in GDP do not translate directly to improvements in quality of life for all households, but rather have differential effects \u2013 some households appear to receive a boost in well-being whereas others perceive a decline in household quality of life even when community income levels are controlled in the models.  Finally, family variables are found to contribute to improvements in subjective well-being for households, with advancing age, a chronic health condition and being female having negative influences on perceived quality of life. \nThe results of this research serve to underscore the importance of using the subjective well-being approach to complement the objective well-being (economic) indicators that are traditionally relied upon.  Countries in the EU, as well as Thailand, already use subjective well-being measures for policy, recognizing that other indicators beyond the traditional \u2013 including both social and environmental \u2013 are potentially important.  The results of this research clearly show that while important, income is only one dimension of quality of life, among many. \nAnd finally, the application of the subjective approach to migrant population in Peru has provided important insights, and as importantly has raised new research questions that are well worth exploring.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6391], "author_name_tesi": "Salas Garc\u00eda, Vania Bitia", "last_name_ssi": "Salas Garc\u00eda", "middle_name_ssi": "Bitia", "first_name_ssi": "Vania", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis", "Jill Leslie Findeis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis, Thesis Advisor", "Jill Leslie Findeis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["subjective well-being", "migration"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on Economic Development: International migration, Social networks, and Social capital.", "id": "19276", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8761", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Three essays are included in this dissertation; each approaches development strategies with different research methods and data.  The focus of this dissertation is on analyzing the impacts of international remittances and social networks as development strategies pursued by households and small rural firms, respectively.  This dissertation extends the study of social networks to determine the effect of population movement variables such as migration and commuting on social capital.  Thus, the link among these three chapters is the analysis of development strategies with an emphasis on the role of these strategies in enhancing economic development.\n\tThe first essay investigates the effect of international migration on children left behind in Peru.  The research question posed is: what is the role of international remittances in human capital formation of children left behind, separating the effect of absenteeism of parents (due to migration, divorce or other) from the effect of remittances?  The theoretical model is based on human capital theory and educational investment decisions linked to remittances.  The model proposes to analyze the role of international remittances on the investment decision between sending children to a public or a private school, that is, the decision to acquire a higher quality of education.  Using different econometric strategies to address endogeneity, I find that remittances have a positive effect on the likelihood of sending children to private schools, controlling for absenteeism of parents.\n\tThe second essay uses unique survey data to identify the role of social networks on small rural firms\u2019 performance located in the Northeast United States (Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania); specifically, two networks are evaluated: social support and economic.  There are two specific objectives: 1) to evaluate the effect of direct and indirect network ties within a cluster on the economic viability of small rural business by using out-degree and closeness, respectively, and 2) to evaluate the impact of a network\u2019s topology on small rural firms by using density.  After addressing sample selection and endogeneity biases, the estimation of the business success models shows that creating direct and indirect ties in the economic and the social support networks will improve economic performance as measured by the reported percent change in products sold and in net farm income.  In addition, the results indicate that strong networks (i.e., a high density degree) will be detrimental to economic performance of small rural firms.\n\tThe third essay follows the line of research of the second essay on social networks to extend the literature on social capital.  This research includes migration, commuting (flow and time) and centrality network indicators as population movement indicators to examine the effects of those variables on the production of social capital, and its change over time.  I exploit the directionality of these variables by including in- and out- per capita flows for migration and commuting.  The results show that the effects of population movement variables on social capital vary according to the direction of the flow.  To identify these effects, I use data from U.S. counties and employ three different econometric techniques: linear regression, spatial econometric, and panel data.  I find that the migration variables (in- and out-) and the centrality network indicator closeness for migration and commuting have a significant effect whereas the commuting variables (in- and out-) do not have a clear effect.  Out-migration positively affects the creation of social capital but in-migration has a negative effect.  Finally, the closeness indicator for migration and commuting has a negative effect on social capital.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8614], "author_name_tesi": "Salas Garc\u00eda, Vania Bitia", "last_name_ssi": "Salas Garc\u00eda", "middle_name_ssi": "Bitia", "first_name_ssi": "Vania", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephan J Goetz", "Stephan J Goetz", "David Gerard Abler", "Edward C Jaenicke", "Kai Arthur Schafft"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephan J Goetz, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephan J Goetz, Committee Chair", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Member", "Kai Arthur Schafft, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Development", "networking", "social capital"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Groundwater Games: Users' behavior in Common-pool Resource economic laboratory and field experiments", "id": "21357", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9677", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Groundwater currently provides 30 percent of freshwater in the world, and it is\nestimated that it potentially constitutes approximately 89 percent of the world's fresh\nwater.

Economists and political scientists have devoted a great\namount of e\u000bffort to understand how common pool resources are managed, as well as the\ncharacteristics of institutions that emerge in order to deal with the use and distribution\nof CPR. The characteristics of a CPR and how agents interact in their use are important\nfor the success and sustainability of CPR-dependent communities.\nThis dissertation will analyze the behavior and decision rules of CPR users in\nan experimental context. We discuss the results from laboratory and \ffield experiments\nframed as a dynamic groundwater game in which users pump water from a shared resource,\nand the actions of users in one period aff\u000bect resource availability and extraction\ncosts of everyone in the next period.

Nanometer-size organically modified fillers of montmorillonite (oMMT), calcium carbonate (CC), or both oMMT and CC were used as fillers, and all composites were produced via conventional melt-blending techniques, namely extrusion, injection molding, compression molding, or extrusion blow-molding for films. The focus of this research was on the role of the different kind of polymer-filler and filler-filler interactions in the composites\u2019 morphology, rheological, and thermomechanical properties. In particular, synergies between fillers and new properties were designed and investigated, as they could relate to macroscopic performances of heat sealants for flexible film packaging applications.\nAmong the new scientific findings from this work, some characteristic examples include: (a) The interactions beween LLDPE-grafted-maleic anhydride (LLDPE-g-MAH) and oMMT can be designed to promote the formation of thermodynamically favored polymer-mediated filler-assemblies that, in turn,  yield composites with strong solid-like rheological behaviors at low frequencies.  (b) In a different approach, EVA/oMMT combinations can be designed to promote preferential dispersion of the silicate nanofillers in EVA-rich phases, leading to the formation of topologically jammed filler-networks that, in turn, yield composites with less solid-like rheological behavior and with improved mechanical properties at ambient temperatures. (c) Finally,  it was also found that there are temperature-associated effects in the filler networks formation and stability for these multi-component systems. Namely, all nanocomposites having LLDPE-g-MAH functional copolymer show deviations from the time-temperature superposition (tTS) principle, whereas for nanocomposites having EVA as the only functional copolymer tTS is nicely satisfied.  \nThe most interesting, probably, findings from this thesis are associated with (d) synergies between MMT and CC nanofillers, in dual-filler composites. Specifically, composites with superior filler dispersions and amplified property improvements were designed and prepared for both the above polymer matrices. Investigating the macroscopic (mechanical, rheological) properties of these composites, revealed: (d1) for ambient temperature mechanical properties, there is a simultaneous increase in tensile modulus and in elongation at break when oMMT is introduced in EVA/PE blend matrix nanocomposites. However, further addition of CC, as second filler in the composite, largely removes the toughening effect of the oMMT, decreasing the elongation at break in the two-filler composites. This change in mechanical response, upon addition of CC particles to EVA/PE/oMMT nanocomposites, was traced to non-typical highly-exfoliated clay morphologies. It is apparent that these exfoliated morphologies are due to a synergy between CC and oMMT, and an oMMT edge-modification process, in which the hydroxyl groups at the edges of the oMMT layers are reacting with the alkyl-carboxyl surface-treatements of the CC particles, has been postulated as the possible mechanism. (d2) The CC-induced highly-exfoliated clay morphologies also modify substantially the viscoelastic properties of the composites, leading to a very pronounced low-frequency solid-like character: This response was attributed to the larger populations of  highly exfoliated clay layers, which can promote the formation of polymer-mediated filler-networks, more in populations and stronger in association than in the single-filler respective composites (LLDPE-g-MAH/oMMT). \nIn the second part of the thesis, the impact of the above composite fundamentals are studied in view of properties associated with flexible packaging applications, namely peel strength design and caulking ability upon  heat-sealing. Specifically: (e) The addition of CC fillers does not significantly alter the mechanisms responsible for peelability in EVA/PE/oMMT nanocomposites, as reported before, so that EVA/PE/oMMT/CC systems exhibited similar ultra-broad temperature-range of peelability as EVA/PE/oMMT sealants before. However, (f) changes in other thermomechanical properties (tensile, seal-strength, caulking-ability and heat capacity) were observed, and all are consistent with the additional clay exfoliation induced by the CC particles as co-fillers. Such property changes depend systematically on the CC content, up to a critical concentration, and exhibiting a percolation reminiscent leveling-off above that concentration.

The first essay compares two standard notions of rational choice under uncertainty: dominance by pure actions, and dominance by pure or mixed actions. I show that these two notions are equivalent for agents that exhibit sufficient risk aversion. Moreover, risk aversion is a cardinal property. Thus, the different forms of dominance considered cannot be distinguished based solely on the ordinal data that can be directly inferred from observed choices.\n\nThe second essay explores the consequences of relaxing a standard assumption in the analysis of strategic situations: the assumption that choices are made simultaneously and independently. Choice interdependence can have drastic consequences. For example, it can enable cooperation in some single-shot prisoners\u2019 dilemmas without the use of binding contracts or side payments. I consider a class partially specified environments in which the actions available to each agent and the agents\u2019 preferences are fixed, but the sequential and information structures of choices are design variables. I propose a simple and tractable solution concept\u2014interdependent choice equilibrium\u2014that fully characterizes all the outcomes that can be implemented in such environments without contracts or side-payments.\n\nThe third essay proposes a model of dynamic price competition between firms that use automated pricing algorithms to set their prices. In my model, algorithms are fixed in the short run but can be revised at exogenous dates, and each firms is able to decode its rival\u2019s algorithm. I show that, when the revision opportunities are infrequent relative to the arrival of consumers into the market, every sub-game perfect equilibrium of the game leads in the long run to profits that are arbitrarily close to the Pareto frontier. That is, the use of pricing algorithms might not only facilitate collusion, but might inevitably lead to it. In contrast with the plethora of equilibria that typically arises in models of repeated competition, my model is able to generate sharp predictions about the behavior of the firms in the long run.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12025, 12037], "author_name_tesi": "Salcedo Gonzalez, Bruno ", "last_name_ssi": "Salcedo Gonzalez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bruno", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward James Green", "Vijay Krishna", "Ruilin Zhou", "Lisa Lipowski Posey", "Lisa Lipowski Posey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward James Green, Dissertation Advisor", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Chair", "Ruilin Zhou, Committee Member", "Lisa Lipowski Posey, Committee Member", "Lisa Lipowski Posey, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Game Theory", "Economics", "Industrial Organization", "Collusion", "Pricing Algorithms", "Repeated Games", "Prisoners Dilemma", "Risk Aversion", "Rationality"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "CHOOSING THE RIGHT INFORMATION COORDINATING MECHANISM FOR THE INTERNATIONAL OCEAN SHIPPING PROCESS", "id": "7098", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2941", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The international shipment of freight container by liner ocean carrier is fraught with uncertainty arising from a number of sources.  The deregulation of the international ocean liner industry provided the impetus for carriers to offer Internet portal services to reduce some of this uncertainty.  The Federal Maritime Commission expected these services to improve the ocean shipping process especially for smaller shippers.  The trade press reports though, were inconsistent with expectations.  \n\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the current nature of utilization and potential value of the Internet portal, Electronic Data Interchange, and, phone, fax and e-mail for conducting the international shipment of freight containers by ocean liners.  The theoretical basis for the model used to answer the research questions utilizes a contingency approach, which assumes that only a certain level of a solution is appropriate for a specific level of a problem.  The rationale of the model is that firms increase their information processing capabilities, by using EDI or Internet portals, in response to increasing information processing needs, arising from higher uncertainty.  It was expected that firms who displayed such a fit would perform better than firms who did not. \n\nThe data analysis revealed the existence of four differently configured gestalts of shippers.  As expected, the gestalts that configured their information processing capabilities according to their information processing requirements performed the best.  It was observed that large shippers with a large number of containers shipped and a higher value of shipments along with stable demand and supply, and routine uncomplicated tasks benefited from the long lead times of ocean shipping.  They could use low information processing capabilities to manage their shipping process.  However, when the number of overseas suppliers increased higher information processing requirements were required to maintain high performance.

The Y122 radical (Y122\u2022) generates, by electron transfer over a remarkably long distance, a cysteinyl radical in its partner subunit, R1. The cysteinyl radical (C439\u2022) initiates the catalytic reaction by removal of a hydrogen atom from the substrate. The long-distance R1-->R2 electron transfer step seems to be mediated by 5 amino acids in R2 and two\nothers in R1, but the mechanism of this remarkable process is not well understood. The\nmechanism of Y122\u2022 formation involves transient oxidation of a near-surface residue\ntryptophan 48 (W48) by a kinetically masked diiron(II)-O2 adduct. This step produces an\nintermediate state containing W48 cation radical (W48+\u2022) and the formally Fe2(III/IV)\ncluster X. The last step of the reaction is the slow oxidation of Y122 by X to produce the\ncatalytically essential Y122\u2022.\nOxygen activation by R2 is mechanistically similar to oxidation reactions\ncatalyzed by other members of the diiron-carboxylate family of oxidases and oxygenases,\nmost notably methane monooxygenase hydroxylase (MMOH) and stearoyl acyl carrier\nprotein &#916;-9 desaturase. R2 and MMOH share similar tertiary structures and contain\nalmost indistinguishable diiron clusters. Despite these similarities, the outcomes of their\nreactions with O2 are quite different: alkane hydroxylation in MMOH and formation of a\nstable tyrosyl radical by one-electron oxidation of Y122 in R2. Two intermediates, P and\nQ, have been detected in the MMOH reaction and are thought to have \u00b5-[1, 2-\nperoxo]diiron(III) and bis-\u00b5-[oxo]diiron(IV) structures, respectively. In the R2 reaction,\nonly X has been unequivocally demonstrated, because the one-electron-more-oxidized\nprecursor to X undergoes rapid reduction by the indole sidechain of W48. Identification\nof the precursor to X has been a challenging yet crucial step in understanding the\nmechanism of oxygen activation by R2. This task has been adopted by several\ninvestigators in the field who proposed that the subtle differences in coordination that are\nobserved in these two proteins are of secondary functional significance, and that both\nproteins direct reactions that begin with one or more common intermediate down\ndivergent mechanistic pathways. In Chapter 3, we have achieved the long-sought goal of\ncharacterizing this species by application of chemical, kinetic, and spectroscopic\nmethods, including protein mutagenesis combined with chemical rescue (Chapter 2), and\nstopped-flow absorption and rapid freeze-quench electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)\nand M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopies. In this chapter, evidence that the \u201ckinetically masked\u201d\nintermediate in the reaction of R2 has a geometry and electronic structure distinct from\nthose of intermediates P and Q of MMOH is presented. The results show that the state,\ntrapped in the reaction of the variant R2-W48A/Y122F (with the wild-type ligand set),\ncomprises at least two complexes that are in rapid equilibrium. Each is diamagnetic and\nexhibits a M&ouml;ssbauer quadrupole doublet with parameters characteristic of high-spin\nFe(III). Each is probably a peroxodiiron(III) structural isomer of the P-like \u00b5-[1,2-\nperoxo]diiron(III) species, previously characterized in the reactions of D84E variants of\nR2 (the Asp to Glu substitution renders the ligand set of R2 identical to that of MMOH).\nAt present it is postulated that the complexes detected in the chemical rescue experiments\nwith R2-W48A/Y122F are two rapidly inter-converting successors to the \u00b5-[1,2-\nperoxo]diiron(III) complex that is extremely fleeting in R2 proteins with the wild-type\nligand set but longer lived in D84E-containing variants.\nThe mechanism of rapid transfer of the electron to the \u201ckinetically masked\u201d\nintermediate resulting in the formation of X involves transient oxidation of the near-surface\nresidue W48 to its cation radical (W48+\u2022). W48+\u2022 is readily reduced by facile\none-electron reductants such as ascorbate, Fe(II)aq, or thiols. A detailed examination of\npathways for decay of the W48+\u2022 in the absence of a reductant in the wild-type protein,\nR2-Y122F, R2-Y356F, and R2-Y122F/Y356F is presented in Chapter 4. This study\nuncovered what we believe is a previously unforeseen mechanism of gating of electron\ntransfer to the diiron cluster during O2 activation by R2 involving binding of a divalent\nmetal cation between the flexible, carboxylate-rich C-terminus of the protein and the\nregion that includes the electron-shuttling residue, W48. This discovery emerged from\nnoting that W48+\u2022 decays via three simultaneous pathways in the absence of a reductant.\nOne pathway for W48+\u2022 decay involves reduction by Y356, the catalytically essential\ntyrosine in the flexible C-terminus. Mediation of W48+\u2022 reduction by Y356 was shown to\nbe dependent on the presence of salt and most efficient in the presence of divalent cations\nsuch as Mg2+. This result lead to the hypothesis that Y356, which is located at the\nsurface of the R2 subunit on the flexible C-terminus, becomes more ordered and at closer\nproximity with the W48 residue at higher salt concentrations, allowing for facile electron\ntransfer between it and W48. The concentration of divalent metal ion required to exert\nthis effect is sufficiently low that we suspect that this phenomenon may be important in\nthe physiological function of the protein. Chapter 5 investigates potential Mg2+ ligands\non the C-terminus and the surface of R2 (close to W48) that could drive this conformational effect that places Y356 into proximity to and electronic communication with the W48+\u2022. It is likely that the divalent metal ion requirement reflects its role in redox mediation not only in steps during O2 activation by R2 but also at the R1-R2 interface during RNR catalysis.\nIn the last chapter (6), we transition from examining O2 activation in the isolated\nR2 subunit from E. coli to examining the reaction in the recently identified class Ic R2\nproteins, specifically R2 from Chlamydia trachomatis (R2Ct). Class Ic R2 proteins\n(found mostly in pathogenic eubacteria) lack the conserved tyrosine that forms the radical\nin class Ia and Ib R2s. A recent study proposed a novel radical-generation strategy in\nthese RNRs, in which the cluster X-like complex in C. trachomatis R2 (XCt) generates\nthe cysteine radical in R1, by-passing the intermediate Y\u2022 radical that serves this function\nin class Ia and Ib RNRs. In other words, the study suggested that O2 activation at the\ndiiron(II) center in R2Ct is coupled directly to production of the catalytically essential\nradical in R1. A primary objective in our study of these novel RNRs is to test the\nhypothesis that O2 activation in R2Ct directly generates the Cys radical in R1, and\nultimately to understand the mechanism of this step and how it fits into the overall\ncatalytic cycle. To do so, we set out to dissect the mechanism of the R2Ct reaction by\nkinetic (stopped-flow and freeze-quench) and spectroscopic (optical absorption, EPR, and\nM&ouml;ssbauer) methods. Our studies elucidated an alternative electron-injection pathway in\nwhich a tyrosine residue, and not W51 (the cogante residue of W48), acts as an electron\nshuttle to the diiron center of R2ct, resulting in the formation of a transient Y\u2022 detected by\nstopped-flow spectroscopy and EPR spectroscopy. It was first assumed that this role\nmight be adopted by Y338 (the cogante residue of Y356) and that the transient Y\u2022 formed might, directly or through an electron transfer pathway constituted of tyrosine residues in R1, oxidize the catalytic cysteine in R1. Although Y338 was shown (by mutagenesis) not to play this role, it was revealed that it communicates with the tyrosine of interest in a fashion similar to that observed to occur between W48 and Y356 in E. coli R2 in the presence of Mg2+. On the basis of these results and other observations discussed in Chapter 6, we posit that electron transfer to the diiron center of R2Ct does not occur to Fe1, as is the reactions of E. coli and mouse R2s, but is mediated by a chain of hydrogen-bonded residues comprising Y112, a water molecule, a second sphere aspartate, E119,\n(E119 is only E in the class Ic proteins and is conserved therein), and the H123 ligand to\nFe2. In other words, we propose a remodeling by evolution to employ an Fe2-side specific electron transfer pathway, a remarkable diversion from the mechanism for and\npathway of electron transfer employed by the class Ia R2 proteins.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3878], "author_name_tesi": "Saleh, Lana ", "last_name_ssi": "Saleh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Carsten Krebs", "Squire J Booker", "John H Golbeck", "Sharon Hammes Schiffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Chair", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member", "Sharon Hammes Schiffer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["R2", "chlamydia trachomatis", "W48", "tryptophan cation radical", "precursor to X", "Y356", "electron injection", "Mg2+", "class Ic"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Improving Low Temperature Performance of Lithium Ion Batteries", "id": "23510", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10788", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Low performance of lithium ion batteries was demonstrated through experimental data.

Running the column experiments under a broad range of conditions, we were able to find the conditions under which the effect of spatial distribution of magnesite mattered in determining column-scale dissolution rate. The flow-through column experiments were conducted in plexiglass laboratory columns packed with magnesite and quartz forming different spatial patterns. Uniform and layered distributions, the two common distributions of minerals occurring in subsurface, were chosen as the spatial patterns for our experiments. The uniform pattern contained a uniform mixture of magnesite and quartz and was referred to as the \u201cMixed column.\u201d The layered patterns contained layers of magnesite distributed within the matrix of quartz. We studied the effect of the orientation of magnesite layers on overall dissolution rate. The magnesite layers were placed either transverse or parallel to the direction of the flow: \u201cflow-transverse\u201d and \u201cflow-parallel columns.\u201d In the flow-transverse column, a layer of magnesite was horizontally laid within the column. In the flow-parallel columns, cylindrical layers of magnesite were vertically placed in the column. To investigate the effect of the number of layers on column-scale dissolution rate, one, two, and three cylindrical layers of magnesite were placed in columns: \u201cOne-zone\u201d, \u201cTwo-zone\u201d, and \u201cThree-zone\u201d columns. The amount of magnesite was kept almost the same in all the experiments (10% v/v). All the columns were flushed with acidic brine (pH=4) at a series of flow velocities ranging from 0.015 to 36 m/d. \nComparing the rates of the Mixed with the rates of the One-zone flow transverse columns under all tested conditions (three length scales of 5, 10, and 22 cm and a series of flow velocities ranging from 0.18 m/d to 36 m/d) the results showed that the column-scale dissolution rate of the Mixed column was always higher than that of the One-zone column. At different flow velocities, the column-scale magnesite dissolution rate varied between 6.40\u00d710-12 and 1.02\u00d710-9 mol/m2/s. When comparing columns of different lengths under similar conditions of flow velocity and spatial distribution, the dissolution rate was higher in the shorter column (5 cm). In the longest columns (22 cm), under medium flow velocity (3.6 m/d), the Mixed column showed 1.14 times higher dissolution rate compared to that of the One-zone column. This was the largest rate difference among the flow-transverse columns.\nFor the Mixed and flow-parallel columns, we systematically quantified dissolution rates under different conditions of flow velocities and permeability contrasts. The column experiments were conducted on two sets of columns with different permeability contrasts. The sets contained Mixed column and flow-parallel Three-zone, Two-zone, and One-zone columns. The permeability contrasts between the magnesite and quartz zones in the One-zone column (\uf06bratio) were found to be 0.74 and 1.2 for sets one and two, respectively. The columns were run under a series of flow velocities ranging from 0.015 to 18 m/d. The results showed that the column-scale dissolution rates were different under different conditions of spatial heterogeneity, flow velocity, and permeability contrast. Under all tested conditions, the Mixed column had the highest dissolution rate compared to the flow-parallel columns. The rates of all the spatial patterns were lower at smaller flow regimes. The effect of permeability contrast did not affect the rates of the Mixed columns. However, the One-zone column with \uf06bratio of 0.74 showed 2% to 29% lower dissolution rate compared to that of the One-zone column with \uf06bratio of 1.2. \nUsing two-dimensional reactive transport simulation, we defined two important surface areas: effective surface area (Ae) and interface surface area (AI). The value of Ae describes the surface area of the grains that effectively participate in dissolution because they interact with fluids that are far from chemical equilibrium (IAP/Keq<0.1); and the value of AI is the effective surface areas laid at the magnesite-quartz interface which is the two outer grid blocks of the magnesite zone. Both Ae and AI are portions of the total BET surface area (AT) calculated by model fitting. We found that the spatial distribution of magnesite affected the Ae and AI values of the columns. This effect can be negligible or significant depending on the flow and permeability contrast. At low flow velocity, both Mixed and One-zone columns were everywhere at equilibrium and their Ae values were zero, in the other words, the spatial distribution did not have any effect on magnesite dissolution rate. On the other hand, at high flow velocity and low permeability of the magnesite zone (\uf06bratio =0.74), the Ae value of the Mixed column determined in the simulation varied up to 80% larger than that of the One-zone column. The column-scale rate of the Mixed column could be 2.4 times higher than that of the One-zone column. \nThe results showed that the effect of spatial distribution of magnesite matters when the mass transport is limited in the magnesite zone and the dissolution reaction mainly occurs at the magnesite-sand interface. This happens under specific conditions of spatial distribution of magnesite, flow velocity and permeability contrast. First, when the magnesite zone is distributed in the direction parallel to the direction of the flow. Second, when the flow velocity is high. And third, when the permeability of the magnesite zone is low. \nAlthough Ae is easy to understand, it is difficult to measure. For the One-zone column, simulating more than 36 different conditions of flow regimes and permeability contrast helped us to find the conditions under which the estimation of Ae is possible based on the spatial distribution. Our Ae analysis revealed that at high flow regimes and low permeability of the magnesite zone, the AI/Ae of the One-zone column is close to 1. This means that for layered distribution of magnesite in natural sediments, we can roughly estimate the value of AI using the calculated surface area of the grains at the interface of the reactive and nonreactive zones. The column-scale bulk dissolution rate of magnesite can then be calculated using AI as an estimation of Ae in the equation .

We hypothesized that cytohesin-2/ARNO could transmit R-Ras signals by regulating the recycling of R-Ras through ARF activation.

Savignon\nThis study investigated the effect of journal writing as a communicative technique on written performance, writing apprehension, perceived sense of writing abilities, and attitudes of Egyptian EFL English majors. It also explored the relationship between L1 (Arabic) and L2 (English) writing performance. The initial number of participants in this study was 50 third-year English Department male students in the College of Education, Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. They were randomly selected and assigned into the treatment groups; the experimental group included 25 whereas the control group included 25 students. Both groups studied an Essay and Composition course for a semester. For the purpose of this study, the experimental group did an extra assignment in which each student wrote a minimum 200-word journal entry on topics that interested him once a week for ten intermittent weeks. \nThe treatment was administered voluntarily by an associate professor in Applied Linguistics who commented on the experimental group\u2019s journal entries by focusing on meaning and content and ignoring surface structural features such as grammar, punctuation, and mechanics.  Instruments included a writing test graded by two independent raters using Jacobs et al.\u2019s (1981) Composition Profile, the Writing Apprehension Test prepared by Daly and Miller (1975) and adapted to L2 by Gungle and Taylor (1989), and attitude questionnaires developed by the researcher. In addition, tutor interview, participants\u2019 written comments, and their perceived sense of writing abilities were utilized as qualitative data collection techniques. The pre- and posttest data from 41 students were analyzed using means, t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Content analysis was used and categories were created for the themes students raised while writing their impressions on the treatment.\nThe findings revealed significant differences between the experimental group and the control group in written performance in favor of the experimental group. This result was supported by qualitative evidence showing that the final journal entries of six students randomly selected from the experimental group indicated development in ideas, coherence, cohesion, and voice. Moreover, journal writing had positive effects on decreasing writing apprehension and developing students\u2019 perceived sense of their writing abilities. Analyzing the attitude questionnaires revealed that the experimental group had strong positive attitudes toward journal writing whereas the control group had neutral attitudes toward traditional writing instruction. However, the qualitative analysis showed positive attitudes toward journal writing and negative attitudes toward traditional writing teaching. Results were interpreted considering the context in which the study was conducted. The study concluded with discussing the findings reached, presenting implications, and suggesting topics for further research.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4340], "author_name_tesi": "Salem, Muhammad Solyman Abdel-Sayed", "last_name_ssi": "Salem", "middle_name_ssi": "Solyman Abdel-Sayed", "first_name_ssi": "Muhammad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sandra J.

Since the adhesive properties of a bacterium are determined by its own surface structure and the surface it is coming in contact with, both of these variables must be investigated to understand adhesion.

Bacterial adhesion in aquifers can also reduce the effectiveness of bioaugmentation techniques for treating polluted landfills.\nIn this study, Microbe and Radiolabel Kinesis (MARK) mini-column tests and atomic force microscope (AFM) experiments were used to understand the dependence of bacterial adhesion characteristics on variables such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) chain length, solution ionic strength, and substrate hydrophobicity.  Column tests were also run using inorganic polystyrene colloids to demonstrate the influence of biomolecules, as well as colloid geometry, on adhesion.\nIt was shown that bacteria do adhere more readily to hydrophobic surfaces, as experiments of bacteria contacting silanized substrates showed.

The SFS energy must be known to recover the true pressure field from the modified pressure used in simulations and may be used to form an eddy viscosity to model the SFS stress tensor. The SFS energy also must be known in LES of compressible flow to close the set of governing equations. The one-equation model, which determines the SFS energy through the numerical solution of its rate equation, is frequently used in LES. Although this approach is common, it has a high computational cost and requires closure assumptions. \nSeveral alternative models for the SFS energy have been proposed, including models formed by dimensional analysis, others that assume a spectral shape which is integrated to obtain the SFS energy, and others that are based on the hypothesis of scale similarity. Many of these models are strictly global, however, meaning that they can only predict the average SFS energy. A local model is proposed for the SFS energy in LES of the ABL that is based on the scale similarity between the SFS energy and the trace of the Leonard stress tensor. The SFS energy model is derived from a stability-dependent atmospheric model of the energy spectrum that incorporates the effects of buoyancy and shear and therefore can account for the shape of the energy spectrum at low wavenumbers. Furthermore, this approach has a lower computational cost than the one-equation model, since the Leonard stress can be calculated easily in simulations. Results from an a priori test using data from the Horizontal Array Turbulence Study (HATS) demonstrate that the model performs well in both a global and a local sense. The model is able to correctly predict the average SFS energy for most stabilities and dimensionless filter widths considered, and does so more accurately than a similar model that assumes an infinite -5/3 energy spectrum. The model also performs well in a local sense, producing a probability distribution function (PDF) similar to that of the actual SFS energy. This procedure is also extended to develop a model for the SFS temperature variance. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5793], "author_name_tesi": "Salesky, Scott Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Salesky", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marcelo Chamecki", "Marcelo Chamecki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marcelo Chamecki, Thesis Advisor", "Marcelo Chamecki, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["SFS modeling", "turbulence", "atmospheric boundary layer", "large eddy simulation", "SFS energy"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Monin-Obukhov Similarity and Convective Organization in the Unstable Atmospheric Boundary Layer", "id": "22387", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10159", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the atmospheric surface layer (ASL), relationships between turbulent fluxes of momentum, heat and other scalars, and their mean gradients are described by Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), which states that any quantity of interest normalized by the proper scales (the height z, the kinematic surface shear stress u_*^2 = -tau_0/rho, the kinematic surface heat flux <wt>_0, and the buoyancy parameter g/Theta_0) will be a function only of the MOST stability parameter z/L. Although MOST is the standard framework in micrometerology, hydrology, ecology, and other disciplines used to interpret experimental measurements, to estimate turbulent fluxes (e.g. of trace gases) that cannot be calculated directly, and to parameterize turbulent transport in numerical weather and climate prediction models, a number of fundamental questions regarding the relationships between turbulent fluxes and their mean gradients in the ASL remain unanswered. \n\nWhen turbulent fluxes cannot be calculated directly, they are often estimated from MOST functions that relate the fluxes to mean gradients as a function of z/L. However, these functions are not predicted by theory and must be determined empirically. As a result, the connections between the observed behavior of these empirical curves and fundamental properties of turbulence in the ASL (e.g. the energy spectrum, turbulent kinetic energy budget, and integral lengthscales) are not well understood. The connections between the observed behavior of the dimensionless mean wind shear phi_m with z/L and observed properties of turbulence including the stability variation of the horizontal and vertical integral lengthscales are investigated using a theoretical framework coupled with ASL data from the Advection Horizontal Array Turbulence Study (AHATS). It is found that coefficients in empirical curves for phi_m(z/L) can be explained by accounting for the stability-dependence of the horizontal and vertical integral lengthscales, and the effect of buoyancy on the integral lengthscales is investigated in detail. \n\nWhen MOST functions are calculated from experimental data, a significant amount of scatter is typically found relative to empirical curves. The cause of this scatter is debated in the literature and, although many researchers attribute the scatter to random errors (i.e. due to an insufficient averaging period for the time average to converge to the true ensemble mean), others suggest that the scatter is physically meaningful and is due to physical processes that are neglected by MOST. In order to determine the extent to which random errors and physical processes each contribute to the observed scatter in experimental measurements, it is necessary to have a reliable method for estimating random errors. Most existing error estimation methods require an estimate of the integral time scale, which is highly sensitive to the method used to estimate it. A new method for estimating random errors, based on filtering the timeseries of the quantity of interest at multiple scales, is proposed and intercompared with existing error estimation methods. The new error estimation method is found to compare well with existing methods and does not require an a priori estimate of the integral timescale. In addition, it can be applied to estimate random errors in moments of any order. \n\nUsing the new error estimation method, together with error propagation analysis, the influence of random errors on the observed scatter in MOST functions calculated from experimental data is explored. Errors in the turbulent fluxes and gradients are propagated to z/L, phi_m, and the dimensionless mean temperature gradient phi_h. Errors in the MOST stability parameter z/L are found to be large for unstable conditions, reaching values of 40% or more. Statistical hypothesis tests are used to demonstrate that random errors in z/L and phi_m or phi_h do not explain the observed scatter. In addition, deviations of phi_m from empirical curves are found to have strong diurnal variation and to increase with height, which suggests that physical processes related to the daytime growth of the convective boundary layer are responsible for the observed deviations from MOST. \n\nFinally, the large scale structure of convective organization in the unstable atmospheric boundary layer is investigated using large eddy simulation. Both observational and numerical studies have revealed that convective updrafts are organized into longitudinal rolls for slightly convective conditions and into open cells for highly convective conditions. However, the physical processes responsible for the transition from roll- to cellular- type convection, the nature of the transition (i.e. whether it occurs rapidly or gradually), and the criteria for the transition are not well understood. A suite of large eddy simulations spanning a range of -z_i/L, where z_i is the ABL depth and L is the Obukhov length, are conducted. Vertical profiles of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) anisotropy are found to collapse into three discrete regimes, which correspond to rolls, transitional structures, and cells in the velocity and temperature fields. The transitional regime is observed for 11 < -z_i/L < 20, and is characterized by oscillatory behavior between roll-like and cell-like features.

Controlling the indoor PM exposure relies on an accurate understanding of aerosol transport, as well as accurate real-time monitoring of PM concentration level in the indoor environment. \nIndoor aerosol transport is a cycle involving continuous repetitions of deposition and resuspension of particles from indoor surfaces. Occupants\u2019 activities such as walking, and indoor environmental conditions such as relative humidity (RH), influence the resuspension rate of particles. The first objective of this dissertation was to investigate the effects of RH and turbulent air swirls on the resuspension rate of allergen carrier particles from indoor surfaces.  This study shows that increasing RH can reduce the resuspension and spread of hydrophilic particles such as dust mites and that the presence of carpet significantly increased resuspension rates compared to linoleum flooring surfaces.\nThis study also analyzes the efficacy of indoor PM sensing with current technologies. Effective PM removal strategies depend on continuous monitoring of indoor aerosols. Although PM monitoring in buildings has not been feasible due to high PM sensor cost, the recent advent of low-cost optical PM sensors has enabled real-time PM monitoring with high spatiotemporal resolution. Since biological particles such as dust mites, pollen, and pet dander are linked to respiratory and allergic symptoms among building occupants, PM sensors can be utilized to accurately measure bioaerosols. However, the performance of low-cost particle sensors in monitoring bioaerosols is under-investigated. Thus, the second objective of this dissertation was to evaluate the performance of low-cost optical particle counters (OPC) in monitoring the common indoor bioaerosols. Controlled chamber experiment results showed that low-cost OPCs performance is strongly influenced by particle concentrations being measured. Low-cost OPCs did not show a linear response compared to the reference sensor in the concentration range less than 5/cm3 for measuring PM2.5 bioaerosol concentrations, while the tested sensors exhibited more linear responses in the range greater than 5/cm3. For each low-cost OPC, particle-specific, as well as average linear calibration equations that work well for the aggregate of tested bioaerosols, were developed.\nOne of the challenges in particle monitoring is size characterization due to the variable and irregular shapes. Usually, for application purposes, particles are assumed to be perfect spheres with corresponding spherical physical behaviors and properties. The general process typically defines a sphere with similar physical properties and assigns it an equivalent diameter size. Aerodynamic equivalent diameter is the most commonly used particle size. While aerodynamic size characterization is required for PM transport and exposure studies, optical-based sensors are used in place of aerodynamic-based sensing in most field applications. The validity of such practice has been called into question by previous studies and further investigation of the relationship between aerodynamic and optical size measurement is necessary. Consequently, the third objective of this dissertation was to experimentally compare the size-resolved concentration measurements of an aerodynamic particle sizer with an optical particle counter. Comparison of multiple tests with sixteen -monodisperse and polydisperse, biological and non-biological- particles showed that the particle type, size, and the measurement size fraction affect the relationship between the two PM sensing techniques. Accordingly, particle type and size-resolved specific empirical linear calibration curves between the two sensors for size fractions of smaller than 10 \u00b5m, smaller than 2.5 \u00b5m, and total number counts were provided. These calibrations provide an opportunity for real-world application of current technologies to reduce the PM exposure health risks for the public.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16953], "author_name_tesi": "Salimifard, Parichehr ", "last_name_ssi": "Salimifard", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Parichehr", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donghyun Rim", "Donghyun Rim", "James D.

Research for developed nations suggests that in contexts of educational expansion, \u201chorizontal\u201d inequalities in the quality or type of education replace \u201cvertical\u201d differences in access to or amount of schooling. I build upon this research and seek to contribute to it through a comprehensive analysis of socioeconomic stratification between public \nand private schools in Chile and Mexico. I consider differences across countries, educational levels and over time, as well as long-term consequences on adult status attainment. Furthermore, I conduct a historical and institutional analysis of the origins and development of education in Latin America to provide a historically-grounded explanation of why school sector stratification is currently so high in Latin America compared to other world regions, and also why levels and patterns of school privatization and school sector stratification vary within Latin American countries. Chile has very high levels of educational expansion and educational privatization. Mexico, by contrast, has not yet achieved the levels of expansion observable in Chile. Mexico has one of the region's most statist and centralized educational systems, though privatization at secondary and tertiary educational levels is an emerging trend. The data I use in this study comes from two nationally representative social mobility surveys of adult men born between 1937 and \n1976 in Chile (CSMS 2001) and 1947 and 1986 in Mexico (EMOVI-2011). Analyses follow a multinomial logistic regression and linear regression approach.\nFindings show that school sector stratification emerges in Chile as early as primary school, whereas in Mexico it becomes significant at the secondary level. School sector in primary school is a strong predictor of continuation and sector placement at subsequent school transitions in both countries. The probability of the upper strata attending a private high school has been very high and constant for the entire period under study in both countries; this suggests a relationship of reinforcement (rather than replacement) between vertical and horizontal educational advantages for the children of the elite. In Chile, the probability that middle-SES students will attend the public sector has declined at all levels in parallel to the increase in the chances of attending the private-subsidized sector, especially for those attending school after the voucher reform of the 1980s. This suggests a national trend of replacement for middle-SES groups. A second set of findings shows that private school attendance has significant direct effects on adult occupational attainment, net of family background and years of schooling; in Chile, occupational returns are larger for private primary schools, and for Mexico they are larger for private high schools. Also, there is a significant interaction effect in that attending a private school (at any level in Chile and at higher levels in Mexico) increases the occupational returns of each additional year of schooling. The occupational gap between public and private students has increased over time in Chile, whereas in Mexico it has remained stable. \nThese finding contribute to the literature on education inequality by expanding current \nhypotheses about horizontal stratification in order to account for: a variety of organizational forms, including private schooling and school choice policies; the fact that horizontal differences appear as early as primary education, and have long-term consequences in adult occupational attainment; vertical and horizontal forms of educational stratification can relate to one another not \nonly in terms of replacement, but also of reinforcement. In sum, this study of how Mexican and Chilean organizational differences in school provision affect educational opportunities informs the larger international discussion on the way the mechanisms of social stratification change as education as an institution expands and globalizes.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9914], "author_name_tesi": "Salinas, Daniel R", "last_name_ssi": "Salinas", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David P Baker", "Katerina Bodovski", "Soo Yong Byun", "Glenn A Firebaugh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David P Baker, Committee Chair", "Katerina Bodovski, Committee Member", "Soo Yong Byun, Committee Member", "Glenn A Firebaugh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Education", "school expansion", "inequality", "Chile", "Mexico", "Private schools", "stratification"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Data Analysis and Modeling of NESTOR SSG Heated Rod Bundle Experiments using VIPRE-I for the Assessment of the Onset of Nucleate Boiling Criteria\n", "id": "10875", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5234", "abstract_tesi": "The modeling and understanding of Axial Offset Anomaly (AOA) and its imposed risks in Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) cores is important because of the severe restrictions it places on the operation of the core.

Because crud deposition is pronounced in areas of localized sub-cooled boiling, it is important to have accurate prediction models for determining the localization of boiling zones in PWR cores in order to understand and model AOA.  Due to these concerns and the need for accurate Onset of Nucleate Boiling (ONB) modeling, an experimental program known as NESTOR was performed by Commissariat \u00e0 l\u2019Energie Atomique (CEA, France), Electricit\u00e9 de France (EDF, France) and Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI, USA).  The aim of the NESTOR program was to assess and, if necessary, develop an accurate ONB model based on wall superheat criterion.  The experiment involved using two identical 5x5 rod-bundle flow loops, one heated and one unheated, for the purpose of gathering detailed rod surface temperature and sub-channel axial velocity measurements at prototypical PWR conditions.  Each of the flow loops included tests run on both a bare-bundle configuration, which contained only Simple Support Grids (SSG), and a prototypical rod-bundle configuration, which contained alternating SSGs and Mixing Vane Grids (MVG).

Because COBRA-TF was originally developed for vertically-\ndominated, in-vessel, sub-channel \ufb02ow, extension of the COBRA-TF modeling\nregion to the horizontal-pipe geometries of the coolant-lines required several code\nmodi\ufb01cations, including:\n\n\u2022 Inclusion of the strati\ufb01ed \ufb02ow regime into the COBRA-TF \ufb02ow regime map,\nalong with associated interfacial drag, wall drag and interfacial heat transfer\ncorrelations,\n\u2022 Inclusion of a horizontal-strati\ufb01cation force between adjacent mesh cells hav-\ning unequal levels of strati\ufb01ed \ufb02ow, and\n\u2022 Generation of a new code-input interface for the modeling of coolant-lines.\n\nThe sheer number of COBRA-TF modi\ufb01cations that were required to complete\nthis work turned this project into a code-development project as much as it was\na study of thermal-hydraulics in reactor coolant-lines. The means for achieving these tasks shifted along the way, ultimately leading the the development of a\nseparate, nearly completely independent one-dimensional, two-phase-\ufb02ow modeling\ncode geared toward reactor coolant-line analysis. This developed code has been\nnamed CLAP, for Coolant-Line-Analysis Package. Versions were created that were\nboth coupled to COBRA-TF and standalone, with the most recent version being\na standalone code.\n\nThis code performs a separate, simpli\ufb01ed, 1-D solution of the conservation\nequations while making special considerations for coolant-line geometry and \ufb02ow\nphenomena. The end of this project saw a functional code package that demon-\nstrates a stable numerical solution and that has gone through a series of Validation\nand Veri\ufb01cation tests using the Two-Phase Testing Facility (TPTF) experimental\ndata[2]. The results indicate that CLAP is under-performing RELAP5-MOD3 in\npredicting the experimental void of the TPTF facility in some cases. There is\nno apparent pattern, however, to point to a consistent type of case that the code\nfails to predict properly (e.g., low-\ufb02ow, high-\ufb02ow, discharging to full vessel, or dis-\ncharging to empty vessel). Pressure-pro\ufb01le predicitons are sometimes unrealistic,\nwhich indicates that there may be a problem with test-case boundary conditions\nor with the coupling of continuity and momentum equations in the solution al-\ngorithm. The code does predict the \ufb02ow regime correctly for all cases with the\nstrati\ufb01cation-force model o\ufb00. Turning the strati\ufb01cation model on can cause the\nlow-\ufb02ow case void pro\ufb01les to over-react to the force and the \ufb02ow regime to tran-\nsition out of strati\ufb01ed \ufb02ow. The code would bene\ufb01t from an increased amount of\nValidation & Veri\ufb01cation testing.\n\nThe development of CLAP was signi\ufb01cant, as it is a cleanly written, logical\nrepresentation of the reactor coolant-line geometry. It is stable and capable of\nmodeling basic \ufb02ow physics in the reactor coolant-line. Code development and de-\nbugging required the temporary removal of the energy equation and mass-transfer\nterms in governing equations. The reintroduction of these terms will allow future\ncoupling to RELAP and re-coupling with COBRA-TF. Adding in more applicable\nentrainment and de-entrainment models would allow the capture of more advanced\nphysics in the coolant-line that can be expected during Loss-of-Coolant Accident.\nOne of the package\u2019s bene\ufb01ts is its ability to be used as a platform for future\ncoolant-line model development and implementation, including capturing of the\nimportant de-entrainment behavior in reactor hot-legs (steam-binding e\ufb00ect) and\n\ufb02ow convection in the upper-plenum region of the vessel.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8072], "author_name_tesi": "Salko, Robert Keith", "last_name_ssi": "Salko", "middle_name_ssi": "Keith", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Vincent Perez Benitez Jr.", "Emilian Popov"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova, Dissertation Advisor", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Vincent Perez Benitez Jr., Committee Member", "Emilian Popov, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["COBRA-TF", "coolant line", "horizontal startified flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Relational Meaning in Sexual Fantasy Disclosures", "id": "25725", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11349", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Grounded within relational framing theory, the goal of this thesis is to explore the relational meaning intimate partners attach to sexual fantasy disclosures.

This study also revealed that social work students were familiar with the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) Code of ethics; however, students in teacher preparation reported minimal discussion of ethical terminology or codes of ethics in their coursework.  \t\n\tFurther, students in teacher preparation reason through ethical dilemmas adhering to either an ethic of care or an ethic of justice orientation as described in the Shapiro and Stefkovich (2011) framework for ethical decision-making and a Stage Three from Kohlberg\u2019s Theory of Moral Development (1975). Many students in teacher preparation expressed a preoccupation with rules and policy compared to students in social work. In comparison, social work education students often reason through ethical dilemmas from an ethic of care, founded in relational values such as compassion and helpfulness. Further, from Kohlberg\u2019s Theory of Moral Development, social work students\u2019 predominately reasoned from a Stage Four. This study also revealed that students\u2019 reason from a higher level when the ethical dilemma was professionally related and lower when the dilemma was professionally neutral.    \n\tThe findings of this study contribute to the body of literature surrounding ethics education in professional development and higher education, the use of formal codes of professional ethics, and moral reasoning and decision making in professional development. Lastly, several suggestions for future studies are proposed that include a longitudinal study that compares students from year one to year four in a range of different areas of professional education.

The flexible, fantastical character of U.S. \u2013 Italian intimacy is a common, and commonly overlooked, element of this transnational relation. Attending to supple types of fantastical attachment, the chapters of this study employ the language of aesthetics to characterize and explore politicized intimate connection. Instead of viewing formalist analysis as a supplement to political historiography, I argue that aesthetic projects directly impact socio-political histories. Refusing the traditional dismissal of imaginative work as \u201cmerely aesthetic,\u201d I affirm the importance, indeed the centrality, of aesthetic attention, exchange, and innovation for understanding transnational relations as well as national literatures. Invoking the vocabulary and interpretive conventions of aesthetics, I highlight the ways that aesthetic objects (here, texts) offer modes of cultural association and pleasure not necessarily constrained by material or historical conditions.\n\nInstead of using imaginative texts to uncover historical or political reality, I bring interpretive categories associated with literary aesthetics (genre distinctions, theories of form, discussions of stylistic flourish) to bear on a body of writing by turns concrete and dreamlike. In the nineteenth-century writing from and about Italy featured in this dissertation, imagination and politics mingle; indeed, the former is deliberately imported as a means to articulate the latter. Analyses are thus positioned between transnational and new formalist approaches and partake of elements from both critical discourses. Taking up of necessity questions of national affiliation or comparison, I imagine socio-political identifications as distinct forms of collective meaning-making, subject to (and productive of) vacillations of style, genre, and language. Attention to aesthetic qualities allows my analysis to dwell in the world of imagination, of extravagant attachment, as languages of aesthetic inquiry are often descriptive and aggregative instead of declaratively conclusive.\n\nAs the chapters of this dissertation shift focus across modes of representation and oscillations of form, so too do the imaginative attachments between American writers and Italian citizens demonstrate distinct values and associations. Although an American love of Italy did have what we could call \u201ca politics,\u201d my analyses do not offer political revelation as a consistent end goal; they attend instead to the intimate and extravagant character of the cultural connections explored in this study. The following chapters suggest that imagining oneself to be in love with Italy was an undercurrent of American thought and literature running below diverse historical meditations.

The internal acoustic pressure of the fluid inside a cylindrical pipe is directly related to the vibrations at the surface due to the coupling of the fluid and structure. The breathing mode provides the basis for this relationship and is extracted from accelerometer data using a circumferential modal decomposition routine. The measurement of pipe interior pressures can be useful in determining the integrity of a piping system by detecting high pressures, which may lead to the fatigue or failure of the system. In an operating industrial application, invasive pressure measurements may be undesirable or even impossible. Therefore, a non-invasive method for measuring these pressures is required. \n\nChallenges introduced by using this particular method and the error they produce in the calculation of pressure, are investigated through an analytical model. The factors include the placement of the accelerometers in an equally-spaced circumferential ring, the transverse sensitivity of the measurement accelerometers, pipe wall thickness, and energy distribution. Experimental measurements are taken on a water-filled aluminum pipe to assess the feasibility of using a ring of accelerometers for the internal acoustic pressure measurement. The pressure calculated using the accelerometers is compared to direct measurements using flush-mounted wall pressure sensors. The calculated pressure tracks the directly-measured pressure very accurately.

Additionally, an information exchange documentation method was created to assist project teams in the accurate definition of key BIM deliverables. Information elements included in this method include information delivery schedule, responsible party, and information content for the BIM deliverables. A procedure has been documented to assist in the completion of process maps and information exchange worksheet. \n\nThe BIM Process Mapping Procedure was validated through the creation of template process maps, quasi-experiments, and a case study assessment.

This decline continued into the 1950\u2019s, when lake trout were thought to be completely extirpated from the Great Lakes, with the exception of Lake Superior and limited areas of Lake Huron.  Stocking of lake trout began in the 1960\u2019s in an effort to restore naturally reproducing populations, with stocking relying on remnant lake trout populations as source populations. These source populations from the Great Lakes, the Finger Lakes, and from introduced populations in the western United States provided the ability to produce numerous hatchery strains.  Historically, multiple lake trout strains were stocked in various locations throughout the Great Lakes with the intent that natural selection would allow for survival of the strain best suited to each specific habitat.  However, stocking has not yet achieved intended recovery targets of restoring basin-wide natural reproduction, and so hatchery supplementation continues.  In an effort to further lake trout restoration goals throughout the Great Lakes, this study had three components: (1) evaluate the efficacy of hormone manipulation to increase hatchery production of the Klondike strain (2) quantify the current genetic status of hatchery strains in production; (3) identify hatchery strain of origin for lake trout reproducing in the Niagara River, NY, as well as their offspring, and to quantify adult lake trout movement into and out of the Niagara River.\nThe Klondike strain of lake trout is a humper morphotype native to Lake Superior and the production of broodstock is maintained at Iron River National Fish Hatchery in Iron River, WI.  The Klondike strain has very poor eye-up rates compared to other hatchery strains raised in similar conditions (3-33% eye-up rates, compared to >70% of many lean morphotypes).  Based on previous studies analyzing potential health and environmental changes possible in a hatchery setting, induction of spawning through the use of gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) was explored as a possible hatchery management tool for increasing eye-up rates.  The experimental design consisted of two treatment groups of fish (low dose of 10ug/kg body weight and high dose of 20ug/kg bw) and a control group (saline solution injection). Other lake trout, not used in the experiment, but raised in a similar hatchery setting were used for further comparison (i.e., these \u201cbaseline\u201d fish were not handled because they did not receive hormone or saline injections).  Both the low and high dose injection of GnRHa resulted in similar increases in eye-up rates compared to control fish (~62%) and baseline non-study fish (>98%).  Interestingly, the control injection of saline solution also had higher eye-up rates when compared to the baseline group of fish (84% compared to >98% in treatment groups).  Beyond an increase in eye-up rates, fish treated with hormones also had a higher number of viable eggs per fish than baseline fish.  While this study had some confounding factors that made results for saline-injected control fish difficult to interpret (i.e., hormone injected and control fish were held in the same holding tanks), hormone injection did improve eye-up rates.  This improvement in eye-up rate allows the hatchery to produce a greater number of fry, while still maintaining the same number of broodstock fish.  Because the Klondike is the only strain of the humper morphotype currently in the federal hatchery system, increased production could result in reaching targeted stocking rates, and possibly allow for increased stocking or stocking in new locations.\nCurrently, there are six different hatchery strains of lake trout in production in the federal hatchery system.  These strains each represent a sample of six different lake trout populations and are used to assist in the restoration goal of establishing naturally reproducing lake trout populations throughout the Great Lakes.  Because these strains are a sub-sample of the source population, genetic diversity can become limited if not properly monitored.  This can be detrimental to establishment of or developing populations, if stocked fry are inbred, genetically similar, or somehow have reduced survival due to lack of genetic diversity.  To understand the current status of lake trout hatchery strains, fin clips were taken from at least two different year classes of each strain for genetic analysis (only one year class was available for the Lake Champlain strain; three were available for the Seneca Lake strain).  For the Klondike strain, a sample of the source population was available and used for comparison.  Using a suite of eleven microsatellite loci, each strain was assessed for genetic diversity.  All hatchery strains were found to have similar levels of genetic diversity, even though all are genetically distinct from one another.  The Klondike strain, however, showed evidence of loss of genetic diversity, specifically allelic richness, when compared to the wild source population.  Continued monitoring of the genetic diversity of the Klondike hatchery strain would be beneficial.\nBased on sampling by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and anecdotal evidence from recreational fishermen, a naturally reproducing population of lake trout appeared to be using the lower Niagara River for spawning.  To better understand movement of this population and to provide further evidence of natural reproduction, fish were captured in the fall 2010 and 2011 before spawning began and implanted with radio transmitters.  Tissue samples were also taken to assess hatchery strain of origin of all adults captured.  Sampling for naturally reproduced offspring took place in the fall using egg traps, as well as in the spring using nets.  Naturally reproduced offspring were genetically sequenced to determine species before microsatellite markers were used to identify hatchery strain of origin.  Identical microsatellite protocols were used on adult samples to determine hatchery strain of origin.  The majority (86%) of lake trout sampled during this study, adult and offspring, were assigned to the Seneca Lake strain.  While radio transmitters were deployed, the data gathered was insufficient for statistical modeling.  Based on the findings from this study, the majority of natural reproduction occurring in the lower Niagara River is by stocked lake trout of the Seneca Lake strain.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9296], "author_name_tesi": "Salvesen, Kelley Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Salvesen", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Kelley", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tyler Wagner", "Meredith Bartron"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tyler Wagner, Thesis Advisor", "Meredith Bartron, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["lake trout", "microsatellites", "hatchery", "great lakes"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Novel Performance Tests for Evaluation of Alkali-silica Reaction", "id": "28744", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12424", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a leading cause of premature concrete deterioration, resulting in cracks that develop in concrete structures. ASR is a slow chemical reaction, taking years to manifest. Therefore, ASTM currently has several widely used laboratory tests to more rapidly assess the ASR risk of aggregates and durability of concrete mixtures. ASTM C1260 uses an extremely accelerated testing environment (specimens are stored in 1N NaOH at 80OC) to reduce the testing time to 16 days, but this dramatically reduces the test reliability. ASTM C1293 uses less harsh conditions (100% relative humidity at 38oC) to accelerate the reaction to identify reactive aggregates in 1 year, but an experimental artifact called alkali leaching can ultimately stop ASR, leading to possible false aggregate identification. \n\nThe motivation, objectives, and outline of this thesis are described in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 details the development and evaluation of two new tests to identify ASR. These new tests address the flaws in existing ASTM testing methods. In the sealed concrete prism test (S-CPT), a membrane is applied to the surface of concrete prisms to prevent alkali leaching. In the water entrained concrete prism tests (WE-CPT) the same moisture barrier prevents alkali leaching, but pre-saturated light weight aggregates are added to the mixture to provide excess moisture for expanding ASR gel. Four varying levels of reactive aggregates were tested at both 38oC and 60oC, to determine the effectiveness of these new test methods and the possibility of accelerating the tests. Expansion, mass change, relative humidity, and pore solution chemistry were experimentally measured to evaluate S-CPT and WE-CPT. The results suggest that alkali leaching can be lessened by a moisture barrier and important relationships between expansion, mass gain, and relative humidity were developed during this research. \n\nIn Appendix A, various moisture barriers were tested for their effectiveness at creating the closed system necessary for S-CPT and WE-CPT. Based on the results, a vapor permeable membrane was selected and used in S-CPT and WE-CPT because it was able to lessen alkali and OH- leaching, while also maintaining ASR promoting levels of relative humidity inside concrete. Subsequent Appendices present experimental results for ASR tests conducted during this research.

Light and slender structures, such as stadiums, are more prone to serviceability issues as the occupants of the structure are often able to excite the structure dynamically.  Because stadium structures can be subjected to significant coordinated dynamic crowd activities, designing for serviceability is essential, but little guidance is currently available.\nDesigning for serviceability relies on the ability of an engineer to accurately predict the structural behavior of a stadium.  In this research, a strategy is developed for the creation of an accurate finite element model to predict the dynamic behavior of the structure.  This strategy is developed utilizing analytical and experimental results from several constructed stadium facilities.\nAssessing a structure for serviceability requires knowledge of what level of vibration is deemed acceptable for the occupants.  The assessment of several in-service events offers additional insight into modifying the current acceptable vibration ranges for particular application to stadium structures.\nThe modeling strategy developed here is the first step in improving serviceability design.  As more accurate models are obtainable by the practicing engineer, more accurate serviceability design methods or simulation techniques will be developed.  As shown through the serviceability assessment results in this research, the current acceptable vibration ranges for stadium structures need refinement.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3328], "author_name_tesi": "Salyards, Kelly Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Salyards", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Kelly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Linda Morley Hanagan", "Louis F Geschwindner Jr.", "M Kevin Parfitt", "Martin Wesley Trethewey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Linda Morley Hanagan, Committee Chair", "Louis F Geschwindner Jr., Committee Member", "M Kevin Parfitt, Committee Member", "Martin Wesley Trethewey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vibration", "serviceability", "staium", "experimental modal analysis", "finite element modeling", "model verification"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Effects of Microstructural Defects \non the Performance of Base-metal \nMultilayer Ceramic Capacitors\n\n", "id": "12436", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4289", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), owing to their processing conditions, can exhibit microstructure defects such as electrode porosity and roughness. The effect of such extrinsic defects on the electrical performance of these devices needs to be understood in order to achieve successful miniaturization into the submicron dielectric layer thickness regime. \nSpecifically, the presence of non-planar and discontinuous electrodes can lead to local field enhancements while the relative morphologies of two adjacent electrodes determine variations in the local dielectric thickness. To study the effects of electrode morphologies, an analytical approach is taken to calculate the electric field enhancement and leakage current with respect to an ideal parallel-plate capacitor. Idealized electrode defects are used to simulate the electric field distribution. It is shown that the electrode roughness causes both the electric field and the leakage current to increase with respect to that of the ideal flat parallel-plate capacitor. Moreover, finite element methods are used to predict electric field enhancements by as high as 100% within capacitor structures containing rough interfaces and porosity.\nTo understand the influence of microstructural defects on field distributions and leakage current, the real three-dimensional microstructure of local regions in MLCCs are reconstructed using a serial-sectioning technique in the focused ion beam. These microstructures are then converted into a finite element model in order to simulate the perturbations in electric field due to the presence of electrode defects. The electric field is three times the average value, and this leads to increase in current density of these devices. It is also shown that increasing sintering rates of MLCCs leads to improved electrode morphology with smoother more continuous electrodes, which in turn leads to a decrease in electric field enhancement and calculated leakage current density. To simulate scaling effects, the dielectric layer thickness is reduced from 2.0\u00b5m to 0.5\u00b5m in the three-dimensional microstructure keeping the same electrode morphology. It is seen that the effect of microstructure defects is more pronounced as one approaches thinner layers, leading to higher local electric field concentrations and a concomitant drop in insulation resistance. It is also seen that the electric field values are as high as 3.8 times the average field in termination regions due the disintegrated structure of the electrodes.\nIn order to assess the effect of microstructure on MLCC performance, two sets of multilayer capacitors subjected to two vastly different sintering rates of 150\u00baC/hr and 3000\u00baC/hr are compared for their electrical properties. Capacitors with higher electrode continuity exhibit proportionally higher capacitance, provided the grain size distributions are similar. From the leakage current measurements, it is found that the Schottky barrier at the electrode-dielectric interface controls the conduction mechanism. This barrier height is calculated to be 1.06 eV for slow-fired MLCCs and was 1.15 for fast-fired MLCCs. This shows that high concentration of electrode defects cause field perturbations and subsequent drop in the net Schottky barrier height. These results are further supported by frequency-dependent impedance measurements. With temperature dependence behavior of current-voltage trends we note that below temperatures of 135\u00b0C, the conduction is controlled by interfacial effects, whereas at higher temperatures it is consistent with bulk-controlled space charge limited current for the samples that are highly reoxidized.\nThe final part of this work studies the various aspects of the initial stages of degradation of MLCCs. MLCCs subjected to unipolar and bipolar degradation are studied for changes in microstructure and electrical properties. With bipolar degradation studies new insights into degradation are gained. First, the ionic accumulation with oxygen vacancies at cathodes is only partially reversible. This has implications on the controlling interface with electronic conduction. Also, it is shown that oxygen vacancy accumulation near the cathodes leads to a drop in insulation resistance. The capacitance also increases with progressive steps of degradation due to the effective thinning of dielectric layer. The reduction in interfacial resistance is also confirmed by impedance analysis. Finally, it is observed that on degradation, the dominant leakage current mechanism changes from being controlled by cathodic injection of electrons to being controlled by their anodic extraction. Some of the key discoveries and conclusions established under this dissertation are:\n1.\tLocal electric fields are strongly perturbed through microstructure defects at the electrode interface of MLCCs.\n2.\tEnhanced leakage currents result from the local field, and increasingly gain importance in the miniaturization to submicron MLCCs.\n3.\tMethodologies that incorporate focused ion beam milling and imaging can provide excellent data on the morphological distribution within multilayer structures at the mesoscale.\n4.\tFast firing processes limit the defect size and densities at the electrode interfaces and offer enhanced MLCC performance for thin-layer devices.\n5.\tHigh temperature conductivity above 135\u00b0C in reoxidized samples is bulk controlled, and this has implications on interpreting the highly accelerated lifetime tests.\n6.\tLocal non-stoichiometry in regard to base metal MLCCs exist even after reoxidation treatments and provide local field enhancement in addition to the morphological defects.\n7.\tElectromigration of oxygen vacancy defects are only partially reversible and permanent non-stoichiometric regions can exist at the interfaces.\n8.\tBipolar degradation schemes with partial degradation result in a variety of microstructural, stoichiometric, and electrical changes.\n9.\tA self-consistent explanation of these effects gives compelling evidences of interface controlled conduction in n-type oxides, with rate-limiting conduction often being controlled at the dielectric-electrode interfaces through a field-assisted thermionic emission process, and field enhanced microstructural and stoichiometric features overriding in many cases the electron injection at the cathodic electrode.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4262], "author_name_tesi": "Samantaray, Malay Milan", "last_name_ssi": "Samantaray", "middle_name_ssi": "Milan", "first_name_ssi": "Malay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Clive A Randall", "Clive A Randall", "Long Qing Chen", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Gerald Dennis Mahan", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof Clive A Randall, Dissertation Advisor", "Clive A Randall, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Gerald Dennis Mahan, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Chair", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["finite element modeling", "microstructure", "multilayer ceramic capacitors", "degradation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Structure and Velocity-Forced Response of Swirl-Stabilized Flames in a Lean-Premixed, Multi-Nozzle Can Combustor", "id": "13370rjs5309", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13370", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The detailed flame structure and velocity-forced flame response of lean-premixed, swirl-stabilized flames were investigated experimentally in a multi-nozzle can combustor. Measurements were obtained at atmospheric pressure in a laboratory-scale gas turbine combustor with five injectors, each containing a counter-clockwise swirler and a bluff centerbody, arranged in a \"four-around-one\" configuration. Velocity perturbations were introduced to the inlet fuel-air mixture at a fixed frequency and amplitude using a siren device. The velocity fluctuations were measured using the two-microphone method. CH* chemiluminescence was used as both a measure of heat release rate and as an indicator of the location of the flame. During the course of the study, a tomographic reconstruction technique was developed where line-of-sight chemiluminescence images from multiple angles around the combustor were used to reconstruct the three-dimensional chemiluminescence distribution of the multi-nozzle flame. Two-dimensional slices of the three-dimensional chemiluminescence image were studied in detail as they clearly reveal the interior structure of the multi-nozzle flame.\n\nTime-averaged 3-D chemiluminescence images were used to characterize the detailed flame structure of a stable, unforced flame with an overall flame shape typical to most inlet conditions at which the multi-nozzle combustor is operated. Two-dimensional slices of the 3-D images reveal the complex structure of the multi-nozzle flame that results from the five individual flames interacting with adjacent flames and the combustor wall. A comparison to the flow field in a similar multi-nozzle system showed that the merging of adjacent swirling flows affects the shape and strength of the recirculation zones which in turn affects the flame structure. Flame-flame interaction affects the heat release rate distribution within the flame brush but has a minimal effect on flame stabilization. Flame-wall interaction affects both flame stabilization and the distribution of heat release rate in the flame brush. Digital photographs and line-of-sight chemiluminescence images are used to study the evolution of flame structure with varying equivalence ratio. At a critical equivalence ratio close to the lean blowoff limit, an abrupt transition in flame structure occurs where the flame length increases, the heat release distribution changes and the middle flame is no longer anchored to the centerbody or dump plate. Time-averaged 3-D image data obtained at an equivalence ratio close to the lean blowoff limit show significant changes in flame structure when compared to the flame at operating conditions where all five flames are anchored to their respective centerbodies.\n\nThe global response of the multi-nozzle flame to velocity perturbations was quantified using the flame transfer function. The input to the flame transfer function was the velocity fluctuation measured using the two-microphone method and the output was the heat release rate fluctuation of the entire multi-nozzle flame. Velocity fluctuation amplitude was maintained at 5% of the inlet velocity in order to remain in the linear flame response regime. Global flame transfer function data obtained at different equivalence ratios showed a change in the nature of the transfer function gain which was related to the change in overall flame shape. \n\nThe local flame response was quantified using flame transfer functions of different regions of flame. Local flame transfer function data showed that the relative contribution of different regions of the flame towards the overall heat release rate fluctuation varies with equivalence ratio. Additionally, the phase relationship between the heat release rate fluctuations in different regions can affect the overall heat release rate fluctuation. Three-dimensional images of velocity-forced flames obtained at select operating conditions show that high flame transfer function gain is caused by constructive interference between multiple mechanisms and low transfer function gain is caused by both spatial canceling of heat release rate fluctuations from different regions of the flame and destructive interference between multiple mechanisms.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13142], "author_name_tesi": "Samarasinghe, Ramal Janith", "last_name_ssi": "Samarasinghe", "middle_name_ssi": "Janith", "first_name_ssi": "Ramal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Domenic Santavicca", "Dr. Domenic Santavicca", "Dr. Jacqueline O'Connor", "Dr. Daniel Haworth", "Dr. Michael Micci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Domenic Santavicca, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. Domenic Santavicca, Committee Chair", "Dr. Jacqueline O'Connor, Committee Member", "Dr. Daniel Haworth, Committee Member", "Dr. Michael Micci, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gas Turbine", "Combustion Instability", "Combustion Dynamics", "Flame Structure", "Flame Response", "Tomographic Imaging"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ANTIBACTERIAL POLYMERS AND FUNCTIONAL NANOCOMPOSITES;                    CARBON DIOXIDE POISONING IN ALKALINE FUEL CELLS\n\n\n", "id": "8023", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6436", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary theme of this thesis is the design, synthesis and evaluation of novel functional materials which display potent antibacterial activity.

Most studies in sub-Saharan Africa have examined the effects of individual-level variables on safe sex behavior, but very few studies have examined the effects of women\u2019s autonomy and women\u2019s status.  The data for this study are derived from a nationally representative survey, the 1999 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.  The study examined the minimum package required to contain the spread of HIV, namely, sexual abstinence, being faithful, and condom use.\n\nUsing multivariate analysis, this research addresses four main areas.  First, I provide a substantive test of sociodemographic factors that affect safe sex behaviors of women in Zimbabwe.  Second, I test the effects of women\u2019s knowledge and preference factors on their practice of safe sex.  Third, I also examine the effects of women\u2019s autonomy and women\u2019s status on safe sex.  Finally, I focus on the possible mediating effects of women\u2019s autonomy, women\u2019s status, knowledge and preference factors on sociodemographic factors\u2019 influence on women\u2019s safe sex behavior.\n\nOverall, the results suggest that sociodemographic, knowledge, and preference factors provide important explanations of safe sex behavior among women in Zimbabwe, in addition to those provided by women\u2019s autonomy and women\u2019s status.  However, there is no consistency in hypothesized direction of effects for sociodemographic, knowledge, and preference factors across all three safe sex practices.  The effects of explanatory variables depend on women\u2019s marital status, age, and type of safe sex behavior.  The results show that the women\u2019s residence exerted significant effects on sexual abstinence, although not in the manner hypothesized. However, residence had expected effects on condom use, for single women.\n\nThe results confirm other findings on the effects of education on safe sex: women with more education are significantly more likely to abstain from sex or use condoms than those with less education.  Ethnicity and fertility preference also exerted significant effects, although the effects varied depending on the type of safe sex practiced.  Compared to Shona women, Ndebele women were less likely to abstain and use condoms (for single women) but more likely to be faithful and use condoms (for married women).  As expected, knowledge of a source and access to male condoms was the strongest predictor for condom use.  Experience with persons with HIV/AIDS or those who had died of AIDS exerted significant effects on being faithful, but not in the manner hypothesized.\n\nWomen\u2019s autonomy explained little variance in safe sex practices.  The results reveal the importance of household decision-making power on abstinence and being faithful, although not in the hypothesized direction.  Decisions on women\u2019s earnings were negatively associated with abstinence but positively associated with condom use for single women.  As concerns women\u2019s status, the results show most of its indicators as unimportant as predictors of safe sex, with the exception of female empowerment of sexual abstinence.  The study shows that women\u2019s autonomy, women\u2019s status, knowledge and preference factors do not substantial mediate the effects of most of the sociodemographic predictor variables on safe sex practices.  \n\nIn sum, while sociodemographic, knowledge, and preference factors are still important in explaining safe sex among women in Zimbabwe, the results of this research suggest that women\u2019s autonomy is an important factor that needs to be considered in women\u2019s sexuality studies.  Finer analysis that covers a wider and more focused range of gender and power factors is necessary to better advance our understanding of women\u2019s sexual behavior in relation to the prevalence among them of HIV/AIDS.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6622], "author_name_tesi": "Sambisa, William ", "last_name_ssi": "Sambisa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Shannon Stokes", "Dr Gordon F De Jong", "Diane Krantz Mclaughlin", "Leif Jensen", "Gretchen T Cornwell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Shannon Stokes, Committee Chair", "Dr Gordon F De Jong, Committee Member", "Diane Krantz Mclaughlin, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "Gretchen T Cornwell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["safe sexual behaviors"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Roles of the University President During an Era of Accountability", "id": "10725", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2223", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using the Roles of the University President During an Era of Accountability model which integrates multiple perspective approaches to presidential leadership as well as role theory with an underlying foundation of ethical constructs this research focuses on four university presidents with at least five years of experience at four-year, Research I, land-grant institutions in the United States.

We focus on the specific case where two parties are trying to perform logistic regression without actually combining their data.

We construct a model in which a firm that was not invited to join the cartel, or that chose to remain outside the cartel, can be eliminated by the cartel if the cartel turns out to be concordant, but not if the cartel turns out to be discordant. This dominant-firm conduct by a cartel can be an incremental source of profits for cartel members beyond the narrow suppression of within-cartel rivalry. This work has implications for the evaluation of competitive versus anticompetitive explanations for certain types of dominant-firm conduct.\n\nChapter 2\nPrior to federal antitrust and merger laws, when firms were largely unconstrained in their\ndecision to either form a cartel or merge, many firms organized as cartels rather than merging. Procurement practices are affected by the nature of competition among suppliers, including mergers, and by uncertainty about whether suppliers are colluding.We show that the payoff to a cartel exceeds that of a merged entity in a procurement setting where a buyer that is dissatisfied with the bids of incumbent bidders can resolicit bids after qualifying a new entrant. A key benefit of cartel formation versus merger is that a cartel can take advantage of customer beliefs that the policing action of competition is still in place.\n\nChapter 3\nA common feature of most procurements is that if the bids are viewed as too high a buyer may make no award and re-auction the project at a later date. In practice, the highest bid that a buyer accepts is set based on the buyer\u2019s own estimate of the project\u2019s cost which may or may not be publicly released prior to bidding. I analyze the role of information disclosure in a two-period procurement model with the following information structure. The sellers' costs have both private and common components. The common component is known to all the sellers, but the buyer privately observes only the realization of a noisy signal which is correlated with the sellers' common cost component. In addition, the\nbuyer is uncertain as to whether he faces a cartel or noncooperative sellers. I show that in this model the buyer can increase his expected payoff by following a policy of concealing the signal in the initial round of bidding. Intuitively, if the buyer\u2019s signal is sufficiently correlated with the true costs, then through a policy of concealing his signal, the buyer can limit the incentives of a low cost cartel to represent itself as high cost. It is also shown that the disclosure of the signal is irrelevant for the buyer when collusion is not a possibility. Thus, nondisclosure of the buyer\u2019s signal may be viewed as a tool to combat collusion.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7427], "author_name_tesi": "Samkharadze, Lily ", "last_name_ssi": "Samkharadze", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Clifford Marshall", "Robert Clifford Marshall", "Edward James Green", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse", "Leslie M Marx"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Clifford Marshall, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Clifford Marshall, Committee Chair", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse, Committee Member", "Leslie M Marx, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cartel", "collusion", "procurement", "merger", "monopolization", "information disclosure"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Genome-Wide Modeling of Transcription Preinitiation Complex Disassembly Mechanisms Using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Data\n", "id": "11601", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1881", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Eukaryotic genes are regulated by hundreds of proteins that assemble into a preinitation complex (PIC), which functions to initiate transcription.  PIC mechanisms of assembly and disassembly in vivo are largely unknown.  To address this issue, in Chapter 2, I wrote the computational tool, PathCom (short for PATHway COMpatibility).  PathCom takes, as input, an assumed PIC assembly pathway and genome-wide occupancy data.  Assuming that occupancy data can be treated as binding duration and explicitly defined assembly/disassembly steps, PathCom outputs plausible PIC disassembly pathways.  I exemplify this process by modeling ChIP-chip data of the general transcription factors (TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, and RNA polymerase II), sequence-specific regulators, and chromatin remodelers of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  My modeling found that TBP, sequence-specific regulator, and chromatin remodeler occupancy to be transient compared with the other general transcription factors, given the assumptions inherent in the system.  Furthermore, I used PathCom to model the disassembly of GTF\u2019s under heat shock conditions and found TBP occupancy to still be transient under heat shock conditions.  PathCom can be used to model any assembly/disassembly process, given all species form a complex together.  The reliability of the output modeling of PathCom relies on the accuracy of the assumptions inherent in the modeling and on the quality of the input occupancy data.\n\tTo improve the quality of ChIP data, ChIP-chip is being replaced by ChIP-seq.  This new technology offers higher resolution and lower background for transcription factor binding site identification.  Therefore, in Chapter 3, I wrote a four-step algorithm to infer true transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-seq data.  This algorithm accounts for peak representation on both DNA strands, reproducibility of peaks, and the presence of a motif.  This algorithm was written for the genomic toolkit Galaxy.  Steps in the algorithm, when possible, were written using preexisting tools on Galaxy.  When not possible, certain steps were written in Python.

This research helps to fill that gap by giving due consideration to the subjects\u2019 talents and skills and how screenwriters\u2019 ability to apply and invent tools and methods was dependent upon their expertise that had an important mediating role on their activities and outcomes. \nAs a result of the study, four screenwriting talents were identified: a story telling talent, a visualization talent, a language talent, and an innovation talent. The study addresses the question of whether talent is innate or can be developed. It discusses a wide array of learning resources the screenwriters use to nourish their talents and sustain their craft. \nThe discovery of the two creative approaches: the organic and analytical is another major finding of the study. The study looks at how applying these creative approaches the screenwriters continuously work on writing a script, which represents one of the underdeveloped areas in activity theory research on creativity. \nDuring my study I worked with experts in screenwriting just as instructional designers do when they try to extract experts\u2019 knowledge for designing learning programs.

A real-time tracking system must be able to track the movement of a person or multiple persons within the field of view of a video camera. The system must exhibit a level of robustness that maintains accuracy and performance in dynamic environments that include multiple occlusions, changing scenery, light intensity variations, and shadows. Additionally, tracking systems may extract details such as shirt/face color, age, and height of persons that have been successfully tracked over a number of frames. The goal is to perform all such tasks in real time at frame rates of at least 30 frames per second. Moreover, small form factor is often a requirement in applications in which the image/video processing must be performed on-site in a non-obtrusive fashion. Smart Cameras are embedded with small FPGAs that can process images on-the-go. For instance, such a system finds great use in building home-care systems for monitoring elderly people in their homes when they are alone.

However, in order utilize these AM capabilities, designers need to be aware of how the AM process impacts design and feasibility of manufacturing. These AM capabilities include different build materials, where each material has different capabilities for producing part features. Some metal AM capabilities also include being able to build a part with multiple materials, and complex geometries such as lattices and interior structures. Designing for these technologies requires all of this knowledge of metal AM capabilities and limitations. Since there are different types of metal AM processes, each with different capabilities, it can be a challenge to sort through all of this information and determine how to design a part and select a process.\nThis thesis introduces a method to help designers learn how to design for metal AM processes and select which machine(s) to use to produce parts. In order to generate a series of design guidelines for metal AM, multiple AM machines are analyzed for their capabilities. These capabilities are captured as different geometric features and their limitations.  Rules for how to design for metal AM are then built upon those features by assigning values to the features for different metal AM machines and organizing them into descriptive categories. An AM process selection tool is then created, with Exsys Corvid expert system software, by using the design guidelines to develop questions to ask a design about their part, which in turn feeds back any changes that need to be made.  The input, outputs, and logic of the tool are addressed. Example parts are analyzed by the program to ensure the success in the creation of design feedback to assist in successfully designing a part for a metal AM process.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9524], "author_name_tesi": "Samperi, Matthew T", "last_name_ssi": "Samperi", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson", "Sanjay B Joshi", "Richard Martukanitz", "Dr Paul Griffin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson, Thesis Advisor", "Sanjay B Joshi, Thesis Advisor", "Richard Martukanitz, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Paul Griffin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Additive Manufacturing", "Design for Manufacturing", "Process Selection", "Rapid Prototyping"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Field-Frequency Lock Implemented with a Sampled-Data Feedback Control Algorithm Derived from a Small-Signal NMR Model\n", "id": "9278", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2665", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High field resistive magnets offer many advantages for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments.  The spectral resolution of a NMR measurement increases linearly with the magnetic field B0, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases with B0^(7/4), and the data acquisition time decreases as 1/B0^3.  However, resistive magnets require a power supply and cooling system, both of which introduce temporal fluctuations in the magnetic field.  Earlier studies that used active methods for suppressing fluctuations can be categorized by the techniques used to sense the fluctuations.  In one category, a pickup coil is used to sense changes in the magnetic field through Faraday induction; the voltage across the coil terminals provides a measure of the field fluctuations.  Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the inductive measurement system at low frequencies, another method is also used to sense field fluctuations.  In this second category, the field fluctuations are measured in terms of their effect on an NMR experiment and the resulting controller is known as a field-frequency lock (FFL).  In the past, FFL controllers have been used to reduce long-term drift in permanent and superconducting magnets, where field fluctuations are low in both amplitude and frequency.  Control gains were traditionally chosen by trial and error and not derived using a dynamic model of the plant.  This thesis describes a FFL controller which is designed using a small-signal model of the nonlinear NMR plant.  The FFL is tested on a 7 Tesla superconducting magnet in the presence of artificial magnetic field disturbances injected with a solenoidal coil.  In order to establish the region of operation where the linear controller is applicable, its performance is quantified for a range of disturbance amplitudes and frequencies.  An understanding of the limitations of the linear controller is essential to the long-term goal of implementing a field-frequency lock in resistive magnets, where field fluctuations have much larger amplitudes and frequencies.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2659], "author_name_tesi": "Samra, Jenna Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Samra", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Jenna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Louis Schiano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Louis Schiano, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["field-frequency lock", "nuclear magnetic resonance", "feedback control"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF A CONTINUUM PLATELET\nAGGREGATION MODEL\n", "id": "11932", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5527", "abstract_tesi": "A continuum stress transport model of platelet aggregation from the literature [14], [16], [15], and\n[18] is presented and solved numerically.

The faults studied in this work are stator voltage imbalances (electrical), rotor bar failures (electro-mechanical) and bearing outer race failure (mechanical). These failures are representative of almost all the failures\noccurring in induction machines. Voltage imbalance has been the longest studied problem. These arise either due to the faulty topology of the electrical system or stator winding faults. Rotor\nbar faults have accounted for about 10% of failures in induction machines, they are the most difficult type of failures to detect. Bearing failure accounts for 40% of all known\nfailures. There is no direct instrumentation known to detect these kinds of failures.\n\n\nThe framework developed provides a common solution methodology for the detection of all these different faults. The methodology utilizes a combination of machine modeling concepts, along with wavelet, and symbolic dynamic analysis to ensure early detection. Additionally the sensor fusion technique developed, presents a\nprobabilistic approach to the problem of bearing faults in induction motors. The method extends the $D$-Markov process to combine the information from both electrical and mechanical sensors. This provides accurate detection, with a low false alarm rate.

Commercial application of nanoscale materials is burgeoning not only because of the cost and size benefits associated with miniaturization but also because of the technological advances resulting from novel properties of nanomaterials. In recent years, research in nanoscience has shown that physical properties, such as material strength, Young's modulus, electrical conductivity etc. may not be single-valued material constants but rather scale-dependent parameters, leading to a growth in literature in characterization experiments which contrast the anomalies between nanoscale and bulk material constants of the same material. Every physical phenomenon (mechanical strength, electrical conductance etc.) has a fundamental length-scale from which it originates, and many of these length-scales fall within the micro/nanoscale which makes defining and measuring material constants length scale-dependent. One dimensional solids are prime candidates for material testing at the nanoscale since they quite often form the transition regimes from the continuum \"bulk\" properties to quantum mechanical \"nano\" effects.\n\nThis dissertation limits scientific study to the narrower focus of experimental mechanical and electrical property characterization of one dimensional materials.

We use our measurements to model transient pore fluid depressurization in response to dilation resulting from step changes in shearing velocity.  Dilatant hardening requires undrained response with the transition from drained to undrained loading indexed by the ratio of the rate of porosity change to the rate of drained fluid loss. Undrained loading is favored for high slip rates on low-permeability thick faults with low critical slip distances. Although experimental conditions indicate negligible depressurization due to relatively high system permeability, model results indicate that under feasible, but end-member conditions, shear-induced dilation of fault zones could reduce pore pressures, or correspondingly increase effective normal stresses, by several 10\u2019s of MPa.  Our results show that transient increases in shearing rate cause fault zone dilation. Such dilation would tend to arrest nucleation of unstable slip. Pore fluid depressurization would exacerbate this effect and could be a significant factor in generation of slow earthquakes, non-volcanic tremors, and related phenomena.<p>\n\n<b>Chapter 2:</b> We use numerical simulations to investigate how fault zone dilatancy and pore fluid decompression influence shear strength behavior in the context of rate and state friction constitutive laws.  Dilatant hardening can change the friction response and the effective critical stiffness, <i>K<sub>cr</sub></i>, which delineates the transition from stable to unstable sliding in an ultimately velocity weakening fault zone. We study the frictional shear strength response to velocity step tests and show that in cases where the duration of pore fluid decompression is long compared to the time necessary for friction to evolve (as dictated by the rate-and-state-dependant friction law) both the critical slip distance (<i>D<sub>C</sub></i>\n) and the direct effect (<i>A</i>) are effectively increased.  We vary the permeability of the fault zone (<i>k</i>), the dilatancy coefficient (<i>&#949;</i>), and the magnitude of the shearing velocity of the fault zone (<i>v<sub>lp</sub></i>\n), and also compare results using both the Aging and Slip laws for the evolution of the state variable.  We show that over the range from <i>k</i>=10<sup>-14</sup> m<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>-21</sup> m<sup>2</sup> <i>D<sub>C</sub></i> is effectively increased from 25 um to ~ 1 cm , and <i>A</i> is increased from 0.15 MPa to over 4 MPa.  We also vary <i>&#966;</i> from 10<sup>-5</sup> \u2013 10<sup>-3</sup>, and the size of the velocity step from 3 to 1000x and find large increases in the effective values of <i>D<sub>C</sub></i> and <i>A</i>, which may lead to inhibition of unstable, stick-slip sliding.<p> \n\n<b>Chapter 3:</b> We describe laboratory experiments on dilatancy and friction constitutive properties of granular fault zones.  We focus in particular on the dilatancy coefficient <i>&#949;</i> defined in the context of rate/state friction theory by the change in porosity <i>&#916;&#966;</i> resulting from a perturbation in shearing velocity <i>&#916;</i><i>v</i>\n: <i>&#949;</i>=<i>&#916;&#966;/&#916;</i>ln(<i>v</i>)\n.  Velocity stepping experiments were conducted in the double-direct shear geometry on a range of materials including quartz sand, illite shale, Westerly Granite, ocean drilling core (ODP 1173-71x), and samples from the San Andreas Fault (SAFOD Phase III).  Tests were conducted dry, at room temperature and humidity, at normal stresses <i>&#963;</i>,&#61472;from 5 to 30 MPa and slip velocities of 3 to 300 \u00b5m/s.  Experiments on quartz sand explored the influence of particle size on <i>&#949;</i>.  We find a strong positive correlation between initial grain-size and <i>&#949;</i> at <i>&#963;</i>&#61472;= 5 MPa but the correlation disappears at higher normal stress, consistent with grain comminution.  For Westerly Granite <i>&#949;</i> varies from 2.0x10<sup>-4</sup> at 5 MPa to 1.2x10<sup>-4</sup> at 30 MPa, while for illite shale and the ODP sample, <i>&#949;</i> is ~ 1.4x10<i>-4</i> under the same conditions.  The SAFOD shale showed the highest value for <i>&#949;</i> at all normal stresses, varying from 5.5x10<sup>-4</sup> at 5 MPa to 2.9x10<sup>-4</sup> at 30 MPa.  Our experiments show that dilation correlates strongly with mean grain-size when <i>&#963;</i> is 10 MPa or less, suggesting that immature fault gouge may exhibit greater dilation than mature fault gouge that has undergone significant comminution.  Our experiments also show that mineral composition of the gouge may play an important role in fault zone dilatancy, in particular the SAFOD shales exhibit strong dilatancy which may be a factor in explaining the stable sliding typical of the creeping section of the San Andreas Fault.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2660], "author_name_tesi": "Samuelson, Jon Erik", "last_name_ssi": "Samuelson", "middle_name_ssi": "Erik", "first_name_ssi": "Jon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chris Marone", "Chris Marone", "Derek Elsworth", "Demian Saffer", "Kamini Singha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chris Marone, Dissertation Advisor", "Chris Marone, Committee Chair", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Demian Saffer, Committee Member", "Kamini Singha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["friction", "earthquake", "dilatancy", "fault zone", "pore fluid pressure"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Quantifying Net Hydroxyl Radical Consumption from the Oxidation of Volatile Organic Compounds and Subsequent Oxidation Products Using a Potential Aerosol Mass Chamber", "id": "16227", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7646", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The OH-initiated oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) begins a complex chain of chemical reactions that lead to a variety of products such as greenhouse gases, acids, other reactive species, and secondary organic aerosol. During these chemical processes, the VOC oxidation products will consume and produce additional OH radicals. Counting these OH radicals is uncertain, however, from explicit reaction mechanisms or direct constituent measurements alone. Therefore, a laboratory method is developed to count the average number of OH radicals consumed or produced by the oxidation of VOCs and subsequent reaction products in the highly oxidizing environment of a Potential Aerosol Mass chamber. The amount of OH consumed is determined by first creating an OH exposure calibration curve relating OH exposure to the number of OH radicals consumed using carbon monoxide (CO). Carbon monoxide is an ideal calibration gas because only one OH radical is consumed per reaction, and its reaction products, carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H), are unlikely to have a large impact on the number of OH radicals. Then, OH exposure is measured for a VOC over a range of mixing ratios. Finally, the net number of OH radicals consumed or produced by the VOC is estimated by comparing the VOC OH exposure curve to the calibration curve.\nThis technique is applied to several relevant atmospheric VOCs: propane, isoprene, m-xylene, and \u03b1-pinene. These experiments suggest that propane and its oxidation products may consume between 1.2 and 2.9 OH radicals per VOC molecule consumed, isoprene between 2.1 and 12.5 OH radicals, m-xylene between 2.3 and 20.7 OH radicals, and \u03b1-pinene between 1.6 and 6.5 OH radicals per VOC molecule oxidized, over a range of VOC mixing ratios from 0 to 650 ppb. These results, however, are found to be dependent upon certain initial conditions and the initial amount of VOC added, the number of OH radicals consumed decreasing as the amount of VOC added increases and OH exposure decreases. The OH counting over atmospherically relevant VOC mixing ratios is in an experimental range of reduced sensitivity and large uncertainties which may limit the applicability of this method to the atmosphere. \nTheoretical and modeling efforts are also employed to estimate the number of OH radicals consumed per VOC molecule oxidized. Theoretical OH counting estimated from reaction mechanisms in relevant literature finds that propane and its oxidation products consume approximately1.8 OH radicals per VOC molecule oxidized, isoprene 2.3 OH radicals, m-xylene 3.5 OH radicals, and \u03b1-pinene 1.9 OH radicals per VOC molecule oxidized. Simple modeled predictions of OH counting, however, significantly overestimate the theoretical and experimental number of OH radicals consumed per VOC molecule oxidized by approximately a factor of 1.1 to 4.3, except for one case with m-xylene. Enhanced modeling efforts may be necessary to capture the OH counting method implemented in the PAM chamber.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7583], "author_name_tesi": "Samuelson, Tiffany Brooke", "last_name_ssi": "Samuelson", "middle_name_ssi": "Brooke", "first_name_ssi": "Tiffany", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Henry Brune"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Henry Brune, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydroxyl radical", "volatile organic compounds", "atmospheric chemistry", "Potential Aerosol Mass chamber", "oxidation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Inter-american Modern and Modernist Poetry: The Poetics of Reimagining the Americas ", "id": "28024", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12236", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Through a re-vision of modern and modernist nineteenth-century inter-American poetic discourse, this dissertation explores ways in which prominent poets contributed to the articulation of an \u201cAmerican expression,\u201d as understood by the Cuban poet, critic, and cultural theorist Jos\u00e9 Lezama Lima, that is, as a vernacular hemispheric literary expression that concentrates on America and re-cognizes it as a critical summa of experiences, imaginations, and knowledges. Analyzing prose and poetic works, I examine how the selected poets not only reimagined the Americas from epistemological, aesthetic, and ethic perspectives, but also engaged, interrogated, and confronted the logos and ethos enforced by the European and the emerging US-American hegemonic project of modernity. In so doing, I trace expressions of decolonizing thinking in the poetic origins created by Andr\u00e9s Bello, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Esteban Echeverr\u00eda, Matthew James Chapman, and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Heredia in their pastoral texts, as well as in the interplay of freedom, democracy, and poesis manifested in works by Emily Dickinson, Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, Walt Whitman, and Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed. Thus, on the one hand, I show that the first group of poets produced and passed on critical principles regarding poesis and freedom that were essential for their successors to continue and further the process of democratization and poetic modernization in the Americas. On the other hand, I argue that Dickinson, Dar\u00edo, Whitman, and Mart\u00ed created what I call Lezamian images, or oblique poetic images that poetically historicized critical knowledges, experiences, and imaginations that were elided by modernity\u2019s civilizing criteria, as well as instantiations of the nonexistent that gave gravity to directional causalities related to democracy and poetic creation that deflected modernity\u2019s linear directionality.

Studies suggest that students will need specific skills to help them work in this global environment in the future.  Agriculture is an area where there has been a large amount of globalization.  People are becoming more aware of this because of the news coverage lately about the current world food crisis.  Currently there are limited international topics taught in education and in agricultural education.  \nThe purpose of this study was to learn the current perceptions and knowledge of high school agricultural students regarding international agriculture concepts.  The study demonstrates the effect of an international curriculum intervention on these perceptions and knowledge of students.  Students\u2019 perceptions of international agriculture were specifically examined compared to the number of semesters of language classes they had taken and previous international experiences they had.  Students\u2019 demographics were also compared with their perceptions and knowledge of international agriculture concepts. \nFive agricultural education teachers with an interest in international agriculture were selected to present a curriculum on international agriculture to their students in the Fall semester of 2007.  This research had a quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design.  Eighty-Six Pennsylvania high school students completed both the pre-test and the post-test in the study.  The students were asked to complete likert type questions about their perceptions of international agriculture.  The survey also included a series of multiple choice questions regarding their knowledge of international agriculture concepts in general and specific questions related to the curriculum.  The final section of the survey was a demographics section.  Students were in grades 10-12 and were currently taking an agriculture class.     \nThe student respondents in this research study were typical high school students in the United States.  The students had limited international experiences in the past but a majority had taken a foreign language class at some time during their education.  Overall, student perceptions of international agriculture were positive but there were no significant differences in their mean perceptions scores from the pre-test to the post-test.   Student knowledge scores did show over a 20% increase from the pre-test to the post-test.  \nBased on the results of this study, there is a need to include international experiences in agricultural teacher education.  Curricula in international agriculture should also be developed for agricultural teachers.  Secondary agricultural education can have an important role in internationalizing education.  The looming world food crisis shows that there is not a more appropriate time to address international problems in agriculture classes.  Students need to be aware of world problems and explore ways to solve them by partnering with other people from around the world.  Internationalizing the high school agriculture curriculum will strengthen students\u2019 skills to deal with these issues and make them better prepared global citizens. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3968], "author_name_tesi": "Sanborn, Melanie Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Sanborn", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Melanie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Henry Bruening"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Henry Bruening, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Agricultural Education", "Internationalization", "Internationalizing Agricultural Education", "Global Education"]}]
