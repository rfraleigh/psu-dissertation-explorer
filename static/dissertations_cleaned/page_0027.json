The CAR gene utilizes multiple alternative splicing events during pre-mRNA processing, thereby increasing the CAR transcriptome.  The work presented in this dissertation focuses on the functional analysis of a prominent human CAR variant, CAR2 that possesses a 4- amino acid insertion in the ligand binding domain.  Previous investigations led us to hypothesize that the CAR2 variant is a ligand-activated receptor and possesses a unique ligand binding profile giving rise to novel biological function.  We now demonstrate that CAR2 constitutes approximately one-third and one-half of the total CAR transcriptome in human hepatocytes and small intestine, respectively. Further, we identify the common plasticizers, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP) as highly potent and uniquely selective agonists of CAR2.  Results from reporter transactivation assays reveal that DEHP and DiNP activate CAR2 at low nanomolar concentrations.  In addition, comparative genomic analysis show that the typical mouse, rat and marmoset models of toxicity can not accurately profile potential human toxicity due to these species inability to generate a CAR2-like transcript.  It is also demonstrated that CAR2 possesses an altered ligand pocket that allows for the highly potent and specific activation of the variant by DEHP and DiNP.  Further studies show that CAR1 and CAR3 share similar ligand activation profiles; whereas CAR2 responds to most CAR1 and CAR3 ligands as well as a unique subset of chemicals. Finally, it is now shown that meclizine, a human CAR1 inverse-agonist, is a specific agonist of CAR2. A meclizine derived pharmacophore was utilized in a ligand-based virtual screening and identified two novel CAR2 agonists from the NCI chemical database. The results of this dissertation will aid in the development of better models of human CAR activation, give a more complete understanding of the interaction of CAR with xenobiotics, yield novel insight into potential mechanisms of phthalate toxicity and provide the foundation for future studies into the physiologic functions of alternatively spliced variants of CAR.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2680], "author_name_tesi": "De Keyser, Joshua Gordon", "last_name_ssi": "De Keyser", "middle_name_ssi": "Gordon", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Toxicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Curtis John Omiecinski", "Curtis John Omiecinski", "Reka Z Albert", "Adam Bleier Glick", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Curtis John Omiecinski, Dissertation Advisor", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Committee Chair", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member", "Adam Bleier Glick, Committee Member", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phthalates", "alternative splicing", "constitutive androstane receptor", "drug and xenobiotic metabolism", "meclizine", "nuclear receptors", "gene induction"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Finite-Difference Time-Domain Modeling of Infrasound Propagation in a Realistic Atmosphere\n\n", "id": "10769", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6059", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Atmospheric infrasonic waves are acoustic waves with frequencies ranging from 0.02 to 10 Hz, slightly higher than the acoustic cut-off frequency (~0.032 Hz), but lower than the audible frequencies (typically 20 Hz-15 kHz). A number of natural events have been identified as generating atmospheric infrasound, such as volcanoes, tornadoes, avalanches, earthquakes, ocean surfaces, lightning, auroral activity, and more recently Transient Luminous Events in the middle atmosphere termed sprites. The importance of infrasound studies has also been emphasized in the past ten years from the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty verification perspective. A proper understanding of infrasound propagation in the atmosphere is required for identification and classification of different infrasonic waves and their sources.\n\nIn this thesis, one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) models of infrasound propagation in a realistic atmosphere have been developed. The models are based on linearized equations of acoustics employing the realistic atmospheric structure and infrasound absorption algorithms advanced by <i>Sutherland and Bass</i> [2004]. The absorption is implemented using a recent decomposition technique introduced by <i>de Groot-Hedlin</i> [2008].\n\nThe FDTD model is used to provide a quantitative interpretation of the recently reported infrasound signatures from pulsating aurora. The pressure perturbations observed on the ground are analyzed as a function of energy flux of precipitating auroral electrons and geometry and altitude localization of the source. The results indicate that fluxes on the order of 50 erg/cm2/s are needed to explain pressure wave magnitudes of 0.05 Pa observed on the ground. This energy is unlikely to be provided exclusively by precipitating electrons, and Joule heating associated with the electrojet modulated by the pulsating aurora may be responsible for part of the deposited energy.\n\nFollowing recent experimental results on infrasound from Transient Luminous Events (TLEs) in the upper atmosphere termed sprited, the FDTD model is used to provide qualitative explanations of close range ground observations: results suggest that the vertical extent of the sprites combined with the altitude dependency of the transverse extent of filamentary structures in sprites are responsible for the inverted chirp signal observed on the ground. Using HARPA ray-tracing simulations, a mechanism explaining long range observations is proposed based on initial suggestions by <i>Farges et al.</i> [2005]. Efforts to provide FDTD results on long range observations are in progress.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6052], "author_name_tesi": "De Larquier, Sebastien ", "last_name_ssi": "De Larquier", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sebastien", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko", "Victor P Pasko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor P Pasko, Thesis Advisor", "Victor P Pasko, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["auroras", "infrasound", "FDTD", "sprites"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE LITHIC INDUSTRIES OF SAN LORENZO-TENOCHTITL\u00c1N:AN ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL STUDY OF OLMEC OBSIDIAN  \n\n\n", "id": "8483", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2925", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the relationship among access to obsidian, tool production technologies, and social status between 1600 and 900 B.C. in the Olmec region of San Lorenzo-Tenochtitl\u00e1n, Veracruz, Mexico. Previous Formative period obsidian studies have emphasized the connection between the acquisition and/or production of obsidian tools and the development of political and economic inequalities. This dissertation examines this issue through a study of 7102 obsidian artifacts from the San Lorenzo plateau and hinterland. \n\nUsing obsidian technological data from eleven domestic and non-domestic contexts, I make inferences about the organization of lithic industries and the nature of Olmec obsidian procurement networks. This study focuses primarily on percussion flake tools, an industry that has often been ignored in Mesoamerican lithic analyses. Previous Mesoamerican percussion and bipolar lithic technologies are also outlined and critiqued. Using data from multiple phases and contexts I propose a detailed technological sequence for the manufacture of percussion tools at San Lorenzo. This technological sequence indicates that Early Formative lithic industries were more sophisticated than previous studies have suggested. This study also finds that the introduction and adoption of prismatic blade technology occurred primarily in domestic contexts at San Lorenzo. \n\nUsing Hirth\u2019s (1998) distributional approach and his four principles of political economy (1996) I propose two separate models (political economy and domestic economy) that could explain the acquisition of obsidian at San Lorenzo. I evaluate these models by comparing differences in the frequencies of various tool types and associated production debitage among contexts of varying status (elite and non-elite) and function (domestic and non-domestic). This study finds no correlation between status and access to obsidian or specific tool technologies. \n\nThe research presented here suggests that obsidian was primarily acquired through domestic trading spheres. A high variability in both the quantity and types of tools was observed across households and non-domestic contexts, suggesting that obsidian trade and tool production were highly individualistic and primarily domestic activities at San Lorenzo. There is no indication that elites in ceremonial contexts had privileged access to obsidian or pressure blades when compared to households. There is also little evidence to suggest that elites ever hoarded blades or controlled blade production at San Lorenzo. This finding forces a reevaluation of previous models that have characterized early Olmec obsidian tools (i.e., pressure blades) as highly valued prestige goods. \t\n\nPreviously proposed Formative period obsidian political economy models were not supported by this analysis. The data suggest that a domestic economy model may better explain how households obtained and used obsidian at San Lorenzo. My findings indicate that a rethinking of Formative period Mesoamerican political economy models is needed. No longer can obsidian be considered a general artifact class equal in value to other exotic imported materials such as jade, marine shell, and pyrite. In order to better understand how obsidian was incorporated into Formative period economic and political systems, future archaeological models will need to address variables such as differential use (utilitarian versus ceremonial), perceived value (unmodified chunks versus finish tools), and quality of particular obsidian sources within specific cultural contexts. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2919], "author_name_tesi": "De Le\u00f3n, Jason  Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "De Le\u00f3n", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Jason ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Dean R.

Antecedent research has mostly focused on bilingual speech in situations where one of the languages enjoys official status and the other is employed in restricted domains or where only one of the languages is spoken by the society at large. Minorca offers a different landscape, one in which Catalan and Spanish are used in public and private milieus. This linguistic situation, it is argued here, enhances the emergence of contact-induced linguistic patterns. Of particular interest are the rates and patterns of subject expression and omission in bilingual varieties of Spanish and Catalan.\nSubject expression in Spanish has received much attention from linguists in diverse sub-disciplines, employing diverse theoretical frameworks and methodological tools. This variation has been most convincingly examined by applying variable rule analysis to naturalistic data collected via sociolinguistic interviews. Variationist studies have revealed that the expression and omission of subjects in Spanish is determined by numerous factors, among these information structure, Tense/Mood/Aspect, person, and genre. For instance, overt subjects are favored in contexts of topic shift, with first person, and when there is a lack of continuity. More notably, variation has been attested across varieties of Spanish; in particular, contrasts in rates and patterns of subject expression are reported between Caribbean Spanish and other varieties of Spanish (Otheguy et al. 2007). \nSyntactic-theoretical treatments of subject expression abound, most concerned with the formal features that license null subjects. Thus, cross-linguistic differences between null subject languages and non-null subject languages have been attributed to the features of functional projections such as Agr and Tns. While null subjects are licensed by properties of the \u2018core\u2019 or narrow syntax of null subject languages, the appearance of overt subjects in such languages is constrained by the informational context. Thus, in contrast to null subjects, the expression of overt subjects in null subject languages is regulated by properties of the \u2018peripheral\u2019 grammar, specifically, the area where the syntax interfaces with the discourse/pragmatics. This generalization has been widely exploited in the literature on child bilingualism, adult second language acquisition, and first language attrition, for the most part by reference to data obtained via experimental research designs. The works of Antonella Sorace and her colleagues indicate that while the core syntax remains unchanged in language contact situations, the peripheral grammars (i.e., the syntax interfaces with other modules) are susceptible to inter-lingual effects. For instance, while Spanish-English bilinguals accept null subjects in Spanish (and reject them in English), they demonstrate the emergence of pragmatically-infelicitous overt pronominal subjects in Spanish. \nThe use of pragmatically-infelicitous overt pronominal subjects in Spanish has been interpreted in two manners: one view identifies this pattern with a simplification process or strategy of cognitive economy attendant to bilingual speech (Sorace 2004); the second view describes it as a convergent outcome, rendering the contact languages more alike (Bullock & Toribio 2004, Toribio 2004). These two approaches make distinct predictions for outcomes in situations of contact between two null subject languages. The simplification approach predicts an increase in overt subjects, as a consequence of a universal process that allows for bilinguals to compensate for the increased processing load of articulating different types of information (syntactic and discursive). In contrast, a convergence account would predict an intermediate rate of overt subjects between the rates observed in the two languages in contact. \nThis dissertation project expands on previous research by examining Spanish in contact with Catalan in Minorca. The project examines variation between null subject languages, by reference to data from two very closely related languages, and it explores bilingual outcomes, by comparing monolingual and bilingual Spanish data. The aim is to examine the role of language-internal and language-external factors in the emergence of contact-induced forms. To that end, naturalistic Spanish language samples were collected from twelve monolingual Spanish speakers, eleven Spanish L1 bilinguals, and twelve Catalan L1 bilinguals, who were recorded in Spanish; in addition, naturalistic Catalan data were gathered from twelve Catalan-dominant speakers (as there are no monolingual Catalan speakers). All language samples were recorded during an interview in which participants reported on their language history, participated in an ethnolinguistic survey, and responded to questions on language attitudes and ideologies. The recordings ranged from  49.40 minutes (4,369 words) to 99.70 minutes (11,399 words). Data were transcribed and the first 300 relevant tokens produced by each participant were coded and submitted to statistical analysis using Goldvarb X (Sankoff, Tagliamonte & Smith 2006). Apart from the overall rate of subject expression, eleven language-internal variables were considered in the distribution of null, overt pronominal, and overt lexical subjects: person and number, discourse function, distance from previous mention, focus, co-referentiality, clause type, animacy, semantic and syntactic verb type, tense continuity, and verb form ambiguity. In addition, seven language-external variables were considered: age, gender, place of residence, first language, second language proficiency, and first and second language use.\n Results indicate that overall rates of overt pronominal subjects are not significantly different in Spanish and Catalan (10.6% and 11.9%). The bilinguals rates in overt pronominal subjects are not significantly different from those in monolingual Spanish (12.8% in the Spanish L1 and 12.6% in the Catalan L1 bilinguals), as predicted by Bullock & Toribio (2004) and Toribio (2004). However, multivariate regressional analyses reveal differences in constraint ranking between Spanish and Catalan. Interestingly, the bilinguals mostly display intermediate positions, i.e., convergent outcomes. Evidence of a bilingual continuum, where the Catalan L1 bilinguals are closer to the Catalan data than the Spanish L1 bilinguals, is also present in the patterns of subject expression, instantiated in constraint ranking differences. Apart from the effect found for L1, proficiency was also returned as significant. Catalan L1 speakers with higher proficiency in Spanish and Spanish L1 speakers with higher proficiency in Catalan display more monolingual-like patterns than those who exhibit more disparate proficiencies across their two languages. \nThis project contributes to various fields. The examination of two sister languages, and monolingual and bilingual varieties of the same language, further enlightens our knowledge of linguistic variation in subject expression, and how to better establish systematic comparisons between typologically similar varieties. The analysis of the speech of bilinguals of two null subject languages argues for the emergence of converged outcomes in their speech. The lack of an increase in the overall rate of overt pronominal subjects indicates a convergent outcome, and patterns in between those in Spanish and those in Catalan indicate convergence. Finally, the examination of a linguistic community displaying extensive and established bilingualism furthers our understanding of the effect of social prestige and other external variables that cannot be explored in other communities.

This investigation was performed using a single-nozzle, swirl-stabilized, gas turbine combustor of industrial design. The global flame response was characterized by a flame transfer function which related fluctuations in the heat release rate from the flame to the artificially imposed fluctuations in the velocity of the mixture entering the combustor. The magnitude of these velocity fluctuations was measured using the two-microphone method while the fluctuations in heat release rate were described by measuring the CH* chemiluminescence emission from the flame. An intensified high speed camera, fitted with a bandpass filter for CH* chemiluminescence was used to described the spatial distribution of the heat release rate within the flame. \n\nThis investigation was conducted in the linear flame response regime over a wide range of operating conditions; 20-35 m/s inlet velocity, 373-473 K preheat, equivalence ratio 0.55-0.7 and in three combustors of 0.11 m, 0.15 m and 0.19 m diameter. The confinement ratio was 0.5, 0.37 and 0.29 for each combustor when calculated using the diameter of the nozzle relative to the combustor diameter. All measurements were made at atmospheric pressure. The effect of the combustor outer wall temperature on the measured flame structure and response to instability was found to be negligible over the range of wall temperatures assessed.\n\nMeasurements of the global flame response in terms of the flame transfer function displayed the characteristic series of alternating extrema in the gain and linear phase decay with frequency described in the literature. These trends were also consistent across all combustor diameters. The effect of operating conditions on the measured transfer function in each confinement was found to be similar and was indicative of a similarity in the mechanisms of flame response in each case. The primary effect of confinement on the flame transfer function was found to be an increase in the slope of the phase plot and a reduction in the gain at high frequencies as confinement was increased.\n\nAttempts to generalize the entire dataset in terms of the measured flame transfer functions using the Strouhal number were unsuccessful. While the Strouhal number was able to collapse the measured data in a single confinement, the data collected over all three combustor diameters was not collapsed. A study into the parameters that governed the response of the flame in each confinement lead to the introduction of both the confinement ratio (flow expansion ratio), and the ratio of flame length to combustor diameter (flame aspect ratio or flame base angle) into the transfer function normalization. Plotting the collated flame transfer function data against a combination of Strouhal number and confinement ratio was successful in collapsing the 0.15 m and 0.19 m combustor diameter data. Data from the 0.11 m diameter combustor did not collapse. This behavior was attributed to a change in the flow regime as confinement was varied. In the least confined cases the flow was in the free-jet regime and governed by the expansion of the jet from the injector into the combustor. This expansion altered the convective velocity at which velocity perturbations traveled within the system. In the most confined case, it was suggested that the flow was in the wall-jet regime and that the degree of flame-wall interaction, and not the expansion ratio, governed the flow velocity within the system.\n\nFlame images were used to further explain the behaviors observed in the global flame response. The shape and structure of the flame was shown to follow a consistent evolution with increasing confinement in that an increase in the degree of flame-wall interaction was found to result in an increase in the axial distribution of the flame's heat release rate. This change was found to occur in both the stable flame shape and the fluctuating flame structure. Furthermore, these changes in location of heat release rate were shown to relate to the changes observed in the transfer function phase and global response of the flame to combustion instability. A new method for describing the different components of flame area typically described in reduced order models was then introduced and used to further analyze the flame images. This technique was able to demonstrate that the position of the flame in the region near the flame anchoring point was independent of confinement. It was also used to recover evidence of convective mechanisms moving along the mean flame position in each confinement case. These convective fluctuations were then shown to be related to a fluctuation in swirl and to be consistent across all combustor sizes.\n\nFinally, a new technique for measuring the response of gas turbine flames to instabilities using only the naturally occurring, turbulent fluctuations within the system was described. This technique was able to accurately predict the transfer function gain response of the flame but not the phase. Errors in the measurement technique were associated with the poor resolution of the measurement systems used to acquire the data and several improvements to this method were, therefore, suggested and demonstrated.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10611], "author_name_tesi": "De Rosa, Alexander John", "last_name_ssi": "De Rosa", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Alexander", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Thomas Litzinger", "Richard A Yetter", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Litzinger, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["combustion dynamics", "combustion instability", "combustion confinement", "instability confinement"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Mexican American adults in higher education", "id": "16389", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8288", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This qualitative study used a narrative design to explore the perceptions, background and experiences of Mexican Americans who completed their bachelor\u2019s degree as adult learners.

Since the NIOSH Guidelines requires compression force to be less than 770 pound-force to consider a job to be safe, the final conclusions of this study are that the use of the Williamson Turn Stand will help significantly reducing the number of injuries among nurses.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1220], "author_name_tesi": "De Toffol, Cedric ", "last_name_ssi": "De Toffol", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cedric", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds", "Andris Freivalds"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds, Thesis Advisor", "Andris Freivalds, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cumulative trauma disorders", "health care", "nurses", "turn stand", "ergonomics", "human factors"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "From New Technology to Alienation: Smartphones as Cultural Symbols", "id": "17617", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8592", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study analyzes the powers of capitalism through contemporary technology, like the smartphone.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the role of root etiolation in phosphorus acquisition under sub-optimal phosphorus conditions as an adaptive trait and to confirm genotypic variation for this response. Two common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) genotypes known for their differing efficiency under low P, DOR 364 and G19833, were grown in sand culture in a greenhouse at two rates of buffered P availability. Twenty-seven days after planting, basal root axis length was longest under low P.  Root and stele cross sectional areas increased over time under high P but not under low P.  Low P root and stele cross sectional areas ultimately measured only 50% and 30% of high P, leading to a significantly higher stele to root area ratio under high P at basal and middle segments of the basal root.  Reduced secondary development was also observed as reduced xylem vessel development under low P.  These developmental differences were not observed to be due to allometry.  Older sections of the basal root axis under high P respired almost 70% more per unit length than under low P.  DOR 364 had significantly larger specific root length than G19833, especially under low P.  This genetic difference was also apparent in significantly reduced root cross sectional area for DOR 364 under low P.

The objective is to maximize searched area subjected to the limitations of an optical sensor when searching for a ground target. The work is mostly exhibited with simulations, but it also includes actual flight test demonstrations. This paper is arranged by presenting the simplest configurations first, followed by increasing the levels of configuration complexity. First, a fixed, downward-pointing camera mounted to the underside of an airplane is simulated flying straight and level at a constant altitude. Parameters such as airspeed and parallel flight path separation are optimized while restricted by camera intrinsics and the relative size of a ground target. Next, the airplane is allowed to fly with gentle banks to the left and right, throwing the camera\u2019s optical axis to the left and right sides of the flight path. In that case, the optimizer solves for the best airspeed, bank angles, and track spacing. The scenario is then extended to allow the camera to tilt and zoom. Next, a pan-tilt-zoom camera mounted to an airplane is simulated while being subjected to the technical limitations of the camera, the aircraft, and the relative size of the target on the ground. An optimizer solves for the best camera angles, zoom setting, and the flight path separation between parallel sweeps. The MATLAB simulation results presented are specific to the parameters of the hardware utilized in the laboratory; however, the simulation code is written to accept generalized airplane and camera systems. Furthermore, alternative camera gimbals are also simulated. Finally, flight tests involving an airplane with a downward-pointing fixed camera were conducted to compare against the simulation results. \nThe simulation results indicate that a three-axis nonstandard gimbaled camera configuration searches the most ground area within the objective search region. Since performance is measured by computing area searched per second, the gimbaled camera configurations have a speed advantage. Because the airplane is able to fly straight and level at higher airspeeds, the search requires less time to complete. Furthermore, the gimbaled camera allows the airplane to enter a 180\u00b0 turn sooner because the gimbaled camera can point to the remaining search area during the turn, unlike the fixed camera.\nHowever, the airplane performing banking maneuvers with the fixed camera performed better than expected by searching the most total area. Another advantage of the fixed camera configuration includes less complexity and the absence of a protruding gimbal mounted to the fuselage. The fixed camera configuration has challenges though. One of the most critical challenges is precisely following the waypoints that cover the search area. Simulations show ideal results, but the experiments show that achieving those results depend highly on the airplane\u2019s ability to maneuver to those waypoints. Finally, the bank maneuvers required more time for the airplane to sweep the search area, which decreases the performance when measured by area searched per second.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7618], "author_name_tesi": "DeAngelo, Mark Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "DeAngelo", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Francis Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Francis Horn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["search", "UAV", "UAVs", "UAS", "optimal", "unmanned", "aerial", "vehicles", "camera", "cameras", "airplane", "optimization", "surveillance"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Landmark-Aided Localization for Air Vehicles Using Learned Object Detectors", "id": "13333mpd5047", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13333", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research presents two methods to localize an aircraft without GPS using fixed landmarks observed from an optical sensor.

The second method uses computer vision object detectors to detect abundant generic landmarks referred as buildings, fields, trees, and road intersections from aerial perspectives. Various landmark attributes and spatial relationships to other landmarks are used to help associate observed landmarks with reference landmarks.

By increasing the availability of pollen and nectar, it may be possible to increase the size of bee populations or alter bee distribution and foraging activity within a landscape. First, to lay the groundwork for establishment of pollinator conservation plantings in Pennsylvania and the mid-Atlantic states, a group of twenty-five perennial plant species that are native to the region was selected based on criteria to ensure their suitability for widespread establishment on agricultural lands. Among other plant characteristics of interest was flowering phenology. To ensure a continuous supply of pollen and nectar from May through mid-October, the respective flowering phenologies of the candidate plant species were documented in 2008 and 2009 and were determined to provide a continuous sequence of blooms during this period. Second, to determine the relative attractiveness of the candidate plant species to members of the local bee community, bees were observed visiting the plants and were also collected from flowers to allow for species-level identifications. Significant differences in the number of bees existed among plants blooming during the early-, mid-, and late-season in both years (p<0.05 in all cases), with the exception of the early-season in 2008. Identifying plants species that are highly attractive to the entire bee community or to particular bee species will allow for the selection of the most appropriate plants for use in pollinator conservation plantings. \nTo test whether resource provisioning areas can enhance bee communities and crop pollination services, the number and diversity of bees associated with a pollinator-dependent crop were compared among fields in which a provisioning area was either present or absent. In addition, pollination services provided within the fields were estimated through (1) timed counts of bee visits to crop flowers, (2) fruit weight, (3) number of seeds per fruit, and (4) number of fruits per plant. The number of seeds produced per fruit was significantly greater in fields that contained a provisioning area (F1,3=14.22, p=0.033), suggesting that these plantings can enhance pollination services. However, the other metrics did not yield consistent results. Developing a more refined understanding of the associations between plants and bee species will be important in developing pollinator conservation measures for agricultural systems in Pennsylvania and other regions of the United States.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4592], "author_name_tesi": "DeBarros, Nelson Bernard", "last_name_ssi": "DeBarros", "middle_name_ssi": "Bernard", "first_name_ssi": "Nelson", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A Mortensen", "David A Mortensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David A Mortensen, Thesis Advisor", "David A Mortensen, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["resource provisioning", "pollination", "native plants", "bees"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "CONFIGURABLE ACCELERATORS FOR VIDEO ANALYTICS\n", "id": "11829", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4450", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Video analytics is the science of analyzing image sequences and video with the aim to gain a cognitive understanding of a scene. The applications which can take advantage of video analytics are diverse, ranging from media measurement systems and surveillance, to medical imaging and traffic systems. Unfortunately, many of these algorithms can still not be deployed in embedded environments, or achieve real-time performance, because of the computational and size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints of such systems. In particular, performing complex imaging tasks in real time are still beyond the capabilities of general CPUs and embedded microcontrollers alone. Alternatively, systems that have the ability to perform video analytics in real-time usually require high SWaPs that forbid their use within an embedded system. The goal of this dissertation is to explore several areas which have the potential for enabling low SWaP accelerators to meet the performance goals of real-time systems. These areas include low-cost field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), graphics processing units (GPUs), three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs), and flexible, high-performance FPGA systems which enable algorithm exploration. \n\tFPGAs have become a highly competitive platform for implementing low-power systems aimed at real-time applications. This dissertation describes the implementation of two popular machine learning algorithms, the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), targeting embedded FPGA systems. These algorithms were chosen because they can have direct impacts on commercial applications where these algorithms are used extensively. Both implementations demonstrate the ability to perform at the 30 frames-per-second necessary to support real-time operation and can be configured to meet the resource constraints of the system. The second class of accelerator, the GPU, consists of tens to hundreds of functional units with an underlying hardware architecture that has been fixed. This dissertation examines a key algorithm towards recognizing salient features within an image, known as center-surround distribution distance. Through the use of a GPU platform, the algorithm was able to be accelerated by up to 30 times over an optimized CPU implementation, enabling the algorithms use for real-time applications. The third area, the 3D IC, targets an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design that has historically been the most efficient choice for accelerating custom applications, as they provide the highest performance at the lowest SWaP. This dissertation demonstrates the design and implementation of a custom accelerator chip using 3D technology targeted towards a complete embedded camera accelerator platform. The chip implements a popular pre-processing algorithm which extracts skin regions from an image and can operate at 312 frames-per-second (10X real-time performance). Lastly, this dissertation explores the Falcon framework, which allows high-performance FPGA systems to automatically be composed from an algorithmic specification. In particular, this dissertation addresses the difficulties which arise when trying to compose multi-FPGA based systems that are made up of several different types of IP cores.  This level of configurability is enabled through the development of several key components including an underlying hardware infrastructure, intelligent mapping tool, and a graphical user interface (GUI), allowing a systems designer to build video analytics systems quickly and easily. The use of the Falcon framework is then demonstrated on a state-of-the art, biologically inspired algorithm, used for multi-class image recognition tasks, known as Hierarchical Model and X (HMAX). Compared to a CPU implementation, the FPGA system generated through the use of the tool garnered a speedup of 16X.\n\tThese studies demonstrate the benefits and disadvantages of several prevailing technologies valuable for creating real-time systems which are capable of analyzing images and video. Understanding these tradeoffs is important as the use of video and images is gaining importance in many commercial applications. The architectures, methods, and tools described within this dissertation are intended to enable image analytics to be used in wider variety of applications.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4420], "author_name_tesi": "DeBole, Michael Vincent", "last_name_ssi": "DeBole", "middle_name_ssi": "Vincent", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Yuan Xie", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Antonios Armaou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Dissertation Advisor", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "Yuan Xie, Committee Chair", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Antonios Armaou, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FPGA", "Hardware Acceleration", "Image Processing", "3D IC", "FPGA Framework"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Horror Global, Horror Local: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Torture Porn, J-Horror, and Giallo as Contemporary Manifestations of the Horror Genre\n", "id": "9938", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3766", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The overbearing effects of Hollywood continue to blur the lines of distinction between national and global cinema, leaving scholars to wonder whether the latter type of cinema has since trumped the former.

Scholarship on women in horror films continues to focus on the feminist sensitivities, without the slightest regard for possible cultural specificities, within the horror genre. This, in turn, often collapses the study of women in horror films into a transnational genre, thereby contributing to the perception of a dominant global cinema. Therefore, it is the aim of the author to look at three culturally-specific subgenres of the horror film to explore their differences and similarities. With a selection of fifteen films, five theatrical releases from each country, the author of this thesis utilizes narrative analysis as the primary means of exploring how each works through cultural anxieties and how each represented women, in hopes of determining whether or not a national cinema still exists. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3745], "author_name_tesi": "DeCarvalho, Lauren J", "last_name_ssi": "DeCarvalho", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Media Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Frank Jordan", "Matthew Frank Jordan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Frank Jordan, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew Frank Jordan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["horror genre", "film studies"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Work of Prime-time Post-recessionary Sexism: Gender and Television Sitcoms in the Post-recessionary Era of the 2010s", "id": "18426", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8803", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the post-recessionary era, we see the emergence of new women-centric sitcoms (and dramedies) that feature elements of economic hardship tied to the anxieties felt by most in our society as a whole.  Increasingly, many of these programs have moved away from the traditional workplace-based sitcom toward the work-related sitcom/dramedy, in which the characters are more often in need of work than actually employed.  Feminist scholars have argued in the past that workplace sitcoms have been a bastion for more feminist-minded portrayals of career-oriented, independent women (Dow, 196).  Newer work-related comedies instead often highlight themes of unstable or insecure employment or organizational status.  In many cases, women characters are framed as the most economically unstable, which is a change from previous portrayals.  With the move away from workplace-based sitcoms, we see fewer and fewer of these organizationally-stable, often strong, women characters on television.  \nThis dissertation investigates these post-recessionary televisual trends concerning women in (and out of) the workplace through the examination of nine situation comedies (and dramedies), spanning nearly 600 episodes in total, from four different networks.  The nine programs examined are Community, Parks and Recreation, The Office, 30 Rock (all from NBC), 2 Broke Girls (CBS), Don\u2019t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23 (ABC), Enlightened, Girls, and Veep (the latter three from HBO).  My study examines how post-recessionary anxiety has given rise to an increasing number of women characters being shown outside of the workplace, or at best struggling to stay afloat in their already-existing, unstable jobs.  I argue that with the decline of workplace-based sitcoms and the influx of women-centric, work-related sitcoms, strong women characters and situations where these women can flourish are increasingly being replaced by characters and situations that represent the continued cultural shift to the anxieties and ideologies typical of postfeminism and justified by a post-recession economy.  Additionally, my project aims to answer, what exactly are the (post)feminist messages being put forth in today\u2019s work-related sitcoms about women (and, by proxy, men) as organizational and economic beings in this post-recession era?\nTo answer this question, although feminist textual analysis is a constant tool throughout the dissertation, I apply different methods to analyze the programs: the application of a \u201cviewing strip\u201d (a concept borrowed from Newcomb and Hirsch, 1983/1994), toward a network in which four related programs in a row aired; the employment of character analysis, toward two comedies that applied the broadest use of humor and archetype characters; and the examination of \u201cparatexts\u201d (a term borrowed from Gray, 2010), in the case of controversial and polarizing programs.  In the process of employing these different approaches, I uncovered two separate phenomena regarding portrayals of working women and the critical response to these portrayals.  The first phenomenon I have dubbed \u201cPost-Recessionary Sexism.\u201d  This term extends Douglas\u2019s (2010) concept of Enlightened Sexism to today\u2019s post-recessionary backdrop and its new manifestations of nuanced sexism and patriarchy, including the trivialization of sexual harassment in the workplace.  \u201cThe Critical Double Standard\u201d is my label for the second phenomenon.  The concept stems from the highly-gendered nature of critic reviews surrounding women protagonists.  Together, both Post-Recessionary Sexism and The Critical Double Standard paint a telling picture of how working women of post-recessionary sitcoms (and dramedies) are being portrayed and perceived.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8650], "author_name_tesi": "DeCarvalho, Lauren J", "last_name_ssi": "DeCarvalho", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Paul Mcallister", "Matthew Paul Mcallister", "Michelle Lyn Rodino", "Lorraine Dowler", "Matthew Frank Jordan", "Matthew Frank Jordan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Paul Mcallister, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Paul Mcallister, Committee Chair", "Michelle Lyn Rodino, Committee Member", "Lorraine Dowler, Committee Member", "Matthew Frank Jordan, Committee Member", "Matthew Frank Jordan, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["television sitcoms", "television studies", "feminist media studies", "feminist television criticism", "media studies"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Investigation of Process Parameter Optimization of Laser-Fired Back Contact Silicon Solar Cells", "id": "10636", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "719", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The integration of novel laser processing techniques in solar cell production promises enhancements in both cell performance and manufacturability.

The primary means of data collection in this study was an online focus group with nine rural sex educators who actively work to create inclusive environments for queer students. In addition, I engaged in an active journaling process that included both an audit trail of events as well as personal creative writings that served as ancillary data.\nAs a qualitative study informed by queer theory and ethnography, findings of the study are first presented in the form of guided narratives followed by an analysis of common themes in the narratives. Themes within the sex educators\u2019 narratives indicate that they navigate their rural environments to be inclusive to queer students in four key ways: (a) engaging with various levels of community; (b) shaping their own classrooms to reflect their values; (c) connecting with students by creating an environment where all questions are answered; and, (d) teaching students to think critically about sexuality and the impact it has on their lives. \nImplied throughout this study is that what is taught in a sex education classroom is that which the community finds to be philosophically within the constraints of \u201cnormalcy\u201d (Rasmussen, Rofes, & Talburt, 2004; Campos, 2002; Irvine, 2002; Moran, 2000; Warner, 1999; Wolfensberger, 1972).  Quite a few rural districts in the study were open to queering sex education, and therefore the educators often did not have to be as subversive as one may assume.  All educators found it critical to either have an explicit set of classroom rules, or to be part of a school district that had these and truly enforced them - not only with students but also administrators and parents.  Educators sometimes found it necessary to create sanctuaries in their classrooms due to the external community pressures that students engaged beyond the boundaries of the classroom.  The data indicate that teachers will be challenged by community activists, religious leaders, parents, administrators, students, or other community constituents, reinforcing Dejean\u2019s (2001) idea that many educators are discontent with the status quo and actively working to overcome normalizing practices.  A lack of consistent training for teachers makes it challenging to define what educators consider to be a \u201cqueer-inclusive\u201d environment, since no standards exist.  Educators felt that in order to teach critical thinking, which fits in with the federal definition of abstinence-only education, they were obligated to provide accurate information to students, including answers to questions as broad as \u201cWhat is sex?\u201d\nThis study contributes to the fields of education and women\u2019s studies in multiple ways. First, it identifies the importance of critical thinking about queerness in sex education. Queer students need to perceive that classroom activities affirm their experiences. Second, it highlights the importance of educating communities and teachers on queer ways of knowing, which increases the possibility of engaging learners in ways that are seen as relevant to their lives. Third, it underscores the need for consistency and measurement of sex education efforts in the classroom.  Fourth, it highlights the unique rural voice within queer-inclusive sex education, a voice that has often been ignored or dismissed.  Suggestions for further research and implications for education theory and practice are discussed.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3046], "author_name_tesi": "DeCoste, Jennifer Michelle", "last_name_ssi": "DeCoste", "middle_name_ssi": "Michelle", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Daniel Marshall", "John Daniel Marshall", "Patrick Willard Shannon", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "Lee Ann De Reus"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Daniel Marshall, Dissertation Advisor", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Member", "Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Chair", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Chair", "Lee Ann De Reus, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sex education", "rural", "qualitative research", "queer"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "REVISITING THE CREVICE CORROSION OF STAINLESS STEEL AND ALUMINUM IN CHLORIDE SOLUTIONS \u2013 THE ROLE OF ELECTRODE POTENTIAL\n", "id": "10220", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "785", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although the crevice corrosion of stainless steel and aluminum in chloride solutions has been studied extensively, there is little agreement on the mechanism of crevice corrosion for these materials.  The present study attempted to resolve the ambiguity of the crevice corrosion mechanism by first reviewing previous relevant studies and then, by conducting an in-depth study of crevice corrosion with a focus on electrode potential and the IR mechanism.  The crevice corrosion of aluminum (99.999 wt. %, AA2024) and stainless steel (304 and 444) in neutral and mildly acidic chloride solutions was investigated.  For each alloy system, polarization curves were generated in simulated crevice solutions and potentiostatic crevice corrosion experiments with varying crevice gap opening dimensions were performed.  Current and electrode potential along the crevice wall were measured.  In-situ photographs of the developing crevice corrosion were obtained and in-situ and ex-situ pH measurements were performed.  For the stainless steels, potentiodynamic and potentiostatic methods, including a novel applied potential shift method, were used in an attempt of detect the development of an anodic peak in a passive system, prior to the onset of crevice corrosion.\nCrevice corrosion of aluminum in a pH 6, 0.6M NaCl solution was not found to occur under open circuit or polarized conditions.  Polarization curves in simulated crevice solutions did not show an anodic peak.  Based on the polarization behavior, the IR mechanism correctly predicts the absence of crevice corrosion for this system.  \nCrevice corrosion was observed for aluminum in a mildly acidic (pH 3), chloride free solution and found to be consistent with the IR mechanism.  In this solution, crevice corrosion resulting in severe material loss was observed and a high current (10 mA) was measured.  This is the first time crevice corrosion of aluminum, as indicated by significant material loss and high measured current, has been reported.  Also of importance, is the fact that the corrosion occurred in the absence of pitting corrosion.  The cause of corrosion in this case can be explained by alkalization of the crevice due to a high rate of hydrogen evolution reaction, driven by a potential drop within the crevice.  \nFor stainless steels, crevice corrosion was clearly demonstrated in a neutral 0.6M NaCl solution and in two mildly acidic simulated crevice solutions:   pH 2, 0.6M NaCl and pH 1, 3M NaCl.  The conclusive evidence of the occurrence of crevice corrosion was a high measured current and photographic evidence of showing severe material loss within the crevice and no attack on the uncreviced surfaces.  All observations of the propagation of crevice corrosion for 304 and 444 were consistent with the IR mechanism.\nAdditional efforts to understand the mechanism of stainless steel crevice corrosion focused on studying the initiation.  No evidence was found to suggest initiation occurs due to a reduction of the pitting potential from chloride accumulation.  Initiation of crevice corrosion was found to occur after the development of an anodic peak.  This is the first time an anodic peak has been detected prior to the onset of crevice corrosion.  This novel observation provides proof that an anodic peak can develop in a passive system.  Since the IR mechanism requires an anodic peak, this observation provides convincing evidence for the applicability of IR mechanism in a passive system.  Equally important, the observation shows that while compositional change is required to develop the anodic peak, another step is necessary to initiate crevice corrosion.  Crevice corrosion mechanisms that rely solely on compositional change are inadequate in that they do not provide an explanation for the additional step.  However, the IR mechanism clearly defines this additional step as the initiation event, IR>&#8710;\u00d6*, at which point the crevice wall in contact with the acidified crevice solution is activated and crevice corrosion begins. \nIn summary, crevice corrosion of aluminum and stainless steels was clearly demonstrated and found to be consistent with the IR mechanism.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [779], "author_name_tesi": "DeForce, Brian ", "last_name_ssi": "DeForce", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Howard W Pickering", "Paul Raymond Howell", "Earle Richard Ryba", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare", "Barbara Shaw", "Timothy John Eden", "Joan Marie Redwing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Howard W Pickering, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Raymond Howell, Committee Chair", "Earle Richard Ryba, Committee Member", "Kwadwo Osseo Asare, Committee Member", "Barbara Shaw, Committee Member", "Timothy John Eden, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["IR mechanism", "304", "chloride", "stainless steel", "aluminum", "crevice corrosion", "corrosion", "localized corrosion"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "COMPUTATIONAL MODELING OF AN 8-GHz MICROWAVE ELECTROTHERMAL THRUSTER \n\n", "id": "11893", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "910", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The design of an 8-GHz Microwave Electrothermal Thruster was studied and optimized via numerical modeling. The electromagnetics of the thruster was modeled in an effort to develop and optimize a thruster design that would produce a robust electric field and resonate at the   mode shape.

Models using both coaxial and waveguide ports for microwave energy inputs were investigated and optimized. It was found that though the coaxial input provided a stable   mode, a much stronger electric field could be obtained by coupling a waveguide to a coaxial port. Also, using a waveguide short, the result could be fine-tuned. The design was optimized through testing different waveguide sizes and varying the antenna depth in the chamber. It was also found that the electric field intensity varied based upon the amount of dielectric in the cavity. Also, the resonant frequency increased when using a dielectric with a higher dielectric constant, but had little effect on the electric field intensity. \nIn the fluid dynamic analysis, three-dimensional models were developed for the propellant injection system using incompressible and weakly compressible fluid flow assumptions. A viscous compressible flow model was being developed using the governing equations: mass, momentum, and energy. Both two- and three-dimensional compressible flow models were developed; however, a three-dimensional compressible flow model was not completed.

Understanding the process by which particles are deposited and then suspended in the air (resuspension), is an important part of understanding how to maintain indoor environments at appropriate levels of quality.   The focus of the present work is that the whole history of a resuspended particle is important.  The process by which the particle is deposited upon a surface determines the condition of the particle on a surface.  The particle could be isolated, in contact with other particles, or part of an agglomerate (a set of particles that adhere to each other and operate as a single unit).  The particle then resides upon the surface for a time, during which it may be subject to variations in temperature, humidity, and other environmental parameters that may change the degree to which the particle is attached to the surface or other particles.  The particle may also be subject to mechanical operations that may change the physical dimensions of the particle.  In order to be resuspended, the particle must then be detached from the surface.  This could be caused by mechanical disturbances, such as vibration, or by aerodynamic disturbances, such as the impact of a turbulent flow structure upon a surface.  Once a particle is detached, it then must be transported away from the surface by the fluid before the particle can be considered resuspended.  In the present work, we concentrate upon the deposition and transport phases of a resuspended particle's life cycle.  To study the deposition process, we formulate a Monte Carlo deposition model.  This model tells us that the condition of aerodynamic isolation, or separation from other particles by a significant number of particle diameters, is very unlikely for most of the particulate matter that is of practical interest.  Examination of the forces upon particles leads us to conclude that for small particles of unit density, the velocity gradient lift forces  that are sometimes blamed for resuspension are not significant when compared to the weight of the particle.  The relative importance of the particle weight is borne out in particle transport simulations in an axisymmetric footstep flow simulation, in which most of the unit density particles are not lifted away from the surface.  We simulate this flow problem, which has been studied experimentally and computationally, using an immersed boundary technique.  We find relatively poor comparison with the experiments and investigate these differences using the simpler, related problem of the impingement of a vortex upon a plane wall.  From these results, we conclude that turbulence in the footstep case is likely the cause of the differences between our calculations and the experiments.  Our simulations and models indicate that much of the resuspension observed in experiments is not the result of single, isolated particles being forcibly detached from a surface, but must come from other on-surface conditions and disturbances.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3120], "author_name_tesi": "DeGraw, Jason W.", "last_name_ssi": "DeGraw", "middle_name_ssi": "W.", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Cimbala", "John Michael Cimbala", "James Freihaut", "Laura Pauley", "John Corry Wyngaard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Cimbala, Dissertation Advisor", "John Michael Cimbala, Committee Chair", "James Freihaut, Committee Member", "Laura Pauley, Committee Chair", "John Corry Wyngaard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["immersed boundary method", "resuspension", "particle deposition", "human walking"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Fluorescent Small Molecule Probes of Biological Systems\n\n", "id": "7977", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4161", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fluorescent derivatives of biologically active molecules are essential tools for studying molecular interactions at the cellular level. Fluorescent tags and/or labels have been used to study protein-protein interactions, intracellular localization of biomolecules and organelles, and small molecule-protein interactions. We report here studies of fluorescent ligands of Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs), protein targets under intense investigation for the treatment of human metabolic disorders. Such fluorescent ligands have the potential to enable faster identification of novel therapeutics. To pursue this goal, we synthesized a variety of fluorescent small molecule PPAR ligands for high-throughput examination of potential endogenous and exogenous ligands that bind these proteins. We found that our fluorescein labeled PPAR ligands bound PPAR&#947; and PPAR&#945; with high selectivity and were good candidates for fluorescence polarization assays. In addition, we also utilized Pennsylvania Green as a more hydrophobic analogue of fluorescein to generate cell-permeable versions of these PPAR probes to develop a novel method for studying PPAR ligand binding in living cells, which can be further extended to other related members of the nuclear hormone receptor family. \nTo extend previously reported studies on 3&#946;-cholesterylamine derivatives that function as non-natural cell surface receptors, we synthesized a series of Oregon Green labeled symmetrical dimers of 3&#946;-cholesterylamine as potential precursors to membrane spanning artificial cell surface receptors. We examined these compounds using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and spectroscopy to identify the optimal structural requirements for insertion into membranes of living mammalian cells. Modeled after our best compound, we synthesized an asymmetrical 3&#946;-cholesterylamine dimer bearing Oregon Green as an extracellular fluorescent label and biotin as an intracellular ligand of streptavidin expressed in the cytosol. Examination of this dimer using confocal microscopy showed low cellular association, which could be due to the non-protonatable amide bearing biotin. Further studies to generate synthetic analogues bearing protonatable groups on the intracellular motif could project biotin into the cytosol and recruit streptavidin to the inner-leaflet of the membrane. Through intracellular control of protein localization it is postulated that asymmetrical cholesterylamines of this type could be used to influence internal cell signaling and cellular uptake pathways. Artificial cell surface receptors that span cellular membranes could provide a new strategy for controlling therapeutically relevant intracellular pathways.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4137], "author_name_tesi": "DeGrazia, Michael ", "last_name_ssi": "DeGrazia", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Blake Peterson", "Ken S Feldman", "Ayusman Sen", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Blake Peterson, Committee Chair", "Ken S Feldman, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PPAR", "Cholesterol", "Oregon Green", "Cell Surface Receptors", "Membrane Spanning"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Thermoregulation and Individual Characteristics during Cold and Heat Stress\n", "id": "7483", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1628", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Numerous individual characteristics influence both the physiological responses to cold stress and the ability to predict body core temperature (Tc) during exercise in the heat.  This series of studies was designed to 1) determine age-related differences in the defense of Tc during resting, mild cold stress in young and older subjects matched for relevant body composition characteristics, 2) determine the relative influence of individual characteristics on the defense of Tc during resting, mild cold stress in young and older subjects and 3) determine the predictive accuracy of 3 models of human thermoregulation during a unique cross-desert expedition, with reference to differences in individualization allowed by each of the models.\n\nAging and Cold Stress (Projects 1 and 2)\n\nThe purpose of project 1 was to determine the influence of primary human aging on the defense of Tc during a mild cold transient.  Thirty-six young (YS; 23\u00b11 years, range 18-30) and 46 older (OS; 71\u00b11 years, range 65-89) subjects underwent a slow transient cold air exposure from a thermoneutral baseline, during which esophageal (Tes) and mean skin temperatures (Tsk), O2 consumption, and skin blood flow (SkBF; laser-Doppler flowmetry) were measured.  Cold exposure was terminated at the onset of visible sustained shivering.  Net metabolic heat production (Mnet), heat debt, predicted change in mid-region temperature (&#61508;Tmid), tissue insulation (It), and cutaneous vascular conductance (laser-Doppler flux/mean arterial pressure, expressed as percent change from baseline (&#916;CVC%base)) were calculated.  There were no baseline group differences for Tes, but Mnet was lower in older subjects (OS: 38.0\u00b11.1; YS: 41.9\u00b11.1 W\u2022m-2, p<0.05).  Tes was well maintained in YS but fell progressively in OS (p<0.01 for all timepoints after 35 min).  The cutaneous vasoconstrictor response to mild cold stress was attenuated in OS (OS: 42\u00b13 vs. YS: 53\u00b14 &#916;CVC%base, p<0.01).  There were no group differences for Tsk or It, while Mnet remained lower in OS during cooling (p<0.05).  The &#61472;&#61508;Tmid did not account for the drop in Tes in OS.   Healthy aged humans, matched with a young subject population for relevant anthropometric characteristics, failed to maintain Tes; however, the mechanisms underlying this response are not clear.\nThe purpose of the second project was to determine the relative influence of individual characteristics on Tc and It during mild cold stress.  Forty-two young (23\u00b11 years, range 18-30) and 46 older (71\u00b11 years, range 65-89) subjects, varying widely in muscularity, adiposity, and body size, underwent a transient cooling protocol during which Tes was measured continuously and It was calculated.  Multiple regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of Tes and It and standardized regression coefficients were analyzed to determine the relative influence of each predictor.  Putative predictors included age, sex, weight, body surface area, body surface area-to-mass ratio, sum of skinfolds, %fat, appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM), and thyroid hormone concentrations ([T3], [T4]).  The sum of skinfolds explained 67% (p<0.01) of the Tes variance in young subjects vs. 2% (p=0.30) in older subjects.  Conversely, ASMM explained a greater portion of the variance in older subjects for both Tes (older: 28%, p<0.01; young: 8%, p=0.05) and It (older: 46%, p<0.01; young: 17%, p<0.01).  The residual variance for Tes was considerably larger in older subjects (59-72% vs. 14-42% in young), possibly due to varying rates of physiological aging.  The individual characteristics that explain the variance in Tes and It, as well are the relative influence of these characteristics, differ between young and older subjects.  \n\nPredicting Core Temperature during Exercise in the Heat (Project 3)\n\nModels of human thermoregulation have been developed and validated from short duration laboratory data utilizing relatively large sample sizes.  However, data collected in field studies may introduce additional sources of variability that may reduce model accuracy.  Additionally, the accuracy of existing models is uncertain when applied to individuals or small groups or longer duration exposures.  Recently, 3 runners undertook a unique expedition to run across the Sahara Desert where we collected the environmental and physiological data necessary for the prediction of Tc by 3 models of thermoregulation over 2 days at the start of the expedition.  The SCENARIO and Initial Capability Decision Aide (ICDA) models allow for input of individual characteristics while Fiala\u2019s model relies solely on environment and exercise intensity.  The runners intermittently ran 8.0 km/h over 6 h during NIGHT desert conditions and 7.0 km/h over 7 h 45 min on during DAY desert conditions.  The Tc standard deviation (SD) was 0.34 and 0.51 for NIGHT and DAY, respectively.  The root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of the Tc prediction was calculated and model accuracy was considered acceptable when RMSD<Tc SD.  NIGHT RMSD= 0.45, 0.64, and 0.91 and DAY RMSD= 0.66, 0.70, and 2.09 for SCENARIO, Fiala and ICDA, respectively.  Increased RMSD during day was likely due to overestimation of solar radiation effects.  The RMSD was smaller when only the first 2 h of the exposure was analyzed.  SCENARIO, which offers the user the greatest opportunity for individualization, resulted in the lowest RMSD.  When SCENARIO was configured to match the individual characteristics assumed by Fiala, the RMSD increased from 0.66 to 0.82, illustrating the importance of individualizing the passive system.\n\nSummary of Findings\n\nOlder humans fail to adequately defend Tc during mild cold stress compared to young subjects; different individual characteristics mediate the respective responses in each age group.  Greater individualization of model inputs contributes to greater predictive accuracy in models of thermoregulation.  Several variables, including solar radiation, fluctuations in exercise intensity and environmental conditions, and minute-by-minute errors in the estimation of the change in Tc, likely contributed to decreased model accuracy during prolonged exercise in desert conditions.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1610], "author_name_tesi": "DeGroot, David W.", "last_name_ssi": "DeGroot", "middle_name_ssi": "W.", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Lawrence Kenney Jr.", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "David Nathan Proctor", "Mosuk Chow", "George Havenith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Lawrence Kenney Jr., Committee Chair", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Committee Member", "David Nathan Proctor, Committee Member", "Mosuk Chow, Committee Member", "George Havenith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["predicting modeling", "core temperature", "aging", "skin blood flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "World Cup or World War?

While The New York Times exhibited the most use of explicit military terminology, militaristic metaphors existed in all three newspapers and, although these war metaphors were not as prevalent in number as expected, many were contextually linked to several major and recurring themes throughout the coverage of the three newspapers: the politicization of soccer, the ability of soccer to unite a given country\u2019s political factions and provide the country with a sense of national identity, and the success of a nation\u2019s soccer team as a global barometer of its geopolitical status.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1564], "author_name_tesi": "DeIuliis, Daniel Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "DeIuliis", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Media Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marie Hardin", "Marie Hardin", "James Ford Risley", "Matthew Paul Mcallister"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marie Hardin, Thesis Advisor", "Marie Hardin, Thesis Advisor", "James Ford Risley, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew Paul Mcallister, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["The London Times", "World Cup", "military", "The New York Times", "The Sunday Times", "war"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Social Dynamics of Network Gatekeeping\n\n", "id": "11657", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1485", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The traditional, uni-directional model of gatekeeping, in which raw content passes through a gatekeeping mechanism manned by journalists and editors before reaching the reading public, has been uprooted by the Web, where the ability of users to create and disseminate their own content makes the roles of gatekeeper and the gated interchangeable.

Vegetarianism in the West is an area where these tensions come into play.  It is frequently conceptualized as an individual-level decision driven by concerns for animal rights, personal health, the environment, world hunger, and spirituality.  However, because meals are often shared experiences, vegetarianism decisively affects friendships and family relationships.  Little is known about the social implications of such dietary change, particularly outside of advanced industrialized countries.  Even less is known about vegetarianism in Argentina, where beef consumption has historically been the world\u2019s highest and the culinary tradition of the asado (\u2248 barbecue) forms an integral part of the national identity.  \nThis case study adopts a qualitative approach to examine vegetarianism as it is practiced in a meat-dominant cultural context of the Global South.  In-depth interviews with 23 vegans and vegetarians in La Plata, Argentina, delved into their narratives of conversion and the ways their practices affect social relationships.  Findings indicate that most participants cited animal welfare as their primary motivation and that they have faced reactions from meat-eaters ranging from adaption and accommodation to concern, bewilderment, resistance, or even hostility.  An attitudinal typology of vegetarianism is developed, which serves to reveal striking gender differences in the ways that vegetarians re-position themselves in the meat landscape.  Women generally exhibited attitudes consistent with active adaptation and tolerance; several embraced traditions such as the asado and cook meat for others, including non-vegetarian partners.  In contrast, men generally rejected these traditions and, of those in committed partnerships, all were with other vegetarians.

I examine this phenomenon in two outlier settings in the Global South: India, with a long history of vegetarianism, and Argentina, with a long history of high beef consumption. I begin with an overview of vegetarianism and this dissertation. In Chapter 2, I turn to India, where I examine vegetarian practice, and I ask: is vegetarianism health protective against obesity, and do these effects vary by neighborhood? I find that vegetarianism on average protects against obese status except in mega cities, where unhealthy food environments may reveal worrisome trends. In Chapters 3 and 4, I focus on vegetarian identity, attitudes, and beliefs, and I present the results of the Social Networks and Pathways of Vegetarianism in Argentina survey. First, I examine gender differences and identify three themes: women as pioneers, meat and masculinity, and vegetarianism as identity and critical worldview. I find women become vegetarian at higher rates and earlier in time than men. Men retain more of a connection to meat-centric spaces, but both women and men develop critical worldviews as part of vegetarian practice. Next, in Chapter 4, I investigate differences beyond the gender binary by using three categorizations: straight women, straight men, and queer-identified. I find that straight men and queer-identified report larger social networks than straight women, whose vegetarianism may exist more under the radar in the Argentine context. Finally, I conclude and suggest that vegetarianism is an important practice, identity, and set of attitudes to study from a sociological and demographic perspective as it emerges as part of the pathway towards a more sustainable future.

To this end, we have engineered murine ESCs to contain fluorescent reporters, permitting enrichment of progenitors from osteogenic differentiation cultures using FACS.  The overall hypothesis is that we can identify specific genes with expression characteristic of various stages in osteogenic differentiation, generate transcriptional reporters in ESCs, and use reporter expression to identify osteogenic intermediates.  These cell populations will be tested by in vitro assays and ultimately these cells could be tested in vivo in the context of a therapeutic paradigm.\n\tThree bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) based reporters have been engineered to place GFP under the transcriptional control of specific genes expressed at various times during osteogenic differentiation (Twist2, Sox9, or Osterix).  Subsequently, these BAC-based reporters were targeted in a single copy to a chosen site in an ESC.  An additional reporter, Nestin-GFP, was targeted to the same genomic site.  A fifth reporter, Brachyury-GFP, was also tested for enrichment ability.  A constitutively expressed YFP transgene has been integrated and tested for ubiquitous expression to allow for tracking of the cells at all times upon transplantation in a murine host model. \n\tThe Twist2-EGFP BAC-based reporter demonstrated the most promising results: (i) Twist2-EGFP fluorescent expression paralleled the endogenous Twist2 mRNA expression pattern, (ii) transgenic Twist2-EGFP mRNA expression recapitulated endogenous Twist2 mRNA expression, (iii)  QRT-PCR analysis of mRNA from Twist2-EGFP positive cells sorted from the osteogenic cultures showed higher expression of osteogenic progenitor markers as compared to the EGFP negative cells, demonstrating enrichment for osteogenic progenitors, and (iv)  sorted populations of Twist2-EGFP cells survived and were able to undergo osteogenic differentiation. \n\tThis thesis provides proof of concept for FACS-based osteogenic enrichment of ESC-derived differentiation cultures, while simultaneously revealing which stages of the differentiation culture are most accessible, and the possible limitations of interrupting the differentiation process.  Ultimately this approach has the potential to enrich for therapeutic osteogenic cells for a variety of applications that can improve and inform in vivo therapeutic modalities.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2645], "author_name_tesi": "DeMarco, Jean E.", "last_name_ssi": "DeMarco", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Jean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Bronson", "Sarah Bronson", "Rebecca C Craven", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "Christopher Niyibizi", "Timothy M Ritty"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Bronson, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Chair", "Rebecca C Craven, Committee Member", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Member", "Christopher Niyibizi, Committee Member", "Timothy M Ritty, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stem cell therapy", "GFP", "osteogenesis", "bone", "embryonic stem cells", "Twist2"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Developing and Validating an Instrument to Measure the Perceived Job Competencies Linked to Performance and Staff Retention of First-Line Nurse Managers Employed in a Hospital Setting ", "id": "7168", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3163", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of the study was to construct and test the psychometric properties of the Nurse Manager Competency Inventory (NMCI), a self-assessment tool for measuring the job competencies linked to performance and staff retention of first-line nurse managers employed in the hospital setting.

The first study hypothesis, that maternal Differentiation of Self, Attachment and Effortful Control all comprised one latent factor designated Maternal Relational Competence (MRC) was unsupported by the data.  Rather, results indicated that Maternal Relational Competence variables did not load on one factor, as hypothesized, but tapped at least two latent factors.\n\tThe second hypothesis, that MRC predicts healthier child BMI was also unsupported by the data.  Overall, none of the predictor variables were related to child BMI.  Given that the correlation between MRC variables and child BMI was non-significant, the hypothesized test of mediation between MRC, feeding attitudes and child BMI was unwarranted, and post-hoc analyses were conducted.  Analyses showed that MRC variables did not distinguish between the child BMI weight groups and that maternal relational competence is better represented by two factors.

Hughes Borehole discharges approximately 1000 gallons per minute of pH 4 AMD that contains high concentrations of Fe (100 mg/L) and numerous trace metals.  Long-term monitoring of the site showed that biological Fe(II) oxidation occurred across the mound without human intervention, but during the majority of the year very little Fe(II) was removed before the AMD reached the effluent end of the mound.  Maximizing the removal of Fe and other metals on the preexisting iron mound could substantially increase the efficiency of conventional passive treatment systems such as limestone drains or wetlands.  \nOn-mound channel reactors along with laboratory-scale \u201cgutter\u201d reactors were constructed to determine optimal conditions for passive biological Fe(II) oxidation.  Fe(II) was much more efficiently removed from gutter reactors that contained iron mound sediment than ones without any sediment.  Residence times of 5-10 hours were shown to remove close to 100% of dissolved influent Fe(II) and 75% of dissolved total Fe.  Additionally the reactors performed better as the age of the sediments increased and consequently shorter residence times of 1-2 hours were also capable of removing substantial amounts of the influent Fe(II).  The addition of surface area to the on-mound reactors improved Fe(II) oxidation at residence times of 30 minutes or less.

Specifically, two actively controlled tailrotor driveline configurations are explored. The first driveline configuration (Configuration I) consists of a multi-segment alloy driveline connected by Non-Constant-Velocity (NCV) flexible couplings and mounted on non-contact AMB devices. The second configuration (Configuration II) consists of a single piece, rigidly coupled, FMC shaft supported by AMBs. For each driveline configuration, a novel hybrid robust-adaptive vibration control strategy is theoretically developed and experimentally validated based on the specific driveline characteristics and uncertainties. In the case of Configuration I, the control strategy is based on a hybrid design consisting of a PID feedback controller augmented with a slowly adapting, Multi-Harmonic Adaptive Vibration Control (MHAVC) input. Here, the control is developed to ensure robustness with respect to the driveline operating conditions e.g. driveline misalignment, load-torque, shaft speed and shaft imbalance. The analysis shows that the hybrid PID/MHAVC control strategy achieves multi-harmonic suppression of the imbalance, misalignment and load-torque induced driveline vibration over a range of operating conditions. Furthermore, the control law developed for Configuration II is based on a hybrid robust H\u201eV feedback/Synchronous Adaptive Vibration Control (SAVC) strategy. Here, the effects of temperature dependent FMC material properties, rotating-frame damping and shaft imbalance are considered in the control design. The analysis shows that the hybrid H\u201eV/SAVC control strategy guarantees stability, convergence and imbalance vibration suppression under the conditions of bounded temperature deviations and unknown imbalance. Finally, the robustness and vibration suppression performance of both new AMB driveline configurations is experimentally confirmed using a frequency-scaled AMB driveline testrig specifically developed for this research.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2151], "author_name_tesi": "DeSmidt, Hans A.", "last_name_ssi": "DeSmidt", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Hans", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kon Well Wang", "Edward C Smith", "Charles E Bakis", "Christopher Rahn", "Alfred Scott Lewis", "Richard C Benson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kon Well Wang, Committee Chair", "Edward C Smith, Committee Chair", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Alfred Scott Lewis, Committee Member", "Richard C Benson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adaptive Control", "Magnetic Bearings", "Driveline Active Vibration Contol", "Helicopter Driveline", "Flexible Matrix Composite", "Periodic Time-Varying System"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Describing Firm's Behavior from Revenue and Cost Data", "id": "6429", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5470", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-08-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The main objective of this research is to discuss and extend the existing literature that is concerned with the estimation of demand and supply parameters to determine unobserved prices, quantities, quality and marginal costs at the firm-level using data sets that reports only revenue and cost figures. A common approach to estimate these parameters is given by the production function. However, to be implemented it needs output data, which most plant-level data sets do not report. In the second chapter (the first one is an introduction), using the same framework, I shall investigate the consequences of ignoring price heterogeneity on the markup estimates from the production function in plant or firm\u2013levels studies. I show that ignoring output price heterogeneity yield markup estimates severely biased towards one regardless of competitiveness levels. I set up an econometric model that assumes monopolistic competition and a CES demand function in a differentiated product market that is easy to estimate and allows for the use aggregate instruments to improve on the OLS estimations. In the third chapter, I discuss the estimation of discrete-choice model of demand. Katayma, Lu and Tybout (2003) used a nested logit model to derive consumer and producer surplus to measure efficiency. Their work (KLT) however differentiates from the others since the data set used there is not quite informative. Again, it assumes that only revenue and total costs are observed. Then combining these data with demand and the quasi-supply relation they demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of interest. I demonstrate how to extend the KLT framework by including the extra information provided by aggregate data. Although it may be difficult to obtain detailed data on quantities at the plant level, the same is not true for aggregate variables. I consider two different hypotheses on the nature of this aggregate measure. The first one assumes that this information is noisy, while the second assumes that this information is deterministic and therefore error free. Each assumption yields a different estimation strategy with potentially yield different parameter estimates. With the preference parameters, qualities and marginal costs determined according to the methodology developed in the third chapter, one is able to construct consumer and producer welfare measures. The first two sections of the third chapter present counterfactual experiments. They consist on assuming exogenous changes in the market environment and analyzing the consequent welfare variation. The former simulation assumes a sharp price decrease in the imported good price. As expected, due to competitive pressures and consequent lower prices, consumer welfare goes up and producers\u2019 profits go down. In turn, the second section simulates a regulatory action whose objective is to split up the existing monopoly owned by Bavaria S.A. After the break up, the company does not internalize the price decision of all domestic beers in the market, then prices go down and similar welfare effects take place. Finally, the last section discusses the construction of welfare-based price indices and the identification of intertemporal welfare variation.

This project incorporates a newly developed method of adult age-at-death estimation and a multistate model of morbidity and mortality.  The results indicate that the Black Death differentially affected individuals with pre-existing health conditions.  The Black Death, however, was not as strongly selective as was normal mortality.

These studies demonstrated that the addition of chicory or a combination of all three FEFS studied (chicory, red clover, and perennial ryegrass) in a low proportion (&#8804;12.5%) of the seeding mixture helps decrease weed invasion and increase forage yield at the first harvest. Additionally forage nutritive value, DM yield, and overall net return are optimized by grazing forages based on canopy height. The use of complex mixtures can be an alternative to drought prone environments where consistency in DM production is more important than top forage productivity. Complex mixtures are a useful alternative for pastures in dairy farms to manage forage production risks in dry years and thereby increase and stabilize annual net returns.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [567], "author_name_tesi": "Deak, Atila ", "last_name_ssi": "Deak", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Atila", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marvin H Hall", "Matt A Sanderson", "Gregory Wayne Roth", "Harold William Harpster", "Clarence Alan Rotz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marvin H Hall, Committee Chair", "Matt A Sanderson, Committee Chair", "Gregory Wayne Roth, Committee Member", "Harold William Harpster, Committee Member", "Clarence Alan Rotz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DIVERISTY", "PASTURES", "GRAZING", "WEED SUPRESSION", "GRAZING ECONOMIC ANALYIS"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Study of the Relationship between Machine Compliance and Grinding Forces in Cylindrical Grinding", "id": "16143", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8278", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work demonstrates a novel strategy for improving size and form control when grinding with abrasive wheels. A comprehensive math model is proposed to capture the relevant physics and is used in conjunction with in-process measurements to provide better workpiece quality. Key issues to the success of this approach include rigorous accounting of the many (nonlinear) sources of structural loop compliance and their interaction with the grinding force. This work is particularly valuable in plunge and traverse grinding because any motion of the abrasive wheel translates directly into workpiece form errors. During a typical plunge grinding operation, the rapidly spinning abrasive wheel is advanced at constant rate into the slower workpiece. The literature documents many modeling attempts to predict the material removal as a function of these feeds and speeds. However, our novel experimental apparatus provides additional in-process information, most notably the grinding force, and clearly shows the inability of the traditional linear models to accurately predict workpiece size. As will be shown, there are additional physics to consider as evidenced by the lag between grinding force and material removal. This lag is not fully predicted by existing models and is a key result of this research. The model presented here correctly predicts this apparent lag by including nonlinear phenomena such as the depth-dependent energy of material removal as well as nonlinear contact stiffness between workpiece and wheel. The key contributions of this work are: 1) recognition of the errors of classical grinding efforts based on our results from a one-of-a-kind apparatus not available to other researchers; 2) inclusion of a physics-based description of the nonlinear relationship in material removal as a function of grinding parameters; 3) the prediction of workpiece size without o-line inspection; and 4) accurate simulation in the presence of ever-changing wheel condition, workpiece type, and grinding parameters.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8197], "author_name_tesi": "Deakyne, Theodore R", "last_name_ssi": "Deakyne", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Theodore", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Russell Marsh", "Eric Russell Marsh", "H Joseph Sommer Iii", "Panagiotis Michaleris", "Sanjay B Joshi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Russell Marsh, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Russell Marsh, Committee Chair", "H Joseph Sommer Iii, Committee Member", "Panagiotis Michaleris, Committee Member", "Sanjay B Joshi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["grinding force", "grinding modelling", "specific energy", "machine compliance", "time constant", "Contact", "grinding vibration", "superabrasives"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Terrain-Based Road Vehicle Localization Using Attitude Measurements\n", "id": "8997", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "157", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research is focused on developing a road vehicle localization technique that is independent of Global Positioning System (GPS) by means of a terrain-based method using in-vehicle attitude measurements.

First, find evidence to support the theory that female entrepreneurs and small business owners are affected by general and maternity-based barriers to advancement opportunities in the mainstream employment. Second, explore female entrepreneurship and female small business ownership by ascertaining what factors can limit the success of female owned businesses. Third, explore the concept of self-employment as a solution to the obstacles women encountered in their professional careers. \nFive categories of hypotheses follow from these three goals. Additionally, this study has implications for future employment decisions as female self-employment may be viewed as a solution to the tribulations experienced by women in traditional employment. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine female entrepreneurs and/or small business owners. Major themes were explored to discover if and how self-employment may be perceived as a solution by women. It was found that these women experienced some kinds of gender specific stereotypes and some work/ family balance issues at their former workplaces. They also believed and engaged in Bias Avoidance Behaviors. These women were either pushed or pulled into self-employment, although other motivators were identified. Women did not recount difficult interactions with financial institutions or a lack of confidence in financial matters, nor did they have trouble accessing networks. Rather, self-employed women experienced work/family imbalance when they had their own businesses. Despite a lack of evidence that businesswomen experienced stereotypes, barriers to advancement opportunities, and/or obstacles in self-employment, women still reported perceiving self- employment as a solution to their needs for flexibility, especially with respect to work/family balance issues.

Interaction with one organism may make the plant more vulnerable or more resistant to attacks by very different organisms. Microorganisms can form intimate associations with plants with direct effects ranging from beneficial to antagonistic, but indirect effects of plant-microbe relationships on plant interactions with other organisms are not well understood. Here, we explore the influences of microorganisms and microbial products on herbivory and resulting plant defenses. We use the legume-rhizobia mutualism as a model-system to explore herbivore-plant interactions by first characterizing the effects of rhizobial inoculation on herbivore feeding and subsequent accumulation of plant defense signaling hormones. We found interactive effects of the legume-rhizobia mutualism on plant-herbivore interactions which were dependent on both the stage of the mutualism and on the feeding style of the herbivore. Next, we explored the effects of association with different sources of rhizobia of soybean on specialist aphid populations in an agricultural setting. We found that particular rhizobia strains can confer greater resistance to their mutualist partners than others. In order to explore the effects of a rhizobia strain-specific trait on herbivory, we focused on the rhizobial product, rhizobitoxine, which can be found in host plant tissues. We found that the presumed presence of this compound decreased herbivore feeding and damage, which could be useful in pest management of legumes. Finally, we utilize genetically modified maize to further explore the application of a microbial product used for insect resistance and its effects on herbivore feeding and induction of plant defenses. Our results contribute to understanding of the evolution of host plant defenses and could facilitate the development of more sustainable management techniques for agriculture that are informed by an understanding of the chemical ecology of plants, microbes, and insects. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2845], "author_name_tesi": "Dean, Jennifer Mae", "last_name_ssi": "Dean", "middle_name_ssi": "Mae", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Consuelo M De Moraes", "Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Gretchen Anna Kuldau", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "Mark C Mescher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Consuelo M De Moraes, Committee Chair", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Member", "Gretchen Anna Kuldau, Committee Member", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Committee Member", "Mark C Mescher, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["insects", "genetic modification", "plant defenses", "legumes", "rhizobia", "Plant-herbivore interactions", "Helicoverpa zea", "Aphis glycines"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Reshaping the Neoliberal City: The Politics of Cooperation and the Movimiento de Ocupantes e Inquilinos in Buenos Aires, Argentina\n", "id": "11606", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3613", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates low-cost housing cooperatives produced by the Movimiento de Ocupantes e Inquilinos (MOI, Movement of Squatters and Tenants), a small non-governmental housing organization in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Since its founding in 1991, MOI has constructed its cooperatives in the sociopolitical context of neoliberal political reforms, forces which have been largely disadvantageous to the city\u2019s poor populations. The hypothesis of this dissertation is that if MOI cooperatives are an example of a creative alternative for low-cost housing that appeals to neoliberal ideology, then it stands to reason that analyzing the forms, styles and spaces of MOI cooperatives can correspondingly elucidate new attitudes towards urban space, housing and the working poor, effectively identifying how this non-governmental organization has contributed to the reshaping the neoliberal city. To test this hypothesis, this dissertation analyzes the architectural forms of MOI cooperatives within the context of neoliberal Buenos Aires. Each chapter takes on one MOI cooperative for case study, and asks the following questions: How were urban space and its uses affected through shifts in politics, economics and public policy? What was the discourse around low-cost housing that emerged in this context? What were the kinds of choices regarding architectural form and style that were made in designing these new cooperatives? How have existing and new forms of social identity for the working poor been mediated through MOI\u2019s adaptive reuse of abandoned property? Through archival, field and ethnographic research, this dissertation elucidates the conditions that engendered MOI\u2019s creative rethinking of low-cost, urban housing. In the current context of housing policy reform, this dissertation serves to define a more inclusive history of housing and a broader definition of the neoliberal city in Buenos Aires, in Latin America and abroad.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3593], "author_name_tesi": "Dean, Kristin V.", "last_name_ssi": "Dean", "middle_name_ssi": "V.", "first_name_ssi": "Kristin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Robert Zabel", "Craig Robert Zabel", "Madhuri Shrikant Desai", "Sarah K Rich", "Peter John Aeschbacher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig Robert Zabel, Dissertation Advisor", "Craig Robert Zabel, Committee Chair", "Madhuri Shrikant Desai, Committee Member", "Sarah K Rich, Committee Member", "Peter John Aeschbacher, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cooperatives", "Housing", "Architecture", "Argentina", "Buenos Aires", "Neoliberal"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER\u2019S LITERACY IN PLAY BELIEFS AND PRACTICES \nIN RELATION TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES\nBASED ON NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND\n\n\n", "id": "6599", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4909", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n         The account of this kindergarten teacher offers a window into the thoughts and actions of a veteran who reflects on her practice for the purpose of continually growing as a professional.

As a conscientious practitioner and life-long learner, Ms. D sought numerous professional development experiences to enhance her teaching practices.  She shared her story of how she teaches literacy in her full day kindergarten class and what the role of play is in the teaching of literacy. Moreover, she reflected on changes in her beliefs and practices resulting from being challenged by professional development activities designed in the wake of the federal legislation of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 (NCLB). Some of these practices were in direct conflict with her philosophies.\n      During the summer following the study she made adaptations to her practices, keeping the strategies learned from the workshops that she found advantageous to young children, and deleting or modifying those that were not satisfactory.

Nanoparticles have emerged as major components in the field of biosensing.  For example, metallic nanoparticles have been used as substrates for Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) and silicon nanowires have improved the sensitivity in the area of field effect transistors (FETs).  Due to the applications of nanoparticles and nanomaterials in sensing, it is vital to have multiple routes to control the surface chemistry of the nanoparticles.  Complete characterization of these surfaces is essential for the fabrication and production of reproducible, sensitive, and reliable biosensors.  Silica has been used to modify the surfaces of nanoparticles offering advantages such as protection of the metallic core, prevention of aggregation, biocompatibility, and the ability to attach molecules to the surface of the nanowire through well-understood silane chemistry.  Modification of these coatings has been accomplished by incorporation of different functional groups for different applications. \n\tControl of surface chemistry is crucial in the performance of nanomaterials and biofunctionalized nanomaterials in applications, such as sensing.  In addition to control over the surface chemistry of the nanoparticles, themselves, different routes of biomolecule immobilization must be optimized.  Biomolecules can be attached by direct adsorption, covalent attachment, or through cross-linking molecules, and the effect of the immobilization process on the biomolecule function must be characterized to produce reliable sensors.  In the following chapters I will address the modification of silica coatings to control the surface chemistry of nanoparticles, and then I will address methods of biomolecule immobilization.\nChapter 2 of this dissertation describes the coating of metallic nanowires with organically modified silica (ORMOSIL) coatings to incorporate different functionalities into a standard silica coating.  The addition of different functional groups, e.g., dihydroimidazole or polyethylene oxide, enabled new chemistry to be incorporated into the coatings, such as metal ion binding or protein resistance, respectively, while still offering the same advantages as standard silane coatings.  Metallic nanowires were coated with a variety of different modified silanes, and were then fully characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and infrared spectroscopy (IR) to confirm the presence of these modified silanes within the coating.  Additionally, the metal nanowire cores were dissolved to leave behind silica nanotubes composed of different ORMOSILs.  Nanotubes have applications in drug delivery, bioanalysis, and catalysis; the synthesis of nanotubes in this manner enabled control over the chemistry of the nanotubes.  Proof-of-concept experiments for applications of these coatings demonstrated the protein resistance and ability to attach DNA using a cross-linking molecule to the polyethylene oxide-containing silica coating, and the metal ion binding of the dihydroimidazole-containing silica coating.\nChapter 3 introduces silica coated, porous Au nanowires for use as Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) substrates for the detection of small molecules in biological samples.  Au/Ag alloy nanowires were coated, as described in Chapter 2, with SiO2 or an organically-modified silica containing a protein-resistant polyethylene oxide functionality.  Once coated, the sacrificial silver was etched from the alloy nanowires, leaving behind silica coated, porous Au nanowires, which were characterized using TEM.  Due to the nanostructure of these nanowires, enhancement of the inherently weak Raman signal was achieved.  A small molecule, 4-mercaptobenzoic acid, was detected, even after the nanowires were exposed to biologically relevant serum concentrations of protein.  This demonstrated the potential usefulness of these coated nanowires for detection of small molecules, e.g., metabolites or metabolic products of drugs, in biological fluids using SERS.\n\tThe immobilization of HRP onto spherical gold nanoparticles by direct adsorption was investigated in Chapter 4.  Direct adsorption of enzymes onto nanoparticles is the most common method of protein immobilization, but it is often not fully characterized.  It was determined that there was multilayer formation based on the quantification of the enzymes on the surface of the nanoparticles. Stability of the protein:nanoparticle conjugates was studied using both zeta potential and flocculation assays at different pH values.  Additionally, the specific activity of the enzyme was determined.  It is generally thought that fluorescent labels do not affect the structure and function of the enzyme.  However, comparisons between HRP and fluorescein labeled HRP:Au conjugates determined that the stability of the conjugates differed, particularly at pH 8.0.\nNanoparticle surface modifications for immobilization were further investigated in Chapter 5.  The experiments presented in Chapter 5 explored the immobilization of enzymes onto nanoparticle surfaces using barcoded nanowires to detect small molecules in solution.  Two different immobilization techniques were studied: encapsulation within a silica coating or within polyelectrolyte multilayers.  These immobilization techniques did not require any covalent attachment to the surface of the nanowires, which may affect the activity of the enzymes, and also enabled encapsulation within a material, preventing reversibility of the immobilization.  It was determined that the layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of polyelectrolytes in the presence of enzymes, rather than encapsulation in silica, enabled the immobilization of a wide variety of enzymes of different molecular weights onto both nanowires and latex beads.  Characterization of two different fluorescently labeled enzymes, malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase, was completed by immobilization onto fluorescent beads.  This enabled quantification of the enzyme molecules per bead and calculation of the specific activity, which provided information as to the stability of the immobilized enzymes and their ability to turnover product for biosensor fabrication.  Progress towards an enzymatic sensor was accomplished by the enzymatic reaction of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), catalyzing the oxidation of the fluorescein derivative, 2,7&#8242;-dichlorodihydrofluorescein, by urea hydrogen peroxide.  The production of the fluorescent product was concentrated around the nanowires, but diffusion away from the nanowires was problematic. \nThe effect of lithographic processes on the ability of the probe DNA oligos to selectively hybridize target sequences was studied in Chapter 6.  The use of lithography to fabricate more complex biosensor devices has become very prevalent, and therefore, it is necessary to understand the effect of lithographic processes on the nucleic acids.  This was accomplished by exposing nanowires to different photoresists, i.e., Megaposit SP 3012, Shipley 1813, PMGI SF6, that require different pre-exposure bake temperatures (95\u00b0C, 100\u00b0C, 190\u00b0C, respectively).  3\u00b4-Thiolated single-stranded DNA was covalently attached to gold or silica coated wires through thiol-Au or Sulfo-SMCC attachment chemistry, respectively, and these wires were deposited onto a substrate prior to photoresist exposure.  It was found that the exposure to standard photoresists, baked at lower temperatures (&#8804;100\u00b0C), did not prevent hybridization of target sequences post photoresist removal.  Post photoresist exposure, the DNA sequences were able to discriminate a single base mismatch.  \nThe fabrication of bioFETS for the detection of nucleic acids was studied in a collaborative project with Dr. Theresa Mayer\u2019s group in the Department of Electrical Engineering.  Previously it was shown that nanowires pre-functionalized with DNA probes were assembled onto a lithographically prepared chip using dielectrophoretic forces.  By confirming the lithographic processes did not affect the biomolecules, this assembly method of silicon nanowires can be used for the fabrication of bioFETs.  Currently, silicon nanowires are synthesized through vapor-liquid-solid growth off of a surface, but low yield and poor quality control and length homogeneity is often problematic.  In collaboration with Xiahua Zhong in the Mayer group, progress towards lithographically prepared axially doped silicon nanowires was accomplished, as also shown in Chapter 6.  The biofunctionalization of these particles and dielectric materials was studied.\nIn conclusion, a variety of different sensing platforms, i.e., SERS substrates, suspension array enzymatic biosensors, and bioFETS, were studied for the development of biosensors to detect small molecules and DNA.  The modification of the surface chemistry of nanoparticles was accomplished through the use of silica coatings and polyelectrolyte multilayers.  The understanding of the interaction of biomolecules with nanoparticles, and the ability to control the surface chemistry of the nanoparticles enables the production and fabrication of reproducible and reliable biosensors.  In the future, this knowledge can be used to fabricate sensitive bioFETs that will enable multiplexed detection of nucleic acid cancer markers and allow for statistical analysis of the results.  Ultimately, this knowledge will permit the fabrication of inexpensive, point-of-care sensors for early detection of diseases based on an electrical readout mechanism.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5653], "author_name_tesi": "Dean, Stacey Lynne", "last_name_ssi": "Dean", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynne", "first_name_ssi": "Stacey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Carlo G Pantano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating, Dissertation Advisor", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Chair", "Mary Elizabeth Williams, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["surface chemistry", "proteins", "nucleic acids", "colloid", "nanoparticles", "SERS", "FETs", "nanowires", "sol-gel", "silica"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Energetic Intermetallic Materials Formed by Cold Spray\n ", "id": "24776", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10958", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cold spray is a recently developed particle consolidation technique that has attracted attention as a method to create structural energetic materials. These materials can be used to replace non-energetic structural components in munitions and other devices. This replacement effectively increases the energy density of the device, without the need to develop a new high explosive payload, which has historically been very challenging. These materials are also candidates for use in self-propagating high-temperature synthesis applications, where the product of the energetic reaction is a useful material itself. These reactants can be deposited in a shape near their final form using cold spray, and then ignited to form the desired product.\nIn cold spray, particles are entrained in a carrier gas that is accelerated to high velocity through a supersonic nozzle. The high speed gas and particle stream impinges on a substrate, which the particles impact. The force of this impact is great enough that the particles adhere to the substrate and form a coating. These coatings can have densities and strengths near those of bulk material, making them potentially useful as structural components.\nThe low gas temperatures used in cold spray differentiate it from other thermal spray techniques. These low temperatures allow particles to remain solid throughout the deposition process. This is a significant benefit, as materials that react when mixed in a molten state can be cold sprayed without reaction taking place. It is this feature that makes cold spray an attractive process for the creation of energetic materials.\nThe energetic material used in this work is an intermetallic composed of a mixture of nickel (Ni) and aluminum (Al). The two metals are intimately mixed with each other as they are deposited, but remain heterogeneous until they are heated to the point of reaction. This intermetallic reaction is exothermic, gasless, and results in a product composed of various nickel aluminide phases, such as Al3Ni or AlNi.\nThe goal of this work is to investigate methods to control the properties of energetic materials made using cold spray. To do this, three studies were undertaken. In the first, the effects of different feed powder microstructures on the energetic properties of cold sprayed material were explored. Cold sprayed materials were made and compared with pellets and loose powders with matching compositions. The cold sprayed samples were made using mixed Al and Ni powders as the feed material, or a powder composed of Al particles that had been coated with a Ni shell (Ni-clad Al). The materials were characterized by measuring the rate at which a reaction front propagated through the material, and the amount of heat released by the material, which was measured using differential scanning calorimetry. Results from this study showed that, in Ni-clad Al, the speed of the reaction front increased with material density and reached a maximum of 116 mm/s in the cold sprayed material. The material made with mixed Al and Ni powders showed the opposite trend, with cold sprayed material having the slowest propagation rate of only 6 mm/s. This difference in behavior was attributed to the flow of molten Al enhancing the reaction propagation rate in samples made of mixed Al and Ni, which was limited when those materials were consolidated to high densities. An analytical model was used to describe the reaction propagation rates for both the mixed and clad materials.\nIn the second study, molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) was added to mixed-Al/Ni cold sprayed material to increase energy density and gas production through the exothermic Al/MoO3 thermite reaction. Results from this study showed that added MoO3 increased the reaction propagation rate over that of mixed Al and Ni with no added MoO3, but reduced heat evolved by the reaction in the calorimeter. Calorimetry experiments and atomistic modeling indicated this unanticipated finding resulted from the formation of a stable Ni/MoO3 product that inhibited both the Al/Ni and Al/MoO3 reactions.\nIn the final study, the effect of heat treatment on the mechanical and energetic properties of energetic cold sprayed material was explored. Cold sprayed materials, made with mixed Al and Ni powders and Ni-clad Al powder, were annealed at temperatures between 300 \u00b0C and 500 \u00b0C for four hours in argon. Changes in the structure of the material caused by annealing were studied using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, calorimetry was used to determine how the heat release of the materials was effected, and Vickers hardness testing was used to find how the mechanical properties of the materials were altered. Results showed that diffusion occurred in the samples during annealing, which led to the formation of intermediate product phases. These decreased the heat release of the materials from 926 J/g to 558 J/g for the Ni-clad Al material, and from 978 J/g to 159 J/g in the mixed-Al/Ni material. The hardness of the materials was also increased from 130 HV to 420 HV in the Ni-clad Al material, and from 66 HV to 645 HV in the mixed Al and Ni material.\nThe results of these studies show that the cold spray process is an effective means of producing energetic materials, and that the properties of these materials can be controlled through the selection of feed powder microstructure, the addition of ternary components, and heat treatment.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10541], "author_name_tesi": "Dean, Steven Wesley", "last_name_ssi": "Dean", "middle_name_ssi": "Wesley", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter", "Stephen R Turns", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "James Hansell Adair", "Timothy John Eden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen R Turns, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Timothy John Eden, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cold Spray", "Intermetallic", "Energetic Material", "Nickel", "Aluminum", "Combustion Synthesis", "Additive Manufacturing"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The effect of oxygen fugacity on the equilibrium partitioning of lithium between olivine and clinopyroxene", "id": "18855", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8960", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mantle olivines and clinopyroxenes from xenoliths sampled worldwide commonly display disequilibrium distributions of lithium and its isotopes. While many theories of open- and closed- system redistribution of lithium have been proposed, none has been adequately demonstrated experimentally. Closed system redistribution of lithium between olivine and clinopyroxene has been proposed to occur in response to changing equilibrium partition coefficients driven by changes in temperature or oxygen fugacity.  Previous experiments (Yakob et al., EPSL. 330, 11-21, 2012) have shown that there is no temperature dependence on Li partitioning between 700-1100\u00b0C.  The goal of this thesis is to determine the potential effect of oxygen fugacity on lithium partitioning between olivine and clinopyroxene.  To this end, a series of piston cylinder experiments was designed to fix the oxygen fugacity at various mantle values while natural olivine and diopside starting materials were equilibrated with a Li-bearing aqueous fluid.  Oxygen fugacity was buffered using the solid state fO2 buffers Fayalite-Magnetite-Quartz, Magnetite-W\u00fcstite, and Mo-MoO2.  A silver capsule was employed to minimize the solubility of Fe in the capsule, thus keeping it in the experimental charge.  Iron retention is critical because the mechanism being tested is coupled substitution of Li+ and Fe3+ for Mg2+ or Fe3+ in the olivine structure.  \n\tResults from these experiments show there is no apparent relationship between oxygen fugacity and equilibrium partitioning of Li between olivine and clinopyroxene at upper mantle conditions.  Over the range of fugacities investigated, DLiol/di was 1.7\u00b10.4 regardless of fO2.  The lack of a relationship between Li partitioning and oxygen fugacity, coupled with the previously determined lack of a relationship with temperature, suggests that closed system redistribution of Li between mantle phases is unlikely to explain the isotopic variability we see in xenoliths worldwide.  Instead, open system interaction with metasomatic fluids or melts could be the cause.  This implies that Li isotopes in mantle xenoliths are not necessarily representative of the ambient mantle from which they are sourced, and therefore limits the use of Li isotopes as a passive tracer of recycled crustal material in the mantle.  However, Li isotopic fractionation during open-system processes related to xenolith entrainment and eruption is likely to be useful as a geospeedometer to determine the rates of these processes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8797], "author_name_tesi": "Deane, James Anthony", "last_name_ssi": "Deane", "middle_name_ssi": "Anthony", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maureen Feineman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maureen Feineman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lithium", "Petrology", "Experimental petrology", "oxygen fugacity", "equilibrium partitioning", "mantle chemistry", "xenolith"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Passing, Passages, and Passkeys: Post-civil Rights Satirists Unlock the Master's House ", "id": "16204", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8060", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the post-civil rights era, which is marked by the eradication of legalized racial\nboundaries, racial passing should be unnecessary and obsolete.

While both Marketing and Economics literature\nhave made significant contributions in analyzing product line decisions of a manufacturer,\nthese studies do not consider discrete consumer choice explicitly. The OM\nliterature has analyzed assortment decisions of a retailer taking into account consumer\nchoice, but the primary focus is on horizontally differentiated products. This dissertation\ninvestigates the assortment and pricing decisions of a retailer selling vertically\n(quality) differentiated products under discrete consumer choice. Thus, this research\ncontributes to the OM literature by extending the assortment planning problem from\nhorizontally differentiated products to vertically differentiated products, and to the\nMarketing literature by explicitly incorporating consumer choice.\nThe first essay investigates the assortment planning problem of a single category\nof vertically differentiated products under consumer choice. Consumers have heterogeneous\npreferences for quality and the retailer is aware of the distribution of the\npreference. The consumer choice process is as follows: A typical consumer independently\nchooses the product (including the outside option) that maximizes her utility\nand does not substitute with another available product if the first choice product is\nout of stock. This simple choice process leads to stochastic demand of each item, and\nhence inventory cost plays a role in retailer\u2019s assortment and pricing decisions. The\noptimal assortment retailer offers under demand uncertainty is found to be a subset\nof the optimal assortment offered in case demand of each product is known with certainty.\nThus inventory cost limits the number of products retailer offers. This finding\nsignificantly reduces the computational effort required to find the optimal assortment.\nWe also provide an algorithm to identify the set of products within which the search\nfor the optimal assortment can be restricted.\nThe second essay investigates the optimal pricing and assortment decisions of\ntwo categories, where each category has several quality differentiated products. Consumers\nhave heterogeneous preference for quality in both categories. Depending on\nthe way consumers choose products from the two categories, they are categorized into\ntwo types, cherry pickers and basket shoppers. A cherry picker evaluates products in\neach category independently and purchases a product only if it maximizes her utility\ncompared to other products in that category and the outside option. In contrast, a\nbasket shopper evaluates both categories together, and selects a configuration comprising\nof one product from each category, only if the total utility of the configuration\nis higher than the utilities from other configurations and the outside option. We show\nthat in presence of the two consumer types, retailer offers the same variety in each\ncategory that she would offer when there are only cherry pickers. The variety level\noffered in each category is the category-profit maximizing set of products. Moreover,\nretailer offers certain high quality products in the two categories category at the same\nprices which she offers to cherry pickers. The pricing policy for the remaining lower\nquality products, however, depends on the relative proportion of the two types and\nthe correlation between the two sensitivities.\nThe last essay investigates assortment and pricing decisions of a co-production\nsystem, most noticeably present in semiconductor manufacturing, where the quality\nof the manufactured units vary. A firm operating in such a system tests each unit\nafter production, classifies the units into quality buckets or bins, and then sells all\nunits in a bin at the same price. We investigate how many bins firm should offer,\nthe quality levels of those bins and their prices. These decisions are made keeping\ninto consideration inventory and demand of the bins. Units in different bins cannot\nbe manufactured independently due to variability in output quality. Further, the\ndemands of the bins, which are generated from consumers\u2019 utility maximization, are\nalso interdependent. We show that firm chooses the optimal quality levels and the\nbatch size such that the demands of all offered bins are met in full. The optimal quality\nlevels are unevenly spaced across the support of the distribution of quality. An\neasier strategy to offer an assortment with equidistant bins can be significantly suboptimal.\nWe also find that a limited number of carefully selected bins provide almost\nall potential revenue from the market. Finally, we discuss practical considerations for\npricing, technology, and optimal product offerings, and explain the proliferation of\nbins witnessed in the last decade in processor manufacturing.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8300], "author_name_tesi": "Deb, Mrinmay ", "last_name_ssi": "Deb", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mrinmay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan H Xu", "Terry Paul Harrison", "Saurabh Bansal", "Min Ding", "Susan H Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan H Xu, Committee Chair", "Terry Paul Harrison, Committee Member", "Saurabh Bansal, Committee Member", "Min Ding, Committee Member", "Susan H Xu, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Retail Assortment Planning", "Consumer Choice Modeling", "Pricing of Substitutable Products"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Digging for Substellar Objects in the Stellar Graveyard", "id": "6669", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2697", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "White dwarfs, the endpoint of stellar evolution for stars with\n with mass $<$ 8$Msun$,\npossess several attributes favorable for studying planet and brown dwarf \nformation around stars with primordial masses $>$ 1 $Msun$.  \nThis thesis explores the \nconsequences of post-main-sequence evolution on the dynamics of a planetary\nsystem and the observational signatures that arise from such evolution.  These\nsignatures are then specifically tested with a direct imaging survey of nearby \nwhite dwarfs.  Finally, new techniques for high contrast imaging are discussed\nand placed in the context of further searches for planets and brown dwarfs\nin the stellar graveyard.\n\nWhile planets closer than $sim$ 5~AU will \nmost likely not survive the post-main sequence evolution of its parent star, any\nplanet with semimajor axis $>$ 5~AU will survive, and its semimajor axis will\nincrease as the central\nstar loses mass.  \nThe stability of adjacent orbits to mutual planet-planet \nperturbations\ndepends on the ratio of the planet mass to the central star's mass, and\n I demonstrate that some planets \nin previously stable orbits around a star undergoing mass loss will become\nunstable.\nI show that when mass loss is slow, systems of two planets that are marginally\nstable can become unstable to close encounters with each other,\n while for three planets the\ntimescale for close encounters decreases significantly with increasing mass ratio.  Close encounters can lead to collisions of planets and new orbits that\nperturb surviving planetesimals into white dwarf grazing orbits.  Perturbed planetesimals can create pollution of the white dwarf's surface and circumstellar\ndust disks which can be observational signatures of planetary systems\n\nIf pollution of a white dwarf's atmosphere is caused by relic planetary systems, any white dwarf with photospheric absorption due to metals can be searched for substellar companions.  Hydrogen white dwarfs with metal absorption, so called\nDAZ white dwarfs, are hard to explain by simple ISM accretion, and present \nan opportunity to test the observational signatures of unstable planetary systems.  Additionally, field white dwarfs can be searched for substellar companions\nas well.    \nI conducted a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Canada France Hawaii Telescope\nsurvey of nearby white\ndwarfs for substellar objects.

Limits to unresolved companions are derived through analysis of 2MASS\nphotometry of the white dwarfs compared to expected fluxes based on the\nWDs effective temperature, distance, and gravity.  From my survey I\nfind several candidate companions, which have been or will be followed up\nwith second epoch observations.  I find that\nmy observations are sensitive to planetary companions around some targets \nwith M $gtorder$6 M$_{Jup}$, and sensitive\nto companions with M $>$ 18 M$_{Jup}$ for all but two of my targets.\nThe lack of\nsignificant near infrared excesses for my targets\nlimits any kind of unresolved companions\npresent\n to be substellar.  In light of these results I make several\ncomments on the possibility of determining the origin of metals in the\natmospheres of white dwarfs and the frequency of substellar objects in orbit\naround intermediate mass stars.\n\nThe search for planetary companions to stars requires further development\nof high contrast imaging techniques.  This thesis studies \nGaussian aperture pupil masks (GAPMs) which in theory can achieve the contrast\nrequisite for directly imaging an extrasolar planet around a nearby\nsolar type star.  I outline the process\n of designing, fabricating, and testing a GAPM\nfor use on current telescopes and specifically the Penn State near-IR Imager and Spectrograph (PIRIS) at the Mt.\nWilson 100$^{primeprime}$ telescope.  I find that observations with\na prototype are quite successful, achieving a contrast similar to a traditional Lyot coronagraph without blocking any light from a central object\nand useful for finding faint companions to nearby young solar analogues.  In\nthe lab I can reproduce the expected PSF reasonably well\nand with a single aperture design which achieves $sim4 \times 10^{-5}$ contrast at 10$lambda/D$.\n  I find that small inaccuracies in the mask fabrication process and\ninsufficient correction of the atmosphere contribute the most degradation to\ncontrast at these levels.\nAdditionally I present the first laboratory experiments using a notch-filter mask, a coronagraphic\nimage mask that can produce infinite dynamic range in an ideal Lyot coronagraph according to scalar diffraction theory.\nI fabricated the first notch-filter mask prototype with 0.25 micron precision\n using an e-beam lithography machine.  My initial optical tests show that the prototype masks\ngenerate contrast levels of 10$^{-5}$ at 3$lambda/D$ and 10$^{-6}$ at $sim 8 lambda/D$, with\n a throughput of 27\\%.

Different techniques, including X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry were combined to provide better understanding of microstructure and interface quality of BaTiO3 thin films on Ni foil. \nIt was found that high quality thin films could be prepared using rapid thermal annealing 750oC in N2 to crystallize the film without building up significant levels of NiO on the substrate.  After building up the desired dielectric thickness, the films were heat-treated at 1000oC and later re-oxidized under controlled oxygen partial pressure conditions.  The resulting films have dielectric constants of 1000-1300 which are stable as a function of temperature with loss tangents less than 2%.  \nFurnace annealed barium titanate films on Ni foil were characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  X-ray diffraction shows a well-crystallized polycrystalline perovskite phase in furnace annealed films with a high intensity of the 100 and 200 peaks.  The films show equiaxed grains with average grain size of 42 nm.  There are 5-6 grains across a 200 nm thick film, suggesting that it should be possible to use grain boundaries in films in order to control the capacitor reliability, as is done with bulk capacitors. NiO was detected by X-ray diffraction, but not by transmission electron microscopy, suggesting that the oxide is not a continuous barrier layer, but is distributed inhomogeneously over the surface. Electron energy loss microscopy shows the existence of C in barium titanate grains.  In addition, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy showed that an interfacial Ni-Ba alloy develops at the interface between the BaTiO3 film and the Ni foil. This would be consistent with very reducing partial pressures locally during the processing, probably as a result of retained organics.\nDecomposition of both powders dried from barium titanate solutions and barium titanate films was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-diffraction.  It was found that flowing N2 delays decomposition of organics in the powders, leading to retained carbonate phases.  Thus, crystallization of barium titanate occurs via decomposition of a barium carbonate phase. Retained organics, especially C, in BaTiO3 films was thus found to be critical in processing of dense chemical solution deposited films in low oxygen partial pressures.\nThe optical properties, film density and film thickness were studied by spectroscopic ellipsometry as a function of processing conditions.  It was shown that the refractive index of amorphous dried films increases as drying temperature increases.  Similarly, the refractive index of the films increases as the RTA temperature increases, probably at least in part due to crystallization of BaTiO3 and removal of some of the intermediate phases.  On annealing at 1000\u00b0C, there is slightly increase in the refractive index of the film due to further crystallization.  The final refractive index is comparable to that of 95% dense barium titanate ceramics.  Re-oxidation did not change the refractive index of the film.  \nTo facilitate studies of the dielectric/electrode interface, the optical properties of thermally grown NiO on Ni foil were extracted.  It was found that the Ni foil begins to oxidize at 300oC in air.  The real part of the high frequency dielectric constant of NiO is similar to that of barium titanate, which complicated modeling of NiO in barium titanate films on Ni foil. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6321], "author_name_tesi": "Dechakupt, Tanawadee ", "last_name_ssi": "Dechakupt", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tanawadee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Clive A Randall", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Amar S Bhalla"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "Amar S Bhalla, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["barium titanate", "thin film capacitors", "chemical solution deposition", "microstructure", "interface"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "African Genres: Literature, Geography, and Poetics in the Long East Coast", "id": "22684", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10381", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "African Genres enacts a broad reassessment of academic and popular conceptions of \u201cAfrica\u201d through analyzing written literatures from the Long East Coast.

Post-industrial cities like Pittsburgh use public art projects alongside investment to try to revitalize economically and socially vulnerable places. These attempts can lead to positive revitalization or damaging gentrification or may have no impact. Results largely depend on place-context and the details of the strategy.\nA database of physical and social features was constructed to use a methodology derived from the study of settlement patterns. Based on spatial relationships between features associated with either positive or negative types of urban development, neighborhoods in Pittsburgh are identified, classified, and analyzed. This analysis reveals the spatial context that contributes to the distribution of public art and its relationship to revitalization projects.\nIn a parallel investigation, these same concepts are explored through an arts practice-based methodology. This methodology creates additional insight into the process of research and the importance of public art research.\nThis study will identify places that may produce positive kinds of growth in a city in need of a new direction.

It also expands our understanding of coworker trust by differentiating between targets: trust in coworkers overall, least trusted coworker, and most trusted coworker.\n\nResults from the study indicate that the tendency to attribute ambiguous behavior to a hostile intention does  predict trust in others, and propensity to trust others was only moderately related to trust in the workplace; displaying anxious or avoidant attachment was a significant predictor of coworker trust across all three measurement methods.  Avoidant attachment is the only variable that was a significant predictor of supervisor trust.

Sphingomyelin\nand phosphatidylcholine are present in the outer layer of the plasma membrane or the\nlumenal side of intracellular membranes, and phosphatidylserine and\nphosphatidylethanolamine are restricted to the cytosolic side of membranes. The\nmaintenance of phospholipid asymmetry is an energy-dependent process. The type IV Ptype\nATPases are classified as putative amphipath transporters. Indirect evidence\nsuggests that the mammalian class 1 transporters 1a (ATP8A2), 1c (ATP8B1), and 1e\n(ATP8B3) transport, and thereby restrict phosphatidylserine to the cytosolic side of\nmembranes.\nTo investigate if all class 1 type IV P-type ATPases transport phosphatidylserine\nand whether enzymes of other classes of type IV P-type ATPases also transport\nphosphatidylserine, selected mammalian genes were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda\ninsect cells using a baculovirus expression system, which produces large enough\nquantities of recombinant proteins for biochemical analyses of substrate specificity.\nBased on similarity to the 1a gene, the protein encoded by the 1b gene (67% identical;\n82% similar) is the most likely candidate to transport the same amphipathic molecule,\nphosphatidylserine, and the protein encoded by the 2b gene (29% identical; 48% similar)\nis the least likely. If the 2b protein also transports phosphatidylserine this will suggest\nthat all type IV P-type ATPases transport phosphatidylserine. Accordingly, using the\npFastBac HTb vector, recombinant 2b protein was expressed with an N-terminal 6x\nhistidine tag to allow detection of the protein using a probe specific to consecutive\nhistidines. Both the histidine probe and a monoclonal antibody directed against 2b\ndetected a protein of the same molecular weight as recombinant 2b, but in both\nbaculovirus-infected and uninfected cells, precluding specific detection of recombinant\n2b protein. 1b was initially expressed with a 6x N-terminal histidine tag using the start\ncodon within the pFastBac HTb vector. Detection of recombinant 1b protein expressed\nfrom this vector was not consistent due to low expression of the recombinant protein or\ndue to improper folding of the protein resulting in inaccessibility of the histidine tag.\nTo increase expression of the 1b protein the 1b expression vector was\nreconstructed using the pFastBac 1 vector. An engineered polyribosomal binding site\nwas placed upstream of the 1b initiation codon to increase protein expression and to\nallow the use of the 1b initiation codon, reducing the addition of non-functional amino\nacids. To decrease the chances of the recombinant protein being incorrectly folded, the\n6x histidine tag was moved to the 3' end of the 1b ORF and engineered to allow protein\ndetection and purification of the recombinant protein using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid\nagarose. Higher levels of recombinant 1b protein expression were achieved using this\nvector. However, attempts to purify the recombinant 1b protein were unsuccessful,\nperhaps due to insufficient solubility of the protein.\nAfter sufficient quantities of soluble recombinant 1b and 2b proteins are purified,\nbiochemical assays will be performed to determine if phosphatidylserine stimulates 1b\nand/or 2b ATPase activity. Briefly, in the presence of Mg2+, ATP will phosphorylate the\niv\npurified enzyme at a conserved aspartate residue in the catalytic site forming a\nphosphoenzyme intermediate. Upon addition of the correct substrate (e.g.,\nphosphatidylserine), the enzyme will dephosphorylate releasing inorganic phosphate.\nThe amount of phosphate released is indicative of enzyme activity. If stimulation is\nspecific, the phosphoenzyme will only dephosphorylate in the presence of the sn-1,2\nstereoisomer.\nTo study the physiological functions of type IV P-type ATPases, gene targeting\nvectors were constructed in order to knock out the 1a and 2b genes. Similar to the\nprotein expression studies, these two genes were chosen because they are least similar to\neach other. Because a gene targeting vector should replace coding sequence within the 5'\nend of a gene to ensure a non-functional protein is produced after homologous\nrecombination in embryonic stem cells. Southern analysis probes IIb and 2bgenom were\ndesigned and used to identify restriction fragments from BAC 23170 containing exons 1,\n2, 3, or 4 of the 2b gene, and the identified fragments inserted into pBluescript vectors.\nThree plasmids were obtained. Two plasmids, POO and PW, contain sequence that\nencodes exon 4 and a portion of transmembrane domain 2. PH#6 contains sequence\nencoding the translational start codon, transmembrane domain 1, exon 1, exon 2, and\nexon 3 and will be used to generate the targeting vector.\nIn constructing a gene targeting vector, a positive selection cassette, such as the\nneomycin resistance cassette, is used to replace a coding portion of the gene of interest\nand allow identification of homologously recombinant embryonic stem cells. A\npreviously constructed 1a gene targeting vector contained a neomycin positive selection\ncassette that replaced 2,473 bp of the 1a ORF, including the coding sequence for\ntransmembrane domain 1, 30 bp of exon 2, exon 3, and 22 bp of exon 4; a 3-frame stop\nadjacent to the 5' end of the neomycin resistance cassette; and 5' and 3' homology\nregions. The 3-frame stop ensures that functional protein will not be produced. The\ndiptheria toxin A negative selection cassette was placed at the end of the 3' homology\nregion of this vector to allow identification of only homologously recombinant\nembryonic stem cells. The revised construct was linearized and given to the PSU\nTransgenic Facility to obtain recombinant embryonic stem cell clones that could be used\nto generate a 1a knockout mouse. A 5' hybridization probe containing exon 5 sequence\nand a 3' hybridization probe containing intron 3 sequence were generated to enable\nverification of homologously recombinant embryonic stem cells via Southern analysis of\nmouse tail DNA.\nMutations within the class 1 gene ATP8B1, which is 47% identical and 65%\nsimilar to the 1a gene, cause liver disease in humans, indicating that other type IV P-type\nATPases are not able to compensate for its loss of function. Therefore, the 1a and 2b\nknockout mice will be examined physically and histologically to determine if the loss of\nfunction of either gene has an effect on the health of the mice. Since 1a is most highly\nexpressed in the brain and lungs, and 2b in the testes, we may expect the 1a knockout\nmouse to have a central nervous system defect and the 2b knockout mouse to have\nfertility problems.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5294], "author_name_tesi": "Deering , Rebecca Sue", "last_name_ssi": "Deering ", "middle_name_ssi": "Sue", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Allen Schlegel", "Robert Allen Schlegel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Allen Schlegel, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Allen Schlegel, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["phosphatidylserine", "ATP8A1", "gene targeting vectors", "baculovirus protein expression", "ATP8A2", "type IV P-type ATPases", "ATP9A", "ATP9B"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Single-molecule microscopy step detection algorithms: kinesin motor proteins and the cellulose synthesis complex", "id": "24977", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11312", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Single-molecule microscopy is a versatile tool that can be used to investigate the stepping mechanism of motor proteins such as kinesin, and to determine the copy number of subunits within membrane bound proteins such as the cellulose synthesis complex. Step detection algorithms provide a means for uncovering critical information within single-molecule microscopy data collected from these systems.\n\nKinesin proteins are intracellular molecular motors that utilize energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in order to transmit force and transport cellular cargo along microtubule tracks. Despite the current wealth of knowledge regarding these proteins, many unresolved mechanisms of the kinesin stepping cycle remain. Step detection algorithms that recover underlying piecewise-constant signals within noise-corrupted, single-molecule time series position data provide a strategy for resolving these mechanisms. The work presented in this thesis shows that by treating a positional time series as an observation sequence from a hidden Markov model, we can apply the model-dependent, continuous Viterbi algorithm in order to determine the most-likely hidden state sequence of the tracked motor protein. This approach has the critical capability of keeping \u201cphase\u201d of plateaus within a given time series, which allows for more accurate determination of kinetic rates and motor domain displacements associated with state transitions during stepping.\n\nIn growing plant cells, cellulose synthesis complexes (CSCs) exist in the plasma membrane as six-lobed rosettes that contain different cellulose synthase (CESA) isoforms, but the number and stoichiometry of CESAs in each CSC are unknown. To begin to address this question, we performed photobleaching of GFP-tagged AtCESA3-containing particles in living Arabidopsis thaliana cells followed by step detection analysis to estimate copy number. The step detection algorithms introduced in this work account for changes in signal variance due to changing numbers of fluorophores in order to avoid overfitting. These procedures can be applied to photobleaching data for any complex with large numbers of fluorescently tagged subunits, providing a new analytical tool with which to probe complex composition and stoichiometry.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10851], "author_name_tesi": "Deffenbaugh, Nathan C", "last_name_ssi": "Deffenbaugh", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Nathan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William O Hancock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William O Hancock, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["single-molecule microscopy", "step detection", "kinesin", "motor proteins", "cellulose synthesis complex", "hidden Markov models"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Soft Errors: Modeling And Interactions with Power Optimizations\n\n", "id": "6783", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6420", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soft errors are radiation induced ionization events that cause errors in circuits.\nThe circuit always recovers from these errors as they do not damage the circuit.

As a result, immigrants now constitute about 12% of the total U.S. population. In the same way, the population of children in immigrant families in the United States (including immigrant children and U.S.-born children of adult immigrants) has also increased considerably. The proportion of children residing in a home with at least one foreign-born parent rose from 12.1% in 1990 to 18.1% in 2000 and 22% in 2007. Yet, the health and health behaviors of this fast-growing population of children in immigrant families remain insufficiently understood. Additional research is needed to adequately understand the psychological, physical, and emotional needs of children in immigrant families, identify the barriers to resources that they experience, and examine the underlying mechanisms through which various aspects of immigrant integration affect the physical and psychological well-being of immigrant children. This dissertation focuses on adolescents with one or more immigrant parents. \n\nThe thesis consists of three studies that examine the disparities in physical and mental health status and health care access and utilization between adolescents and young adults in immigrant and non-immigrant families. In the first study, I examine the differences in the trajectories of self-reported physical health from age 12 to 32 among non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics in immigrant and non-immigrant families. Further, I assess the effect of assimilation on the self-reported health trajectories of adolescents and young adults age 12 to 32 with immigrant or non-immigrant parents from the four racial/ethnic backgrounds mentioned. The second study determines whether the trends in the receipt of routine physical exams from age 12 to 32 differ for those in immigrant and non-immigrant families. Also, the role of factors associated with health care access and utilization on the trajectories of routine physical examination is evaluated. Finally, the third study examines the immigrant generational differences in depressive symptoms among adolescents and notes how person, family, and neighborhood factors explain the association between depressive symptoms and generational status. In all the three studies, I analyze the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) data using hierarchical or multilevel modeling techniques.\n\nThe results of the first study are that an advantage in the trajectory of self-reported health exists for those in immigrant families from age 12 to 32 regardless of race/ethnicity and adjusting for socioeconomic characteristics, demographic factors, acculturation, and spatial assimilation does not fully explain the health advantage. \n\nThe second study results show immigrant families are less likely to receive timely routine physical exams between the ages of 12 and 22 compared to those in non-immigrant families. However, from age 23 to 32 those in immigrant families are more likely to receive routine physical exam compared to those in non-immigrant families among Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics. High income, health insurance, having a usual source of health care, and a high parental education enhance the probability of routine physical exam over time.\n\nIn the third study, first generation adolescents report higher average depressive symptoms than third generation adolescents while second generation adolescents do not differ significantly from third generation adolescents regarding average depressive symptoms reported. Also, greater proportions of first and second generation adolescents reside in neighborhoods characterized by high concentrated disadvantage, high immigrant concentration, and low residential stability. Results from the third study also indicate that person and family factors account for generation differences in depressive symptoms while neighborhood factors contribute substantially to racial/ethnic disparities in depressive symptoms among adolescents. \n\nTaken as a whole, the three studies in the dissertation have added to the existing knowledge on the health status and health care access and utilization of adolescents and young adults in immigrant families as well as the role of person, family, and neighborhood factors in shaping these health outcomes using a nationally representative longitudinal data set and multi-level modeling approaches. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [308], "author_name_tesi": "Degboe, Arnold Nutifafa Komla", "last_name_ssi": "Degboe", "middle_name_ssi": "Nutifafa Komla", "first_name_ssi": "Arnold", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier", "Rhonda Belue", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook", "D Wayne Osgood", "Dennis G Shea"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Dissertation Advisor", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Chair", "Rhonda Belue, Committee Member", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "Dennis G Shea, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["immigrant adolescents", "adolescents with immigrant parents", "immigrant health status trajectory", "immigrant routine physical exam trajectory", "immigrant health disparities", "neighborhood context and immigrant adolescents", "neighborhood context and psychological well-being", "multi-level modeling", "growth curves"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Influence of Steam on the Flammability Limits of Premixed Natural Gas/Oxygen/Steam Mixtures", "id": "10727", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4158", "abstract_tesi": "Synthesis gas (syngas), a mixture of CO and H2, is an intermediate in a variety of industrial processes.

A unique test chamber has allowed the study of ignition, flame propagation, and explosion characteristics of gas mixtures similar to those used as reactants in the SCT-CPO reactor. The tests were conducted at various pressures with different mole fractions of steam and two different compositions of natural gas (NG). A flammability boundary for the mixtures, based on normalized pressure and mole fraction of steam, was determined. Previous studies indicate that steam can be used to suppress the flammability of a mixture by both physical and chemical processes. To examine the chemical processes, Chemkin Code calculations were executed. Similar to the experimentally observed phenomena, the Chemkin calculations also showed that more steam was required to suppress the flammability of the mixture with the higher adiabatic flame temperature. The results show highly non-linear flammability boundaries for both hydrocarbon/oxygen/steam mixtures were very sensitive to equivalence ratio and pressure, as the mechanism for flammability suppression by steam is also strongly dependent on these parameters.

The study of student graduation behaviors has been plagued with methodological concerns, especially when the inherent longitudinal nature of college student graduation is considered.  The purpose of this study was to investigate college student graduation using a technique called discrete time survival analysis.  Discrete time survival analysis addresses many of the concerns associated with the longitudinal study of graduation, such as the use of variables that change over time and censored cases, and allows for the investigation of timing of graduation.

Through a study of print culture and fin de si\u00e8cle urban development, this dissertation examines the regional and broader significance Yucat\u00e1n\u2019s nineteenth-century origins debate and advances five major arguments.  First, I contend that the question proved discursively critical to the formation of modern Mexican church and state institutions in the decades following independence between volatile mid-century events and the rise of a Porfirian plantation-based cordage industry serving global agricultural markets.  The genesis question became critical not only in determining Caste War-era politics and policy but proved central to Yucat\u00e1n\u2019s present and future inclusion in the nation as well as shaping the formation of its own socioeconomic order.  Second, I find that religion proved a modern medium through which institutional definitions of race were constructed and contested.  Third, the project underscores the ways in which nineteenth-century narratives of natural and ethnic history were intertwined, with larger implications for better understanding elite discursive justifications for an exploitative, export-based Porfirian economy.  Fourth, my work illustrates how genealogical constructions culturally framed elite-sponsored infrastructural projects alongside Mexico\u2019s post-Reform (1857-61) revitalized popular religious festivals, both materially manifest in the Yucatec capital of M\u00e9rida\u2019s fin de si\u00e8cle urban growth.

Luisa Castro\u2019s\nLa segunda mujer (2006), Rosa Montero\u2019s La hija del Can\u00edbal (1997), Espido Freire\u2019s\nMelocotones helados (1999), and Maria de la Pau Janer\u2019s Las mujeres que hay en m\u00ed (2002)\ncarefully relate the deliberate suppression of recent\u2014national, familial, and specifically\nfemale\u2014history to an existing crisis in women\u2019s identity. Each woman exhibits a problematic\nunfamiliarity with the past that affects insecurity and an inner conflict in the character. This\nstruggle is a profound one that is manifested through a splintering or splitting of consciousness, a\nlack of compatibility between mind and body, mistaken identities, and an overall sense of\nconfusion regarding each woman\u2019s sense of self. Although the female subject has been the center\nof considerable critical attention in recent years, very few studies have focused exclusively on\nthe correlative relationship existing among a palpable crisis in female identity, the collective\namnesia of Spain\u2019s Transition to democracy, and twenty-first-century Spain\u2019s impetus to recover\nand re-vision an ignored female memory and history so as to make sense of the present. It is with\niv\nthe aim of filling this apparent void in contemporary Peninsular literary studies that I embark on\nthis project.\nThe present study would argue that the novels all provide significant commentary on the\nexperience of women at the brink of twenty-first-century Spanish society and that they\ncharacterize women as being unaware of their personal histories and present identities. The crises\nthe characters experience are often provoked and intensified by androcentric practices and\ninstitutions\u2014domestic violence, marriage and pregnancy at a young age, archaic and oppressive\nreligious rituals, and the general subjugation of women. The first two chapters consider female\nsubjects who are writers by trade, yet temporarily abandon and then return to the narrative\nprocess to assert and reinvent themselves as they piece together the many fragments that\nconstitute their identity. The splintering of identity is not only visible in the fragmented narrative\nstructure of the novels and the implied texts of the protagonists but in the characters\u2019 psyche and\nmaterial body as well. The first chapter outlines the effects of domestic abuse on the protagonist\nand the tendency of physical and emotional violence to function as a simultaneously destructive\nand creative force that is capable of redefining and reformulating female subjectivity. Instances\nof violence compel the protagonist to locate and generate a response to her precarious situation,\nwhich eventually results in a reconstruction of identity and a feminist consciousness. The\nconsecutive chapters deal much more explicitly with the persistence of the past in the present and\nwith the protagonists\u2019 desire to revisit and recover suppressed secrets from their personal past. In\nthe second chapter, I analyze the connection Montero establishes between the reworking and\nrecovery of historiographic material from Spain\u2019s pre- and post-Civil War eras and the rewriting\nof personal history and the self. I, too, consider the scarred and splintered female body as a site\nv\nof personal and traumatic memory that the protagonist reads and re-writes as if it were a text that\nreveals certain painful truths from her life experiences.\nThe third and fourth chapters revisit the problem of mistaken, blurred identities, and a\nsplintering of consciousness reminiscent of the \u201cFemale Gothic\u201d mode. Both chapters address\nthe spectral return of the past\u2014manifest in the presence of ghosts, oppressive silences, and the\namnesic process that characterized the transition to democracy in Spain\u2014which underscores the\nnotion that history perpetually repeats itself in the present. The reader frequently senses that very\nlittle has changed, and that progress has not been made, particularly in terms of female\nexperience, which appears to mirror the struggles of previous generations of women. My\nanalyses of Freire and Janer\u2019s texts consider the ways in which the past and the spectral\nintertwine in a discourse that explores the tensions between remembrance and oblivion, as\nexperienced by the contemporary female subject. The remnants and ghosts of the past indicate\nthe presence of a repressed (female) history that has been kept from the protagonists, thereby\ninciting identity confusion in the young women. This dissertation will conclude that the\nmisunderstanding or ignorance of feminist thought relates to the silencing and forgetting of a\ncollective Spanish women\u2019s history, not only during the Franco era, but throughout and beyond\nthe nation\u2019s transition to democracy as well. Through their respective engagements with literary\nor artistic production, these female characters seek to simultaneously recuperate and revise their\npersonal histories and identities so as to make reparations to the previous generations of women\nwho were not afforded an audible voice.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [215], "author_name_tesi": "Delgado-Poust, Antonia L", "last_name_ssi": "Delgado-Poust", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Antonia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew J Marr", "Matthew J Mahr", "William Robert Blue", "Cheryl Jean Glenn", "Guadalupe Mart\u00ed Pe\u00f1a", "Chip Gerfen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew J Marr, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew J Mahr, Committee Chair", "William Robert Blue, Committee Member", "Cheryl Jean Glenn, Committee Member", "Guadalupe Mart\u00ed Pe\u00f1a, Committee Member", "Chip Gerfen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spanish Feminism", "historical memory", "self and other"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Silicide and Germanide Contacts to Silicon and Germanium Nanowires", "id": "11787", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4722", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Semiconductor nanowires have shown promise and garnered considerable interest for use in  field-effect transistors, thin film transistors, and chemical and biological sensors.  Electrical contacts to nanowire based devices have been identified as a source of performance limitations of these devices.  For the successful application of nanowires into high-performance devices, a fundamental understanding of contact formation and contact properties is necessary.  Furthermore, the formation of metallic silicides in the case of Si nanowires (SiNWs) or germanides in the case of GeNWs have proven to be an effective way to reduce the access and/or series resistance of nanowire devices.  Here, the formation of silicides (Ti, V, Pt, Pd, and Ni) and germanides (Ni) in contacts to nanowires have been studied.  Additionally, a method for accurate extraction of the Schottky barrier height in axial contacts to nanowires is demonstrated for Ni silicide contacts to n-type SiNWs.\nWe have found that as a basic criteria for forming axial metal silicide contacts to SiNWs from metal contact pads, the metal should be the dominant diffusing species (DDS) in the solid state reaction between the metal and Si for the phase formed.  In the case of Ti and V, Si is actually the dominant diffusing species in the first phase formed, namely C49 or C54 TiSi2 and VSi2, and in this case the silicide is formed underneath the contact pad as opposed to along the SiNW itself.  For Pt and Pd, the metal is the DDS in the first phase formed, Pt2Si or Pd2Si, and axial silicide segments are formed.  However, in the case of Pt silicide formation, more severe annealing conditions cause a transformation to PtSi.  In PtSi, Si is the DDS and Kirkendall voids form as a result of the unequal fluxes of Pt and Si causing a break to form at the interface between the PtSi and SiNW.  In the case of Pd2Si formation, Pd2Si is the only phase that forms and the segment continues growth with increased annealing time and temperature; however, during silicidation of oxidized SiNWs Pd2Si reacts through the SiO2 shell surrounding the SiNW.  This situation would be problematic for forming structures in which the silicide contact is underneath a gate that must provide electrical isolation.  A short would form between the gate and silicide contact if a transistor were made.\nFortunately, Ni silicides also form axial metal contacts and in the Ni-Si system for every Ni silicide phase that forms Ni is the DDS.  We have also identified for the Ni-SiNW system that the orientation of the SiNW can determine the Ni silicide phase that forms.  In the case of annealing Ni contact pads to [112] SiNWs, the high-temperature metastable theta-Ni2Si phase forms and is thermally stable until annealing conditions of 700\u00b0C and higher.  At 700\u00b0C branches form as a compressive stress release mechanism and could result in electrical shorts to neighboring devices in high device density applications.  When annealing Ni contact pads on SiNWs with [111] growth directions, NiSi2 is the first phase to form and remains stable until temperatures in excess of 600\u00b0C where a transformation to NiSi occurs.  In addition to identifying differences in the Ni silicide phase formed for different growth direction SiNWs, we have also identified differences in the kinetics of Ni silicide formation for [112] and [111] SiNWs.  For [112] SiNWs, the formation of theta-Ni2Si is diffusion-limited with an activation energy of 1.45 \u00b1 0.07 eV/atom.  This activation energy is considerably lower than literature values of bulk lattice diffusion through Ni silicide compounds, and thus the diffusion mechanism is attributed to Ni diffusion along the Si/SiO2 interface.  For [111] SiNWs the formation of NiSi2 is interfacial reaction limited with an activation energy of 0.76 \u00b1 0.10 eV/atom.  Furthermore, for the formation of theta-Ni2Si axial contacts to oxidized SiNWs, it was found the Ni reacted with the core of the SiNW, leaving the SiO2 shell intact surrounding the theta-Ni2Si/SiNW interface.  The ability of the theta-Ni2Si contact to react only with the Si core is a requirement for implementation into wrap-around gate Schottky diodes.\nAfter identification of a suitable candidate, namely &#61553;-Ni2Si contacts to SiNWs, was identified these contacts were integrated into wrap-around gate Schottky diode structures.  Simulations by Karthik Sarpatwari showed that gating of the metal/semiconductor interface in full wrap-around gate Schottky contacts was an effective approach for extracting the true Schottky barrier height at the metal/semiconductor interface.  For our theta-Ni2Si contacts to n-type SiNWs we were able to identify the same linear relationship between the ideality factor (n) and effective Schottky barrier height (&#966;Beff) measured under different gate bias conditions.  By extrapolation of the linear &#966;Beff-n plot to n=1 the actual barrier height at the theta-Ni2Si/n-SiNW interface is identified, in this case 0.57 eV.  We measured Schottky barrier heights for SiNWs ranging in diameter from 60\u2013100 nm and found no significant (\u00b1 0.02 eV) deviation or trend with SiNW diameter.  A new fabrication procedure for producing smaller diameter (30 nm and less) is also discussed and issues with integration of smaller diameter SiNWs into these structures due to the reduction of SiO2 by the Al gate are mentioned.\nLastly, the formation of axial Ni germanide contacts to GeNWs was examined.  We found that axial Ni germanide segments begin forming after annealing at 300\u00b0C for 2 min and continue growing with increased time and temperature.  The Ni germanide phase is identified by matching of electron diffraction patterns to the Ni2In prototype structure.  A stoichiometry of Ni3Ge2 is assigned due to the lack of vacancy ordering observed in the electron diffraction patterns.  All other Ni germanide phases with the Ni2In prototype structure (B8 region of the phase diagram) have been reported previously to have some vacancy ordering with the exception of Ni3Ge2.  After annealing at temperatures in excess of 400\u00b0C, a break is formed in the Ni germanide segment near the Ni germanide/GeNW interface.  Plausible reasons for the break formation are discussed.  We find the break formation problem can be worked around and that longer Ni germanide segments with average lengths of 1.5 &#956;m can be formed after annealing at 400\u00b0C for 5 min.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4687], "author_name_tesi": "Dellas, Nicholas S", "last_name_ssi": "Dellas", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Zi Kui Liu", "Joan Marie Redwing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney, Dissertation Advisor", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Chair", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Member", "Zi Kui Liu, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["silicide", "Schottky barrier", "nanowire", "kinetics", "nickel"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "MODELLING THE STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF H-BOND NETWORKS AT OXIDE-WATER INTERFACES: FROM NEUTRON SPECTROSCOPY TO SUM FREQUENCY GENERATION", "id": "13937mjd1056", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13937", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis I review the structure and dynamics of H-bond networks at oxide-water interfaces.

Moving beyond the local VDOS, I then use a network description of the H-bond network and a ``residence'' definition of the H-bond to study how cations affect structural correlations of the H-bond network at the SiO<sub>2</sub>(110)-H<sub>2</sub>O interface.  I then introduce a non-local measure of the vibrational spectrum of an interface, Sum Frequency Generation (SFG), and review the theory behind this surface-specific nonlinear optical vibrational probe.

Research has shown that plant responses to herbivory can vary with the type and extent of feeding damage, secretions associated with herbivore feeding, and plant genotype.  This thesis research uses an economically important agricultural system and a closely related wild system to further explore how plant defenses are influenced by herbivore-associated traits and plant genetic variation.  Using tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum, we examined the role that caterpillar saliva and regurgitant play in mediating plant volatiles and in affecting plant quality for subsequent herbivores.  We found that caterpillar saliva has an inhibitory effect on plant volatile responses and that both saliva and regurgitant may be necessary to elicit a volatile response similar to that released in response to caterpillar feeding.  We also found that saliva- and regurgitant-induced plant responses affected subsequent herbivore distribution and ovipositional preferences, further highlighting the distinctive effects of these secretions on plant defensive responses.  We also examined plant responses to herbivores that employ different feeding habits and to simultaneous herbivory by these insects.  We found that the volatile response of plants to piercing-sucking thrips versus chewing caterpillars was qualitatively and quantitatively distinct.  In addition, two volatiles were released in greater amounts in response to simultaneous herbivory compared to caterpillar feeding alone.  Using horsenettle, Solanum carolinense, we examined the effects of genetic variation and inbreeding on plant volatile production and host-plant quality.  We found that inbreeding decreased total volatile production, increased host-plant quality, and decreased herbivore resistance.  These effects varied among maternal families, indicating genetic variation among these families for inbreeding depression.  We also demonstrate broad-sense heritable variation for volatile traits among these plants.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1058], "author_name_tesi": "Delphia, Casey Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Delphia", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Casey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Consuelo M De Moraes", "Gary Felton", "Mark C Mescher", "Andrew George Stephenson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Consuelo M De Moraes, Committee Chair", "Gary Felton, Committee Chair", "Mark C Mescher, Committee Member", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["inbreeding", "plant volatiles", "plant-insect interactions", "Nicotiana tabacum", "Solanum carolinense", "genetic variation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF MOWING PRACTICES AND DEW REMOVAL ON FUNGICIDE EFFICACY FOR DOLLAR SPOT CONTROL\n", "id": "11896", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6137", "abstract_tesi": "Dollar spot (Sclerotinia homoeocarpa F.T. Bennett) is a severe disease problem on creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) fairways in the northeastern United States.  Although dollar spot can be managed with fungicides, golf course managers attempt to limit fungicide use on fairways due to cost considerations and concerns over fungicide resistance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dew removal and mowing frequency on fungicide performance for dollar spot control.  In 2009 and 2010, a factorial experiment involving daily dew removal or no dew removal, mowing frequency (2, 4, and 6 d wk-1), and fungicides (chlorothalonil, propiconazole, and iprodione) was conducted on creeping bentgrass and annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) maintained as a golf course fairway.  Fungicides were applied once at the beginning of each test, and daily dew removal and mowing treatments were performed between 0700 and 0800 h.  Dollar spot was assessed by counting infection centers in each plot.  Area under the disease progress curve data showed that daily dew removal resulted in fewer dollar spot infection centers compared to not removing dew during late summer 2009 and 2010 for all mowing frequency and fungicide treatments.  As mowing frequency increased from 2 to 6 d wk-1, dollar spot decreased when both dew removal and no dew removal treatments were included in the data analyses.  However, when data analyses included only treatments in which dew was removed daily, differences in dollar spot incidence among mowing frequencies were not detected at P &#8804; 0.05 using Tukey\u2019s Honestly Significant Difference Test.  This finding suggests that the effect of mowing frequency on dollar spot suppression is related to dew removal.  Dew removal in iprodione-treated plots mowed 4 d wk-1 during late summer 2009 provided up to 10 additional days to reach a 15-infection-center plot-1 threshold level compared to iprodione plots in which dew was not removed.  Similar trends were noticed for propiconazole and chlorothalonil treatments at certain times during the test.  The number of days required for infection centers to reach the threshold varied with fungicide treatment, mowing frequency, and season.  Results of this study demonstrate that fungicide performance for dollar spot control can be extended when daily dew removal is employed, and in some cases, when mowing frequency is increased on dew-covered turf.  However, benefits of dew removal practices on fungicide performance can vary with weather conditions, fungicide, threshold level, and possibly other factors. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6130], "author_name_tesi": "Delvalle, Tanner Clinton", "last_name_ssi": "Delvalle", "middle_name_ssi": "Clinton", "first_name_ssi": "Tanner", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Landschoot", "Peter Landschoot"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Landschoot, Thesis Advisor", "Peter Landschoot, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fungicides", "Dew Removal", "Mowing", "Cultural Practices", "Dollar Spot", "Efficacy", "Golf", "Disease"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A record of coupled hlllslope and channel response to Pleistocene periglacial erosion in a sandstone headwater valley, central Pennsylvania", "id": "14555jzd5570", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14555", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Outside of the Last Glacial Maximum ice extent, landscapes in the central Valley and Ridge physiographic province of Appalachia preserve soils and thick colluvial deposits indicating extensive periglacial landscape modification. The preservation of periglacial landforms in the present interglacial suggests active hillslope sediment transport in cold climates followed by limited modification in the Holocene. However, the timing and extent of these processes are poorly constrained, and it is unclear whether, and how much, this signature is due to LGM or older periglaciations. Here, we pair geomorphic mapping with in situ cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al measurements of surface material and buried clasts to estimate the residence time and depositional history of colluvium within Garner Run, a 1 km2 sandstone headwater valley in central Appalachia containing relict Pleistocene periglacial features including solifluction lobes, boulder fields, and thick colluvial footslope deposits. 10Be concentrations of stream sediment and hillslope regolith indicate slow erosion rates (6.3 m \u00b1 0.5 m m.y.-1) over the past 38-140 kyr. From dating of buried valley-bottom deposits recovered from a 9 m drill core, we interpret two depositional pulses since ~290 ka, a record which spans at least three glacial terminations and implies limited removal of valley bottom deposits during interglacials. This age is consistent with independent calculations determined from debris volume estimates, total hillslope contributing area, and catchment erosion rate integrated over multiple climate cycles. Thus, we infer that erosion rates measured in upland basins in Central Appalachia reflect the integration both temperate and periglacial processes, and that in cold-warm transitions, erosion rates reflect only moderate departures from otherwise slow background rates. Furthermore, due to slow erosion rates, we show that sedimentary records in sandstone headwater valleys present opportunities for direct examination of climate-modulated hillslope processes.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15556], "author_name_tesi": "Delvecchio, Joanmarie ", "last_name_ssi": "Delvecchio", "first_name_ssi": "Joanmarie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roman A.

Although banned in the United States in the late 1970s, PCBs are persistent in the environment due to their propensity to bioaccumulate, thus remaining a threat to environmental and human health. Even though PCBs have been extensively studied over the past several decades, there remains uncertainty regarding the dynamics of specific PCB congeners in aquatic organisms. Much of this uncertainty stems from earlier studies relying on measures of total PCBs to assess health effects instead of evaluating individual congener dynamics. To reduce this uncertainty, I performed an experiment to examine the effects of food deprivation on congener dynamics and immune function in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). I exposed channel catfish to PCBs using a short-term dietary exposure until fish attained an approximate 5 ppm body burden. The PCB exposure period was followed by a 7 week food deprivation period. Total PCB (TPCB), homolog groups, and congener concentrations were quantified in whole body, fillet and liver tissue prior to the PCB exposure period and 4, and 7 weeks post-PCB exposure. Numerous biomarkers of immune function were assessed at these time points. \nResults from this research revealed that TPCB concentrations in fillet and whole body tissue decreased over the duration of the post-PCB exposure period and the rate of depuration was slightly less in fish that were food deprived. Further, whole body TPCB concentrations continued to decrease in both fed and food deprived fish after 4 weeks post-PCB exposure, whereas concentrations in fillet tissue remained stable from 4 weeks post-exposure to 7 weeks post-exposure. Results from the homolog analyses revealed similar patterns when compared to TPCB and provided evidence that PCB homolog groups did not appear to depurate from liver, fillet, or whole body tissues differentially after 7 weeks post-PCB exposure. Analysis of individual congeners over time also revealed little, to no, congener-specific activity in liver, fillet, or whole body tissues. \nFish health assays showed that the environmentally relevant concentration of PCBs did affect mechanisms of innate immune function, specifically bactericidal activity, and affected the fish\u2019s ability to respond chemically (i.e. cortisol production) to the presence of stress (i.e. food deprivation). Results from this study suggested that food deprivation had a large effect on the immune function of channel catfish, with PCB-exposed fish demonstrating a slight decrease in immune function immediately post PCB exposure. Further, PCB exposed fish showed an increase in innate immune function after being fed clean feed and control fish (i.e., not PCB exposure) that were deprived of food showed an appreciable decline in immune function. The bactericidal activity assay revealed the most definitive negative response to PCB exposure and could potentially be a more sensitive indicator of immune health compared to the other assays examined. Further, bactericidal activity also responded more definitively in response to the treatment of feed deprivation. \nResults from this research confirm that PCBs alone are indeed modulators of the immune and endocrine system in two-year old (sub-adult/adult) channel catfish and depurate non-preferentially from tissues at a slow rate directly after removal of exposure to the toxicant. This research further suggests that food deprivation is not an effective method to utilize when attempting to increase rates of PCB depuration in channel catfish, and may actually further enhance the toxicity by decreasing immune function. Management agencies should continue to monitor PCB concentrations in aquatic systems and consider PCB exposure as a potential factor influencing the overall health of a fishery. Furthermore, because channel catfish are well researched, have a relatively long lifespan, occupy the food chain as a benthic oriented predator, depurate PCBs (and potentially other organochlorines) slowly, and are non-migratory by nature, they could prove to be a valuable species for fisheries managers to utilize in long-term assessments of ecosystem health. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8272], "author_name_tesi": "Demario, Devin Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Demario", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Devin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tyler Wagner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tyler Wagner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["catfish", "fisheries", "polychlorinated biphenyls", "toxicology", "fish", "contaminants", "environmental contaminant", "environmental toxicant", "bayesian analysis", "fish health", "innate immune function"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Talk Aloud Problem Solving: Exploration of Acquisition and Frequency Building in Science Text ", "id": "19879", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9398", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Discovering new ways to help students attain higher levels of scientific knowledge and to think critically is a national goal (Educate to Innovate campaign).

Organizational learning is increasingly being viewed as a means for long-term success however, there is little empirical evidence to support this view. This research was conducted to address this gap. The research was conducted in the U.S. and involved public pharmaceutical companies within one particular code in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. The study explored the relationship between a firm\u2019s implementation of learning organization dimensions or characteristics and financial performance. \nThe specific research hypotheses were: \n1. Firms that demonstrate above-average financial performance possess the seven dimensions of a learning organization to a greater extent than firms that demonstrate below-average financial performance.\n2. Firms that demonstrate above average improvement in financial performance possess the seven dimensions of a learning organization to a greater extent than firms that demonstrate below-average improvement in financial performance.\nThe independent variable was the \u2018learning organization and the dependent variable was \u2018organizational performance\u2019. Both of these are latent variables measured by indicator variables. The indicator variables for \u2018learning organization\u2019 are the seven dimensions of a learning organization, as defined by Marsick and Watskins (2003).  These are: (a) create continuous learning opportunities; (b) promote inquiry and dialogue; (c) encourage collaboration and team learning; (d) provide strategic leadership for learning; (e) empower people toward a collective vision; (f) connect the organization to its environment; and (g) create systems to capture and share learning. Financial performance was measured using two profitability ratios (i.e. return on assets and return on sales); these ratios relate profit to some aspect of management performance such as using assets profitably, creating a return on owner\u2019s investment and generating a profit on sales. Return on assets is calculated as net income divided by total assets and return on sales is calculated as net income divided by sales. \nFinancial data for these two ratios were collected over an eleven year period, from 1995 to 2005. To evaluate the first hypothesis, the firms that were in the first quartile for \u2018overall average\u2019 for both ROA and ROS were compared to firms that were in the fourth quartile for \u2018overall average\u2019 for both ROA and ROS.

The objective of this dissertation was to research the evolution and ecology of the interactions between plants and F. oxysporum isolates pathogenic and nonpathogenic to a given host.  We concentrated on chickpea as a model system.  Specifically, the diversity and phylogenetic relationships within and between F. oxysporum f. sp. ciceris, the causal agent of Fusarium wilt of chickpea, and F. oxysporum endophytes of chickpea were assessed.  Furthermore, the interactions of endophytic F. oxysporum and their host plants were studied under controlled and field conditions.  In a search for polymorphic sequences to address the evolutionary relationships between pathogenic races of F. oxysporum f. sp. ciceris, 33 genetic markers were screened, including 10 microsatellite loci.  Twenty-two of these markers were completely identical, showing that there is a limited degree of diversity in F. oxysporum f. sp. ciceris and confirming its monophyletic origin.  Additional phylogenetic analysis of the 10 microsatellite markers across F. oxysporum revealed that the majority of the loci are evolving according to a stepwise mutational model and that point mutations are accumulating within the core repeat region, leading to the degradation of the microsatellite.  No evidence was found that recombination is acting as a mutational force in these microsatellites, consistent with the hypothesis that clonality is the predominant mode of reproduction in F. oxysporum.  Phylogenetic analysis of 74 F. oxysporum endophytes isolated from chickpea from various chickpea-growing regions of the world revealed that these endophytes are not related to the pathogenic F. oxysporum f. sp. ciceris and that the majority of the endophytes belonged to three lineages within the F. oxysporum phylogeny.  These lineages contained isolates from distant geographic locations, suggesting that genotypes in these lineages may be preferentially found as chickpea endophytes in many chickpea-growing areas.  Therefore, endophytes within these lineages may be host-adapted to chickpea.  The growth patterns in planta of 38 of these chickpea endophytes were compared to 20 other F. oxysporum isolates from different hosts by inoculating chickpea plants under controlled conditions.  All F. oxysporum were able to colonize the roots and crown of chickpea plants, and many were able to colonize the stem and seeds of the plant.  Many of the isolates recovered from the stem and seeds were different from the inoculated genotype, suggesting that aerial spread of the fungus may have occurred, and confounding the detection of differences in colonization between isolates from chickpea-endophyte lineages and isolates from other lineages.  The degree of niche specialization of nonpathogenic F. oxysporum under field conditions was studied by comparing populations of F. oxysporum associated with asymptomatic tomato plants.  Over 600 isolates of both endophytic and soil populations were collected from two nearby fields in Pennsylvania.  Populations were highly diverse, and significant genetic differentiation was observed between the fields and between some of the soil and plant populations, with different tomato cultivars harbored significantly genetically differentiated endophytic populations.  Two genotypes composed the majority of the population, suggesting that these genotypes may preferentially associate with tomato, similar to host-adapted endophytes from chickpea.

Moreover, with technological asymmetries, the more productive country gains significantly more from falling trade costs than does the backward one.\n \nCHAPTER 2 (with Hiau Looi Kee and Kala Krishna): Do Trade Policy Differences Induce Sorting? Theory and Evidence from Bangladeshi Apparel Exporters. \nThis essay provides new testable predictions of heterogeneous firm (HF) models for trade. Variations in trade policy, trade preferences, and the rules of origin (ROOs) needed to obtain them are incorporated into the model and some analytical means of dealing with the resulting asymmetries are developed. The policy differences modeled correspond to differences across products and destination markets for Bangladeshi garment exports to the US and EU which turns out to provide an interesting natural experiment. Predictions of the model for the distributions of TFP of various groups of firms are tested non-parametrically and are supported by the data. \n\nCHAPTER 3 (with Andres Rodriguez-Clare): Export Subsidies, Productivity and Welfare under Firm-Level Heterogeneity. \nIn this essay the monopolistic competition setting with heterogeneous firms is used to study the effect of an export subsidy on productivity and welfare of a small economy with a first best consumer subsidy already in place, which neutralizes the domestic distortion caused by the mark-up. It is shown that even though the export subsidy induces productivity growth in the economy, its effect on welfare is negative due to increasing input prices and falling variety. \n\nCHAPTER 4 (with Kala Krishna): Trade and Trade Policy with Differentiated Products: A Chamberlinian-Ricardian Model: A Comment. \nThis essay shows that the results of Venables (1987) strongly depend on the assumption that there are no fixed costs of trade. The introduction of fixed costs of exporting, while making the model more consistent with the empirical evidence, leads to the opposite conclusion that technological progress in one country cannot harm the welfare of its trading partner. However, the results can be obtained in a richer setting with heterogeneous firms. \n\nCHAPTER 5 (with Kala Krishna): Regulations, Regime Switches and Non-Monotonicity when Non-Compliance is an Option: An Application to Content Protection and Preference: A Comment. \nThis essay shows that the result of Ju and Krishna (2002), i.e., the non-monotonicity in the comparative statics across regimes, disappears, if exporters differ in their productivities. Taking into account firm heterogeneity not only makes the model more consistent with the empirical data, but also provides very different predictions about the results of policy changes.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5463], "author_name_tesi": "Demidova, Svetlana Alexandrovna", "last_name_ssi": "Demidova", "middle_name_ssi": "Alexandrovna", "first_name_ssi": "Svetlana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kala Krishna", "Bee Yan Roberts", "Andres Rodriguez Clare", "James R.

We find that an organic equivalency arrangement between the E.U. and the U.S. increases organic exports to the E.U. by 57.6% each year.\nIn Chapter 2, we use the synthetic control method to investigate the impact of the 2012 bilateral organic equivalency arrangement between the European Union and the United States, the two largest organic markets in the world. Employing the newly available USDA Global Agricultural Trade System (GATS) data on organic trade, we collectively analyze 23 products of U.S. organic exports, representing fresh produce, coffee, and tomato sauce, at the quarterly level during the 2011-2014 period.

Despite the control measures adopted by the commercial layer industry to minimize SE contamination of layer flocks and shell eggs, egg-associated foodborne illness continues to occur. Overall aim of this thesis was to improve existing Egg Quality Assurance Programs (EQAPs) in order to further reduce SE contamination of commercial layer flocks and shell eggs. First, an epidemiological analysis of SE isolated from layer house environment and shell eggs of layer flocks on Pennsylvania participated in the Pennsylvania Egg Quality Assurance Program and Egg Rule of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during 2007 to 2014 was carried out. Phage typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns demonstrated that the SE phage type (PT8) and on the PFGE) fingerprint pattern (JEGX01.0004) most commonly associated with human SE infection are also the predominant types present in the SE isolated from layer house environment, shell eggs, rodents, and beetles. This highlights the importance of monitoring the layer house environment to identify flocks producing SE infected shell eggs and to minimize SE contamination of shell eggs and egg-associated human SE infection. More than 50% of SE-positive hen house drag swabs examined in the study were collected around 30 weeks of age suggesting that inclusion of environmental testing in EQAPs at a flock age of 30 weeks to identify contaminated flocks producing shell eggs is highly desirable. \nSecond, a systematic review was carried out to identify the potential risk factors for SE contamination of layer flocks and shell eggs. Best evidence synthesis of observational studies demonstrated multiple risk factors, with strong to moderate evidence of association with SE contamination of layer hen house  environment (previous Salmonella infection, inadequate cleaning and disinfection between flocks, presence of rodents, induced molting, flock sizes over 30,000 hens, multi-age flocks on the premise, cage housing systems, in-line egg processing, rearing pullets on the floor, pests having access to feed, visitors to the layer houses and trucks near farms, and air inlets) and shell eggs (high level of manure contamination, middle and late phase of production, high degree of egg handling equipment contamination, flock sizes over 30,000 hens, and egg production rate of more than 96%).  Dust sample testing increased the odds of detecting SE in layer flocks raised in cage houses. Overall, this study refined the existing body of knowledge about targeted intervention strategies to control SE contamination of layer hen flocks and shell eggs and provided scientific evidence to optimize existing EQAPs. \nFinally, a longitudinal study was carried out for the purpose of monitoring the presence of SE in layer environment and eggs. This study was conducted for two consecutive flock cycles in two major egg producing states; Iowa and Pennsylvania, before and after introducing EQAP practices. The proportion of flocks with an SE-positive hen house environment during flock cycle two (after implementing EQAP practices) was significantly less than the flock cycle one (after implementing EQAP practices) demonstrating EQAP practices were effective in reducing SE contamination of layer flocks. The most common PFGE pattern identified was JEGX01.0004 and PT8 in laying hen environments re-emphasizing the importance of implementing EQAP practices in layer flocks to minimize shell egg contamination of SE which in turn is expected to reduce human SE infection.   \nIn summary, the findings of this thesis recommend that the mandatory FDA Egg Rule has to be improved by including hen house environmental sampling time point at 30-weeks of age to increase the probability of detecting SE-contaminated layer flocks early in the production cycle. Farm specific EQAP practices will mitigate SE contamination of layer flocks and shell eggs in different layer production systems thereby reducing the public health burden of egg-associated SE infection in humans. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11715], "author_name_tesi": "Denagamage, Thomas Nishantha", "last_name_ssi": "Denagamage", "middle_name_ssi": "Nishantha", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao", "Bhushan M Jayarao", "Edward G Dudley", "Girish Soorappa Kirimanjeswara", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao, Dissertation Advisor", "Bhushan M Jayarao, Committee Chair", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Member", "Girish Soorappa Kirimanjeswara, Committee Member", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Foodborne", "EQAP", "Epidemiology", "Phage typing", "Poultry", "PFGE", "Risk factors", "Salmonella Enteritidis", "Shell eggs", "Systematic review"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Self-Perceived Competence with Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Clients: A Qualitative Study with Heterosexual Early Career Psychologists and Advanced Trainees\n\n", "id": "11508", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "185", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The field of psychology is generally\u2014though not uniformly\u2014LGB-affirmative. Yet many trainees enter doctoral programs with LGB-negative beliefs based on strong religious convictions and/or cultural traditions. This study used the qualitative research methodology of grounded theory (Glaser, 1992) to explore the doctoral LGB-training experiences of 29 heterosexual early-career psychologists and advanced psychology trainees who did not hold LGB-affirmative views upon entering their graduate programs. Some participants had developed LGB-affirmative values while in their programs and some had not, but all considered themselves currently competent to work with LGB clients. The goal of this research was to develop a substantive theory of how our participants engaged with LGB training in their programs, and how they believed they gained competence with LGB clients.\n\nThe core category that emerged in our study was Dissonance. When participants entered doctoral training, they experienced cognitive dissonance provoked by the differences between their own LGB beliefs and those of others. Participants adopted distinct strategies to reduce their dissonance and adapt to their programs: Assimilation, Separation, and Integration. Participants who used the Assimilation strategy typically rapidly adopted LGB-affirmative beliefs. Conversely, participants who used the Separation strategy held to their own LGB-negative beliefs and dismissed the affirmative values of psychology and people in their programs. Participants who used the Integration strategy, however, were continually engaged in a process of examining their own values and attempting to resolve their dissonance, which was the most successful strategy for developing competence with LGB clients.\n\nParticipants said that exposure to and positive, meaningful contact with LGB people allowed them to develop increasing comfort with and empathy for LGB people, which participants cited as the most important factors for increasing their competence with LGB clients. Frequently cited barriers to LGB competence were discomfort, anxiety and avoidance of LGB material, particularly LGB relationships and sexuality and LGB clients\u2019 own conflicts regarding religion and sexual orientation. Participants without LGB-affirmative values particularly struggled with these issues, and evaluated themselves as less competent when confronted with them. However, some non-affirmative participants used their religious beliefs to connect with their LGB clients\u2019 humanity and to develop empathy for them, thereby increasing their competence.\nWe found that conservatively religious participants felt unwelcome in secular programs, and believed their religious identities were stigmatized. They did not discuss their religious and LGB values with faculty for fear of negative evaluation. Some participants did discuss their values conflicts in clinical supervision, which they cited as the most helpful aspect of their LGB training.  \n\nLGB training must addresses LGB awareness, knowledge, and skills. In addition, programs must attend more to assisting trainees in resolving conflicts between their personal LGB values and their professional roles with LGB clients. We agree with the position of the Counseling Psychology Model Training Values Statement Addressing Diversity (CCPTP, ACCTA, & SCP, 2009), which stated that training programs cannot mandate trainees\u2019 beliefs, but can require trainees to learn to provide competent services to minority populations. Our participants\u2019 experiences made clear that resolving values conflicts is an essential task in developing competence in working with LGB clients.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [184], "author_name_tesi": "Dendy, Anna Katherine", "last_name_ssi": "Dendy", "middle_name_ssi": "Katherine", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counseling Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Bieschke", "Kathleen Bieschke", "Joyce Karen Illfelder Kaye", "Keith B Wilson", "Theresa K Vescio"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Bieschke, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathleen Bieschke, Committee Chair", "Joyce Karen Illfelder Kaye, Committee Member", "Keith B Wilson, Committee Member", "Theresa K Vescio, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gay", "bisexual", "LGB clients", "counseling competence", "lesbian", "psychotherapy competence", "grounded theory", "qualitative study"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Ocean environmental effects on walrus communication", "id": "23481", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10164", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work aimed to develop source characteristics and transmission effects for the acoustic breeding displays of male Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens).  Pacific walrus breeding activities occur in late winter in the Bering Sea, an area renowned for extreme weather conditions and high biological productivity.  During the breeding season, males perform acoustic displays while swimming in the vicinity of females hauled out on ice.    Underwater vocalizations heard by individuals hauled out on ice may be important in the mate selection process.  The extreme environment in which walrus breeding activities occur precludes direct observation of these animals during this important period and has resulted in a lack of data. A combination of remote-sensing data, captive animal research, controlled environment experiment, and computational modeling was used to increase our understanding of the acoustic displays of Pacific walrus.\nAnalysis of recordings of captive and wild male Pacific walrus vocalizations during breeding season provided quantification of source characteristics.  Working with a captive animal provided the ability to make direct observations of a male producing breeding vocalizations and the direct calculation of source level.  The mean peak to peak source level of the impulsive knocks produced by the captive male was 183 dB (re: 1 \u00b5Pa) with the middle 95% of the knocks between 168 dB and 195 dB.  The broadband knock signals contained significant acoustic energy up to 13 kHz.  To estimate source level from wild vocalizations, the location of the source walrus first needed to be determined.  Using a method of relative multipath arrival time, more than 37,000 knocks were localized from six years of data from autonomous recorders deployed in the Bering Sea.  The mean peak-peak source level from the wild recordings was 177 dB (re: 1 \u00b5Pa) with 95% of the knocks between 163 dB and 189 dB.  For both wild and captive vocalizations, a significant relationship between ambient noise level and source level was identified.  The Lombard effect, the increase in source level in response to an increase in noise level has not previously been identified in any pinniped species.  In both datasets, an increase of approximately 5 dB in source level was found for an increase in 10 dB of noise level.   \nA propagation experiment was conducted to measure the transmission of an impulsive acoustic signal, similar to a walrus knock, from an underwater source through ice and into air.  Peak to peak pressure measured in air was approximately 2,500 times lower than pressure measured in water separated by two meters of shorefast ice.  The results from this experiment were used to verify the adequacy of a wavenumber integration acoustic propagation model for determining transmission loss in this multi-media environment.  Propagation model environments were generated from historical ice thickness and oceanographic data.  Modeled received signals were compared with walrus audiometric data to determine what factors impact signal detectability with source level, ice thickness, and range having the greatest impact.  \nThe findings of this work suggest that the underwater vocalizations of males making breeding vocalizations are received by females hauled out on ice at audible levels when the females are within a few hundred meters of the males.  As the signals exceed the levels estimated to be perceived, these signals may play a role in mate selection by the females.  If climate change affects the ice conditions, water depth, and bathymetry where walrus congregate for breeding, mate selection and therefore offspring fitness may be impacted.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9853], "author_name_tesi": "Denes, Samuel Leon", "last_name_ssi": "Denes", "middle_name_ssi": "Leon", "first_name_ssi": "Samuel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer L Miksis Olds", "Charles Holland", "Thomas B Gabrielson", "Timothy Joseph Kane", "Susan Parks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer L Miksis Olds, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles Holland, Committee Member", "Thomas B Gabrielson, Committee Member", "Timothy Joseph Kane, Committee Member", "Susan Parks, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Walrus vocalizations", "marginal ice zone", "acoustic", "propagation"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "EXCESS FOUNDRY SAND CHARACTERIZATION AND EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION IN CONTROLLED LOW-STRENGTH MATERIAL\n\n\n", "id": "6295", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "408", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this dissertation is to provide support with technical data for the reuse of excess foundry sand.

The implementa- tion of both MD/QCT and TCE chemistry reaction models in DSMC is studied in a 0-D time dependent analysis and 2-D axisymmetric DSMC simulations. The MD/QCT simulations were found to result in lower reaction rate constants and reaction probabilities than the TCE model and the vibrational favoring feature of the SO2 + O -> SO + 2O reaction was revealed. A 2-D DSMC simulation of an approximate planetary flow consisting of a plume-counter flow between planetary outgassing sulfur dioxide and high energy free stream oxygen was performed. The flow conditions are such that the reference values used in obtaining the total VHS cross section are inadequate to describe the total collisional cross section. Therefore the total cross section using the more general viscosity cross section was obtained through the MD/QCT simulations and was found to have a significantly differ- ent energy dependence compared to the original VHS cross section. For the 2-D DSMC simulations it was found that the structure of the flow as well as the chem- ically formed sulfur oxide were different for the MD/QCT and the TCE reaction probabilities and total cross sections.

However their low fracture toughnesses have limited their widespread use as structural materials. Directionally solidified LaB6-ZrB2 eutectics are attractive new ceramic candidates of ultra-high temperature materials because of their supreme high melting temperature (2442\u00a1\u00e3C), high micro-hardness (22.6~29.5 GPa), and high bend strength (up to 1320 MPa). Especially, LaB6-ZrB2 DSEs have a higher fracture toughness (>11.0 MPa* m1/2) than most oxide DSEs (<8.0 MPa* m1/2). In this thesis, LaB6-ZrB2 DSEs were investigated to understand the high fracture toughness from the aspect of the heterophase interface.  \n Interfaces in LaB6-ZrB2 DSEs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and modeled by geometric models such as near coincidence site lattice (NCSL), displacement shift complete (DSC) lattice, and secondary original lattice (O2-lattice) models. The nominal crystallographic orientation relationship between the constituent phases and the interface facet corresponded to high translational symmetry. Interfacial misfit dislocations were observed on the major facet and indicated those interfaces were fully relaxed. These analyses indicated that interfaces were relaxed to relatively low-energy configurations. Thermal residual stresses resulted from the good bonded interface and the thermal expansion mismatch between LaB6 and ZrB2, were measured and modeled by X-ray diffraction techniques (XRD) and finite element method (FEM). The experimental and modeling results show considerable tensile stresses in the ZrB2 fibers and compressive stresses in the LaB6 matrix. In fibers, the radial stress is approximately 1.5 times the axial component. No evidence was found that the sample growth rate has large effect on residual stresses within the range 1.5mm/min to 6.0mm/min. lastly, qualitative assessments of the interface structure and thermal residual stress effects on the interfacial debonding were made at the end of this work.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2248], "author_name_tesi": "Deng, Hongqi ", "last_name_ssi": "Deng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hongqi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth C Dickey", "John Richard Hellmann Jr.", "Christopher L Muhlstein", "Judith Todd Copley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Chair", "John Richard Hellmann Jr., Committee Member", "Christopher L Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Judith Todd Copley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["directionally solidified eutectic", "interface"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A model for simulating the compression stiffness degradation in circular elastomeric bearings due to fatigue ", "id": "18820", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8848", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Elastomeric bearings are widely used in bridge and building construction but sustain fatigue damage when subjected to repeated cycles of loading.

Due to the limited experimental data, the influence of a number of bearing design parameters, such as geometry, material, and loading on the fatigue behavior are not well understood. As such, it would be of great benefit to have analytical models that are capable of simulating the fatigue behavior so that a broader understanding of how the various design parameters influences the fatigue behavior.\nIn this study, an analytical model was developed using an analytical framework to simulate compression stiffness degradation due to cycles of compressive loading in axially loaded solid circular multi-layer laminated rubber bearings. The model is used to perform a parametric study to identify the influence that maximum load and shape factor have on the stiffness degradation and fatigue life of the bearing. A global variance based sensitivity analysis is performed using the analytical model to identify the relative importance of a number of model factors, e.g. stress range, shape factor, material properties, to which fatigue life and stiffness degradation are most sensitive. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8694], "author_name_tesi": "Deng, Pu ", "last_name_ssi": "Deng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pu", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gordon Patrick Warn", "Maria Lopez De Murphy", "Charles E Bakis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gordon Patrick Warn, Thesis Advisor", "Maria Lopez De Murphy, Thesis Advisor", "Charles E Bakis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["elastomeric bearing", "fatigue", "compression stiffness", "simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "NETWORK QUEUE MANAGEMENT AND CONGESTION CONTROL IN INTERNET AND WIRELESS NETWORKS", "id": "6306", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6666", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ever growing users demand has made network congestion a critical problem in today's Internet.

This dissertation studies several related research issues. First, we compare the performance of various Active Queue Management (AQM) schemes in providing QoS guarantees from a network-centric standpoint such as link throughput or router queue length. We propose a new AQM scheme, called Stabilized Virtual Buffer (SVB), that provides better performance and stability under a wide range of traffic and network conditions. To have a better understanding of the behavior of the AQM schemes, we then investigate the interaction between an AQM scheme and the end-system congestion control mechanism using a control-theoretic approach, and develop a generalized framework for analyzing various AQM schemes. Based on this model, we propose a generic implementation of AQM schemes as proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. We also propose an adaptive controller mechanism to improve the system stability under changing network conditions. Next, we study how the AQM schemes behave in providing QoS assurance from a network user's perspective.

In particular, we investigate: (1) Using AQM schemes in Wireless LANS for facilitating the QoS provisioning and providing fairness for traffic flows traversing between wired and wireless domains; (2) Network flow control mechanisms that interacts with the 802.11 MAC protocol for enhancing fairness in wireless ad-hoc networks; and (3) Reliable and Energy-efficient data transport for congestion control and avoidance in wireless sensor networks.

PTAs act to detect gravitational waves generated from very \ndistant sources by observing the small and correlated\neffect the waves have on pulse arrival times at the Earth. In this thesis, I present advanced Bayesian analysis methods that \ncan be used to search for gravitational waves in pulsar timing data. These methods were also applied to analyze a set of radial velocity (RV) data collected by \nthe Hobby-Eberly Telescope on observing a K0 giant star. They confirmed the presence of two Jupiter mass planets around a K0 \ngiant star and also characterized the stellar p-mode oscillation. \n\nThe first part of the thesis investigates the effect of wavefront curvature on a pulsar's response to a gravitational \nwave. In it we show that we can assume the gravitational wave phasefront is planar across the array only if the \nsource luminosity distance $\\gg 2\\pi L^2/\\lambda$, where $L$ is the pulsar distance to the Earth ($\\sim$ kpc) and \n$\\lambda$ is the radiation wavelength ($\\sim$ pc) in the PTA waveband. Correspondingly, for a point gravitational wave source \ncloser than $\\sim 100$ Mpc, we should take into account the effect of wavefront curvature across the pulsar-Earth line of sight, \nwhich depends on the luminosity distance to the source, when evaluating the pulsar timing response. As a consequence, if a PTA can detect a gravitational wave \nfrom a source closer than $\\sim 100$ Mpc, the effects of wavefront curvature on the response allows us to determine the source \nluminosity distance. This technique is very similar to the use of pulsar timing parallax to measure the distances to nearby \npulsars, because they both try to measure the phasefront curvature of a wave passing through a long baseline \n(pulsar-Earth distance and Sun-Earth distance) to determine the wave source distance. \n\nThe second and third parts of the thesis propose a new analysis method based on Bayesian nonparametric regression to search for gravitational\nwave bursts and a gravitational wave background in PTA data. Unlike the conventional Bayesian analysis \nthat introduces a signal model with a fixed number of parameters, Bayesian nonparametric regression  \nsets constraints on the {\\it function space} that may be reasonably thought to characterize the range of gravitational wave signals. \nFor example, focus attention on the detection of a gravitational wave burst, by which we mean a signal that begins and ends \nover the course of an observational epoch. The burst may result from a source that we know how to model - e.g., a near-unity \nmass ratio black hole binary system - or it may be the result of a process, which we have not imagined and, so, have no model \nfor. Similarly, a gravitational wave background resulting from a superposition of a number of weak sources may be difficult to \ncharacterize if the number of weak sources is sufficiently large that none can be individually resolved, but not so large that \ntheir superposition leads to a reasonably Gaussian distribution. Correspondingly, the Bayesian \nnonparametric regression method may be very useful to help search for gravitational wave bursts and a gravitational wave \nbackground in the pulsar timing data. By testing this new method on simulated data sets, it is found that we can use it to detect \ngravitational wave bursts and a gravitational wave background, and we can also characterize their important physical parameters \nsuch as the burst durations and the amplitude of the background even if their signal-to-noise ratios are low. \n\nThe fourth part develops Bayesian analysis methods that can be used to detect gravitational waves \ngenerated from circular-orbit supermassive black hole binaries with a pulsar timing array. PTA response to such gravitational \nwaves can be modeled as the difference between two sinusoidal terms --- the one with a coherent phase among different pulsars called \n``Earth term'' and the other one with incoherent phases among different pulsars called ``pulsar term''. For gravitational waves \nfrom slowly evolving binaries, the two terms in the PTA response model have the same frequency. Previous methods aimed at detecting gravitational waves from circular-orbit binaries ignored pulsar terms in data analysis since those terms were considered to be negligible when \naveraging over all the pulsars. However, it is found that we can incorporate the contributions of pulsar terms into data analysis \nin the case of slowly evolving binaries by treating the incoherent phases in pulsar terms as unknown parameters to be marginalized. \nBy testing \nthe new method on simulated data sets, the improvement, compared to previous analyses, is equivalent to halving the strength \nof timing noise associated with each pulsar. \n\nThe final part of this thesis applies Bayesian analysis to search for the evidence of a planetary system around the K0 giant star HD 102103 \ndetected by the Penn State-Torun planet group at the Hobby Eberly Telescope. It analyzes 116 observations of the star's radial \nvelocity. However, the stellar p-mode oscillation also contributes\nto the radial velocity data, challenging the search for the planets around the star. The Bayesian method \nmodels the stellar oscillation effect and the potential exoplanet signal together, simultaneously inferring their parameters \nfrom the data. Consequently, the method removes the ambiguities of the presence \nof two Jupiter mass planets around the K0 giant and as a bonus, it also characterizes the strength and the frequency of the \nstellar oscillation.

The mechanisms that regulate these crucial processes provide insight into diseases, such as cancer. The Hippo (Hpo) signaling regulates cell number mainly by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell apoptosis, and this signaling is highly conserved from Drosophila to mammals. Hpo is the key kinase of Hpo signaling; however, the way in which Hpo kinase activity is regulated remains less understood. In this project, I investigated how Hpo kinase is activated and regulated by upstream molecules both in vivo and in vitro. I found that Hpo dimerization could facilitate its activation by auto-phosphorylation. Moreover, membrane association appears to increase Hpo dimerization efficiency, and upstream molecules Expanded/Merlin/Kibra promote Hpo membrane association. Therefore, both dimerization and membrane association are critical for Hpo kinase to be activated. This mechanism provides essential insight to reveal the mystery that how upstream molecules transduce signal to Hpo signaling. \nIn another project, I investigated Yap1 (a major downstream effector of mammalian Hpo signaling) activity regulation in mammalian pancreatic beta \u03b2-cells under free fatty acids (FFAs) treatment. Mammalian pancreatic \u03b2-cells are responsible for the production of insulin and therefore play a pivotal role in development and glucose homeostasis. Among many factors, high concentrations of saturated free fatty acids (FFAs) such as palmitate are known to have a negative effect on \u03b2-cell viability, which might induce type 2 diabetes. In this study, I demonstrated that Hpo signaling effector Yap1 plays a crucial role in regulating \u03b2-cell survival under FFA treatment. I found that Yap1 is activated through F-actin accumulation in a time-delayed manner to enhance \u03b2-cells viability during palmitate-induced apoptosis. Moreover, Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), one of the downstream targets of Yap1, was identified to repress palmitate-induced \u03b2-cell apoptosis. These discoveries support a model in which Yap1 could positively regulate \u03b2-cell survival under FFA treatment, and this model might lead to the development of new strategies for potential treatment of diabetes.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9902], "author_name_tesi": "Deng, Yaoting ", "last_name_ssi": "Deng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yaoting", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhi Chun Lai", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Melissa Rolls", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Richard W Ordway", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Yanming Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhi Chun Lai, Dissertation Advisor", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Chair", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Yanming Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hippo pathway", "Hippo", "transphosphorylation", "dimerization", "Merlin", "Expanded", "Kibra", "FFA", "\u03b2-cells", "Yap", "F-actin", "apoptosis"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Determinants of Shadow Education in Math: A Comparative Study of Hong Kong and Shanghai", "id": "19654", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9452", "abstract_tesi": "        Driven by the purpose of improving student academic performance, shadow education, also known as outside-school learning or private supplementary tutoring, has been a growing educational phenomenon all over the world.

Then, this paper investigates the determinants of shadow education in Hong Kong and Shanghai by using the data from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009. The results of the logistic regression analysis show that in Hong Kong, having higher family socioeconomic status (SES), higher student grade level, more positive attitude towards school, taking more math classes per week, having a higher math score, studying in a class with a greater student-teacher ratio were associated with an increased likelihood of participating in shadow education in math; while in Shanghai, having a higher index of family SES, living with two parents, keeping a positive attitude toward school, studying in classrooms with better disciplinary climate, having more math classes per week, obtaining a higher math score and studying in a class with a smaller student-teacher ratio, were associated with an increased likelihood. \n       \n        A comparison between determinants of Hong Kong and Shanghai suggests that there are eight factors that significantly differ in their effect on math tutoring between Hong Kong and Shanghai .

There is an ongoing interest in naturally derived biocomposites which exhibit low density and high porosity for a wide range of applications ranging from the commodities described above to insulating building materials to biomedical tissue scaffolds to processed food products.\nIn this work, low density starch-based composites produced by microwave expansion were developed. In particular, composites integrating different types of starch with chitosan and cellulose were examined. Types of cellulose include microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and hydrolyzed cellulose nanofibers. Time series studies showed optimal microwave treatment time for 20% MCC w/w (MCC:starch) reinforced starch-based composite was around 40s. Among all the composites, the maximal expansion ratio was around 490%. Expansion of starch-based composites with cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs) is less than those with MCC. Densities, mechanical properties and morphologies of the starch-based composites were investigated using volume displacement method, Instron compressive test, and FESEM. The effect of microcrystalline cellulose on starch expansion is further discussed.\nAn insoluble biocomposite composed of potato starch and chitosan was also prepared by microwave treatment. The effect of pH on swelling (liquid absorption) behavior of the composites was investigated at pH 2, pH 6.8 and pH 12. Analysis revealed that the swelling ratio of composites depends both on the aqueous pH value and the content of the chitosan. Composites exhibited a relatively high swelling ratio at pH environment lower than the pKa of amine groups on chitosan (about 6.3). When immersed in the same pH solution, a composite with higher chitosan content exhibited a higher swelling ratio. The microstructure of composites produced was also investigated by FESEM. \nIn the last chapter, improvement of current study and future work are proposed.

Although there is a general lack of agreement about the most desirable urban form, context provides a fundamental basis in establishing standards for sustainable cities.  Design as a response to environmental context also reinforces the profound relationship between people and place.  This extraordinary relationship is initially defined by a region\u2019s ecology, yet constantly evolves according to cultural flows, technological innovation, and subtle environmental variations.  It is clear that the constant intermingling between human society and environmental context is not a static process.  \n\nThis thesis inquires to how urban development parallels the evolution of human ecology and nonhuman ecology in the region of Montreal.  By determining the common linkages between urban development, human ecology and non-human ecology, one can begin to extrapolate the responsive qualities of the existing urban forms of Montreal.  Moreover, what does the architectural record reveal about the human-environment dynamic and how can this insight be used to develop mutually advantageous design strategies for infill development in Montreal?  The investigation begins by outlining the theoretical background surrounding the concept of co-evolution, a process of adaptation between humans\u2019 material practices, ideas and values and the non-human environment.  Subsequently, a comprehensive site analysis of Montreal is preformed, which will firstly reveal the ecological determinants of this region.  The implications of eco-determinants are dependent upon a site\u2019s ecology on varying scales, i.e. they are context specific.  This site assessment derives the data necessary to generate a record of urban evolution along three parallel axes: human ecology, non-human ecology and built environment which are defined in the introduction to this thesis.  \n\nThe data from the case study is analyzed to evaluate how infill development in a Montreal district (Le Plateau Mont-Royal) reacts to its environment according to predetermined sustainable design parameters.  The results from data collection are interpreted in order to isolate the passive design practices and strategies that are appropriate for this particular city and climatic region.  Infill development has the most potential as a point of intervention in the context of this study because infill is defined as a measured and deliberate process of urban evolution.  Infill development is realized through varied designers, innovative methodologies and diverse design principles.

The long-term fate of soil organic carbon during global warming is important because soil carbon is the largest terrestrial organic carbon reservoir and soil can serve as a sink or a source for atmospheric CO2. Soil carbon degradation is multifaceted as different pools of organic carbon in soils (e.g., fresh biomass, refractory soil organic matter, and thermally mature fossil organic matter) have different reactivity. Fire, an important component of ecosystems at a range of spatial and temporal scales, affects vegetation distribution, the carbon cycle, and climate. Because there are several variables and mechanisms are complex, it is difficult to predict future and infer past changes in both soil degradation and fire activity based on climate and environmental conditions. Examining changes in soil organic carbon, climate, and fire during past warming events, such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), should help elucidate climate-carbon cycle relationships, especially effects that are expressed over long durations (e.g., 100 \u2013 10,000 years).\n\tAbrupt global warming during the PETM dramatically altered vegetation and hydrologic patterns, and, likely, terrestrial organic carbon production and preservation. The PETM coincided with a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE), signifying a large release of 13C-depleted carbon to the biosphere and a major perturbation to the carbon cycle. Bulk organic carbon isotopes (\u03b413Corg) are often used to identify the CIE, but in terrestrial sections the \u03b413Corg CIE can be highly variable and distorted. It has been suggested that \u03b413Corg values were highly variable because of soil carbon degradation by microbes and allochthonous (pre-PETM) fossil carbon inputs. Constraining the degree and extent of degradation is critical in identifying the 13C-depleted carbon source and understanding carbon cycling processes and possible underlying organic carbon destabilization mechanisms during the PETM. \n\tAt three Paleocene-Eocene fluvial sites in the western USA, my co-authors and I test the hypothesis that there were increased degradation (soil carbon loss) and refractory (allochthonous) carbon inputs during the PETM. Clay minerals stabilize organic carbon, but we hypothesize decreased clay content and changes in mineralogy destabilized organic carbon during the PETM. If soil moisture was a control on soil organic carbon degradation, then sites with similar soil moistirue conditions would have a similar loss of organic carbon. Using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), combustion byproducts that are relatively resistant to degradation, as a proxy for intermediate refractory carbon helped to discern the relative preservation of different carbon pools in the soils. I developed a novel molecular metric of degradation by calculating the percent loss of PAHs relative to total organic carbon (TOC) to estimate the extent of organic carbon loss and proportion of refractory allochthonous carbon during the PETM. \n\tAll forms of soil carbon decreased during the PETM, and PAH concentrations decreased even more than TOC, which suggests a more refractory phase was present, such as allochthonous fossil carbon. Positive correlations between elemental oxide weight percents (e.g., Al2O3 and TiO2) and TOC suggests organic carbon preservation was associated with clay minerals. Wetter sites had a greater percent loss of organic carbon during the PETM than drier sites. Reduced soil organic matter preservation during the PETM was due to a combination of increased temperatures (which increased microbial decomposition rates), decreased clay content and changes in mineralogy (which inhibited stability of fresh carbon), and fluctuations in soil moisture (which destabilized older, refractory carbon). Soil carbon degradation, even of intermediately refractory carbon, was not just a local phenomenon and was regional, and potentially global, in scope.\n\tIn the marine sediments of the Arctic, where organic carbon was well-preserved during the PETM, we used PAHs as an indicator for fire and plant biomarkers, as well as published pollen data, to decipher the dynamics between fire, precipitation, and vegetation changes in the paleoecosystem. In modern ecosystems, climate influences fuel availability (e.g., vegetation), fuel flammability (e.g., precipitation and temperature), and ignitions (i.e., lightning). In the paleorecord, authors often invoke drier conditions as a cause of increased fire occurrence. During the PETM, Arctic sediments exhibit higher PAH concentrations, and they both increased relative to plant input and tracked the increase in angiosperms (inferred from plant biomarker ratios and pollen). Our results suggest wetter conditions, followed by increased temperature, favored angiosperms and enhanced fire occurrence. Like modern fire dynamics, shifts in past fire patterns reflect a balance of variability in precipitation and sufficiently flammable vegetation. Increased fire in a wetter Arctic suggests PETM precipitation was seasonal, or variable on a longer timescale, and that hotter temperatures and angiosperm-dominated forests further facilitated burning.\n\tOverall, we used PAHs as a primary signal of production (i.e., fire occurrence) in marine sediments and as a secondary signal of preservation (e.g., organic carbon degradation) in ancient soils. Our results highlight that terrestrial organic carbon was better preserved in the marine section than the fluvial sections. Increased temperatures, decreased clay content, changes in mineralogy, and variations in soil moisture destabilized carbon on millennial timescales and, with sustained higher temperatures across the PETM (~150 thousand years), increased soil carbon degradation persisted for tens of thousands of years. As temperatures warmed and remained warmer than the Paleocene, soils served as a sustained source of CO2 to the atmosphere rather than a sink. Although CO\u00ac2 released from microbial respiration enhanced the greenhouse warming, increased organic carbon preservation in the marine realm may have counteracted the increased carbon output from soils.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12576], "author_name_tesi": "Denis, Elizabeth Helen", "last_name_ssi": "Denis", "middle_name_ssi": "Helen", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM)", "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)", "soil organic carbon", "terrestrial carbon cycle", "degradation", "fire", "preservation", "biomarker"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Pricing Effect of Restaurant Industry Related Factors on Fama French Three Factor Model\n\n\n", "id": "7287", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "801", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the addition of restaurant industry-related factors on the accuracy and explanatory power of the Fama-French three factor model when estimating the risk and expected return of restaurant firms.

Four factors that may affect the restaurant industry\u2019s systematic risk were selected.

Furthermore these influences are not captured in standard asset pricing models like the Fama French model. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [794], "author_name_tesi": "Denizci, Basak ", "last_name_ssi": "Denizci", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Basak", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Hotel, Restaurant, and Institutional Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arun Upjena", "Anna S Mattila", "David Allen Cranage", "Timothy T Simin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arun Upjena, Committee Chair", "Anna S Mattila, Committee Member", "David Allen Cranage, Committee Member", "Timothy T Simin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["factors", "finance", "Fama-French", "restaurant"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "thermo-mechanical model development and experimental validation for metallic parts in additive manufacturing", "id": "26184", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11541", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this work is to experimentally validate thermal and\nmechanical finite element models of metallic parts produced using\nadditive manufacturing (AM) processes. AM offers advantages over\nother manufacturing processes due the fact that it can produce net\nand near-net shapes directly from a digital drawing file. Parts can\nbe produced on a layer by layer basis by melting wire or powder\nmetal using a laser or an electron beam. The material then cools and\nsolidifies to form a fully dense geometry. Unfortunately the large\nthermal gradients cause a buildup of residual stress often taking\nparts out of tolerance or causing failure by cracking or\ndelamination. To successfully reduce distortion and residual stress\nin metallic AM parts without expensive and time consuming trial and\nerror iterations, an experimentally validated physics based model is\nneeded.\n\nIn this work finite element (FE) models for the laser directed\nenergy deposition (LDED), the Electron Beam Directed Manufacture\n(EBDM) process, and the Laser Powder-Bed Fusion (LPBF) process are\ndeveloped and validated. In situ distortion and temperature\nmeasurements are taken during the LDED processing of both Ti-6Al-4V\nand Inconel 625. The in situ\nexperimental results are used in addition to post-process residual\nstress measurements to validate a thermo-mechanical model for each\nalloy. The results show that each material builds distortion\ndifferently during AM processing, a previously unknown effect that\nmust be accounted for in the model. The thermal boundary conditions\nin the model are then modified to allow for the modeling of the EBDM\nprocess. The EBDM model is validated against in situ temperature and\ndistortion measurements as well as post-process residual stress\nmeasurements taken on a single bead wide Ti-6Al-4V wall build.\nFurther model validation is provided by comparing the predicted\nmechanical response of a large EBDM aerospace component consisting\nof several thousand deposition tracks to post-process distortion\nmeasurements taken on the actual part. Several distortion mitigation\ntechniques are also investigated using an FE model. The findings are\nused to reduce the maximum distortion present on the large\nindustrial aerospace component by 91~\\%. Finally, the modeling work\nfor the LDED and the EBDM processes is extended to Laser Powder-Bed\nFusion (LPBF) processing of Inconel\n718. The necessary boundary conditions and material properties to\ninclude in the models are identified by comparing the model with in\nsitu experimental results.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11049], "author_name_tesi": "Denlinger, Erik Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Denlinger", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Erik", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Panagiotis Michaleris", "Reuben H Kraft", "Eric Russell Marsh", "Allison Michelle Beese", "Edward William Reutzel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Panagiotis Michaleris, Dissertation Advisor", "Reuben H Kraft, Committee Member", "Eric Russell Marsh, Committee Member", "Allison Michelle Beese, Committee Member", "Edward William Reutzel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Additive Manufacturing", "Distortion", "Residual stress", "Ti-6Al-4V", "Inconel", "FEM", "Powder-bed"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Intraprofessional Collaboration:  Innovations in Occupational Therapy Academia", "id": "13780trd117", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13780", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this qualitative action research (AR) study was to develop an innovative college elective with occupational therapy and assistant students (OT/OTA) from different universities which examined skill development related to effective supervisory, collaborative and intraprofessional relationships.  A theoretical lens of situated learning, focusing on social means of information assimilation and a learner-centered approach, framed the study and informed the direction and formatting of the elective.  The study provided opportunities for student collaborators, both OT and OTAs, to participate, direct and make decisions surrounding class experiences, structure and outcome measures. The 15-week semester/term cycled repeatedly through planning, acting, observing and reflecting for the express purpose of collaborator problem solving within the realm of OT academia related to OT/OTA intraprofessional integration.\n\tFindings of the study afforded understanding into the realm of therapy and assistant academic preparation.  First, collaborators were able to recognize the ways in which their learning had transpired previous to the study, including teacher-centered formats of lecture, labs and testing for assessment. This was contrasted to the learner-centered approach of shared decision-making, exploring content in ways that were identified as meaningful by the students, and as collaborative, reflective and social in nature.  The adult learners went on to identify attributes of effective intraprofessional collaboration to include effective communication, active listening, trust, respect, and empathy.  Self-awareness and an understanding of one\u2019s counterpart were pivotal to the successful intraprofessional partnership.  When learning the skills of working together, learners discussed the importance of face-to-face-interactions and the importance of time to develop connections.  Logistical, financial and institutional limitations created challenges for this undertaking, however the endeavor yielded not only informative insights, but also implications for practice and for future research.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14448], "author_name_tesi": "Dennehy, Terri Reichley", "last_name_ssi": "Dennehy", "middle_name_ssi": "Reichley", "first_name_ssi": "Terri", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward W.

As numerical weather prediction (NWP) models use increasingly finer grid spacing, processes involved in CI might be expected to be better represented, leading to increased forecast ability. In this study, we compare observations to rare 5-minute model output from the operational North American Mesoscale Forecast System (NAM) at both 4- and 1.33-km grid spacing. Two severe weather cases (28 April 2014 and 6 May 2015) are simulated, and compared for evidence of increased forecast performance with decreased horizontal grid spacing. The results show similar convective environments between the two nests, especially for strongly forced events. The dryline dynamics are explored, and limitations related to the model setup are exposed. Model artifacts related to physics parameterizations and the numerical framework are unveiled, and they contributed directly to changes in the operational NAM that were implemented officially in March 2017.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15277], "author_name_tesi": "Dennis, Eli James", "last_name_ssi": "Dennis", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Eli", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yvette P.

The second paper investigates the relationship between entrepreneurs\u2019 decisions to enter self-employment and tumult in the broader employment environment and economy. The analysis suggests that an awareness of those conditions plays a role in decisions to enter self-employment and, further, that such an awareness on a broader scale may play a role in driving up rates of self-employments. The final paper considers the role entrepreneurship plays as an ideological touchstone in the economy in the United States.
