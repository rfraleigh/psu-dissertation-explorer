Also of interest was whether the associations were moderated by age.  Participants included 907 individuals from the National Study of Daily Experiences II (NSDE), an 8-day daily diary telephone study with cortisol assessed on study days 2-5.  Age of the participants ranged from 33 to 84.  Multilevel modeling was used to analyze the data.             \n     Persons with higher scores on neuroticism were more likely to report at least one physical health symptom on a given day.  Higher scores on neuroticism were also related to a higher number and severity of symptoms on symptom days.  In addition, individuals with higher scores on neuroticism were more variable in number of symptoms but less variable in symptom severity.  These associations were not moderated by age.  In regards to cortisol at waking, individuals with higher scores on neuroticism had higher levels of and more within-person variation, suggesting a link between neuroticism and hyperactivity of the HPA axis.  This association between neuroticism and cortisol at waking was driven mainly by the older adults.  Neuroticism may influence objective daily physical health more in old age as a result of biological vulnerability.  In addition, perhaps continued high levels of neuroticism contribute to heightened physical reactivity and sensitivity due to the repeated experience of stressors.  This is known as amplification or a kindling effect.    \n     Overall, these results provide support for both the biological and psychological mechanisms proposed to underlie the association between neuroticism and health.  The findings also underscore the complex associations among neuroticism, age, daily physical health symptoms, and cortisol at waking.     \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2154], "author_name_tesi": "King, Heather ", "last_name_ssi": "King", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Manuel Almeida", "David Manuel Almeida", "Denis Gerstorf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Manuel Almeida, Thesis Advisor", "David Manuel Almeida, Thesis Advisor", "Denis Gerstorf, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["neuroticism", "daily health"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "BEHAVIORAL, PERSONALITY, AND HORMONAL CORRELATES OF TYPES AND DIMENSIONS OF PHYSICAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS IN DAILY LIFE\n", "id": "12529", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13242", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Daily physical health symptoms are an integral part of health during adulthood, however, much remains to be explored regarding these experiences.  Although different types and dimensions may be important, few studies have simultaneously examined these aspects of symptom reports and at the daily level.  The goal of this dissertation was to examine multiple dimensions (e.g., frequency, severity) and types of physical symptoms in daily life as well as behavioral, personality, and hormonal correlates using a national sample of adults.  \n\nThe first aim of Paper 1 was to provide a descriptive account of daily physical health symptom experiences.  Symptom types were compared, and age and gender differences were also examined.  The second aim was to examine how levels of and fluctuations in various aspects of daily physical symptoms are associated with daily work cutback, an index of symptom-related impairment.  Both between- and within- person associations and the role of age as a moderator were examined using logistic multilevel modeling.  In general, the results provided evidence for multidimensionality.  In addition, women generally reported worse daily physical health compared to men.  Fewer age differences emerged, though older adults experienced bodily pain more frequently.  Finally, symptom experiences were linked to the odds of reporting any work cutback, particularly for adults in midlife in some instances. \n\nPaper 2 examined how neuroticism was associated with daily physical health symptom occurrence as well as level of and fluctuation in symptom severity by symptom type.  The second aim was to investigate how neuroticism and physical symptom experiences were associated with and combined to predict parameters of diurnal cortisol, specifically the cortisol awakening response (CAR) and daily decline.  Results from logistic and linear multilevel models demonstrated that neuroticism was primarily associated with bodily pain and fatigue symptoms as well as a less steep (CAR) and more day-to-day variation in the afternoon/evening cortisol decline.  In addition, specific types and dimensions of symptom experiences were associated with a flatter daily cortisol decline as well as interacted with neuroticism to influence diurnal cortisol.  Collectively, these results have implications for assessment of daily physical health symptoms in survey research and medical settings.  In addition, neuroticism is a risk factor for poor daily physical health and physiological dysregulation with intervention applications.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12789], "author_name_tesi": "King, Heather ", "last_name_ssi": "King", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David M.

The specific purpose was to describe 1) evangelical Christian faculty members\u2019 perceptions of what it means to be a Christian, 2) the circumstances under which they are more likely to self-disclose their religious identity at work, and 3) the tensions and constraints they experience when communicating it in the secular institutions of higher education in which they work.  The qualitative methods used involved soliciting participant narratives which were transcribed and analyzed according to the Constant-Comparison Method in order to produce openly coded thematic units.  \n\tAnalysis produced four themes describing what it means to be a Christian, and these findings suggest a possible extension of the Communication Theory of Identity to include the existence of \u201cprimary identity actions\u201d within the personal frame of identity.  Also, this study provided support for the theoretical supposition of a hierarchy of identities by establishing that the participants had a topmost identity.  The findings extend what is known about stigmatized identities by providing a case in which a usually accepted identity becomes stigmatized within a specific context.\nThis study provides support for several aspects of the Communication Privacy Management Theory including the use of motivational, contextual, and risk-to-benefit ratio decision making criteria.  However, the two most important revelations of the study with regard to self-disclosure suggest a critique of current self-disclosure theories.  First, self-disclosure appears more complicated than presumed previously.  Current theory characterizes the bases of disclosure decisions as mostly self-focused motivations, but the findings herein indicate communicators often use criteria for disclosing that are based on mutual concerns and even other-focused (i.e. altruistic) motivations.  Second, the findings revealed a phenomenological gap between self-disclosure as conceptualized by scholars and self-disclosure as experienced in people\u2019s day-to-day lives.  Participants extensively reported nonverbal behaviors and superficial disclosures as important ways they communicate their religious identity in the workplace.  The importance of this study will be reinforced if subsequent research uncovers similar findings.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3403], "author_name_tesi": "King, Kristin F.

Yet this definition underestimates the rhetorical potency of spectacle, as a context in which athletes may participate in projects of social transformation and institutional reform. Sport Spectacle, Athletic Activism, and the Rhetorical Analysis of Mediated Sport engages a set of case studies that assess the rhetorical conditions that empower or sideline athletes in projects of social change. The introduction builds a working vocabulary of four key terms\u2014form, style, medium, and genre\u2014that are central to the rhetorical analysis of mediated sports and mobilizes those concepts throughout the dissertation\u2019s case studies. \u201cWe\u2019ve Come a Long Way Maybe: Billie Jean King\u2019s Feminism and the Battle of the Sexes\u201d contrasts the bodily material feminism of King\u2019s 1973 victory over Bobby Riggs with the strong emphasis on financial equity that King advocated in interviews and memoirs and notes how King has attempted to leverage control over public memory of the match to position herself as a figure of social transformation. \u201cThree Waves of Gay Male Athlete Coming Out Narratives\u201d considers how the genre compels athletes to reconcile their identities as athletes with their identities as gay men while tracing the evolution of common argumentative appeals for the fitness of gay men in sport since the 1970s. \u201cBlack Lives Matter and the Decline of the Decline of the Activist-Athlete\u201d argues that if the Black Lives Matter social movement is viewed only through the prism of athletic activism, some of the central issues that the movement continues to face\u2014its emphasis on horizontal models of organization and leadership, its skepticism toward working through established levers of governance, and its ambivalent relationship to the politics of respectability\u2014are further obscured and refracted by the institutions of sports and sports media discourse and particular instances of athlete-activist protest, even as these athletes overturn longstanding assumptions about the political quiescence of elite athletes. \u201c\u2018Absent Athletes,\u2019 Athletic Agency, and the Sports Documentary\u201d considers how the genre of the sports documentary often gives athletes a sense of social importance while simultaneously stripping them of the agency to make such arguments themselves. Through analysis of the sports documentaries of Steve James and Amir Bar-Lev, I argue that documentary is uniquely positioned as a genre that subverts the spectacle of sports and transforms spectators into deliberative civic agents.

The fishermen from this village\norganized a cooperative in 1960 and their success in collective marketing\nhas provided them a high degree of economic self-determination.  In\naddition to marketing, the cooperative provides other services to members.\nAmong these, access to credit is important because of its value to\nfishermen and the management challenges emerging from the cooperative's\ngrowth.  The cooperative has grown from a community-based institution of 40\nmembers into a multi-million dollar seafood processing and marketing\nbusiness servicing over 500 fishermen.  Through this transformation the\ncooperative's membership has become more diverse, in their fishing methods,\nplaces of residence, and economic interests in the lobster fishery.\nBecause cooperative credit occurs as a common pool and legislation\ngoverning cooperatives ties members' repayment to marketing, this setting\nis an interesting case of a multi-tiered collective action problem.\n\n\nA theoretical framework based on Ostrum's principles for self-governing\ncollective action institutions is used to test the relationships among\ngroup composition, monitoring opportunities, commitment, the costs of\nproviding and maintaining common pool credit, and the economic benefits\ncollective marketing confers.  Tourism development and market price for\nlobsters are external factors that also affect member commitment and the\nstate of the common credit pool.  The theory predicts that changes in the\nmembership's composition affect members' commitment to collective marketing\nand their use of cooperative credit.  Qualitative and quantitative analysis\nidentifies membership composition as a significant factor explaining much\nof the variation in cooperative members' monitoring options, commitment to\nmarketing, and level of debt and the costs associated with maintaining it.\nWhile fishermen's collective marketing does not determine the level of\neconomic returns conferred through the cooperative (determined by market\nprices), the persistence of collective marketing does provide the\ninstitutional setting by which the members access better paying markets.\nThe theoretical and practical significance of these results are discussed.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6150], "author_name_tesi": "King, Thomas Dean", "last_name_ssi": "King", "middle_name_ssi": "Dean", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Paul Durrenberger", "Albert E Luloff", "Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Jeffrey Cohen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Paul Durrenberger, Committee Chair", "Albert E Luloff, Committee Member", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Cohen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cooperatives", "Common Pool Resources", "Lobster Fishing", "Community-Based Institutions", "Grassroots Development", "Belize"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Reading Art: Multiliteracies and History Education", "id": "27789", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12335", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This article (published two years prior) was an early foray connecting historical thinking, the arts, and multiliteracies and served as a base for subsequent graduate work.

Risk analysis in any form should be done on a regular basis to tackle the possibility of unwanted major hazard-related events such as explosions, outbursts, airbursts, inundations, spontaneous combustion, and roof fall instabilities.  One of the responses by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in 2007 involved a new pattern of violations (POV) process to target mines with a poor safety performance, specifically to improve their safety.  However, the 2010 disaster (worst in 40 years) gave an impression that the collective effort of the industry, federal/state agencies, and researchers to achieve the goal of zero fatalities and serious injuries has gone awry. \nThe Safe Performance Index (SPI) methodology developed in this research is a straight-forward, effective, transparent, and reproducible approach that can help in identifying and addressing some of the existing issues while targeting (poor safety performance) mines which need help.  It combines three injury and three citation measures that are scaled to have an equal mean (5.0) in a balanced way with proportionate weighting factors (0.05, 0.15, 0.30) and overall normalizing factor (15) into a mine safety performance evaluation tool.  It can be used to assess the relative safety-related risk of mines, including by mine-size category. \nUsing 2008 and 2009 data, comparisons were made of SPI-associated, normalized safety performance measures across mine-size categories, with emphasis on small-mine safety performance as compared to large- and medium-sized mines.  The accident rates (NDL IR, NFDL IR, SM/100) of very small and small mines in 2008 and 2009 were less than those of medium and large mines. The data indicates a heavy occurrence of very severe injuries in a number of very small and small mines.\nIn another application which is a part of this research, the six normalized safety measures and the SPI are used to evaluate the risk that existed at mines in the two years preceding the occurrence of a fatality.  This mine safety performance tracking method could have been helpful to the companies, state agency, or MSHA in recognizing and addressing emerging problems with actions that may have been able to prevent high-risk conditions, the fatality, and/or other serious injuries.  The approach would have given scrutiny to the risk of mines that encompassed 74% of the fatalities during 2007-2010. \nIn order to assess the SPI as a comparable risk measurement tool, a traditional risk approach is also developed using data embracing frequency and severity in the final equation to analyze the relative risk for all underground coal mines for the years 2007\u20132010.  Then, the SPI is compared with this traditional risk analysis method to demonstrate that the results attained by either method provide the relative safety-related risk of underground coal mines regarding injuries and citations for violations of regulations.  The comparison reveals that the SPI does emulate a traditional approach to risk analysis.  A correlation coefficient of \u20130.89 or more was observed between the results of these two methodologies and either can be used to assist companies, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), or state agencies in target-ing mines with high risk for serious injuries and elevated citations for remediation of their injury and/or violation experience.  The SPI, however, provides a more understandable approach for mine operators to apply using measures compatible with MSHA\u2019s enforcement tools. \nThese methodologies form an all-encompassing approach that can be used to assist companies, the MSHA, or state agencies in targeting mines with high risk for serious injuries and elevated citations.  Once targeted as high risk, mines can then pursue appropriate intervention to remediate their violation and/or injury experience.  This research may help in plugging the gap in the safety system and better pursue the goal of zero fatalities and serious injuries in the underground coal mines.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7977], "author_name_tesi": "Kinilakodi, Harisha ", "last_name_ssi": "Kinilakodi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Harisha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr R Larry Grayson", "Dr R Larry Grayson", "William Arthur Groves", "Antonio Nieto", "Dr Samuel A Oyewole", "Andris Freivalds"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr R Larry Grayson, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr R Larry Grayson, Committee Chair", "William Arthur Groves, Committee Member", "Antonio Nieto, Committee Member", "Dr Samuel A Oyewole, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mine Safety", "Performance Index", "Safety Violation", "Safety-Related Risk", "Risk Analysis", "Risk Index"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "IDENTIFICATION AND ISOLATION OF GENETIC ELEMENTS CONFERRING INCREASED TOMATO FRUIT LYCOPENE CONTENT", "id": "11147", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4315", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is a vegetable crop produced and consumed around the world, and is a model system for the study of carotenoid accumulation. The dominant carotenoid in tomato is trans-lycopene, a powerful antioxidant that has been postulated to confer health benefits to humans and is responsible for the red appearance of ripe tomato fruits. Increasing lycopene content in tomato fruits represents an opportunity to increase market value for tomato crops, elevate the nutritional content of tomato for consumers, and to increase scientific understanding of carotenogenesis in plants. However, very few tomato alleles that cause increased lycopene accumulation in ripe fruits and are immediately useful for breeding purposes have been described in the literature. Given that little genetic variation exists within the cultivated tomato germplasm, wild Solanum species provide a unique opportunity to transfer new alleles into the cultigen. Using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between S. lycopersicum NCEBR-1, an advanced fresh market tomato breeding line with moderate lycopene content, and S. pimpinellifolium LA2093, a wild accession with exceptionally high lycopene content, the genetic architecture underlying lycopene accumulation is described. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping over several years using lycopene data obtained via colorimetry, spectrophotometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography assays reveals a highly-significant three-QTL model which explains ~45% of the phenotypic variation in the RIL population. Two of these QTL, located on chromosomes 7 (lyc7.1) and 12 (lyc12.1), explain most of the phenotypic variation. A marker-assisted backcross program was subsequently initiated to verify QTL effects and isolate the QTLs in a uniform genetic background. Genotypes harboring lyc12.1 contained approximately 72% more lycopene than the recurrent parent, NCEBR-1. Near-isogenic lines for lyc12.1 were produced, the QTL was fine mapped to a 1.5 Mb region of tomato genome sequence, and candidate genes underlying the QTL were identified for further study. Future experimentation outlined in this dissertation will elucidate the gene\u2019s role in carotenogenesis.

These multiple and contradictory discourses regarding matrimony performed a variety of functions beyond attempting to regulate a household or persuade the audience of the worthiness, or lack thereof, of the institution. They are displays of power that seek to impose an idealized vision of society and one\u2019s authority over others. An exploration of this subtext brings to light the difficulties of exerting individual agency in the face of myriad constraints, whether social, economic, or political. The authorial postures assumed, the identities created, the sources adapted, and the knowledge exposed created a late medieval form of self-fashioning. Another didactic genre, mirrors for princes or Furstenspiegel, fulfilled a manifest political role in providing counsel to male rulers; texts regarding marriage, addressed ostensibly to women but containing many messages intended for men, complement this agenda of influence. Marriage texts express the fears, ambitions, and negotiations that result from governing the polity in their representation of the difficulties of holding sway over a representative microcosm, the household. This study examines the authorial anxieties and authoritative posturing of three texts representative of late medieval discourses about marriage, Le Livre du Chevalier de la Tour Landry pour l\u2019enseignement ses filles, Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris, and Eustache Deschamps\u2019s Le Miroir de mariage. \nChapter One \u201cThe Courtly Conundrum: Marriage and Legitimacy in Le Livre du Chevalier de la Tour Landry pour l\u2019enseignement de ses filles \u201d discusses the late medieval shift toward a regulatory discourse of institutionalized marriage and away from the perilous courtly love trope. Le Livre du Chevalier de la Tour Landry pour l\u2019enseignement de ses filles, a French conduct book written by the Chevalier de la Tour Landry, a member of the provincial petite noblesse, in 1371. His work displays a patriarchal, authorial desire to participate in the conversation regarding matrimony. The narrator, known as \u201cthe Chevalier\u201d in this study, betrays a paternalist angst brought about by the threat of disobedience should he fail to impose his vision. The narrator\u2019s adaptation of his source text, Le Miroir des Bonnes Femmes, espouses the idea of a lineage founded in virtue and reveals the threat of illegitimacy that could arise if his fatherly advice is not heeded.   \nChapter Two, \u201cPlaying the Game in Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris,\u201d examines the importance of gaming and social exchange in the 1394 Parisian bourgeois conduct book of an anonymous author. Through its anecdotes, exempla, religious instruction, and preoccupation with the daily affairs of the household, this polyvalent work celebrates a set of class values particular to the late medieval bourgeoisie. As the narrator encourages his wife to uphold their collective estate, he negotiates a place for himself and his household through the practices of leisure and labor. Depicting men who participate in games where a wife\u2019s obedience is at stake demonstrates how the discursive formation of a woman\u2019s virtue circulated as a form of symbolic currency in late medieval society. His unacknowledged adaptation of Le Jeu des echecs moralis\u00e9, a mirror for princes composed in Latin by Jacobus de Cessolis and translated into French by Jean Ferron in 1347, reveals the political aspirations and personal investment in self-improvement behind his allusions to gaming. \nChapter Three, \u201cFranc Vouloir and the ties that bind in Eustache Deschamps\u2019s Miroir de mariage,\u201d reflects upon the masculine solidarity established between Franc Vouloir [Free Will], model ruler, and his counselor, Repertoire de Science [Repository of Knowledge], in the allegorical mirror intended to dissuade men from wedding. Neither of the protagonists lives up to his name; Free Will strains to exert his agency in decision-making and Repository\u2019s counsel remains ineffective. This lengthy, unfinished treatise and its illustrations of faulty medieval institutions reflect Deschamps\u2019s own frustrations and motivations as a politically engaged poet, a member of the noblesse de robe, and administrator in the royal court during the reign of Charles VI. The text showcases Aristotelian notions about politics, adapting ideas from the Nichomachean Ethics and the Politics that had been translated for Charles V, at the same time as it features their problematic application. It is above all an illustration of the difficulties of imposing and maintaining an ideal in an imperfect, material world, a self-reflexive act regarding the problematic confrontation of the wills that results from the production and reception of any mirroring or conduct text.\nChapter Four complements and completes the study of Deschamps\u2019s Miroir de mariage. \u201cEustache Deschamps\u2019s Miroir de mariage: The Wife and the Will\u201d posits that the illustration of the problematic application of counsel is in fact a parody of the mirroring tradition. The sober tones of Franc Vouloir and Repertoire de Science\u2019s exchange are counterbalanced by the fabliaux-like yet still misogynistic comedy of the descriptions of the imaginary household. The proliferation of voices and the multiple audiences established in the work complicate the questions of authorial voice and purported certainties about what society should be. In this dispute over sovereignty and mastery, there can be no true winner and the loser is the French nation as a whole. This last chapter demonstrates how the surprising transition from the discussion of an unruly wife to a poorly ruled nation lends political significance to the exchange of tales about women between men in the later Middle Ages. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8345], "author_name_tesi": "Kinne, Elizabeth Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Kinne", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Norris Joiner Lacy", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat", "Christine Clark Evans", "Jean Claude Vuillemin", "Robert R Edwards"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Norris Joiner Lacy, Dissertation Advisor", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Committee Chair", "Christine Clark Evans, Committee Member", "Jean Claude Vuillemin, Committee Member", "Robert R Edwards, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["conduct literature", "French medieval literature", "politics", "mirrors for princes", "marriage", "authority"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Assessment of Load Sharing Members in an Anti-ram Bollard System Subjected to Vehicle Impacts", "id": "18677", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8438", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Due to the increased frequency, scale, and danger of malicious attacks carried out by Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs), the need to adequately protect critical structures from these types of attacks continues to increase. Anti-ram bollards, which typically consist of vertical steel members embedded in concrete, have proven to be an effective and somewhat unobtrusive solution for protecting buildings and their occupants from vehicle impacts. However, there is still room to improve anti-ram bollard systems, and make them more efficient structural systems. One way to address these issues in urban areas is to utilize above-grade load sharing between the vertical steel bollards. Therefore, this study focused on the evaluation of above grade load sharing members in a steel anti-ram bollard system in an attempt to develop efficient load sharing mechanisms that improve the structure\u2019s ability to resist vehicle impacts, while concurrently remaining aesthetically unobtrusive. \n \nThe anti-ram system that was examined consists of two vertical, hollow structural shapes (HSS) embedded in a foundation consisting of HSS members embedded in reinforced concrete. The vertical HSS bollards were connected above grade using steel load sharing members that were intended to engage the non-impacted bollard to assist with energy dissipation. A computational study was completed using calibrated LS-DYNA finite element models to determine if effective, above grade, load sharing member configurations and designs could be established so that further optimization of the entire anti-ram system could be possible. It was found that effective above-grade load sharing could improve the crashworthiness of the anti-ram bollard systems that were studied. Of the designs that were investigated, the most efficient load sharing member design was a single HSS member connecting the vertical bollards near their tops.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8347], "author_name_tesi": "Kinney, Scott Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Kinney", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dan Linzell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dan Linzell, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Finite Element Modeling", "Anti-ram", "Bollard", "Load Sharing", "Steel Member Design", "Parametric Study", "Crash Testing"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Task and Individual Characteristics as Predictors of Performance in a Job-Relevant Multi-Tasking Environment\n\n", "id": "7591", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6133", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\tUnderstanding performance in complex multitasking environments is of paramount importance to selection practitioners.  Organizations are asking employees to do more work in less time than ever before.  With this increased task demand, understanding who can and cannot survive in this type of situation is critical.  To date, little research has investigated how to predict who will succeed and who will fail in these demanding situations.  Cognitive psychological research has focused on task characteristics that impact human capacity to multitask.  This stream of research has not had much impact on the selection practitioner.  Research on individual difference predictors of job performance has ignored criteria specific to performance in multitasking job environments.  This dissertation blends what cognitive psychologists have learned about human capacity to multitask and what industrial/organizational psychologists have learned about predicting job performance to investigate individual difference predictors in a job-relevant multitasking simulation.  The results from this study suggest that several of the task characteristic conditions researched in cognitive multitasking research do generalize to applied multitasking environments.  Also, several individual difference variables (cognitive ability, intellectance, extroversion, and polychronicity) emerged as predictors of performance in an applied multitasking environment, with cognitive ability being the best predictor.  Implications of these results on employee selection, job design, and future research are discussed.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6126], "author_name_tesi": "Kinney, Theodore Boone", "last_name_ssi": "Kinney", "middle_name_ssi": "Boone", "first_name_ssi": "Theodore", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin R Murphy", "Jeanette Cleveland", "James Lewis Farr", "Michael Wenger", "Frank Edward Ritter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin R Murphy, Committee Chair", "Jeanette Cleveland, Committee Member", "James Lewis Farr, Committee Member", "Michael Wenger, Committee Member", "Frank Edward Ritter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Job Performance", "Individual Differences", "Multitasking"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "HYPERTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE SENSING BY THE ORGANUM VASCULOSUM OF THE LAMINA TERMINALIS", "id": "14952bxk270", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14952", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High dietary NaCl intake is a significant risk factor for the development of hypertension. Time controlled studies in humans and rodents suggests that high salt intake elevates plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NaCl concentrations and subsequently raises sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and arterial blood pressure (ABP), potentially via osmosensitive neurons located in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT). However, the mechanism by which elevated extracellular [NaCl] acts in the brain to regulate SNA and ABP is poorly understood. Intriguingly, central infusion of benzamil, an amiloride analogue, attenuates the development of salt-sensitive hypertension models. \n\tThis dissertation evaluated (i) the contribution of hypertonic NaCl-sensing by OVLT neurons to subsequent regulation of SNA and ABP, (ii) whether NaCl and osmolarity similarly affect these functions, and (iii) the role of benzamil-sensitive channels, namely epithelial sodium channels (ENaC), in OVLT neuron NaCl-sensing. These multifaceted studies in adult male Sprague Dawley rats utilized whole cell patch clamp recordings from OVLT neurons in hypothalamic slices and in vivo recordings of OVLT single-unit activity, end-organ SNA, and ABP in response to acutely administered hypertonic solutions.\n\tInitial investigations demonstrated that 2-5% elevations in extracellular [NaCl] intrinsically excite most OVLT neurons in vitro and in vivo. Hypertonic NaCl administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) or intra-OVLT significantly increases lumbar and adrenal SNA and raises ABP. These responses are attenuated by inhibiting OVLT neurons with muscimol. Notably, ICV infusion or OVLT injection with equi-osmotic sorbitol did not alter SNA and ABP. Furthermore, most OVLT neurons in vitro and in vivo demonstrated greater increases in discharge frequency in response to hypertonic NaCl than equi-osmotic mannitol or sorbitol. Interestingly, hypertonic NaCl-sensing by OVLT neurons was attenuated by either 0.5\u00b5M benzamil or 10\u00b5M amiloride, yet 10\u00b5M amiloride did not affect excitation of OVLT neurons by mannitol. Finally, intra-OVLT benzamil injection reduced central NaCl-evoked sympathoexcitation. Collectively, these results indicate that OVLT neuron hypertonic NaCl-sensing, but not osmosensing, regulates SNA and ABP, and ENaC contributes to these NaCl-sensing functions in OVLT. Future investigations into the mechanisms of OVLT NaCl-sensing in salt-sensitive hypertension may facilitate development of targeted therapies that reduce NaCl-sensitive elevations in SNA and ABP.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16283], "author_name_tesi": "Kinsman, Brian J", "last_name_ssi": "Kinsman", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biomedical Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kirsteen Nairn Browning", "Kirsteen Nairn Browning", "Charles H Lang", "Urs Leuenberger", "Leslie Joan Parent", "Sean D.

This study conversely looks at the acoustics of small rooms with a focus on Penn State's recording Studio A in Music Building II.  In all rooms, the full frequency response can be grouped into two distinct sections; separated by the Schroeder frequency ($f_s$).  For many cases, rooms are large enough that most of the audible frequency range falls above the Schroeder frequency, where as smaller spaces have a significant audible range below. The goal of this study was to characterize the acoustic performance (in both ranges) of the control room and live room of Studio A and provide suggestions to reduce the impact of undesirable phenomena.  Both rooms have important roles to play in the operation of a studio which depend on their acoustic character.  COMSOL multi-physics models for each room were created to understand the modal behavior below the Schroeder frequency.  For comparison, measured modes were visualized from frequency response measurement points in one plane at a 1 foot spacing.  For frequencies above the Schroeder frequency, an ODEON model was created and validated against measured impulse responses, where metrics such as reverberation time (T60) and early decay time (EDT) have been considered.  In addition, transmission loss measurements were conducted between the control room and live room.  This allowed for analysis of the partition's performance for frequencies in one-third octave bands.  By comparing the computer simulations to the measurements, it has been revealed that there are prevalent modes that occur in both rooms and match the simulated models reasonably well.  Frequency response plots give a good indication of the Schroeder frequency and show where modal behavior begins and mid-to-high statistics take over.  With reverberation times being quite short at around 0.2-0.3 seconds,  relative changes in the model were made to give suggestions for increased performance.  Improvements such as implementing the \"live end, dead end\" (LEDE) concept, and incorporating Helmholtz resonators have been explored and are intended to improve the acoustics and functionality of each space.

This thesis introduces TD (temporal design) Plugin as a method for architects to consider temporal aspects of architecture. In this thesis, I have defined the temporal design in architecture as designing an architectural experience from the eyes of the spectator in space while considering as many details about the experience as possible. The TD Plugin was developed by using the results of the analysis of the application of montage techniques in three architectural projects. I argue that Le Corbusier montages \u2018views and perspectives\u2019, while Tschumi montages \u2018layers of the experience\u2019 (event, movement, space), and Koolhaas montages \u2018program\u2019. My thesis demonstrates that montage techniques helped these architects to pay more attention to temporal design. TD plugin meshes with existing design techniques. It is based on fragmentation of experience into sequences and episodes, and further designing these fragments in detail by using TD plugin table. The table provides a checklist of spatial and temporal features. The final product is a succession of the views and perspectives as one walks through the sequence. For an evaluation of the TD Plugin, a pilot-workshop where three participants learned about the method and designed an art gallery was held. The results showed that \u2018sequence-based design\u2019, and the \u2018spatial features checklist\u2019 encouraged temporal design. The participants agreed that the method had increased their sensitivity toward designing a real experience. They were satisfied by the foregrounding which happened in the process of fragmentation and assemblage of the episodes. On the other hand, they were not completely comfortable in using the table, which resulted in a drastic change in their design speed. To sum up, the thesis suggests a practical view toward the topic of time and architecture. Since time and space are connected in real experiences, this thesis proposes a design plugin which aims to help architects to better design the actual architectural experience in detail. In other words, the TD plugin assists architects not only in designing the physical dimension, but in getting them to realize the temporal aspect of architecture and incorporate this in their designs.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13576], "author_name_tesi": "Kioumarsi, Niloufar ", "last_name_ssi": "Kioumarsi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Niloufar", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Felecia Davis", "Daniel E Willis", "Alexandra Staub"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Felecia Davis, Thesis Advisor", "Daniel E Willis, Committee Member", "Alexandra Staub, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Architecture", "Time", "Temporal design", "Design method", "Montage"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Multifunctional Porous Silicon Nanopillar Arrays: Superhydrophobicity, Antireflection, and Sensitive SERS Performance", "id": "15150", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7637", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Silicon nanostructures are of intense interest because of their applications in biology, biochemical sensing, energy storage, energy harvesting, photonic materials, electronic materials, and optical thin films. Perhaps more significantly, SiNPs can be fabricated with conventional silicon and CMOS processes, making them easily integrated into a variety of current electronic and photonic architectures. \n\tOne-dimensional silicon nanostructures can either be grown with a bottom-up approach or fabricated with top-down methods. Growth generally involves chemical synthesis mediated by catalytic particles, whereas top-down methods utilize a chemical or physical etch and a surface nanopattern to fabricate the structures. While both methods have shown advantages and disadvantages, the ability to produce single-crystalline structures with highly controllable orientation and location has proven an overwhelming advantage for top-down methods and has greatly expanded the list of potential applications for these materials.\n\tThe sub-micron dimensions of silicon nanostructures gives them a variety of unique electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. Collections of aligned nanostructures strongly influence the reflection of light from a surface and the way liquids expand across a surface. When the size of individual structures is reduced below 10 nm, quantum effects are introduced into the band structure, altering electronic conduction and light interaction and emission. Individual properties have been studied and utilized for a variety of nano-enabled devices, but only recently have researchers looked to simultaneously utilize multiple properties to for enhanced performance. \n\tIn this work, we fabricate one-dimensional silicon nanopillar (SiNP) arrays with a top-down approach that utilizes nanosphere lithography to pattern a metallic surface and a wet-chemical etch of silicon to produce free-standing nanostructures. The SiNPs show unique longitudinal features along their entire length and have surface porosity with dimensions on the single-nanometer level.  The SiNP substrates reduced reflection nearly fivefold from planar silicon in the visible range without any optimization.  The same substrates also approached superhydrophobic behavior with increasing aspect ratio, demonstrating contact angles up to 138\u00b0.. Finally, the pillars were made into sensitive surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates by depositing metal onto the pillars. The performance of the substrates was demonstrated using a chemical dye R6G. To emphasize the unique and versatile attributes of the SiNP arrays, all of the characterization and applications in this work were accomplished on the same set of substrates. Combining multiple unique properties of SiNPs and SiNP arrays into a single device can have important effects on low-analyte detection sensitivity, solar harvesting efficiency, dynamic biological monitoring, and many other potential nanoscale systems. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7574], "author_name_tesi": "Kiraly, Brian Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Kiraly", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Huang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["porous", "nanopillar", "SERS", "superhydrophobic", "antireflection"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF \nCUSTOM-DESIGNED POSTERIOR-STEP GLENOID PROSTHESES IN TOTAL SHOULDER ARTHROPLASTY\n\n", "id": "10130", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6732", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is the treatment of choice for advanced gleno-humeral osteoarthritis.  Among different complications of the procedure, loosening of the glenoid component (the socket) is most common.  The risk for glenoid component loosening is greatly increased with pre-existing bone erosion in the posterior glenoid, for which the treatment options are currently limited.  The goal of the present project was to employ a cadaver model to evaluate the mechanical efficacy of two Posterior-step glenoid prostheses (Poly-step and Ti-step), two custom implants designed to compensate for a typical posterior glenoid defect.  Our first hypothesis was that TSA using a standard (STD) glenoid prosthesis, in the absence of a defect, will not significantly alter joint stability, as measured by gleno-humeral translations, but will increase loading of the glenoid, as measured by the peri-glenoid principal bone strains.  The second hypothesis was that TSA using custom Poly-step and Ti-step prostheses, to compensate for a biconcave posterior glenoid defect, will reverse the alterations in peri-glenoid strains and joint translations as caused by the defect.  Furthermore, we also hypothesized that consequences of implantation of custom Poly-step and Ti-step prostheses in the presence of a defect will be similar to those following STD prosthesis implantation in the absence of such a defect.\nFifteen non-embalmed, fresh frozen human shoulder specimens were tested in a custom-built loading apparatus after fixing three triaxial strain gauge rosettes around the glenoid, and two marker-clusters on the acromion and the humerus.  The arm was placed in 90\u00b0 of abduction in neutral, in 30\u00b0 of horizontal flexion and 30\u00b0 of horizontal extension, while applying static forces to the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles, and axial forces to the distal humerus using a linear actuator.  Peri-glenoid bone strains and marker-motion were recorded using analogue-to-digital converter and custom software, and a four-camera motion capture system respectively.  Principal strains and joint translations were derived from the strains and marker-motion respectively, and were compared across conditions, arm positions and implant types.  In five out of fifteen specimens, TSA was performed using a standard glenoid prosthesis while in the remaining ten specimens, a defect (20\u00b0 biconcave type) was surgically created in the posterior glenoid, and custom Polyethylene-step and Titanium-step glenoid prostheses were implanted in five specimens each.  \nWe observed that implantation of a STD glenoid prosthesis, in the absence of posterior glenoid defect, had no significant effect on glenoid bone loading or joint stability (p > 0.05).  Creation of a 20\u00b0 biconcave defect in the posterior glenoid caused some significant alterations in glenoid strains but not in joint translations, as compared to those in the native joints (p < 0.05).  Implantation of a Polyethylene-step glenoid prosthesis in the presence of a defect, successfully reversed the mechanical alterations caused by the defect, while implantation of a Titanium-step prosthesis did not.  Significantly greater anterior compressive strains and posterior tensile strains were observed following TSA using Ti-step prosthesis, and humeral head translations were also more anteriorly directed, as compared to the STD and Poly-step prostheses.  Therefore, we concluded that Polyethyelene-step glenoid prosthesis may be a viable option for treating posterior glenoid defects, and warrants further mechanical evaluation in the form of fatigue loading and testing for loosening etc.  If successful, this prosthesis may provide an important treatment avenue for surgeons performing TSA on arthritic shoulders with posterior glenoid deficiency, and potentially reduce the incidence of glenoid component loosening and failure. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6727], "author_name_tesi": "Kirane, Yatin ", "last_name_ssi": "Kirane", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yatin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil Sharkey", "Neil Sharkey", "April D Armstrong", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Andris Freivalds", "Kevin Paul Black"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Neil Sharkey, Dissertation Advisor", "Neil Sharkey, Committee Chair", "April D Armstrong, Committee Chair", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "Kevin Paul Black, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["posterior glenoid defect", "glenoid prosthesis", "shoulder arthroplasty"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Assembly of Nanowire Arrays: Exploring Interparticle Interactions, Particle Orientation, and Mixed Particle Arrays", "id": "25845", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11321", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Assembly represents an important step between nanowire synthesis and their use in next generation technologies. It is an interesting challenge because the particle shape necessitates control over its position and orientation with respect to the assembly substrate and neighboring particles. This dissertation examines the fundamental forces involved in the self-assembly of nanowire arrays. The effects of gravity, van der Waals (VDW) attractions, and electrostatic repulsions were explored by manipulating the geometry, material, and surface chemistry of the particles and substrates. Optical microscopy was used to examine arrays that were formed in an aqueous suspension. Single or multi-segment metal nanowires (2 12 \u00b5m long and 190-300 nm in diameter) were fabricated by the template electrodeposition process and small molecule, nucleic acid, polyelectrolyte, or silica coating was applied to provide electrostatic repulsions. The silica shell provided a rigid coating that allowed specific core segments to be chemically etched while maintaining the overall particle shape. These particles were referred to as partially etched nanowires (PENs) and assembled in vertical or horizontal arrays as the particle center of mass and aspect ratio were varied. In vertical arrays, nearly 70% of particles were perpendicular to the surface. In horizontal arrays, smectic rows formed and alignment of like segments was observed. Experiment and simulation together suggested that differences in VDW attractions between the particle segments were responsible for this alignment. The rich behavior of the different particle types was explored further by assembling binary mixtures of PENs. Here, the roles of gravity and VDW attractions were emphasized as they dictated the particle orientation in the final observed structure. Particle-substrate interactions were probed by creating patterned assembly surfaces with optical lithography. Microwell patterns were used to improve the percentage of vertically aligned PENs and allowed assemblies to be dried in place. These microwells also enabled the vertical assembly of single segment nanowires which typically oriented parallel to the underlying substrate. Glass surfaces patterned with gold provided high VDW regions that localized nanowire row formation. Finally, a reconfigurable system was explored that used light-induced temperature gradients and VDW/gravitational forces to switch between horizontal and vertical arrays.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10859], "author_name_tesi": "Kirby, David Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Kirby", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "James Hansell Adair"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["van der Waals", "electrostatics", "sedimentation", "gold", "nanotube", "silica", "vertical array", "horizontal array", "microwells"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "To Make Their Journey Better: Research-Focused Aspirations for Preparing Adult Volunteers for Facilitating Positive Youth Development", "id": "10572", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2519", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This basic interpretive qualitative research study explored the personal and professional backgrounds, training experiences, perspectives, and perceptions held by adult volunteers serving as crew advisors in the Venturing program of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).

Chemical treatments were analyzed by means of wetting angle measurements, AFM \nanalyses, and XPS surveys. Several alkali metals and other contaminants were shown to be present on the surface of the samples tested along with a significant amount of carbon, \nimplying organic contamination.

During the course of the investigation, we discovered that the mechanism of antibody-mediated clearance of these closely related subspecies of Bordetella differ significantly. Adoptively transferred serum antibodies cleared the animal pathogen B. bronchiseptica within three days of infection. Antibodies, however, had a minimal effect on human adapted B. pertussis until after the generation of a Th1 response.  Comparative immunobiology of these two subspecies in a mouse model revealed that B. pertussis is initially able to resist antibody-mediated clearance via the expression of pertussis toxin, which modulates the critical immune responses required for this rapid bacterial elimination. This suggests a model in which B. pertussis is able to transiently infect immune individuals and persist in vaccinated populations. This model is supported by epidemiological data indicating frequent epidemics of whooping coughs in highly vaccinated populations. Additionally, this study revealed distinct yet overlapping immune surveillance mechanisms in different areas of the respiratory tract. Together, this study provides important insights into the evolution, adaptation, and epidemiology of B. pertussis. It also aids in developing novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for whooping cough.

While traditional fabrication techniques, notably porogen leaching and gas foaming, have resulted in widely applied and functional scaffolds, such constructs exhibit a large degree of variability and are difficult to replicate more complex, physiological geometries. These limitations have increased interest in additive manufacturing as an alternative, generating significant research and development focus on both scaffold materials and scaffold fabrication techniques. \n\tCurrently, additive manufacturing is split into two major categories: bio (cell) printing, and scaffold printing. While the former relies on gel-based materials, including alginate, collagen, gelatin, Polyethylene Glycol PEG, and mixtures of the above (due to their water solubility, relatively mild printing conditions, and ability to facilitate nutrient transfer to encapsulated cells from the surrounding tissue), the latter has traditionally used thermoplastic, biocompatible polymers such as Poly Capralactone (PCL), Poylactic Acid (PLA), Poly Lactic-co-glycolic Acid (PLGA), as well as ceramics, and metals. The latter are capable of post-print cell seeding or of direct cell recruitment in vivo. The material choice for use in additive manufacturing is determined primarily by the ability to form solid constructs rapidly upon printing through temperature- or pH-regulated gelation, free radical crosslinking, shear thickening, or solidification from a melted state, among other methods.\n\tIn this study, we explore the use of citrate based, thermoset polymers as a new class of materials for additive manufacturing. This study includes the modification of an off-the-shelf 3D printer commonly used for filament extrusion of PLA thermoplastics, with a micro extrusion system consisting of a pressurized pneumatic system, syringe reservoir, and needle extruder. Further, we formulate novel composite bio-inks to facilitate the printing of thermoset, citrate based pre-polymers prior to irreversible crosslinking. This was done to increase the manufacturability of citrate based polymers, allowing these class of materials to expand its suitable tissue scaffold applications. 3D printed constructs were explored as a skin substitute, using additive manufacture allowed thin scaffolds to be manufacture and tested for this application. \n\tThree materials are studied to evaluate printability using the modified printer: PCL, a known printable thermoplastic, Poly-(Octamythlene Citrate) (POC), a well-studied thermoset, and POC-Ca, a thermoset modified with the addition of calcium ions. Composite inks are formed with hydroxyapatite and salt with vary concentrations to determine the optimal concentration for composite inks. The printability study is conducted via evaluations of a printed scaffold by three methods: visual observation of extrudability and filament formation, quantifying the circularity of a single printed layer (demonstrating shape fidelity), and comparison between the theoretical areas of printed holes and their experimentally determined values. Scaffolds were designed for the printability evaluations were 12 mm x 12 mm with 9, 2mm holes, with a scaffold thickness of 0.4 mm. \n\tOverall, results demonstrate that citrate based composites can be designed as functional bio-inks printable to 2 mm resolution into consistent, thin films. Thus, this work demonstrates the ability to adapt additive manufacturing to generate thermoset tissue engineering scaffolds that could not previously be created with traditional manufacturing techniques. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16202], "author_name_tesi": "Kirk, Gerald ", "last_name_ssi": "Kirk", "first_name_ssi": "Gerald", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jian Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jian Yang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["3D Printing", "Additive Manufacturing", "Citrate Base Polymers", "Thermoset", "Skin Scaffold", "Tissue Engineering"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Diagnosing Different Evolutionary Paths for the Development of Mesoscale Convective Vortices\n", "id": "7326", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2972", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Examination of the literature regarding mesoscale convective vortices (MCVs) exposes incongruity over their origin and development.  A vorticity budget analysis conclusively demonstrates that incongruous results are due, at least in part, to different MCV developmental paths. \n\tA study of the dynamics of two numerically generated MCVs for the purpose of comparing their evolution from the initial stages to maturity produced the result that the final MCV structure was achieved from different developmental paths.  Each MCV was diagnosed using model output from the fifth generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU-NCAR) Mesoscale Model 5 (MM5).  The analysis consisted of detailing the dynamics of MCV formation through diagnosis of the traditional vertical vorticity equation.   The results of the study, combined with a  comparison with other studies, led to the conclusion that the same mature MCV structure was produced from a variety of dynamical paths.  \n\tRewriting the traditional form of the relative vertical vorticity equation in terms of momentum advection curl produced an alternative form of the equation.  The re-written equation was used to design a phase- plot depiction of evolutionary growth.  When thermodynamics was included in the phase plot by correlating the path to the heating characteristics of the troposphere, the similarities and differences for MCV cases were diagnosed.\n\tThe application of the phase-plot scheme to several cases showed that, for MCV formation events, there were two interconnected regions that combined to produce the vortex.  The upper-middle and upper troposphere vorticity growth was governed primarily by vertical motion with heating driving the vorticity growth in the upper-middle region.  The lower-middle and lower troposphere vorticity growth was governed primarily by horizontal motion with the vertical heating gradient driving the vorticity growth in the lower-middle region.  In the middle troposphere, evolutionary paths were governed by the relative strengths of heating and heating gradient. \nAdditional phase-plot and mesoscale analysis clarified the characteristics of two MCV formation modes.  In some cases heating drove the complete formation of the MCV, whereas in cases with less heating, upper-level dynamics were vital to MCV formation.       \nIn total, these results helped synthesize the results of other investigators. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2964], "author_name_tesi": "Kirk, James Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Kirk", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John H Clark", "Craig F Bohren", "Hampton Nelson Shirer", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John H Clark, Committee Chair", "Craig F Bohren, Committee Member", "Hampton Nelson Shirer, Committee Member", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["convective", "phase plot", "MCV", "vortices", "vortex", "mesoscale", "convection"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Drawing from Discourse: Autoethnographic Reflections of Race, Gender, and the Practice of Teaching Art", "id": "26548", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11564", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tIn this autoethnographic study, I consider how I, as a White woman teaching art, participate in, maneuver, and manipulate spoken and unspoken racialized and gendered discourses within the context of a high school with a diverse population of students.

Without a good partitioner and with naive mapping of the partitioned processes to the processors in the network, speedups are difficult to achieve on large HPC systems. The data in such simulations is usually in the form of matrices, which can be abstracted as graphs. We propose that considering the geometry of the application graphs as well as the underlying processor network is of vital importance when scaling up.\nAs a first step, the data associated with the problem, abstracted as a graph, needs to be distributed on to the processors in the network. Parallel multilevel partitioners, such as Pt-Scotch and ParMetis, produce good quality partitions but their performance scales poorly. Coordinate bisection schemes such as those in Zoltan, which can be applied only to graphs with coordinates, scale well but partition quality is often compromised. We seek to address this gap by developing a scalable parallel scheme which imparts coordinates to a graph through a lattice-based multilevel embedding. Partitions are computed with a parallel formulation of a geometric scheme that has been shown to provide provably good cuts on certain classes of graphs. We analyze the parallel complexity of our scheme and we observe speed-ups and cut-sizes on large graphs. Our results indicate that our method is substantially faster than ParMetis and Pt-Scotch for hundreds to thousands of processors, while producing high quality cuts.\nWe then consider the problem of mapping irregular applications to multiprocessor architectures whose interconnect topologies affect the latencies of data movement across processor nodes. The starting point for solutions to this problem concern suitable weighted graph representations of an irregular application and a processor topology. Prior works for this problem have demonstrated that graph partitioning approaches can provide high quality solutions. Additionally, when coordinate information is available for the weighted graph of the application, geometric mapping schemes can also provide high quality solutions. We develop and present a scheme that we call \u201cembedded sectioning\u201d that directly computes a locality enhancing embedding of the weighted graph representation which is then mapped to the processor topology using recursive coordinate bisection. Our scheme is specifically directed at gaining high quality mappings for highly irregular applications where the amount of communication can vary greatly. We evaluate the quality of mappings produced by embedded sectioning for mesh-based processor topologies using well accepted measures including congestion, dilation and their product, referred to as communication volume. For a test suite of unit-weight graphs mapped to 32 \u00d7 32 mesh of processors, our method improves congestion by 26%, dilation by 52% and communication volume by 64% relative to the best values of these measures from 9 other schemes. Additionally, we observe that these improvements increase with the increase in the skewness of communication in applications. For a test suite with skewness of 2, corresponding improvements for congestion, dilation and communication volume are 72%, 52% and 87% respectively.\nWe also study the sensitivity of the geometric partitioning schemes for partitioning a graph whose vertices are embedded in 2D/3D space. These parallel schemes typically show high performance on larger number of processors, than other types of parallel partitioning schemes. We specifically consider Recursive Coordinate Bisection and its implementation in Zoltan and ScalaPart implementation of Geometric Mesh Partitioning. The problem of parallel geometric graph partitioning arises in many iterative schemes for finite element methods. The quality of partitions is measured in terms of edges crossing the partitions. Moreover, the partitions should be robust to perturbation of coordinates, bad mesh quality meshes and approximate embedding. Understanding the tradeoffs will help in better usage of the existing parallel geometric partitioning algorithms and also in the development of better parallel geometric partitioning algorithms. In this paper we study a very popular geometric partitioning scheme, Recursive Coordinate Bisection, from the Zoltan package and the recently developed parallel geometric scheme, ScalaPart, based on multiple \u2018sphere\u2019 cuts. We find that both ScalaPart and RCB are affected by the number of tries and refinement respectively. We also find that ScalaPart is more robust in terms of partition quality to perturbation of coordinates, mesh quality and approximate graph embedding. ScalaPart is slower than RCB but shows better speedup unto 32 cores.\nWe conclude with a discussion on how the discovery of geometry for sparse application graphs can lead to the discovery of locality. When the application graph is laid out in a few dimensions, the structure is leveraged to speed and scale up algorithms on HPC systems.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10584], "author_name_tesi": "Kirmani, Shad ", "last_name_ssi": "Kirmani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Padma Raghavan", "Padma Raghavan", "Kamesh Madduri", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Christopher J Duffy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Padma Raghavan, Dissertation Advisor", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Chair", "Kamesh Madduri, Committee Member", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Member", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Parallel computing", "graph partitioning", "topology", "graphs"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Exploring Microchannel Cooling Designs through the uses of Numerical Optimization and Additive Manufacturing", "id": "14700klk5208", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "14700", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Advancing the performance of heat exchangers beyond their current capabilities requires a fresh look into the relationship between design methodologies and manufacturing techniques.  Progress in design tools can lead to the efficient generation of unique geometries optimized for a given application; progress in manufacturing capabilities can turn those unique geometries into reality.  Currently, however, the translation from computational design to as-built manufactured part is rarely one to one.  \nThis work seeks to highlight the effects of both nontraditional and traditional design methodologies on microchannels manufactured using Laser Powder Bed Fusion.  The nontraditional design approach made use of an adjoint-based sensitivity analysis to optimize the shape of four baseline microchannel designs for three different objective functions.  The sensitivity analysis was coupled with a conventional flow solver, and identified regions of the baseline designs that exerted the strongest influence on the objective function.  The shape of those most sensitive regions were then morphed to achieve the optimization goal.  The resultant microchannel geometries were largely reproduced in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion process, though contained a much higher surface roughness than was modeled.  Even still, some of the objective functions were achieved experimentally.  \nA follow-up study was conceived to delve deeper into the efficacy of the design tool, and to isolate the effects of the optimized features from the effects of high surface roughness in the as-built metal parts.  A stereolithography process was used to build the optimized channels in plastic, and allowed for experimentation on the true, intended optimized designs. In general, the adjoint-based sensitivity analysis was successful: experiments on the plastic optimized channels yielded analogous performance to the numerical simulation.  The influence of surface roughness in the metal parts varied depending on the shape changes. \nAnother study was performed that applied a traditional design approach to microchannels containing pin fins.  These arrays were also built using Laser Powder Bed Fusion.  Results from this study highlighted the differences in performance between conventionally and additively manufactured pin fin arrays.  Additionally, the study identified in the additive process a dependence on surface roughness that was based on pin density in the channels; such a manufacturing consideration need not be taken into account with a conventional method.

Current gas turbine engines run at temperatures that far exceed the melting temperature of the components that run the engine. These components are subjected to extremely intense thermal and mechanical stresses. Advancements in the industry are directly tied to allowing even higher operating temperatures. To extend the lifetime of components in this hostile environment, advanced cooling technologies must be implemented, most especially in the first turbine stage, where temperatures are at their highest. One form of cooling technology can be found in inserting pin fin arrays into the internal passageways of turbine blades and vanes. These pin fins add surface area over which heat transfer can take place and promote turbulence within the channels, thereby increasing the heat transfer from the component.\nThis study characterized the contribution to the heat transfer in an array of pin fins that comes from the pin surface itself. Oblong-shaped pins, with a constant height-to-diameter ratio of one, were studied. To gain an understanding of the heat transfer over the pin and correlated flow features through the array, the spanwise, streamwise and Reynolds number were varied. The oblongs were shown to have two regions of high heat transfer, one at the stagnation point of the pin and one immediately before the boundary layer on the surface transitioned to turbulence.

All too often, literary analyses of minority women writers\u2019 works offer reductive and, at times, even inaccurate readings of specific immigrant realities. Such literary criticism posits a continuous and universal female immigrant identity as well as an immutable, inescapable immigrant status. Consequently, analyses of their literary works frequently represent their immigrant experiences as those of perpetual victims trapped at the juncture of an absolute cultural divide between static cultures: that of their culture of origin and of their \u201cguest country.\u201d Other essentializing readers suggest that, in spite of the immigrant woman\u2019s apparent lack of agency, she has felicitous options: after resolving her ethnic conflicts, which include a formulaic critique of the guest country\u2019s culture, these critics presume that the immigrant woman achieves a joyful assimilation or, more accurately, a state of felicitous hybridity in which she consciously chooses the best aspects from each discrete culture and finds fortuitous personal resolution. \nIn this project, I explore writing by the Jewish Argentine writers Cecilia Absatz (1943- ) and Nora Glickman (1944- ), the Turkish German writers Seyran Ate&#351; (1963- ) and Yad\u00e9 Kara (1965- ), and the Chinese American writers Gish Jen 1955- ) and Sigrid Nunez (1951- ). By examining their works through a non-binary rather than a binary lens, this research complicates the logics of incommensurability and stereotypical facile hybridity that have prevailed in the literary analysis of narratives of immigrant women. The readings offered here avoid such dichotomies as inclusion vs. exclusion, majority vs. minority, oppressor vs. oppressed, or the center vs. periphery/margin/fringe/interstice of nations and endeavors, in order to instead enhance the literary criticism of minority writing, to portray minority women as integral members of the nations that many of them have come to view as their home countries. These women writers, as instigators of change who are capable of refashioning the circumstances of their lives, also fashion narratives that present their own critical perspective on their own situation.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3684], "author_name_tesi": "Kirschner, Luz Ang\u00e9lica", "last_name_ssi": "Kirschner", "middle_name_ssi": "Ang\u00e9lica", "first_name_ssi": "Luz", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sophia A Mcclennen", "Djelal Kadir", "Bettina Mathes", "V\u00e9ronique M.

This was an action research study intended:  to develop and implement a professional development program for student affairs professionals to understand whiteness as an important component of anti-racist education; and to examine their process of coming to understand whiteness during the program itself and their own perceptions of the process shortly after the program was over. \n \nThe literature review on whiteness attempted to illuminate the historical associations of whiteness particularly its relationship to power and privilege along with a current definition that also associated the concept with privilege, power relations, and structural advantage.  For these reasons, a theoretical framework that considered power relations in society and ultimately in education was necessary.  Therefore, the ideas put forward with regard to critical theory, critical pedagogy, engaged pedagogy, and most directly an engaged pedagogy of whiteness were essential perspectives that were incorporated as the theoretical lens in this research.\n\nSince this study investigated the process of how student affairs professionals attempted to understand whiteness and white privilege while dealing with diversity issues on campus, it was critical action research that represented an appropriate research design for utilization.  Individual semi-structured interviews and a focus group were the main data collection methods used in this study.  The findings of this action research study were presented in conjunction with the four-step action research cycle (plan, act, observe, and reflect) in order to illustrate and support the action research process. \n \nThe findings were discussed in the above sections in light of three themes:  race and whiteness: the absent presence, learning in action, and making it personal.  The discussion of these themes attempted to highlight two specific areas of this study that are worth further examination.  First, a further look at how the concepts of whiteness and white privilege were included in the study as not only learning material, but also how these concepts operated as an ever-present invisible social construction.  Second, the value of incorporating a critical or engaged pedagogy was considered followed by a discussion of the unexpected merits of utilizing an action research methodology.  The findings of the study were further considered with regard to the implications of the study for practice.\n\nThere were several implications of the findings for the practices of adult education and student affairs that can be considered in light of this study.  They included:  the importance of including whiteness in anti-racist education, value of professional development, need to discuss white identity, value of including participants of color, role of time, and ongoing awareness about impact of whiteness on findings.  As well as future iterations of the action research cycle with the participants included in this study, future research should replicate this study to consider findings with other participants as well.  It should also investigate additional program materials, additional ways to support group interactions, and different program models that have a lesser time commitment, but still value participant discussion.\n  \nA critical or engaged pedagogy was considered in conjunction with action research because the aim was not only to unveil study participants\u2019 meaning of an often unconscious and subtle issue like whiteness, but also to incorporate a process of research that would allow student affairs professionals to get directly involved in an effort that could positively influence their practice.  By evidence of the examples of changes in practice presented by several participants it can be suggested that this study made a difference to some student affairs professionals at one institution of higher education.  Although this study could be viewed as a small start, it could also be viewed as a positive one that illustrates the final and possibly the most important strength of this research \u2013 it mattered.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [315], "author_name_tesi": "Kirshman, Andrea Orwig", "last_name_ssi": "Kirshman", "middle_name_ssi": "Orwig", "first_name_ssi": "Andrea", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Edward W Taylor", "Holly L Angelique", "Glen Alan Mazis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Chair", "Edward W Taylor, Committee Member", "Holly L Angelique, Committee Member", "Glen Alan Mazis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["anti-racist education", "student affairs", "whiteness"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Context-Driven Similarity-Based Retrieval of Cyber Analyst Experiences for Multi-Step Attack Analysis", "id": "17448", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8557", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multi-step  cyber-attacks  on  enterprise  networks  are  gaining  popularity  due  to  their subtlety and longevity that make them hard to detect.

This division of information can discourage students from connecting overarching concepts to the relationship of lived experiences. Therefore, bridging these ideas together helps provide educational significance and personal meaning while encouraging learners to develop a sense of place. My dissertation explores how rural students make these connections through the research and artmaking process. \nIn a semester-long ethnographically informed investigation, I collaborated with an art instructor to research within her high school class, Art Experiences. We used an art integrative place-based framework to guide our inquiry. To ground our research in a classroom setting, we modeled the curriculum after art educator and theorist Julia Marshall\u2019s (2014a) art integrative transdisciplinary approach\u2014Art Research Integration (ARI). \nARI positions students as artist-researchers who independently explore topics of interest through thematic investigation. This process encourages learners to connect overarching concepts with their lives outside of school. Following Marshall\u2019s model, students in our study embraced the artist-researcher role. To support lived experiences from a cultural and geographic perspective, we intertwined ARI with place-based inquiry. Its inclusion aimed to foster learners\u2019 curiosity about the surrounding rural area. Through investigation of an individualized locally-themed question, each student followed a unique research trail. Learners documented their research in sketchbooks which provided them a space to brainstorm ideas, create concept maps, and archive resources. Students drew sketches to express what they had learned from their exploration. Using their sketches as inspiration, students created works of art to complement their research findings. \nDuring my inquiry, I examined how students explored diverse academic subjects, their interests, and the local area using an art integrative place-based approach. I focused on explicating how and in what ways learners wove together academic disciplinary knowledge, how ARI facilitated a transdisciplinary process of learning, and the ways using a place-based rural perspective helped to understand learner decision making better. Answering these questions provided insight into the ways learners became artist-researchers, understood content interconnectivity, and linked lived experience with place to enhance personal meaning. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16461], "author_name_tesi": "Kiser, Kathleen Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Kiser", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kimberly Anne Powell", "Kimberly Anne Powell", "Christine M Thompson", "Mary Ann Stankiewicz", "Scott P Mcdonald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kimberly Anne Powell, Dissertation Advisor", "Kimberly Anne Powell, Committee Chair", "Christine M Thompson, Committee Member", "Mary Ann Stankiewicz, Committee Member", "Scott P Mcdonald, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": [": art integration", "transdisciplinary", "place-based", "rural education"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Utilizing Qualitative and Quantitative Methods to Shed Light on the Relational Influences of Yoga On and Off the Matt", "id": "14714mzk191", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14714", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Throughout the last few decades, the mind-body practice of yoga has seen an unprecedented rise in popularity both from the general population and the scientific community. Despite the wide-array of salutary health benefits that have been demonstrated, a clear void is present in the yoga literature investigating the ways in which yoga impacts connections with oneself and social relationships (which are invaluable for one\u2019s health and wellbeing). The overarching goal of this dissertation was to examine the influences of yoga practice on the widely neglected \u201crelational\u201d (intra- and interpersonal) outcomes. Utilizing a mixed methods approach, the three studies which comprised this dissertation sought to gather unique perspectives to accumulate pre-experimental evidence for the relational benefits of yoga.\nStudy 1 was a qualitative study which investigated the ways in which community-dwelling yoga practitioners perceived and experienced the relational influences of yoga. Through open-ended questions (n=107) and in-depth interviews (n=12), four emerging themes were identified, culminating in the development of a conceptual model of how yoga may work to bring about relational benefits. Study 2 extended this line of inquiry through a 21-day daily diary study, examining the associations of daily yoga practice with mindfulness, (self-)compassion, and social connectedness, to better understand how relational benefits would manifest in regular practitioners of yoga (n=104) in a real world setting. Multilevel analyses indicated that on days when an individual practiced more yoga than their usual, greater mindfulness and self-compassion were reported, which, in turn, predicted enhanced interpersonal outcomes (i.e., compassion and social connectedness). Study 3 examined the role of trait mindfulness in impacting yoga\u2019s relational benefits in yoga na\u00efve practitioners (n=21) participating in a semester long yoga course to better understand for whom and when yoga works. Multivariate time-series analyses demonstrated that on yoga practice days, those with low trait mindfulness observed decreases in relational outcomes specifically, across the first half of the 15-week academic yoga course, whereas those in the high mindfulness group reaped positive relational influences, with effects for self-compassion sustained at the end of the semester. \nCollectively, this dissertation shed light on the understudied relational aspects of yoga, underscoring the value of employing diverse methodological approaches. The findings demonstrate relational benefits are: (1) perceived and experienced through daily yoga practice across diverse yoga styles and experiences, (2) \u201cdynamic\u201d phenomena varying substantially within-persons over time and in sync with daily yoga practice, and (3) realized differently for people depending on their level of dispositional mindfulness. While further prospective and experimental research is warranted to corroborate these preliminary findings, a routine yoga practice appears to hold promise in having a positive impact (on and off the mat) on preserving and strengthening the intra- and interpersonal connections which constitute the building blocks of our daily lives. As such, yoga could serve as a promising intervention to promote a \u201cwholesome life\u201d across diverse populations. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15677], "author_name_tesi": "Kishida, Moe ", "last_name_ssi": "Kishida", "first_name_ssi": "Moe", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steriani Elavsky", "Steriani Elavsky", "Scherezade K.

The overarching aim of the present study was to identify resilient resources in coping with the MT through a positive and multi-dimensional lens. Specifically, the study was designed to unveil potential underlying pathways of the physical activity and menopausal symptom association to better understand the critical question of \u201cwhether, how, for whom, and under what circumstances\u201d physical activity may help ameliorate symptoms. Community-dwelling middle-aged women (N=103; age range 40-60 years) completed daily Internet surveys at the end of the day and wore an accelerometer for the objective assessment of physical activity for 21 days.

Data access costs dominate the execution times of most parallel applications and they are expected to be even more important in the future. Under these circumstances, the organization of data and computation across available resources becomes a major effect on the performance of the overall system. This dissertation explores the reorganization problem from a hardware-aware perspective to fully harness the underlying architecture and demonstrates various methods to improve the memory performance. These methods span both both domain-specific solutions for some memory-intensive kernels of high importance as well as domain-agnostic optimization techniques.\n\nThis dissertation approaches the problem of reorganization from two different perspectives. While the traditional methods of organization for data and computation, namely mapping and scheduling, remain highly influential and beneficial; we also evaluate the idea of approximate computing in this context and reorganize data and computation based on their predicted importance. Our exploration includes following steps. On the domain-specific side; we apply mapping, scheduling and data layout reorganization techniques to the sparse matrix vector multiplication problem.

For example, when an internal stimulus, such as taste, is paired with illness ( an internally applied reinforcer ), rats develop strong conditioned aversion. However, pairing an external stimulus like the size of the food pellet with illness results in only weak or no aversion. Conversely, pairing an internal stimulus such as taste with an externally applied reinforcer, such as shock, results in weak or ineffective conditioning but pairing an external stimulus such as the size of the pellet, with an externally applied reinforcer, such as shock, results in strong conditioning (Chapter 1). These findings led Garcia to propose that evolution has shaped the nervous system so that certain kinds of stimuli are more easily associated with certain classes of reinforcers (selective associative learning). Nevertheless, subsequent studies have shown that pairing of large contextual changes (External stimulus) with illness can cause conditioned context aversions in rats, raising questions about the limits of selective associative learning. The aim of present studies was to discover if conditioned aversion can be seen when discrete visual cues are paired with illness using mice rather than rats as subjects (Chapters 3, 4 and 5). We paired visual cues with illness (produced by injection of lithium chloride) using genetically heterogeneous mice and obtained strong aversion to a novel container (CS) after a single conditioning trial (Chapters 3, 4 and 5). Moreover, strong conditioned context aversion was also demonstrated even when there was a 30- minute delay between the presentation of the CS and the UCS, just as occurs in conditioned taste aversion experiments. In Chapter 4, we compared duration of retention in conditioned context aversion (CCA) and conditioned taste aversion (CTA). The results provide very little evidence that conditioned taste aversion is retained for longer than conditioned context aversion. In our experiments, we only investigated one part of the theory of selective associative learning. More specifically, we examined whether pairing an external stimulus (such as a visual cue) with an internally applied reinforcer (illness) would result in strong conditioned aversion. We did not examine whether pairing an internal stimulus (such as taste) with an externally applied reinforcer (such as shock) would likewise result in strong aversion. Although our experiments are thus limited to one particular form of learning (pairing an external stimulus to an internally applied reinforcer), many previous experiments have also dealt with one aspect of selective associative learning (Garcia, Ervin, & Koelling, 1966; Gemberling & Domjan, 1982; Rescorla, 2008). In addition, the results of Chapter 6 show that a conditioned context preference can be formed when sucrose solution is used as a positive reinforcer. However, the retention is short-lived (only 6 hours). Development of contextual aversion conditioning protocols for mice will enable the molecular resources available for this species to be exploited in studies of this kind of learning and representation of the CS by discrete (e.g. a visual stimulus) rather than multi-modal stimuli offers more focus when considering relevant brain regions to explore.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11298, 11299], "author_name_tesi": "Kislal, Sezen ", "last_name_ssi": "Kislal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sezen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A Blizard", "Byron C Jones", "David John Vandenbergh", "Frederick Martin Brown", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David A Blizard, Dissertation Advisor", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Member", "Frederick Martin Brown, Committee Member", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli, Committee Member", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Selective associative learning", "Conditioned context aversion", "Conditioned taste aversion", "Laboratory mice"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Rampant Modernism and its Cityscapes: Alfred D\u00f6blin's Berlin Alexanderplatz, Robert Musil's Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften, Ahmet Hamdi Tanp&#305;nar's Saatleri Ayarlama Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc\n\n", "id": "12072", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2456", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigates the nature of literary Modernism and social modernity through three modernist novels that represent analogous historical ruptures and conditions in early twentieth-century Vienna, Berlin, and Istanbul.

In the history of the brain, the pre-Vesalian period between the turn of the 16th century and 1543 has either been denigrated for its medieval emphasis on the antiquated theory of the inner senses and symbolic images or praised for its more modern use of the techniques of dissection and visually accurate representations.  Texts like the Mirror of Medicine and Fieldbook of Surgery, however, present the brain through the inner senses, dissection and visually accurate images.  In order to account for these diverse presentations, I use theories of allegory and emblem to explain the simultaneous presence of multiple epistemic styles. \n\nIn addition to this unique approach that uses allegory and emblem to explore the history of medicine, surgery, and the brain, I provide evidence that questions the historical emphasis on Fries\u2019 and denigration of Gersdorff\u2019s text while offering a fruitful method of understanding knowledge forms in medicine and surgery in the early 16th Century.  I show that a medieval allegorical thought style classified signs within a hierarchy of knowledge that moved through the hierarchically ordered signifying structures of gesture, image, and word, each separating the subject by degrees from the ideal object knowable in one\u2019s intellectual faculty.  Prior to the 16th Century, the proper performance of the inner senses of common sense, imagination, reason and memory helped the intellect use these faculties to bridge the gap between thought and object and can be seen in Fries\u2019 allegorical medieval medicine.  Gersdorff\u2019s surgical manual, however, teaches by moving between the equally valuable domains of speech, writing and print, images and gestures, thereby relating fragmented signs emblematically.\n\nFour main chapters explore the performativity and theatricality of words, images, and gestures that represent the brain in the early 16th Century.  After an introduction to the authors, texts, and milieu, The Inner Senses: from Allegory to Emblem provides the theoretical foundation for the use of allegory and emblem to understand the performativity and theatricality of knowledge of the brain found in Fries and Gersdroff\u2019s texts.  Knowing the Brain in the Early 16th Century explores medical and surgical discourses and the performative aspects of diagnosis, treatment, and proper performance of the inner senses whereby doctor, surgeon, and patient moved through common sense, imagination, reason, and memory.  The Theatricality of the Head and Brain in the Early 16th Century argues that in the 16th Century, the brain did not yet exist as an isolated object but should be understood in a conceptual relationship to the allegory of the head.  Finally, The Brain as Emblem provides an emblematic reading of the oft-ignored fugitive sheet in Gersdorff\u2019s text and demonstrates an alternate future to the brain\u2019s fragmentary and enigmatic construction that influences late 16th Century cerebral anatomy as well as Philip Melanchthon\u2019s Protestant education reforms.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2544], "author_name_tesi": "Kismet Bell, Jameson Bradley", "last_name_ssi": "Kismet Bell", "middle_name_ssi": "Bradley", "first_name_ssi": "Jameson", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Michael Hagner", "Joan Landes", "Dennis Schmidt", "Barry Richard Page Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Chair", "Michael Hagner, Committee Member", "Joan Landes, Committee Member", "Dennis Schmidt, Committee Member", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["History of Medicine", "History of Surgery", "History of the Brain", "Renaissance Epistemology", "Art History", "Visualization", "Performance Studies", "Ventricle Theory", "Lorenz Fries", "Hans von Gersdorff", "Inner Senses", "German Literature"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Theoretical and Computer Simulation Insights into Stimuli-Responsive Polymer Systems\n", "id": "7957", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "275", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The phase behavior of temperature-responsive polymers with tunable lower critical solution temperatures (LCST) and light-responsive polymers was explored using statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. \n\nThe LCST in water of (ethylene oxide)/ethylene copolymers is tailored by their\nchemical composition, specifically by the balance of hydrophilic to\nhydrophobic groups in the polymer.

This dissertation comprises three individual studies: Parts 1 and 2 utilize ancient and modern DNA to elucidate the domestication histories of two important North American crop plants, chenopod (Chenopodium berlandieri Moq., Chenopodiaceae), and bottle gourd (Laganeria siceraria [Molina] Standl., Cucurbitaceae). Part 3 is an experimental study conducted to understand the effects of pathogenic stress on the formation of silica phytoliths in gourd/squash (Cucurbita pepo L., Cucurbitaceae), and potential implications for archaeological phytolith analyses.\nIn Part 1, I test whether chenopod, an important prehistoric starchy seed crop in the Eastern Woodlands of North America was locally and independently domesticated, or whether it was introduced from Mesoamerica, where morphologically identical crops are grown today. I conclude that it was native to the Eastern Woodlands, and argue that this finding strengthens the existing evidence for eastern North America as an entirely independent center of plant domestication.\nIn Part 2, I test competing hypotheses regarding the arrival and proliferation of bottle gourds, one of the world\u2019s earliest and most broadly distributed crop plants, in the New World. I conclude that bottle gourds traveled on ocean currents from their native Africa to the New World during the Pleistocene, established genetically diverse naturalized populations, and underwent multiple domestication events in the Americas during the Holocene.\nIn Part 3, I extract and analyze silica phytoliths from wild gourd fruits grown in controlled experimental conditions to test for morphological changes driven by two common diseases. I find that pathogenic stress has the potential to significantly impact phytolith size in ways that might confound archaeological phytolith analyses.

Heart failure significantly changes and impacts life for the patient and family. Heart failure requires complex home medical management that is often interrupted with frequent hospital admissions for acute exacerbations. While providing this critically important care, informal caregivers face significant threats to their own health, including psychological, physical, and financial distress. Little is known regarding the \u201cwork\u201d of caregiving. There were no identified studies in the literature that evaluated the spousal caregiving experience over time in the context of the unpredictable and uncertain illness progression of heart failure.\nThe purpose of this study was to define the types of work experienced in long term spousal caregiving in older adults across the illness progression of heart failure utilizing qualitative methodology.  The goal of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of the types of work in spousal caregiving specifically defining the types of work manifested over the course of 12-14 months of caregiving.  The second goal of this study was to generate a middle range theory of spousal caregiving in heart failure.  \n\nMethods:  This study was a qualitative secondary analysis of a larger longitudinal study on the palliative care needs of older patients with heart failure and their spousal caregivers (Hupcey, PI).  The in-depth serial interview data of 20 spousal caregivers collected monthly over a period of 12-14 months were analyzed utilizing the tenets of qualitative grounded theory methodology.  The spousal caregivers ranged in age from 46-78 with a mean age of 67.  The care recipients ranged in age from 62-79 with a mean age of 70.   Fourteen of the caregivers were female and 6 were male.  Length of time in the caregiving role from the beginning of the study ranged from 2 months to 9 years.\n\nResults:  The types of work experienced varied dynamically each month over the 12-14 month period. The seven main thematic concepts, work of providing care, work of living with the illness, the work of navigating the system, the work of maintaining self, the work of managing the household, the work of vigilance, and, the work of normalcy, support the basic social process of caring for a spouse across the illness progression of heart failure and informed the emergence of the core variable of Committed Obligation and subsequent theory of the Process of Committed Obligation.. \n\nConclusion:  The results of this study demonstrate that the needs of the couples, especially the caregiver, require more than a brief contact with the healthcare provider and healthcare providers should recognize cues in the clinical encounters that could lead to specific needs driven interventions.  The findings of this study illustrate that the caregiver moves with the spouse during the course of the illness and when there is an exacerbation or instability the needs of the caregiver escalate in tandem with the care recipient but may be manifested in different ways.  Caregivers should be assessed for unmet needs throughout the course of heart failure not just at exacerbations or hospitalizations. Caregivers and patients with advanced heart failure may benefit from specific models of supportive care throughout the trajectory of heart failure.  Comprehensive models of care, which focus on quality of life, symptom control, and psychosocial support for patients and their caregivers in the midst of active treatment should be developed. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3681], "author_name_tesi": "Kitko, Lisa A.", "last_name_ssi": "Kitko", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Lisa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith E Hupcey", "Judith E Hupcey", "Janice Lee Penrod", "Susan Jayne Loeb", "Robert William Schrauf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith E Hupcey, Dissertation Advisor", "Judith E Hupcey, Committee Chair", "Janice Lee Penrod, Committee Member", "Susan Jayne Loeb, Committee Member", "Robert William Schrauf, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["heart failure", "caregiving", "older adult"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Factors Affecting the Intentions of Voters to Participate in Internet Voting Systems\n", "id": "10672", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1526", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to identify and explore factors that affect the intentions of potential voters to participate in Internet voting systems in the U.

The U.S. healthcare system could not sustain the financial or human resources necessary to meet the needs of care recipients who are dying without the assistance of informal family caregivers. End-of-life caregivers pay a price\u2014emotional, social, financial, and physical\u2014throughout the caregiving process. Many factors contribute to the cost of caregiving, such as caregiver distress and burden. Despite the extensive scientific literature on caregiving at the end of life, necessary evidence to inform nursing science in ways that adequately and appropriately support and sustain those healthy informal family caregivers providing end-of-life care remains unknown. No research to date has approached this problem from a linguistic standpoint. This study used discourse-based analysis to examine a qualitative secondary dataset to understand which aspects of self (caregiver) and other (care recipient) are revealed through caregiver discourse and how a caregiver\u2019s perception of self and the care recipient change over time. Principles of discourse analysis were applied to develop an analytic framework and explore the linguistic cues (i.e., grammar, reference, identity, deixis, stance, indexicality and agency) expressed by a caregiver in their role as caregiver. Findings demonstrated the usefulness of a discourse-based analytic method as a new approach in the re-use of large qualitative secondary datasets. In addition, linguistic cues were revealed about how a caregiver perceives self and the care recipient over time. Results established an analytic framework that can be applied to a larger sample of this dataset to more deeply and precisely reveal discursive cues within one End-of-Life Caregiving Trajectory (expected-death) and across all three trajectories (expected-death, unexpected-death and mixed-death). Understanding a caregiver\u2019s discursive cues may give clinicians the ability to better identify subtle yet important expressions of caregivers\u2019 perception of self and others in the caregiving role. Further analysis is needed to identify how these linguistic patterns can lead to interventions that support informal family caregivers.

In its abstract form, the agora became a synonym of a perfect public space which was, by the sheer power of its existence, able to produce a democratic society of utopian qualities. But historical evidence shows that ancient Greek democracy was - similar to our own experience with the public sphere - riddled with partisan politics and personal interests. The normative ideal necessarily collided with social reality on the ground. Starting with classical Athens, this study explores different historical metamorphoses of the agora as its heritage was gradually passed to us through the urban communes of the High Medieval period, Renaissance Venice, and London in the golden age of its coffeehouses. The historical-empirical excursion ends in Philadelphia, tracing its transformation from a colonial town to an early industrial metropolis. In collecting historical-empirical evidence, this study relies exclusively on primary sources. In each studied case, the public sphere is conceptualized as the synergetic confluence of information flows mediated through evolving communication technologies and face-to-face encounters which take place within the physical container of various urban forms. In conclusion, the comparative analysis presents two archetypes of Western democracies and implicitly two corresponding archetypical public spheres as they gradually evolved in the West: (a) the classical republican ideal which was originally conceived in Athens and reached its full bloom in the historical reality of Renaissance Venice; and (b) mass democracy which was ushered in gradually through the experience of \u2018early modern\u2019 London, finding its fulfillment in the post-Revolutionary Philadelphia, and as an ideal still holds normative power over Western political imagination. In tracing the historical metamorphosis of the agora, this study focuses on the evolving concept of public opinion; examines the way different societies attempted to solve the conflict of private and public interests within the public sphere; analyzes spatial relationships between dominant urban centres and their local and global peripheries; sheds more light on the social determination of communication technologies; and reveals the historical roots of the articulation of democratic ideals with capitalism.  \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3069], "author_name_tesi": "Kittler, Juraj ", "last_name_ssi": "Kittler", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Juraj", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ronald V Bettig", "Ronald V Bettig", "Jorge R Schement", "Amit Schejter", "Deryck William Holdsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ronald V Bettig, Dissertation Advisor", "Ronald V Bettig, Committee Chair", "Jorge R Schement, Committee Member", "Amit Schejter, Committee Member", "Deryck William Holdsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["London", "Venice", "public sphere", "historical evolution", "communication technologies", "urban historical geography", "comparative study", "Agora", "Athens", "Philadelphia"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EFFECT OF CORN PARTICLE SIZE MILLING ON BROILER, PULLET, AND LAYER GROWTH, PERFORMANCE, AND DIGESTIBILITY", "id": "14798ldk14", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14798", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Corn particle size (PS) is a relatively unexplored topic regarding its impact on commercial poultry performance grown for meat or eggs. Additionally, there are potential feed fabrication aspects to consider as mills could potentially save machine energy, wear, and money by modifying PS. The objectives of the following studies were to: 1) assess hammer mill energy usage and economic efficiency grinding corn to different geometric mean diameters (GMD), 2) evaluate the nutrient digestibility, growth performance, and carcass characteristics of broiler chickens fed treatment GMD corn, and 3) evaluate the growth and performance of pullets and subsequent productivity and egg quality of laying hens fed corn GMD treatments. Cooperator feed mill Wenger Feeds, LLC (Rheems, PA) delivered two batches of corn ground to 600, 900, 1200, and 1500 \u00b5m by hammer mill. Energy and machine efficiency show larger PS (1200 and 1500 \u00b5m) lend themselves to greater efficiency, tonnes per hour (TPH) throughput, and lower cost/tonne than 600 and 900 \u00b5m. Four live bird studies followed: First, a broiler digestibility study was conducted where apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and true ileal digestibility (TID), which are ways to measure the ability of amino acids to be absorbed into the bloodstream through the gastrointestinal tract, and were measured to determine level of nutrient absorption through the small intestine of 35 day old male broilers. Second, a broiler floor pen study at commercial bird density was performed with crumbled and pelleted diets. Birds fed the 600 and 900 \u00b5m corn diets showed increased body weight (BW) and body weight gain (BWG) but no significant differences between treatments for feed intake (FI) or feed conversion ratio (FC). In a third study, commercial egg laying pullet chicks fed the 600 \u00b5m corn through to maturity had consistently heavier BW than those of other PS treatments. Lastly, from 19 \u2013 43 weeks of age, hens in conventional cages were fed corn based treatment diets formulated in a phase fed program, with diets consisting of 50-60% ground treatment corn.

The current study examined the impact of the mother-infant relationship on infant and maternal stress physiology through examination of sympathetic and adrenocortical responses to infant challenge. A sample of 284 mother-infant dyads was selected from families participating in a large, multi-site study of child development under conditions of rural poverty.  During a home visit, mothers and infants participated in a free-play session and a series of infant challenge tasks to elicit distress to novelty and frustration.  Observational coding of maternal sensitivity, intrusiveness, and detachment were conducted from digital recordings of the free-play and infant behavioral reactivity and regulation were coded from DVDs of the challenge tasks.  Saliva samples were collected before, 20-, and 40-minutes after the challenge tasks and assayed for salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and cortisol.  Symptoms of maternal depression and anxiety were assessed using the Brief Symptom Index (BSI).  A growth mixture modeling technique was applied to sAA and cortisol data.  Analyses were controlled for sampling time of day, demographic factors, health behaviors, and medication use. In general, there were more associations with infant and maternal behaviors for infant physiology than for maternal stress physiology.  Infant reactivity and regulatory behaviors interacted to predict infant sAA and cortisol response to challenge.  Infants displaying both high behavioral reactivity and regulatory behavior were more likely to have low, non-reactive sAA levels and cortisol reactivity with recovery.  In contrast, low reactive infants (i.e., little fussing) displaying few regulatory behaviors tended to show sAA increases and were less likely to display cortisol reactivity.  Infants of highly detached mothers tended to display low and non-reactive sAA levels, while infants of highly anxious mothers more often showed sAA increases. Mothers of boys were more likely to have higher baseline cortisol levels than mothers of girls. Physiological attunement in mother-infant dyads was found for baseline levels of sAA and cortisol, but not between profiles of reactivity to the challenge.  The present study has implications for understanding how early mother-infant relationships in high-risk environments can influence the development of stress physiological systems.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3547], "author_name_tesi": "Kivlighan, Katie Therese", "last_name_ssi": "Kivlighan", "middle_name_ssi": "Therese", "first_name_ssi": "Katie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas A Granger", "Elizabeth Susman", "John Walter Graham", "Laura Klein", "Clancy Blair"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas A Granger, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth Susman, Committee Member", "John Walter Graham, Committee Member", "Laura Klein, Committee Member", "Clancy Blair, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["salivary alpha-amylase", "salivary cortisol", "stress reactivity", "mother-infant relationship", "maternal behavior", "temperament"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Examination of the mechanism of parvovirus B19 NS1 induced cellular toxicity. \n\n", "id": "10519", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6480", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Human parvovirus B19 is a ubiquitous infectious agent known to cause erythema infectiosum in children. Numerous clinical observations have also linked the virus to diverse idiopathic conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like syndromes, a variety of rheumatic manifestations, liver and kidney disease. Tissues identified as non-permissive for B19 replication have been shown to harbor genomic evidence of B19 infection for extended periods of time. Although such non-permissive cells display an inability to produce viral structural proteins and replicate the viral genome, curiously these same tissues allow for transcription and translation of the B19 non-structural protein 1 (NS1). As the sole chaperone of all major steps in the viral life cycle and mediator of cytotoxicity in mammalian cells, the persistence of NS1 in replication non-permissive tissues may be responsible for many of the non-hematological conditions associated with parvovirus B19 infection. \n\tIn this dissertation, I examine the mechanism of B19 NS1-induced cytotoxicity. I hypothesize that the endonuclease activity encoded in the B19 NS1 protein is responsible for B19 NS1-induced cytotoxicity in mammalian cells. To examine this hypothesis, I generated a homology model of B19 NS1, which demonstrated the spatial localization and key residues in the endonuclease active site of B19 NS1 as well as the ATP binding region of the protein. Residues in the putative metal coordination motif of the endonuclease active site were mutated in order to abrogate this catalytic function. Abrogation of the endonuclease active site was shown to disrupt B19 NS1-induced cell cycle arrest in the S phase, reduce B19 NS1-induced DNA damage and subsequent apoptotic cell death. The DNA damage induced by B19 NS1 was suggested to be single-strand breaks, as would be expected if the protein were nicking cellular DNA with the endonuclease active site. Together, these experiments showed that the endonuclease activity of B19 NS1 upon cellular DNA is partially responsible for B19 NS1-induced cytotoxicity. \n\tAn additional amino acid substitution in B19 NS1 was examined for its effect on B19 NS1-induced cytotoxicity. B19 genotypes 1 and 3 have been associated with fulminant hepatitis, in contrast to genotype 2. Substitution I181M, only observed in B19 genotype 2 NS1 proteins, was introduced into a genotype 1 background of NS1. The NS1 protein with the I181M substitution was less toxic to mammalian cells in culture, suggesting that this substitution in genotype 2 NS1 proteins may reduce their ability to kill liver cells and thereby cause fulminant hepatitis. Together, these studies support the hypothesis that direct NS1-induced cellular damage contributes to non-hematological conditions associated with parvovirus B19 infection. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6478], "author_name_tesi": "Kivovich, Violetta ", "last_name_ssi": "Kivovich", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Violetta", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Kester, Ph D", "Mark Kester", "Stanley J Naides", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Robert G Levenson", "Leslie Joan Parent"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Kester, Ph D, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Kester, Committee Chair", "Stanley J Naides, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["homology modeling", "B19", "NS1", "apoptosis", "DNA damage", "parvovirus", "singla-strand breaks"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Optical Propagation through the Ocean Surface", "id": "14768", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7556", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Usage of the laser in the studies through the ocean is very widespread and the each steps of the laser propagation through the ocean is a major topic to be analyzed independently.

In most mammals, the pisiform is elongated, forms from two centers of ossification, has minimal sliding mobility, and articulates with the ulna and triquetral. Variability in these characteristics often accompany specialized forms of locomotion or a novel grasping mechanism, although the association between pisiform morphology and locomotion has not been well described previously. Hominoids possess an array of derived pisiform characteristics, the most drastic of which is the short, pea-shaped human pisiform that forms from only a single ossification center. This study utilizes osteological, histological, and developmental studies to assess possible developmental mechanisms underlying human pisiform reduction and establish the homology of the human ossification center with respect to the two ossification centers in other primates. The typical mammalian pisiform, as studied in mice, forms a growth plate between the two ossification centers indicating that humans have lost an ossification center and associated growth plate. When compared to ossification in other primates, determined by dental stage, the human pisiform ossifies in the same time frame expected of the epiphysis in other species. Additionally, the pisiform and calcaneus are paralogous structures in the wrist and ankle. The human pisiform forms at approximately the same time as the calcaneus epiphysis, further establishing the human pisiform as homologous to the epiphysis in other species. Reduced pisiforms have also been identified in mice with mutations to Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 genes. Investigation of the pisiform growth plates reveals that both Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 have dosage-dependent effects on organization of the columnar zone chondrocytes. Hoxd11 mutations also result in a diminished hypertrophic zone and an irregular ossification front. While these genes are unlikely to explain the mechanism behind the reduced human pisiform, they may underlie other morphological variation including short pisiforms in species that retain two ossification centers, such as the orangutan. This also establishes that growth plates, and wrist morphology in particular, can be sensitive to much smaller changes in Hox11 dosage than previously established.

Macrophages are early targets of viral infection, and because they are relatively resistant to the cytopathic effects induced by HIV-1 infection, they serve as potential sites of long-term viral infection in addition to playing a major role in the development of pathologies such as AIDS dementia complex. \nMonocytic precursor cells differentiate in response to antigen-specific stimuli within a tissue microenvironment into phenotypically distinct macrophage subsets.  We have investigated the transcriptional response of HIV-1 in two of these populations, classically and alternatively activated macrophages.  Our data indicate that HIV-1 transcription is suppressed in alternatively activated populations that were generated by treating bone marrow derived macrophages with IL-4 when compared to classically activated populations cultured in the presence of IFN-\u0192\u00d7 and LPS.  Additionally HIV-1 transcription was increased in cells lacking stk, a cellular receptor noted for its anti-inflammatory activity.  These results indicate that the phenotypic characteristics of a macrophage population can directly influence HIV-1 transcription.  \nTo specifically explore the mechanisms by which cellular signals can suppress HIV-1 transcription we use a cell line expressing the receptor tyrosine kinase RON (U937 RON), which has been shown to negatively regulate HIV-1 transcription.  Our data indicate that RON suppresses HIV-1 replication by promoting RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) pausing, and preventing chromatin re-organization, and nucleosome remodeling.  Furthermore, increased binding of the negative elongation factor subunit NELF-E was correlated with decreased Pol II processivity, suggesting a possible mechanism for the ability of RON to suppress HIV-1 transcription elongation.  The targeting of Pol II processivity by RON signaling also suggests a more general mechanism which RON may employ to negatively regulate other genes such as IL-12p40, and iNOS.\nAdditionally, we explore the status of the elongation complex on the HIV-1 LTR in a suppressed virus state using the latently infected cell line U1.  We show that RNA Pol II pausing is induced early in provirus transcription before formation of the TAR element at approximately +40 bp and that NELF is instrumental in maintaining this pause.  Depleting NELF using siRNA results in enhanced transcription elongation, histone acetylation, and nucleosome remodeling, indicating that transcription elongation and chromatin remodeling are coupled events.  Our results suggest a novel role for NELF in repression of early HIV-1 provirus transcription that is different from that previously suggested by transient expression assays.\nTaken together, these results demonstrate that cellular signals can negatively regulate HIV-1 transcription by targeting the elongation complex, leading to a suppressed or latent virus phenotype.  Our data, for the first time, indicate a Tat independent role for NELF in maintaining Pol II pausing at the HIV-1 LTR that would be similar to other cellular genes that are regulated by transcription elongation.  These studies further show that cellular signals, such as RON, can actively induce a reversible pause of the RNA Pol II complex to suppress HIV-1 replication and affords us a system in which to study signaling mechanisms and biochemical requirements required to establish viral latency.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [163], "author_name_tesi": "Klatt, Alicia J", "last_name_ssi": "Klatt", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Alicia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Avery August", "Pamela Correll", "Richard John Frisque", "David Scott Gilmour"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Pamela Correll, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["RNA Polymerase II", "Transcription", "Macrophages", "HIV", "NELF", "RON"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Comparison of the Tornadic and Nontornadic Supercells Intercepted by VORTEX2 on 10 June 2010", "id": "22731", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10000", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "On the evening of 10 June 2010, VORTEX2 collected a rare set of observations of nontornadic (2345\u20130040 UTC) and tornadic supercells (0110\u20130230 UTC) evolving in close proximity to each other in northeastern Colorado. To analyze these supercells, we use single- and dual-Doppler radar, mobile mesonet, StickNet, and mobile sounding data. We strive to understand why one supercell produced no tornadoes and the other at least two, by comparing the storms\u2019 environments, outflow temperatures, storm kinematics, and interactions with other convection.  Additionally, for the tornadic supercell, we study the evolution of the two tornadoes and the following periods of cyclic mesocyclogenesis.\n\nThe storms developed in environments with a low likelihood of significant tornadoes but within climatology for weak tornadoes.  The only environmental parameter showing a significant difference between the two storm environments was low-level storm-relative helicity, which was larger in the environment of the tornadic supercell and may have made tornadogenesis more favorable.  Virtual potential temperature deficits in the outflow were qualitatively similar for the two storms, both within the normal range for a weakly tornadic supercell.  After a few hours, new convection developed along the outflow between the two storms.  The nontornadic supercell experienced a merger with one of these new cells, and this merger led to the supercell\u2019s demise.  Had the merger not occurred, the nontornadic supercell might have had the opportunity to produce a tornado, given the similarities in environment and outflow characteristics to the tornadic supercell.   Outflow from the new convection impinged on the northern flank of the tornadic storm and may have made tornadogenesis more likely by enhancing convergence or baroclinity in this storm.

Throughout my dissertation I focused on three directions of elongation. The first, Spt4/5 in archaea, eukaryotes, and bacteria (NusG), is the only conserved elongation factor in all three domains of life. Here, I report the X-ray crystal structure of the Pyrococcus furiosus Spt4/5 complex solved at 1.8 \u00c5 resolution. This is the first complete Spt4/5 X-ray crystal structure containing Spt4 (zinc and N-terminal NusG (NGN) binding domains) and the Spt5 N-terminal, linker and C-terminal Kyprides-Ouzounis-Woese (KOW) domains. Spt4 contacts Spt5 through the linker, KOW, and NGN. Thus, Spt4 may restrict the location of the KOW with respect to the Spt5NGN domain, suggesting the Spt5 linker between NGN and KOW is rigid. With our collaborators we solved a cryo-EM reconstruction of Spt4/5-archaeal RNAP (aRNAP) and engineered a model of the Spt4/5-aRNAP elongation complex providing new features about Spt4/5.\nThe second direction is RNA synthesis, occurs during transcription elongation, is not foolproof and incorrect bases can be introduced. Removal of mismatches occurs by a proofreading mechanism. I demonstrate that aRNAP is capable of intrinsic and TFS-enhanced RNA cleavage of a transcription elongation complex (TEC) assembled on a DNA/RNA scaffold. Altering reaction conditions, it is possible to inhibit RNA cleavage and capture steps of  the cleavage mechanism for crystallization, to determine the X-ray crystal structures of the proofreading TEC in the presence and absence of TFS.\n\tThe final direction focuses on hepatitis delta virus (HDV), an RNA satellite virus of the hepatitis B virus that infects about 20 million people worldwide. HDV has a single-stranded circular RNA genome without its own RNA-dependent RNAP. Instead, HDV replication and mRNA synthesis is carried out by host RNAP without DNA intermediates. Using aRNAP and a short model RNA template containing a hairpin loop and dinucleotide bulge, I determined the aRNAP forms a stable complex with the model RNA. In the presence of Mg2+ aRNAP cleaves the RNA around the dinucleotide bulge and carries out RNA extension. This shows how a DNA-dependent aRNAP cleaves and synthesizes RNA, extending the known abilities of aRNAP.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [692], "author_name_tesi": "Klein, Brianna Joy", "last_name_ssi": "Klein", "middle_name_ssi": "Joy", "first_name_ssi": "Brianna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katsuhiko Murakami", "Katsuhiko Murakami", "Paul Lee Babitzke", "David Scott Gilmour", "B Tracy Nixon", "Biao He"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katsuhiko Murakami, Dissertation Advisor", "Katsuhiko Murakami, Committee Chair", "Paul Lee Babitzke, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Biao He, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["RNA-directed RNA synthesis by DNA-dependent aRNAP", "Pyrococcus furiosus Spt4/5", "Structure of Spt4/5 at 1.8 \u00c5", "Archaeal RNAP", "Inhibited TECs With or Without TFS"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Development of a Statistical Model of Reach Exertion Magnitude Perception for Use in Designing Truck Cabs", "id": "14497", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7362", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this work was to develop a statistical model to describe a user\u2019s perception of the difficulty of performing various reaching tasks in a truck cab as a function of the reach location.

This model consisted of a linear combination of the first four spherical harmonics, with the coefficients of each term in the model changing according to the desired difficulty rating. The model was developed using data gathered from an experimental study performed by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) in which volunteers performed reaches to a variety of points and rated each point according to their perception of the reach task\u2019s difficulty.

The physical model of MacDonald, further developed by Coelho, was extended for application to tan delta (the ratio of dielectric loss to dielectric constant) as a function of frequency. The validity of this approach was confirmed by plotting the characteristic EP time as a function of thickness and comparing the actual and predicted unrelaxed dielectric constant for a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) -based ionomer neutralized by lithium, sodium, and cesium. Results were obtained for ion mobility and mobile ion concentration for a neat PEO-based ionomer, two (methoxyethoxy-ethoxy phosphazene) (MEEP) -based ionomers, two MEEP-based salt-doped polymers, sulfonated polystyrene (SPS) neutralized by sodium with a high sulfonation fraction, and SPS neutralized\nby zinc with a low sulfonation fraction. Additionally, the conductivity parameters of six plasticized forms of a neat PEO-based ionomer were characterized, but the method apparently failed to correctly evaluate bulk ionic behavior. In all cases except the SPS ionomers ion mobility follows a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) temperature dependence. In all cases, mobile ion concentration follows an Arrhenius temperature dependence. Fitting parameters from these two relationships yielded direct information about the state of ionic diffusion and ion pairing in each system. Combination of these two functionalities predicts a relationship for conductivity that is significantly different than the VFT relation typically used in the literature to fit conductivity. The most outstanding result was the extremely small fraction of ions found to be mobile. For ionomers it can be concluded that\nthe primary reason for low conductivities arises from the low fraction of mobile ions.\n\nThe local and segmental dynamics of the neat and plasticized PEO-based ionomer were also studied in comparison to conductivity, with the conclusion that the glass transition temperature (a manifestation of the segmental segments) is the\nprimary property governing conduction behavior in single-phase ionomers.

Our resulting measures of firm experience take into account both industry and geographic dimensions, and regional variation in cost and demand conditions more accurately controls for market level heterogeneity.\n     Chapter two estimates two empirical models of plant exit from an industry.  Using data from seven regional manufacturing industries, we find that characteristics of the plant at the time of entry affect the decision of the plant to exit, even after controlling for differences in plant, firm, and market characteristics.  The second empirical model allows different methods of exit from the industry.  The findings suggest that experience at the time of entry not only affects the exit decision, but it also helps to determine the method of exit.\n     Chapter three examines the micro-level dynamics of the oil equipment industry during the period surrounding the rise in oil prices during the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s.

However, little has been published on the role of Par-4 in colon cancer. The purpose of this dissertation is to demonstrate that Par-4 has potential in colon cancer therapy by virtue of its impact on colon cancer cell apoptosis. To achieve this goal, Par-4 was overexpressed in the colon cancer cell line HT29. Par-4-overexpressing cells were more susceptible to apoptosis induced by the colon cancer chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Not only does Par-4 have potential in vitro, it also inhibits colon cancer growth in vivo. Par-4 overexpressing tumors grew more slowly and to a smaller mass than wild type HT29 tumors. Caspase-9 cleavage was increased in the Par-4 tumors. In addition to demonstrating the pro-apoptotic effects of overexpressing Par-4 in colon cancer, the potential of activating endogenous Par-4 was explored.  In colon cancer, the protein levels and the kinase activity of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, c-Src, increase with tumor progression. One of the downstream effectors of c-Src is Akt1. Akt1 has been shown to inhibit the pro-apoptotic activity of Par-4 in prostate cancer cells. Therefore, the possibility of activating Par-4 by inhibiting c-Src was investigated.  Colon carcinoma cell lines were treated with the Src kinase inhibitor (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(dimethylethyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) in combination with 5-FU. Treating cells with PP2 and 5-FU resulted in reduced interaction of Par-4 with Akt1 and with the scaffolding protein 14-3-3\u0192\u00e3, and mobilization of Par-4 to the nucleus. Par-4 was shown to interact not only with Akt1 and 14-3-3\u0192\u00e3, but also with c-Src. Overexpression of c-Src induced the phosphorylation of Par-4 at tyrosine site/s. Thus, endogenous Par-4 can be activated by inhibiting Src kinase with a pharmacological inhibitor and adding a chemotherapeutic agent. The activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Par-4 is a novel mechanism by which apoptosis occurs with a Src kinase inhibitor and 5-FU. In this dissertation, therefore, I demonstrate that a) Par-4 overexpression in combination with the apoptotic and chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU causes cell death in colon cancer cells; and b) endogenous Par-4 can be activated in colon cancer cells by Src inhibition and 5-FU treatment. Thus, the first steps toward attainment of the long-term goal of elucidation of the Par-4 function in colon cancer have been made. With the understanding that Par-4 can be activated in colon cancer, and that Par-4 can promote apoptosis in colon cancer and decrease colon cancer growth, strategies can be designed to exploit the pro-apoptotic activity of Par-4 in colon cancer therapy. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1021], "author_name_tesi": "Kline, Christina Leah Banta", "last_name_ssi": "Kline", "middle_name_ssi": "Banta", "first_name_ssi": "Christina Leah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rosalyn Bryson Irby", "Harriet C Isom", "Shantu G Amin", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby", "Thomas E Spratt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rosalyn Bryson Irby, Dissertation Advisor", "Harriet C Isom, Committee Member", "Shantu G Amin, Committee Member", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["c-Src", "Par-4", "prostate apoptosis response protein-4", "colon cancer", "5-fluorouracil"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "The Design and Control of Catalytic Motors", "id": "7101", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6269", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes work on the design and control of catalytic motors. The motors range in size from nanoscale self-propelled nanorods to microscale catalysts patterned on surfaces for fluid pumping. There are two main goals of this work: 1)Presenting mechanisms for colloid and fluid motion and providing evidence to support\nthese mechanisms, 2) Controlling the motion with non-invasive techniques (do not interfere with the catalytic reaction). Both goals are important in advancing this science still in its infancy for possible applications in other areas of nanotechnology such as delivery vehicles for cargo, in self-assembly or implementing into microfluidics devices. Chapter 1 provides a brief background about motors focusing mostly on enzymatic motors that inspired the catalytic motors work in this thesis. Chapter 2 describes platinum-gold based catalytic motors containing ferromagnetic nickel segments as the first remotely steered yet catalytically driven nanomotors. Chapter 3 presents the first catalytic micropump driven by the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide on gold and subsequent reduction on silver. This was the first example of a bimetallic electrochemical reaction establishing a self-generated electric field. The self-generated electric field established convection and pattern formation of colloids due to electrokinetics. Catalytic microfluidic pumps are promising for applications in existing microfluidic technologies. Chapter 4 discusses the advances made in achieving control over the catalytic microfluidic pumps presented in chapter 3 through engineering advances and surface chemistry advances. Also presented is a method to measure the reaction kinetics in-situ which aided in the design of a rigorous model describing the convection and pattern formation. Chapter 5 presents a new way to move colloids by a non-catalytic reaction whereby colloids move through ion gradients as the silver dissolves under ultraviolet light. The transport of colloids is believed to follow a diffusiophoretic mechanism. Now colloid movement is under both spatial and temporal control because light can be switched on and off to regulate the patterns formed.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6269], "author_name_tesi": "Kline, Timothy R", "last_name_ssi": "Kline", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Jeffrey M Catchmark"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Jeffrey M Catchmark, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["heterogeneous catalysis", "colloids. nanotechnology", "interface", "autonomous", "microfluidics", "pumping", "fluids"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE EVALUATION OF TRNSYS IN CREATING ADVANCED ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN BUILDINGS\n", "id": "9649", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5577", "abstract_tesi": "In meeting the energy demands in today\u2019s society, a number of environmental, political, economic, and societal issues, in both a local and world perspective, have emerged.

Experimental studies have shown that variations in portion size and energy density (ED) have substantial, independent effects on children\u2019s energy intake. The available data demonstrate that continuing to serve large portions has effects that persist for up to 24-hours in children, and for ED, the effects continue for up to 2 days. Since children are exposed to large portions of higher-ED foods, it is essential to investigate how these factors combine to influence preschool children\u2019s intake, but the studies that have been conducted report inconsistent results. Furthermore, in these studies the main dish at the meal was the only item varied by portion size and ED, which does not represent the current eating environment in which other foods and beverages also vary in these properties. For this dissertation, two studies were designed to test the effect of varying both the portion size and ED of an entire meal (Study 1) and of milk (Study 2) on preschool children\u2019s intake. Investigation of these effects will aid in the development of strategies to counter these environmental food cues and moderate energy intake.\nIn Study 1, the effect of varying the portion size and ED of a meal of commonly consumed foods on children\u2019s intake was evaluated. In a crossover design, lunch was served in 3 childcare centers once a week for 6 weeks to 120 children aged 3-5 years (14% overweight or obese). For the 6 meals, all items were served at 3 levels of portion size (100, 150, or 200%) and 2 levels of ED (100 or 142%). Lunch items were either lower- or higher-ED commercially available versions of chicken, macaroni and cheese, vegetable, applesauce, ketchup, and milk. Children\u2019s ratings of the foods showed that the lower-ED and higher-ED items were equally well liked. Varying the ED of food and milk did not affect the total weight consumed across meals; however, serving larger portions significantly increased the weight eaten at both the lower- and higher-ED meals (P<0.0001). Meal energy intake was found to be independently affected by ED and portion size (both P<0.0001). Increasing meal ED by 42% led to a 40% increase in energy intake and doubling portions led to a 24% increase. These effects combined to increase intake by 177\u00b112 kcal or 80% in the meal with the higher ED and largest portions compared to the lower-ED meal with the smallest portions. Large portions of high-ED foods are likely to contribute to childhood obesity by promoting the overconsumption of energy. Since the differences in ED did not affect ratings of liking, these results suggest that preschool children could be offered lower-ED versions of commonly consumed foods in order to moderate energy intake.\nIn Study 2, the extent that changes in milk portion size and ED affected children\u2019s intake of both milk and the accompanying foods was investigated with a 2-by-2 crossover design. Experimental meals were served once a week for 4 weeks in childcare classrooms and were consumed ad libitum by 125 children aged 3-5 y (8% overweight or obese). Across the 4 meals, unflavored milk was varied in portion size (9 fl. oz. or 6 fl.oz. [recommended]) and ED (3.25% full-fat [0.61 kcal/g] or 1% low-fat [0.42 kcal/g; recommended]). The foods served at the meal (chicken, pasta, broccoli, and bananas) were not varied. The results showed that serving the larger portion of milk increased milk energy intake by 20\u00b13 kcal (27%; P<0.0001) compared to serving the smaller portion, but had no significant effect on food intake or meal energy intake. Serving higher-ED milk increased milk energy intake by 31\u00b12 kcal (44%) and decreased food energy intake by 26\u00b16 kcal (10%) compared to serving lower-ED milk (both P<0.0001). Thus, across all children, the change in milk ED did not influence total energy intake at the meal. The effects of milk portion size and ED were not influenced by most child characteristics, such as age, body size, and parent-reported eating behaviors; however, the effect of milk ED on intake did differ significantly by sex. For boys, serving higher-ED milk decreased food energy intake by 43\u00b18 kcal (16%; P<0.0001) and did not affect total energy intake compared to serving lower-ED milk. For girls, consuming more energy from the higher-ED milk did not lead to a significant compensatory reduction in food energy intake and an additional 24\u00b110 kcal (7%; P=0.03) was consumed over the entire meal. This suggests that boys, but not girls, adjusted their food energy intake in response to changes in ED of milk consumed with lunch. These results showed that serving larger portions of milk could promote milk intake without affecting total energy intake at a meal, but the effects of milk ED on total energy intake at a meal vary between children.\nThe results of the two present studies indicate that the intake of preschool children is influenced by variations in both portion size and ED. When larger portions are served, children increase both the weight consumed and energy intake. However, when similar portions are served, they consume a consistent weight of a meal or milk even when ED is varied; therefore, when ED is increased children consume significantly more energy from the food or beverage. When the portion size and ED of all foods at a meal are manipulated, preschool children\u2019s intake is substantially influenced; however, if only one item is manipulated, such as milk, some children may adjust intake to account for changes in these factors. For most children, however, strategies that moderate the portion size of food would be effective at reducing energy intake. Choosing lower-ED commercially available products, such as lower-fat milk, grilled chicken strips, and unsweetened applesauce that are similar in acceptability to the higher-ED versions is an effective and easy strategy for caregivers to adopt. Overall, the results of the present research indicate that the combination of large portions and higher-ED foods has a substantial effect on ad libitum energy intake, which indicates that policy makers and food producers should consider these factors when developing recommendations and products. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12135], "author_name_tesi": "Kling, Samantha May", "last_name_ssi": "Kling", "middle_name_ssi": "May", "first_name_ssi": "Samantha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara J.

NbxNy was chosen for this research because it is a refractory material that can possess a large number of crystalline structures, and it has been found to have good tribological properties.  To separate the effects of momentum transfer per arriving atom (p/a), which considers bombarding species mass, energy, and ion-to-atom transport ratio, from those of energy deposition per arriving atom (E/a), a mass independent parameter, different inert ion beams (krypton, argon, and neon) were used to create a matrix of coatings formed using similar energy deposition, but different momentum transfer and vice versa.   \n\nDeposition was conducted in a research-scale IBAD system using electron beam evaporation, a radio frequency ion source, and a neutral nitrogen gas backfill.  Films were characterized using x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, and residual stress analysis.  Direct and quantifiable effects of bombardment were observed; however, energy deposition and momentum transfer effects could not be completely separated, confirming that thin film processes are complex.  Complexities arose from ion-specific interactions (ion size, recoil energy, per cent reflected neutrals, Penning ionization, etc.) and chemistry effects that are not considered by the simple models. Overall, it can be stated that bombardment promoted nitride formation, nanocrystallinity, and compressive stress formation; influenced morphology (which influenced post-deposition oxygen uptake) and stress evolution; increased lattice parameter; modified crystalline phase and texture; and led to inert gas incorporation.  High stress levels correlated strongly with material disorder and closed-structured morphologies.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4465], "author_name_tesi": "Klingenberg, Melissa Lynn Weis", "last_name_ssi": "Klingenberg", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn Weis", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Russell Messier", "Mark William Horn", "Carlo G Pantano", "Barbara Shaw", "J Derek Demaree"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Russell Messier, Committee Chair", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member", "Barbara Shaw, Committee Member", "J Derek Demaree, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ion beam assisted deposition", "niobium nitride", "energy deposition", "momentum transfer", "inert ion bombardment"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS WITH THE BETA-HEAVY-SPECTRIN C-TERMINUS\n", "id": "7378", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1707", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "       Many proteins participate in the polarized state and are necessary for the maintenance and stabilization of cell adhesion complexes. The localization of a spectrin based membrane skeleton (SBMS) induced by E-Cadherin mediated cell adhesion has long been postulated to be important in establishing and/or maintaining polarized domains in epithelia. However, little is known about the linkages between the junctions, polarity complexes and the SBMS. We have previously shown that the apical SBMS has an essential role in development that is associated with the maintenance of the zonula adherens (ZA), and that the Crumbs complex, which lies just above the ZA, is connected to the actin cytoskeleton via the scaffold protein Beta-Heavy-spectrin (BetaH).\n        Previous results in the lab provide supporting evidence for the idea that a major role for the SBMS is to stabilize membrane domains by regulating membrane turnover, and extends these models by suggesting that the apical SBMS is not merely a passive structure, but one that actively regulates protein turnover by nucleating a protein complex that normally modulates endocytosis. A primary role of this function may be to downregulate endocytosis in order to stabilize the protein composition of the associated membrane. Segment 33 of BetaH can be regarded as both a membrane anchor, and an effector domain that could contribute to ZA stability by modulating the rate of turnover of its constituent proteins. Specifically, the BetaH C-terminal segment 33 overexpression experiments suggest that it is a scaffold for a protein complex that modulates membrane turnover, and loss of this domain is correlated with ZA instability. Identifying proteins associated with the C-terminus is a necessary first step to understand the function of this membrane modulatory complex, thus a yeast 2-hybrid screen was done in attempts to find novel protein-protein interactions. .\n       The identification of a novel gene seven times from the yeast 2-hybrid screen prompted us to further characterize its interaction with BetaH33. Since this was a novel gene, there were no available reagents to begin with. Therefore an antibody was made, and RNAi transgenic flies were created to help verify and characterize this novel protein. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1693], "author_name_tesi": "Klipfell, Elizabeth Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Klipfell", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Graham Hugh Thomas", "David Scott Gilmour", "Avery August", "Robert Paulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Chair", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Beta-Heavy-spectrin", "Crumbs complex", "spectrin based membrane skeleton", "ZA instability", "yeast 2-hybrid screen"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Role of Opioid Growth Factor in Enhancing the Success of Trabeculectomy", "id": "9419", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4356", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over 2.2 million people have glaucoma in the U.S. Trabeculectomy surgery is commonly used to prevent complications of glaucoma, and the success of the trabeculectomy depends on the reaction of Tenon's Capsule Fibroblasts (TCFs) to the surgical trauma. The studies depicted in this thesis were aimed at establishing the role of OGF and OGFr in the modulation of cell proliferation of rabbit TCFs (RTCFs) in vitro as well as in vivo.  \nRTCFs were isolated and established in culture.  The presence of opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor (OGFr) was determined by immunoreactivity.  The kinetics of OGFr were established in receptor binding assays.  The ability of OGF to inhibit RTCF proliferation was assessed with dose response growth curves. Receptor-mediated effects of OGF were ascertained by treatment with OGF and naloxone (NAL). The toxicity of OGF action was examined in reversibility experiments. Interference of OGF-OGFr interaction by opioid antagonists or OGF antibody was conducted.  The mechanism of action of the OGF/OGFr axis on the survival of RTCFs was evaluated with siRNA, BrdU, and TUNEL techniques.  \nTreating RTCFs with OGF over a 10 million-fold range of dosages revealed that OGF works to inhibit proliferation of RTCFs in a dose dependent manner.  Through receptor binding assays, OGF was seen to work in a one-site model of binding.  When treating RTCFs with the long-acting opioid antagonist, naltrexone (NTX), RTCFs proliferated at a much higher rate than control or OGF treated cells.  Cell counts of RTCFs treated with mitomycin-C (MMC) were significantly lower than control, OGF, and NTX treatment groups.  MMC and MMC/OGF treated RTCFs did not differ in regard to cell number.  The unique ability of OGF to alter cell proliferation was not evident when RTCFs were treated with an array of traditional opioids.  OGF works in a receptor-mediated manner.  When treated with the short-acting opioid antagonist naloxone, RTCF cell numbers were not significantly elevated compared to controls or RTCFs treated with OGF and naloxone simultaneously.\nSpecificity of OGF was determined through treatment of RTCFs with an antibody to OGF.  Cell counts of antibody treated RTCFs were significantly higher than control counterparts, thus indicating that endogenous OGF plays an integral role in the regulation of cell proliferation.\nReversibility experiments showed that the inhibition of cell proliferation characteristic to OGF is not permanent.  This is an important factor in demonstrating the non-toxic inhibitory effects of OGF compared to other anti-proliferative therapies.  OGFr siRNA experiments, demonstrated that OGFr is necessary for OGF to inhibit RTCF proliferation.  OGF also decreases DNA synthesis in RTCFs compared to NTX, MMC, and control groups.  MMC did not alter DNA synthesis.  OGF and NTX did not induce apoptosis as evident through caspase 3 and TUNEL assays indicting that both compounds displayed non-toxic characteristics.  MMC treated RTCFs had significantly higher caspase 3 activity and TUNEL labeling when compared to control, OGF, and NTX treatment groups.  TUNEL labeling revealed that MMC/OGF treated RTCFs possessed significantly less TUNEL labeling compared to MMC alone.  This decrease in late apoptotic activity suggests that OGF has some protective effects.  \nIn the in vivo studies, a modified Scheie procedure was performed on New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits.  Animals were treated intraoperatively with PBS (control), Hydron + OGF, MMC, or Hydron alone.  Intraocular pressure was measured daily by a tonometer.  Daily measurements of bleb height, area, and vascularity were assessed via a slit lamp microscope.  H&E, trichrome, Giemsa, and Sirius Red staining were used to assess cellularity, blood vessels, inflammatory cells, and collagen fiber orientation.  Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays were also performed.\nFiltering blebs of the Hydron + OGF group survived more than twice as longer as controls, while also maintaining a reduced IOP for a significantly longer period of time.  Filtering blebs of Hydron + OGF, and MMC animals had comparable survival times.\nBleb height and area of the MMC and Hydron + OGF treated animals were comparable throughout the study.  IOPs of surviving blebs did not differ between any treatment group, while vascularity of control, Hydron, and Hydron + OGF group was significantly increased compared to MMC.\nHistopathology evaluation revealed that Hydron and Hydron + OGF specimens had developed exuberant granulation tissue inside of the surgical bleb at their respective late time points, while the MMC specimen did not.  Also, the Hydron + OGF specimen had less small and large collagen fibers within the bleb area compared to the Hydron specimen.  DNA synthesis was markedly increased in the Hydron specimen in the areas of the scleral fistula and Tenon\u2019s capsule compared to control, MMC, and Hydron + OGF groups, whereas the Hydron + OGF specimen had significantly less DNA synthesis than all other treatment groups in the scleral fistula and Tenon\u2019s capsule areas.  MMC specimens had an increased amount of TUNEL labeling in the scleral fistula and conjunctiva areas compared to control, Hydron + OGF, and Hydron groups.  This finding illustrates that treatment with MMC results in more toxic side effects than OGF, which has been documented to be safe and non-toxic.\nIn summary these data indicate that OGF is effective at inhibiting RTCFs in a safe and non-toxic manner.  However, an optimal vehicle for OGF administration is needed to improve delivery of OGF, and thus optimize the inhibitory effects of OGF in vivo.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4328], "author_name_tesi": "Klocek, Matthew Stephen", "last_name_ssi": "Klocek", "middle_name_ssi": "Stephen", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ian Stuart Zagon", "Ian Stuart Zagon", "Patricia J Mc Laughlin", "Joseph W Sassani", "H Paul Ehrlich", "Alphonse E Leure Dupree"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ian Stuart Zagon, Dissertation Advisor", "Ian Stuart Zagon, Committee Member", "Patricia J Mc Laughlin, Committee Chair", "Joseph W Sassani, Committee Member", "H Paul Ehrlich, Committee Member", "Alphonse E Leure Dupree, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Opioid Growth Factor", "Glaucoma", "Wound Healing"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The belowground ecophysiological responses of grapevines to competition by cover crops", "id": "24814", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10965", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Excessive grapevine vigor can decrease viable fruit yield, fruit quality, and overall profit in commercial vineyards.

This variation could potentially be influenced by a number of factors including soil environment, climate, competitor plant strategy, grapevine age, or grapevine root responses to competition.

Prior research has identified institutional motivations for engagement in internationalization that include preparation of students to live and work in an increasingly interconnected world, competition with other institutions, and revenue generation.  Institutional initiatives often rely on the cooperation and engagement of faculty members, but faculty motivation for participation in their institution\u2019s internationalization effort is not well understood.  The absence of research in this area is problematic because the faculty plays a crucial role in the fulfillment of higher education\u2019s tripartite mission of teaching, research, and service through such responsibilities as designing and reforming curricula, teaching and mentoring students, collaborating on research, engaging in campus and community outreach, and perpetuating institutional culture.  \n     The phenomenon of internationalization provides a timely setting in which to explore how faculty members, as individuals, choose to enhance their work lives via engagement in an institutional initiative.  It also offers an appropriate venue in which to investigate how faculty and institutional goals for an institutional initiative merge and diverge.  To these ends, this study engaged 15 faculty members at two undergraduate-focused institutions in the northeastern United States in phenomenological interviews as well as focus groups that explored personal and institutional motivations for faculty participation in internationalization; the teaching, research, service, and other professional activities that connect to their institution\u2019s internationalization initiative; and the effect of facilitators and/or impediments to their engagement in internationalization on their motivation to continue to participate in these efforts.  This inquiry was informed by scholarship from the fields of philosophy and higher education, particularly the theoretical underpinnings of the concept of internationalization, research on practices of internationalization, and research on faculty life and work.  Data analysis employed Giorgi\u2019s method of descriptive phenomenological reduction, through which structures, or dimensions, of the experience of internationalization and descriptions of how those dimensions connected to each other were identified.\n     Among the key findings of this study regarding the structures of the faculty experience of internationalization was that participants were more intrinsically than extrinsically motivated to engage in it.  Specifically, participant engagement in internationalization generally predated institutional adoption of an internationalization initiative and came from personal experience.  Regarding faculty practices of internationalization, a key finding was that participants had difficulty integrating internationalized teaching, research, and service practices throughout their work, despite an interest in doing so.  Participants generally attributed this difficulty to a lack of institutional support.  They also suggested that their efforts were not integrated into the broader life and work of their institutions because, despite the expressed intentions of their universities, internationalization was not incorporated into the broader institutional vision, identity, and mission.\n     Findings from this study generated a series of propositions for future research on faculty experiences of internationalization and the effects that they believe their engagement in it has on their academic work and professional lives, as well as on how individuals\u2019 goals and institutional goals for internationalization may or may not correspond and thus be achieved.

High-producing dairy cattle require more dietary energy in order to meet the demands of increased milk production.  High energy diets, however, are low in physically effective NDF (peNDF) and high in starch.  Starch sources in the diet are often processed in a manner to optimize starch availability in the rumen and the fiber sources are often highly digestible and short in particle length.  As a result, these types of diets are highly fermentable in the rumen and often lack the structural characteristics needed to maximize rumination time and the flow of salivary buffers into the rumen.  The result is reduced pH in the rumen and increased risk of acidosis.  While it is critical to meet the energy requirements of high-producing cows, acidosis must be avoided to ensure high milk production and efficient use of feed.  There is growing evidence that dairy cows will select feeds with high ruminal buffering capacity in an attempt to attenuate the effects of low ruminal pH.  Four experiments were carried out on early to mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows to investigate the effects of corn silage particle size and supplemental hay on feed preference, ruminal fermentation, dry matter intake, and milk yield and components during an induction of SARA.  Together, these experiments provide valuable observations in regards to feeding supplemental hay as a nutritional management strategy to mitigate SARA.  Feeding supplemental long hay to high-producing dairy cattle experiencing SARA was found to be beneficial and helped maintain dry matter intake, alleviate low ruminal pH, and blunted the shift of FA towards trans-10, C18:1.

To that end, the\nproperties of two such proteins, rat hepatic cytochrome b5 (cyt b5) and the truncated\nhemoglobin (trHb) from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 (S6803), have\nbeen investigated.\nThe electron-transport protein cytochrome b5 (cyt b5) contains two hydrophobic cores\nin the holo state. Core 1 participates in most of the heme-protein interactions and folds\nonly in the presence of the prosthetic group; by comparison, core 2 is present in the\napoprotein, makes relatively few heme contacts, and provides a scaffold that orients\nproperly the binding region. To examine the autonomy of core 1 and the extent to which\nloop closure and the nature of the loop anchor affect folding properties, a class of\nchimeric proteins was constructed. These proteins, termed EbE1-4, comprised the hemebinding\nloop of cyt b5 inserted in place of an existing loop within the folded scaffold of\nPsaE, a protein with an SH3-domain fold from a cyanobacterial photosystem I. The\nvarious EbE constructs differed only in the residues used to join the two proteins\u0081f\nprimary structures. For those proteins that were water-soluble, 2-dimensional\niv\nhomonuclear NMR data confirmed that the insertion did not disturb significantly PsaE\u0081fs\nSH3 fold. Thermal and chemical denaturation experiments monitored by CD and\nabsorption spectroscopies indicated that the thermodynamic stability of PsaE was not\ncompromised greatly by more than tripling the size of the flexible loop. The residues\nchosen to join the flexible and structure regions influenced the sign of \u0192\u00a2\u0192\u00a2G\u0081\u2039unf, the\nfolding and unfolding kinetics in the presence of urea, the solubility of the protein, and\nthe number of native states populated by the protein. Although none of the proteins binds\nheme specifically, autonomous function of core 1 cannot be discounted, since strain in\nthe tertiary structure caused by ordering both the cyt b5 binding loop and the PsaE SH3\nfold may prevent binding in this case. If the EbE results can be extrapolated to the cyt b5\ncase, it appears that restraint of the large, unstructured binding loop may not destabilize\ngreatly the apoprotein fold. This may be a general property of loops in folded, globular\nproteins. In addition, the results suggest that the interface between the inserted loop and\nits supporting scaffold can control many properties of the protein.\nThe cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (S6803) expresses a two-on-two\nglobin that uses His46 (distal side) and His70 (proximal) as axial ligands to the heme\niron. His46 can be displaced by O2, CO, and CN&#8722;, among others, whereas His70 is not\nlabile under native conditions. The residue preceding the proximal histidine has been\nimplicated in the control of axial ligand reactivity in globins; the details of the\nmechanism, however, are not well understood, and little information exists for bishistidyl\nhexacoordinate proteins. In many vertebrate hemoglobins and in the\nSynechocystis protein, the position is occupied by an alanine whereas, in myoglobins, it is\na serine involved in an intricate hydrogen bond network. We examined the role of Ala69\nv\nin S6803 hemoglobin through the effects of the Ala \u0081\u00a8 Ser replacement. The substitution\nresulted in minor structural perturbations, but the holoprotein\u0081fs response to temperature-,\nurea-, and acid-induced denaturation was measurably affected. Enhanced three-state\nbehavior was manifested in the decoupling of heme binding and secondary structure\nformation. Urea-gradient gel experiments revealed that the stability of the apoprotein\nwas unchanged by the replacement, and that a slight alteration of the folding kinetics\noccurred in the holoproteins. Cyanide-binding experiments were performed to assess\ntrans effects. The apparent rate constant for association decreased two-fold upon\nAla69Ser replacement. This deceleration was attributed to a change in the lifetime of a\nstate containing a decoordinated His46. The results demonstrated that, as in vertebrate\nglobins and leghemoglobin, proximal influences operate to determine fundamental\ndynamic and thermodynamic properties of the protein.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2501], "author_name_tesi": "Knappenberger, Jane A", "last_name_ssi": "Knappenberger", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Jane", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Juliette T J Lecomte", "Philip C.

Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) job satisfaction is a critical issue facing any stakeholder concerned with advancing the health of the nation\u2019s elderly. Increasing job satisfaction and decreasing job dissatisfaction has been found to improve staff retention and ultimately result in improved patient outcomes. Given the aging United States population, the projected nursing (RN and LPN) shortage, predominance of LPNs as the primary licensed nurse in long-term care settings, and the lack of LPN workforce research it is essential to understand the key attributes of LPN job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction in long-term care settings. Purpose. The goal of this study is to examine the attributes of long-term care LPNs\u2019 job satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Methods. A qualitative, focus group study was conducted at six long-term care institutions in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. A purposive sample of 4 to 12 LPNs in each of the six focus groups (n = 37) participated in a 90-minute focus group session. Herzberg\u2019s motivation/hygiene theory (1959) provided the theoretical basis for the conceptual framework for this qualitative study. The focus group methodology allowed the researcher to utilize the collective power of individual and group discussion, resulting in rich data. Data analysis began immediately following completion of the first focus group session and included open coding, condensation, and abstraction. Utilization of member checks, expert verification, and maintenance of an audit trail contributed to trustworthiness. Results. Four themes including value (sub-themes: value of the \u201cwork\u201d itself and recognition), real connection, empowerment (sub-themes: role identity and voice), and growth contributed to LPN job satisfaction and one theme, working conditions (sub-themes: unrealistic workload and equipment) contributed to LPN job dissatisfaction. The dissatisfier, working conditions, was also found to potentially impact the LPNs\u2019 ability to experience job satisfiers, thus preventing improved LPN job satisfaction. Conclusions: This study contributes to the literature by providing job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction data specific to the LPN in the long-term care setting. The four key attributes (value, real connection, empowerment, and growth) of LPN job satisfaction in long-term care settings are congruent with other research findings specific to RN, overall nursing staff, and direct care worker (DCW) populations, and align with some of Herzberg\u2019s (1959) intrinsic motivators. In addition, the job satisfaction attributes identified in this study align with the major tenets of transformational leadership, referred to as the 4 I\u2019s, inclusive of idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration. The depth of understanding of these attributes is enhanced; providing specific details to assist administrators and staff in addressing concepts such as LPN role identity and empowerment and providing opportunities in addition to the RN career path (i.e. specialty certification), thus contributing to LPN job satisfaction. In contrast to Herzberg (1959), only one dissatisfaction attribute, working conditions, was identified. Working conditions, inclusive of unrealistic workload and equipment can impact the LPNs\u2019 ability to achieve overall LPN job satisfaction. The four attributes constitute four pieces of the LPN job satisfaction experience. The job dissatisfaction attribute, working conditions, can prevent the LPN from experiencing job satisfaction. Thus, it will be essential for supervisors/administrators to address issues related to working conditions, allowing job satisfaction to prevail, potentially improving LPN retention, and positively impacting patient outcomes. This is critical to meet the current and future health care needs of the United States\u2019 elderly in long-term care settings.   \n \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9503], "author_name_tesi": "Knecht, Patricia ", "last_name_ssi": "Knecht", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Patricia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paula F Milone Nuzzo", "Judith E Hupcey", "Lisa Ann Kitko", "Janice L Dreachslin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paula F Milone Nuzzo, Dissertation Advisor", "Judith E Hupcey, Committee Member", "Lisa Ann Kitko, Committee Member", "Janice L Dreachslin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["job satisfaction", "job dissatisfaction", "LPN", "licensed practical nurse", "long-term care", "nursing home", "focus group", "nursing staff"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Effects on Placement of Human Figures Within Naturalistic Scenes (Photographs) on Initial Visual Attention of Young Adults\n", "id": "11878", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "276", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Purpose: There are many systems and devices available for use in augmentative and alternative communication, there are many systems and devices available for use in intervention.  This research focused on the Visual Scene Display (VSD) in which language concepts are embedded within broader scenes depicted within photographs or other schematic images.  Currently, naturalistic human figures are not frequently used in VSDs.  This research examined how human figures attract visual attention during a short viewing period.\n\nMethod: Twenty undergraduate and graduate students viewed one of three image sets (each set consisting of three images) over a short viewing period of five seconds per image.  The participants were given minimal verbal instruction to provide a \"free viewing\" setting.  Infrared eye-tracking technology was used to record the participants' viewing patterns.

They represent angiosperm-dominated Gondwanan rainforests and have been the focus of many paleontological and geological studies. Here, I focus on rare, toothed fossil leaves that have received little attention. These show affinities to Laurales, a magnoliid order in the basal angiosperms, representing the families Atherospermataceae and Monimiaceae. These ancient families currently exhibit broad, often disjunct southern distributions, and thus hold much interest for Gondwanan biogeography. Their fossil records are exceptionally scarce, in that only ca. 17 fossil species, 11 based on fossil wood and six on leaf adpressions, are reported between Atherospermataceae and Monimiaceae. The fossil wood records have low taxonomic precision but are more recently published. However, the leaf macrofossil record, prior to the single Neogene example, is in need of critical revision because most identifications are poorly supported. Thus, any new foliar material referable to these families is of great interest. My purposes are to: 1) evaluate new fossil material for one fossil-leaf compression species of Atherospermataceae and one of Monimiaceae from Eocene Patagonia; 2) determine modern genera showing the closest affinities to these fossil species; and 3) improve current understanding of Laurales paleobiogeography. \nHistorically, the RP and LH floras were thought to include several fossil species with affinities to living forests in southern South America. Many of these have recently been revised to genera with Australasian affinities, indicating that the floras may not include many connections to living Patagonian floras. Furthermore, the Australasian elements show that biotic exchange was occurring between South America and Australasia, via Antarctica, before the final separation of South America and Antarctica during the middle Eocene. The first fossil species evaluated is Laurelia guinazui Berry 1935, long considered a probable Patagonian element of the RP flora. Laurelia guinazui was originally described as Monimiaceae, but Laurelia (South America and New Zealand) is now assigned to Atherospermataceae. I report 16 new fossil specimens of L. guinazui from LH and RP that have greater detail preserved than the syntypes (RP) and confirm their placement to Atherospermataceae. Morphological character evaluation suggests an extinct taxon with closest affinity (in decreasing order) to the extant genera Daphnandra, Doryphora (both Australia), Laureliopsis (Chile and Argentina), and Laurelia (New Zealand and Chile), and I propose the new combination Atherospermophyllum guinazui (Berry). The second fossil species, Monimiophyllum callidentatum sp. nov., is new and represented by a single specimen from LH. It exhibits distinct \u2018Monimioid\u2019 teeth and other features that allow confident placement in Monimiaceae. Among extant genera, the greatest morphological similarity is to Wilkiea (Australia), which appears to contrast with molecular analyses that place the divergence of the clade containing Wilkiea in Australasia between 16 and 38 Ma (Renner et al., 2010. J. Biogeography 37:1227). This result implies that the lineage may be much older and have a much broader biogeographic history across Gondwana. This study significantly improves the fossil record of two early-diverging families in Laurales, by establishing what are probably their most reliable pre-Neogene occurrences, in Eocene Patagonia. The fossils were found at great modern distance from many of their closest living relatives, further weakening the signal of extant Patagonian forests in these exceptional Eocene fossil floras and increasing their links to Australasia.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7820], "author_name_tesi": "Knight, Cassandra ", "last_name_ssi": "Knight", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cassandra", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Daniel Wilf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Daniel Wilf, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Eocene", "Patagonia", "Monimiaceae", "Atherospermataceae", "Paleobiogeography"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Educating The Engineers Of 2020: \nan Outcomes-based Typology Of Engineering Undergraduates\n", "id": "14656", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7503", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Members of government and industry have called for greater emphasis within U.S. colleges and universities on producing engineers who can enter and advance a more competitive, globally connected workforce.  Looking toward this future, engineers will need to exhibit strong analytical skills as in the past, but they also will need to be proficient in a cadre of new abilities to compete.  This study examines, in combination, an array of knowledge and skills aligned with the National Academy of Engineering\u2019s \u201cengineer of 2020.\u201d The study has two major goals.  The first is to develop a typology of engineering students based on the learning outcomes associated with the engineer of E2020.  The second is to understand the educational experiences that distinguish these groups of students who resemble, more or less, the engineer of 2020.   This approach acknowledges that engineering graduates need a complex skill set to succeed in the new global economy; it is the combination of skills associated with the engineer of 2020, not the individual skills in isolation, which will ensure graduates can respond to workforce needs of the future.  To date, research on student outcomes has studied learning outcomes independent of one another rather than investigating student learning holistically. \n\nThe study uses student data from the Prototype to production: Processes and conditions for preparing the Engineer of 2020 study, sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF EEC-0550608).  Engineering students from a nationally representative sample of engineering programs in the United States answered a survey that collected information on their pre-college academic preparation and sociodemographic characteristics, their curricular and co-curricular experiences in their engineering programs, and their self-ratings of their engineering-related competencies.  Only data on engineering students in their senior year (n=2,422) were utilized in analyses. \n\nAnalyses were conducted in multiple phases for each of five engineering disciplines in the data set (biomedical/bioengineering, chemical, civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering).  First, cluster analyses produced typologies (or groupings) of engineering seniors (one for each of five engineering disciplines studied and an \u201call engineering\u201d analysis) based on nine self-reported learning outcomes, including fundamental skills, design skills, contextual awareness, interdisciplinary competence, and professional skills.  Second, profiles of pre-college characteristics as well as student experiences in college were developed for each discipline and the five disciplines combined.  Using analyses of variance, Chi-square analyses, and multinomial logistic regression, this phase also identified differences in student characteristics and college experiences between clusters of students reporting high proficiencies on the array of outcomes and students in other clusters.  This second phase informed the third phase, which produced parsimonious models that used pre-college characteristics and student experience variables to predict cluster membership.  \n\nAs a whole, the findings demonstrate that analyses that include the full array of E2020 learning outcomes produce meaningful typologies that distinguish between groupings of students in different engineering fields.  Findings demonstrate that a subset of students \u2013 the engineers of 2020 \u2013 report high skills and abilities on the full array of learning outcomes.  These are the graduates sought by both the federal government and industry who most closely resemble the engineers of 2020.  In addition, distinctive curricular and co-curricular experiences distinguish this E2020 group of students in each engineering discipline from other groupings of students in that same discipline. These findings have valuable implications for practice because they identify an array of discipline-specific, in- and out-of-class learning experiences that appear to promote the development of this multi-dimensional set of outcomes.  Overall, however, greater curricular emphases on broad and systems perspectives in the engineering curriculum most consistently set apart the students who report high proficiencies on the E2020 outcomes.  The findings also indicate that strategies for improving undergraduate engineering outcomes should be tailored by engineering discipline.  The study contributes to both practice and research by developing a technique that can be used to create an outcomes-based typology that can be applied to any set of learning outcomes.  Graphical representations of results consolidate large quantities of information into an easily accessible format so that findings can guide both practitioners and policymakers who seek to improve this multi-dimensional set of undergraduate engineering learning outcomes. Future directions for research, including operationalizing organizational contexts influencing E2020 learning outcomes as well as anticipated career trajectories of students across the typology, are also discussed. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7442], "author_name_tesi": "Knight, David Bruce", "last_name_ssi": "Knight", "middle_name_ssi": "Bruce", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa Lattuca", "John Jesse Cheslock", "Patrick T Terenzini", "Michael John Dooris", "Timothy Grant Pollock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa Lattuca, Dissertation Advisor", "John Jesse Cheslock, Committee Chair", "Patrick T Terenzini, Committee Member", "Michael John Dooris, Committee Member", "Timothy Grant Pollock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Engineering education", "Student outcomes", "Engineer of 2020"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "COGNITIVE REASONING SKILLS AND CLASSROOM SETTINGS:  A MULTI-LEVEL EXAMINATION OF STUDENT AND TEACHER FACTORS IN MATH ACHIEVEMENT\n", "id": "9417", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2218", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Through examination of math teaching and learning in middle elementary school, this dissertation explores two facets at the core of schooling: the processes of individual student learning and instructional practices. Paper one explores change in math achievement, the impacts of executive function (EF) or general reasoning on change in achievement, and the extent to which conceptual and reasoning based instruction relates to EF and achievement in third and fourth grades over the course of a school year. Although the positive relationship between EF and math achievement at single points in development is widely recognized and heavily researched, little work has focused on the effects of EF on growth in math achievement, particularly in elementary school. In the best-fitting model of growth, with both linear and quadratic factors, student behavior and Raven\u2019s scores predicted achievement but not change in achievement, while school attended and the tower task (a test of planning and strategy) relate to achievement and change in achievement. Preliminary analyses suggest that instruction that differs in amounts of reasoning and conceptually based activity may affect change in achievement and interact with cognitive abilities in predicting growth in math achievement. Because engagement and student behavior are integral to academic success, further exploration of the characteristics of classrooms and instruction that foster engagement and productive student behavior is an essential pursuit. The second paper aims to answer the broad question of which aspects of classroom settings and instruction are important for improving student engagement and behavior. This research contributes to existing knowledge by examining the relationships among activity settings (individual, small group, full class), teacher behaviors, instructional characteristics, and student behaviors in the context of math instruction in third and fourth grades.

The complimentary theoretical frameworks of sociocultural theory and contextual theology provide the lens through which this exploration is understood.  These frameworks attempt to understand the context of an adult learner and its influence on the developmental process.  \nThis study utilized a sequential exploratory mixed method research design, which involved a mixture of qualitative and quantitative inquiry.  Using the qualitative data collected in February 2009 and February 2010, a quantitative survey was developed.  303 pastors participated in the survey in September, 2010.  The first set of findings asserts that Burkinab\u00e9 pastors contextualize their worldview based on three aspects of the traditional African worldview:  r\u00e9ligion traditionelle africaine (also referred to animism); the African oral narrative tradition; and the communal nature of reality.  The second set of findings indicates that Burkinab\u00e9 Alliance pastors develop spiritually through five domains of theological contextualization:  a spiritual maturity characterized by growth, the primacy of a personal relationship with Christ, supernatural encounters with what are perceived to be demonic spirits, a negotiation of economic poverty, and a variety of spiritual experiences including dreams, visions, synchronicities, and the practice of the spiritual disciplines.  The third set of findings indicates that Burkinab\u00e9 Alliance pastors wonder if they will develop spiritually through continuing education.  Each set of findings reveals varying quantitative differences between the Julaphone and Francophone Burkinab\u00e9 Alliance pastors, which appear to be due to cultural and educational differences.

An Analysis of First-time DUI Offenders in Pennsylvania", "id": "25028", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10812", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Arrests for driving under the influence constitute the most common type of arrest in the United States, but they are often excluded from criminological research.  The present study uses hierarchical linear modeling to analyze the sentencing and recidivism of first-time DUI offenders across 60 judicial districts in the State of Pennsylvania.  \n\nThe general theoretical question relates to factors that promote or inhibit deterrence.  The study is concerned primarily with the severity of punishments, since arguments have been made both that severe punishments are necessary to reduce the likelihood of additional criminal behaviors (e.g., Beccaria 1764/1963), and that severe punishments are related to the persistence of offending behaviors (e.g., Sherman, 1993).  Additionally, this thesis is concerned with the effects of a criminal label (e.g., Braithwaite, 1989; Laub and Sampson, 2003) by comparing the criminal behaviors of individuals who receive a permanent, and stigmatizing, criminal label to those who receive access to a rehabilitative and reintegrative disposition that does not carry a criminal label.  \n\nTwo overarching research questions are considered.  First, what offender, offense, and community characteristics influence whether an offender receives diversion or is sentenced for a guilty conviction?  Second, what offender, offense, and community characteristics are related to the recidivism of first-time DUI offenders?  Specifically, this thesis seeks to understand the processes of selection into diversion programs and the relationship between diversion, versus a criminal label, on future criminal behaviors.  \n\nThese questions are analyzed using data from the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC), Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing (PCS), Pennsylvania State Police (PSP), Pennsylvania Center for Crime and Delinquency, Pennsylvania Department of Health, and the United States Census Bureau.  Demographic and criminal history characteristics, offense and judicial proceeding characteristics, and community characteristics were included in two-level analyses of offenders nested within their respective Court of Common Pleas.  Type of disposition - Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) or Guilty Conviction - and rearrest within 4 years of sentencing for a first-time DUI offense were analyzed as dependent variables.  \n\nConsistent with general sentencing research, racial minorities, males, and younger offenders were more likely than white, female, and older offenders to receive harsh sentences.  Offenders with more serious criminal histories were more likely than offenders with no prior criminal history to receive a guilty conviction.  Blood alcohol content (BAC) was not predictive of disposition outcomes, but drug-impaired offenders were more likely than alcohol-impaired offenders to receive a guilty conviction.  \n\nWhite, female, and older offenders were less likely than non-white, male, and younger offenders to recidivate.  More serious offenders, characterized by the commission of a non-DUI offense that was more serious than their DUI offense, were more likely than less serious or DUI-only offenders to recidivate.  Offenders with prior arrests were more likely than offenders with no prior arrests to recidivate.  While BAC was not predictive of recidivism, drug-impaired offenders were more likely than alcohol-impaired offenders to recidivate.  \n\nThe relationship between a guilty conviction and recidivism varied by gender and race.  While the rate of recidivism of males was similar for those who received ARD and those sentenced for a guilty conviction, females sentenced for a guilty conviction were significantly more likely than females receiving diversion to recidivate.  The difference in recidivism between minority offenders sentenced to a guilty conviction and those receiving ARD was also significantly larger than the difference in recidivism for white offenders sentenced to a guilty conviction and those receiving ARD.  \n\nFinally, county and judicial district characteristics were not predictive of disposition outcomes or rearrest.  While this study found variation in the size of the effects of offender and offense characteristics across judicial districts, no county or judicial district characteristics included in the study were able to account for this variation. \n\nThe results of this thesis suggest two implications for theory.  First, arrest itself appears to be a strong deterrent for DUI offenders.  The lack of significant differences in recidivism for those receiving a guilty conviction and those receiving diversion suggests that arrest itself may be a severe punishment for this group of offenders and that the severity of subsequent punishment is less important.  Second, this thesis provides support for a contingent labeling effect.  The findings provide some evidence of a racial or gendered effect of criminal labels and the associated propensity to recidivate. \n\nFinally, the current study has an important implication for policy.  The findings suggest that diversion programs are currently disproportionately awarded to offenders based on demographic characteristics, but the effects of sentencing on recidivism appear similar regardless of the disposition outcome.  Consequently, an expansion of diversion programs for first-time DUI offenders could be considered in order to reduce state costs and to reduce any potential stigma that may result from a permanent criminal label.

The study focuses on the challenges of preparing teacher candidates in the current sociopolitical context and examines how participants enact a critical pedagogy of teacher education that includes authentic writing, critical literacy, and student-centered approaches in order to meet these challenges.  The researcher describes four commitments shared by participants: engagement, scholarship, advocacy, and reflection.  Those shared commitments are explored through two themes in order to demonstrate how participants 1) politicize teacher education and 2) humanize teacher education. Data were collected through interviews and documents, and the researcher analyzed the data using an inductive, thematic analysis, guided by a critical theoretical framework and the tenets of critical pedagogy.  Findings from this study reveal how critical teacher educators\u2019 lived experiences influence their commitments and how their stances toward corporate education reform influence their pedagogy. The researcher makes recommendations for teacher educators and teacher education based on the findings \u2013 namely that critical teacher educators should do more to make sense of and engage with the movement to resist corporate education reform and that teacher education can better prepare teachers for the current sociopolitical context with explicit attention to the issues that contribute to schools as they are and by fostering hope and courage to see new possibilities for schools as they could be.  Implications for preservice teachers and their experiences as beginning teachers are also discussed.  This study reveals how efforts to politicize and humanize teacher education can better prepare teachers as empowered scholars and reflective practitioners who are able to make sense of the corporate reform paradigm and envision alternatives to it.

The model focuses on the surface morphology effects on ice adhesion strength. As super-cooled water droplets, having a typical median volume diameter ranging from 10 to 80 \u03bcm, impact and freeze on the leading edges of aircraft, it is hypothesized that the small drops expand and clamp to surface discontinuities, contributing to the ice adhesion strength of the material. The derivation of a Newtonian mechanics model to calculate the forces required for the removal of ice that has expanded and clamped inside macro surface structures is presented. The model requires knowledge of the macro-scale (10-6 m) surface geometry.  Newtonian mechanics accounted for the expansion and clamping of freezing ice including temperature dependent ice properties. The model is dependent on Young\u2019s modulus, the thermal coefficient of expansion of ice, and the coefficient of static friction between ice and the adhering substrate. All of these properties are dependent on the variation of temperature. \n\tThe research validated the developed model experimentally.  Firstly, the individual parameters as functions of temperature were obtained from literature review and experimental measurements. Previous research revealed the correlation with temperature of the Young\u2019s modulus and the thermal coefficient of expansion for ice. The relationship for the thermal coefficient of expansion found is valid for temperatures ranging between -193.15 and 6.85 \u00b0C (-315.67 and 44.33 \u00b0F). The Young\u2019s modulus temperature relationship was obtained from tests presented in the literature that used sea ice.   Secondly, the static coefficient of friction is dependent on the surface interaction between the accreted ice and the surface material.  Through bench top testing, it was determined that the coefficient of friction of ice is also dependent on temperature. The coefficient of friction was experimentally acquired for a mercaptan and amine blended epoxy (Great Planes 30 Minute Pro Two-Part) applied to an aluminum substrate. The coefficient of friction varied from 0.046 with a standard deviation of 0.015 at -5.8 \u00b0C (21.6 \u00b0F) to 0.190 with a standard deviation of 0.019 at -15.7 \u00b0C (3.7 \u00b0F), a change of 420%, and is dependent on loading conditions and the test environment.\n\tThe final phase of the research was the experimental validation of the ice adhesion model through adhesion strength testing on the Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand (AERTS). To conduct validation testing, controlled surfaces were created.  The surfaces were coated with the same mercaptan and amine epoxy blend to create a surface that approached a Ra of zero. The actual surface roughness measured was a Ra of 0.01 \u03bcm (3.94 x 10-7 in.). This pristine coating provided a baseline against other surface of the same coating that had controlled surface roughness.   The epoxy surfaces were ablated using a laser at differing intensities to create surfaces with varying roughness depths. The laser etched the coatings at 0.35, 0.6, and 1.2 W, each with a respective surface roughness of 1.13, 1.95, and 5.11 Ra (4.45 x 10-5, 7.68 x 10-5, and 2.01 x 10-4 in.). All of these coatings were tested within the Federal Aviation Regulation Part 25 and Part 29 Appendix C icing envelope to recreate realistic environmental icing conditions. The pristine surface was had an adhesion strength of 4.11 psi (28.3 kPa) with a standard deviation of 0.75 psi (5.17 kPa) at -8 \u00b0C (17.6 \u00b0F) and 7.99 psi (55.1 kPa) with a standard deviation of 0.94 psi (6.48 kPa) at -16 \u00b0C (3.2 \u00b0F). While, for example, the coating with the most severe ablation (Ra of 5.11 \u03bcm) was had an adhesion strength of 22.7 psi (156.8 kPa) with a standard deviation of 2.70 psi (18.62 kPa) at -8 \u00b0C and 42.4 psi (292.5 kPa) with a standard deviation of 3.45 psi (23.79 kPa) at -16 \u00b0C.  These measured values were then compared to the model predictions. The maximum discrepancy between prediction and experimental results was 9% for the 25 experimental tests conducted using the 1.2 W ablation surface. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11183], "author_name_tesi": "Knuth, Taylor Dayton", "last_name_ssi": "Knuth", "middle_name_ssi": "Dayton", "first_name_ssi": "Taylor", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Palacios", "Douglas Edward Wolfe", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Palacios, Thesis Advisor", "Douglas Edward Wolfe, Thesis Advisor", "George A Lesieutre, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["adhesion strength", "surface morphology", "predictive", "topography", "surface geometry", "Newtonian mechanics", "two-dimensional loading"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Postural coordination patterns and surface of support dyanmics", "id": "22029", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10156", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The degrees of freedom problem (DFs) (Bernstein, 1967) has been interpreted as the central issue in motor control.  It has been primarily investigated by focusing on the peripheral mechanical and physiological component levels (e.g., muscles, joints, etc.) in a variety of movement contexts.  The analysis of these component DFs is important but it is distinct though related to the analysis of the dynamical (also called active or functional) DFs of the coordination and control of the motor output. The dynamical DFs provide information about how the very many component level DFs are organized and how the state of the organization of the system dynamics changes under certain constraints (e.g., environmental, organism, and task).  \nThe experimental paradigm used was a sinusoidally translating support surface to drive the organization of the individual DFs (e.g., joint) in the control of upright standing balance.  It was used to address the questions of how the organizational properties of the postural control system, beyond the level of joint kinematic description, change during a moving surface of support balance task.  In addition, the organization of postural coordination problem provides insight on the additional question of how the postural system constrains the many redundant DFs to a collective variable or a set of variables to realize task demands.  \n\tExperiment 1 found by principal component analysis that the number of dynamical DFs of the postural coordination pattern was reduced from three to two as the average velocity of the support surface induced by a combination of frequency (0.2, 0.6, and 1.0 HZ) and amplitude (9, 16, and 23 cm) increased producing different contribution of each joint motion to the organization of the postural coordination pattern.\n\tExperiment 2 addressed the question of how the organizational properties of coordination patterns change as a function of the continuous scaling of frequency (0.2 Hz to 1.3 Hz) of the support surface in a trial.  In addition, we investigated whether the postural system organizes a particular modal solution or a set of solutions to preserve the postural stability as a function of practice.  The findings showed that practice induced 3 dynamical DFs at the lower frequencies and 2 dynamical DFs at the higher frequencies of the support surface.  Relative phase analysis revealed that the anti-phase pattern of the ankle-hip coordination held at the higher frequencies and contributed to change in the dynamical DFs of the postural coordination patterns.\n\tExperiment 3 examined whether the coordination of COM-COP in the space level (Bernstein, 1996) exhibits a phase transition in movement coordination to the continuous scaling (0 to 3 Hz or vice versa) of the support surface dynamics.  The results showed that the support surface dynamics induced a non-equilibrium phase transition of the COM-COP pattern including dynamic characteristics such as a critical fluctuations and hysteresis.  Conversely, the ankle-hip coordination, in the level of muscular-articular synergies (Bernstein, 1996), transitioned earlier than the COM-COP with no change in the associated dynamical phenomena. \n\tOverall, the findings reveal that sinusoidally translated dynamics of the support surface maps redundantly though preferentially to a small set of qualitatively different postural coordination patterns.  The organization of the coordination patterns that emerge in joint space is influenced by a particular adaptive solution to maintain postural stability under the broad range of the support surface constraints.  Lastly, the COM-COP coordination that is at the level of space rather than that of synergy is a candidate collective variable of the multi-segmental whole body system acting on a redundant postural task.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9845], "author_name_tesi": "Ko, Ji Hyun", "last_name_ssi": "Ko", "middle_name_ssi": "Hyun", "first_name_ssi": "Ji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell", "John Henry Challis", "David A.

The performance of GDDA-BLAST is better than those of other method such as SAM and psi-BLAST in homology detection.\nUsing GDDA-BLAST, I also implemented a classification library to find quantitative thresholds capable of inferring protein function using phylogenetic profiles.

Comparisons of patterns and rates of nucleotide changes across different functional classes or between polymorphism and divergence allow distinguishing the underlying evolutionary forces.  In Drosophila, synonymous DNA evolve under the balance of selection-mutation-drift in which weak selection increases fixation probabilities of translationally superior codons, but mutation pressure and genetic drift allow selection-unpreferred codons to persist in a genome.  Under this model, identifying deviations from the equilibrium evolution in different classes of mutations provides opportunities to determine underlying evolutionary force(s).  In addition, valuable inferences on patterns of DNA evolution rely on phylogenetic knowledge of the species studied.  This study investigates three aspects of molecular evolution among D. melanogaster and its closely relatives.  (1) Phylogenetic relationships were investigated among six D. melanogaster subgroup species.  Phylogenetic analyses from multiple loci obtain strong supports on grouping D. teissieri-D. yakuba together with D. erecta-D. orena species pairs after splitting from the D. melanogaster-D. simulans species complex.  (2) Lineage-specific patterns and rates of nucleotide changes were identified on the six extant lineages and two ancestral lineages from 22 genes (>11,000 codons).  Nonstationary molecular evolution (either toward GC-increasing or -decreasing) appears to occur frequently within these closely related siblings.  Heterogeneity in patterns of nucleotide changes between high, low codon-bias, and adjacent intronic regions suggests that natural selection play a predominant role in shaping codon bias evolution.   Strong regional heterogeneity in base composition evolution was also identified from a cluster of genes located near the telomere of X chromosome in D. yakuba and D. orena.  Frequent temporal and spatial deviations from equilibrium DNA evolution reveal importance of fine-scale investigation for studying patterns of molecular evolution and raise concerns of violations of stationarity which is often assumed in modeling DNA evolution in molecular and phylogenetic analyses.  (3) Evolutionary dynamics of polymorphic and fixed mutations was also examined in each of D. teissieri and D. yakuba.  Detecting differences in patterns of nucleotide changes between polymorphism and divergence can reveal footprints of natural selection.  However, the differences could also cause false inferences of DNA divergence in a single-allele analysis in which polymorphic and fixed changes are mixed.  The results show that the most recent common ancestor lies in deep on a gene tree in D. teissieri.  Polymorphic mutations appear to have potentially profound effects on patterns of molecular evolution in a single-allele analysis.  Comparisons of the frequency configurations of polymorphism and divergence between putatively selection preferred and unpreferred synonymous mutations and between protein and synonymous mutations shed light on evidence of adaptive evolution for preferred silent mutations and A/T to G/C protein mutations possibly related to natural selection on enhancing efficiency and accuracy and/or reducing energy cost during protein synthesis.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6587], "author_name_tesi": "Ko, Wen-Ya ", "last_name_ssi": "Ko", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wen-Ya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hiroshi Akashi", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Claude Walker Depamphilis", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Anton Nekrutenko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hiroshi Akashi, Committee Chair", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member", "Claude Walker Depamphilis, Committee Member", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Member", "Anton Nekrutenko, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["telomeric base composition evolution", "codon bias evolution", "Drosophila melanogaster subgroup", "molecular phylogeny", "molecular evolution", "nucleotide polymorphism and divergence"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Young Children\u2019s Self-regulation and Teachers\u2019 Ratings of Young Children\u2019s Play and Approaches to Learning as a Function of Age, Gender, and Language Background\n", "id": "15426", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7911", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among children\u2019s self-regulation, play, and approaches to learning as a function of age, gender, and language status (English as a first language or as a second language). This research is based on the assumption that children who play well and take a positive approach to learning in the classroom are also effective in terms of self-regulation and other related \u201cschool readiness\u201d skills, such as receptive vocabulary and social development in the classroom. Children (n = 50) were tested in the spring of the school year (2012) using measures for self-regulation, play, and approaches to learning together with an adaptation of an older version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. In order to assess development of self-regulation, executive function tasks (i.e., day-night, tapping, and Simon says tasks) were administered in late winter and early spring. The children\u2019s play quality and approaches to learning were rated by teachers. The results showed that children\u2019s self-regulation is significantly related to their rating scores for play and approaches to learning and that these ratings were highly correlated with each other. Additionally, the girls\u2019 scores on both the Simon says test and the modified Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test were significantly better than the boys\u2019 scores. For 3- to 4-year-old children, these tasks were a little challenging, but for 4- to 5-year-old children, the tasks were not difficult. From the results, it appears that self-regulation, play, language, and approaches go together at this specific period in children\u2019s lives. Thus, teachers would be well-advised to create lessons, curricula, and activities designed to strengthen these important cognitive traits and behaviors in young children. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7833], "author_name_tesi": "Ko, Yoojung ", "last_name_ssi": "Ko", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yoojung", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Glendon Wilbur Blume"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson, Thesis Advisor", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Thesis Advisor", "Glendon Wilbur Blume, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["play", "self-regulation", "executive function", "approaches to learning", "children", "cognitive development"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Giant Lipid Vesicles Encapsulating A Synthetic Cytoplasm As A Model System To Investigate Cellular Fission and Differentiation", "id": "13807", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4149", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Biological cells exhibit chemical heterogeneity in both their cytoplasmic interiors\nand their plasma membranes. This heterogeneity has consequences for cell function, such\nas polarity and asymmetric division, yet studying the underlying mechanisms has proven\ndifficult due to the complexity of even the simplest living cell. Models of biological cells\nprovide a tool for testing hypotheses in cellular biology. For example, giant lipid vesicles\n(GVs) are cell-sized structures composed of a lipid bilayer membrane surrounding an\naqueous core, that serve as model cells or parts of cells. By encapsulating an aqueous\ntwo-phase system (ATPS) it has been possible to generate microcompartments within\nGVs. This work is interesting in that aqueous phase separation is one proposed\nmechanism for dynamic microcompartmentalization in the cytoplasm of biological cells,\nand our model provides a means for examining the consequences of this type of\nheterogeneity in a simple system. Previous work has demonstrated osmotic deflation,\ntemperature, and pH-driven dynamic microcompartmentation within the GV interior, as\nwell as structural and cytoplasmic polarity. This thesis examines the consequences of this\ninitial polarity, focusing on asymmetric fission and differentiation in this model cell.\nWhile the overall goal of this thesis is concerned with polar ATPS GVs, Chapter 5\nanswers fundamental questions about the non-ideal behavior of two-polymer solutions,\nwhich has direct consequences for our artificial cell work.\nChapter 1 provides a brief introduction to ATPS GVs as a simple model system\nfor phase-separation driven microcompartmentation of the cytoplasm. Background\ninformation on microcompartmentation in biological cells and its consequences for cell\nfunction is presented. Examples of experimental models of the cytoplasm are reported,\nand shortcomings of these models are discussed. An introduction to GVs as membrane\nmodels, and model cells is provided. The chapter concludes with a summary of previous\nwork incorporating an ATPS cytoplasm mimic inside GV model cells. Chapter 2\ndescribes ATPS GVs presenting micron-scale domains in their bilayer membranes. It\ndescribes the effects of PEGylated lipids and temperature on domain localization, as well\nas the interplay between the membrane and interior chemistry. Additionally, osmotic\ndeflation induced budding of these ATPS GVs with heterogeneous membranes is\nreported, which resulted in vesicles that were asymmetric, or polar, in their structure as\nwell as the membrane and interior compositions. Chapter 3 builds on this initial polarity\nand describes the consequences of osmotic deflation of these asymmetric GVs. Further\nincreases in external osmolality drove fission of polar GVs, to produce two non-identical\ndaughter vesicles that were different in their membrane and interior \u201ccytoplasmic\u201d\ncompositions. Additionally, osmotic-stress induced aqueous phase separation and polarity\nin daughter vesicles is reported. In Chapter 4, the differential segregation of denatured\nproteins and preferential accumulation in one daughter vesicle, but not the other, upon\nasymmetric fission of an ATPS GV is presented. The asymmetric segregation of\naggregates is believed to play a role in cellular aging, and the work described in Chapter\n4 provides insight into possible mechanisms by which this biased aggregate accumulation\nmay occur in living systems. Chapter 5 describes observed non-ideal properties of ATPS,\nand measured polymer-polymer interactions, in order to gain insight into the driving\nforces of ATPS phase separation- information that is fundamentally important for our\nsynthetic cell work. Overall, this thesis presents important findings on ATPS phase\nbehavior, and demonstrates a model cell capable of polarity and asymmetric cell division.\nThis model cell could potentially serve as a test bed for examining hypotheses in cell\nbiology (e.g. the role of membrane composition in cellular polarity; malfunctions in\nasymmetric inheritance; spatial and organization cues in polarity induction, etc.).", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4127], "author_name_tesi": "Koback, Meghan  Jo", "last_name_ssi": "Koback", "middle_name_ssi": "Jo", "first_name_ssi": "Meghan ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating", "Barbara Jane Garrison", "Nicholas Winograd", "Scott A Showalter", "Peter J Butler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating, Dissertation Advisor", "Barbara Jane Garrison, Committee Chair", "Nicholas Winograd, Committee Member", "Scott A Showalter, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ATPS", "Aqueous phase separation", "Aqueous Two-Phase System", "Polyethylene glycol", "Dextran", "Giant Vesicles (GVs)", "lipid bilayer", "vesicles", "liposomes"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Effects of Cocos Ridge Collision on the Western Caribbean: Is There a Panama Block?", "id": "16027", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7390", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We present improved block kinematics of the western Caribbean and a new interpretation of tectonic behavior of the Panama Region, both of which suggest effects of the Cocos Ridge collision. It has been argued whether the region behaves as a tectonic block, a segmented region, or a deforming zone. This study is the first to comprehensively analyze the kinematics of Central America, using a spatially and temporally reinforced Global Positioning System (GPS) network covering the region from Guatemala to Colombia. Through kinematic block modeling, we simultaneously solve for the Euler vectors of the Central American fore arc, the Panama Region, and the North Andes and Choco blocks in northwestern South America, and coupling on block bounding faults that best describe the observed velocity field. We use seismic reflection profiles, seismic tomography, hypocentral locations, and structural and geologic studies to propose and approximate block boundaries. In our inversion of the three-dimensional GPS velocity data and earthquake slip vectors, published Euler vectors constrain block motion. We construct nine principal models to investigate the location and nature of the western boundary of the Panama Region and to test different block models of the western Caribbean.\n\nModel results suggest counterclockwise rotation of the Central American fore arc relative to the Caribbean plate described by the Euler vector, (89.1W, 8.0N, 1.125 \u00b1 0.121\u00b0 Ma-1), indicating tectonic escape from the Cocos Ridge. The block rate and motion of the fore arc ranges from 10.4 mm a-1 directed northwestward in northern Costa Rica to 15.0 mm a-1 directed westward in Guatemala. In our best-fit model, the Panama Region is a single tectonic block rotating counterclockwise about the Euler pole located at 95.6W, 26.9N and at a rate of 0.216 \u00b1 0.238\u00b0 Ma-1 relative to the Caribbean plate, not a predictable direction for tectonic escape. We interpret this northeastward motion as a result of ridge collision and northwestward pushing from the neighboring Choco and North Andes blocks. Network gaps in the Panama Region leaves the possibility that a segmented or deforming Panama Region explains the surface velocities better than the single block model.\n\nThe Panama Region motion in central Costa Rica relative to the Caribbean plate suggests a recurrence interval longer than 420 years for earthquakes comparable to the 1991 MW 7.7 El Limon event along the western segment of the North Panama Deformed Belt.

The direct impact of perceived discrepancy on the relationship between parental expectations and psychological distress as well as the indirect impact of cultural context and cultural values on psychological distress via perceived expectations discrepancy were the foci of this study. The concept of cognitive appraisal (evaluation of a transaction between the person and the environment; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) was the basis for viewing perceived expectations discrepancy as cognitive appraisal, which determines the stressful nature of a series of transactions between the person and the environment. \n     The role of culture was critical in this study, as one\u0081fs beliefs and values are thought to have an impact on the cognitive appraisal process (Lazarus & Folkman). Two models with and without cultural context and cultural values as indirect predictors of psychological distress via the perceived discrepancy were hypothesized. \nStructural equation modeling was used to test models predicting psychological distress with a sample of 203 Chinese American undergraduate students. Due to the poor factor loadings of cultural context indicators onto the cultural context variable, the structural model that included the cultural context variable was not tested. However, bivariate correlations indicated that generational status predicts level of perceived discrepancy as well as parental expectations. \n     Results suggested that a structural model including perceived discrepancy, perceived parental expectations, and cultural values as predictors of psychological distress fit the data adequately. Whereas parental expectations was a significant predictor of psychological distress in bivariate correlations, such significance was reduced to none in the presence of perceived discrepancy in SEM analysis. Thus, the role of perceived discrepancy as a mediator between parental expectations and psychological distress was supported. Cultural values were found to have a significant indirect effect on psychological distress via perceived discrepancy. Given the importance of meeting familial expectations within Asian cultures in general, the results indicated the need for students\u0081f cultural values to be considered in predicting their level of perceived discrepancy as well as psychological distress.

The layered structure in HLaNb2O7 was modified by pillaring, exfoliation-restacking, and further annealing. The modification in structure strongly affected the grain boundary conduction, rather than grain bulk conduction. Grain boundary conduction is thought to be strongly dependent on adsorbed water, whereas grain conduction would be more dependent on movement of interlayer protons. HLaNb2O7 was prone to reduction under hydrogen, yielding a mixed ionic-electronic conductor. In-plane conductivity measurements on an oriented film of HLaNb2O7 showed similar behavior. Part of this reduction was suppressed by addition of water vapor to the ambient atmosphere and by replacing the B-site niobium with tantalum.\n\nIn Chapter 3, the nanoscroll-to-nanotube thermal transformation was studied for H4Nb6O17.4.4H2O scrolls, prepared by exfoliation of K4Nb6O17. Thermal dehydration of the scrolls produces Nb2O5 nanotubes at 400-450oC. The non-topochemical transformation results in polycrystalline nanotubes; however, significant texturing with respect to the tube axis is observed. Substituting Ta for Nb in the precursor compound led to a lower yield of scrolls, most likely because there is less built-in lattice strain to drive scrolling of the unilamellar colloidal sheets.\n\nChapter 4 reports the synthesis of a wide range of single crystal spinel platelets with exposed (111) faces, lateral dimensions in the micron range, and thicknesses of 20-50nm, prepared by soft chemical dehydration of well crystallized layered precursors. This method enables the synthesis of the metastable composition NiCoAlO4, which cannot be prepared by conventional solid state synthesis. Because of their nanoscale thickness, mosaic structure, shape anisotropy, and surface porosity, NiCoAlO4 and NiCo2O4 platelets exhibit room temperature superparamagnetism (TB = 40K, 250K respectively) despite the fact that they have micron-size lateral dimensions. The accessibility of a wide range of superparamagnetic spinel platelets (as opposed to cubes or spheres) should be useful for studies in ferrofluids and related composite magnetic materials.\n\nThe final chapter examines the fluorination of the layered perovskites NaYTiO4, RbLaNb2O7, and KCa2Nb3O10 to yield the fluorine-exchanged perovskite products NayTiO4-xFx, RbLaNb2O7-xFx, and KCa2Nb3O10. Such fluorination under an inert atmosphere preserves the layered perovskites structure but slightly modifies the unit cell. Fluorination reduces the B-site cation, inducing a mixed valency at the B-site. Electronic structure calculations on RbLaNb2O6F show that in the absence of structural disorder, the resulting material is a 2-D metallic conductor. RbLaNb2O6F is air stable, and is capable of ion-exchange with aqueous acid. By exfoliating these layered materials, it may be possible to obtain metallic conducting oxide nanosheets, which have not been extensively reported upon in the past.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6912], "author_name_tesi": "Kobayashi, Yoji ", "last_name_ssi": "Kobayashi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yoji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk", "Harry R Allcock", "John V Badding", "Digby D Macdonald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Chair", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Digby D Macdonald, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["layered double hydroxide", "Nb2O5", "nanotube", "proton conductivity", "Dion-Jacobson", "layered perovskite", "layered oxide", "spinel", "superparamagnetism", "oxyfluoride", "WIEN2k"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Updating the Colonial Cartographic Representation of Barbados: Digital Inquiries of a Sugar Island", "id": "13747pjk223", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13747", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The island of Barbados, settled in the 1620s as an English colony, grew swiftly to\nbecome a major economic node in the Atlantic trade network by producing sugar and\nrum.

In the first part, we focus on detecting samples from anomalous latent classes, buried within a collected batch of known (normal) class samples, where the number of features for each sample is high. We assume and observe to be true that careful feature selection within unsupervised anomaly detection may be needed to achieve the most accurate results (depending on the particular feature representation that is in use). \nWe form pairwise feature tests based on Gaussian mixture models, with one test for every pair of features. The mixtures are estimated using known class samples (null training set). Using these mixture models, p-values are obtained on the test batch samples under the null hypothesis. We use these p-values in basically two different ways. In our first approach, we consider sample-by-sample detection of anomalous class samples amongst the batch of collected samples. We propose a novel sample-wise sequential anomaly detection procedure with growing number of tests. New tests are included only when they are needed, i.e., when their use on currently undetected samples will yield greater aggregate statistical significance of multiple testing corrected detections than obtainable using the existing test set. This approach aims to maximize aggregate statistical significance of all detections made up until a finite horizon. We then approach this anomaly detection problem as a clustering problem. We calculate approximate joint p-values for candidate anomalous clusters, defined by (sample subset, test subset) pairs. Our approach sequentially detects the most significant clusters of samples in a networking context. We use different kinds of feature representations and conditioning contexts and experimented on many datasets for comprehensive performance evaluation purposes. Our p-value clustering algorithm is compared, using ROC curves, with alternative p-value based methods, our sample-by-sample sequential detection, and the one-class SVM. All the competing methods make sample-wise detections, i.e., they do not jointly detect anomalous clusters. The anomalous class was either an HTTP bot (Zeus) or peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic. For certain feature representations, our p-value clustering approach gives promising results for detecting the Zeus bot and P2P traffic amongst Web. \n\nIn the second part, we analyze some issues about the network neutrality. We investigate the relations between caching, pricing, and revenues of entities under the light of network neutrality concerns. Firstly, we consider a model with two ``eyeball\" Internet Service Providers (ISPs)\n(i.e., those acting as both network access and content providers (CP)), with transit pricing of net traffic at their peering point. That is, there is an inter-provider service-level agreement (SLA) involving a revenue based on net transit traffic flow across their peering point(s). We studied the effects of caching remote content via a game between the ISPs on a platform having usage-priced subscribers. We do this for two cases: one is for different congestion points in each ISP (depending traffic origin) leading to\ntractable Nash equilibria; and the other is for a single congestion point which we herein study numerically. Secondly, we consider a game between an ISP and CP on a platform of end-user demand. A price-convex demand-response is motivated based on the delay-sensitive applications that are expected to be subjected to the assumed usage-priced priority service over best-effort service. Thus, we are considering a two-sided market with multiclass demand wherein one class (that under consideration herein) is delay-sensitive. Both the Internet and proposed Information Centric Network (ICN, encompassing Content Centric Networking (CCN)) scenarios are considered. For our purposes, the  ICN case is basically different in the polarity of the side-payment (from ISP to CP in an ICN) and, more importantly here, in that content caching by the ISP is incentivized. A price-convex demand-response model is extended to account for content caching. The corresponding Nash equilibria are derived and studied numerically.

In this kind of mechanism, every single warship periodically (e.g. once a week) applies a routine complete check on the reliability and the operability of her material systems and assigns a credit score in a given range for each main system and a subsystem according to the relevant technical documents. After summing up the credits to get an overall score for each main system, she sends a routine report to her immediate headquarters periodically in a given format unless otherwise stated.

At the end, it is concluded that the most suitable combination would be Borda Count via Ideal Values considering the practicality and consistency of the methodologies mentioned.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6459], "author_name_tesi": "Kocaman, Veysel ", "last_name_ssi": "Kocaman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Veysel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Soundar Kumara", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Soundar Kumara, Thesis Advisor", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ORL", "MCDM", "AHP", "LINMAP", "DEA", "Lp Metrics", "Borda Count", "Readiness", "Ranking", "Scaling", "Normalization"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Monte Carlo Simulation Of Laminar Composite Breakdown In DC Field", "id": "11567", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "794", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this project is to utilize computer model to simulate and explore the effects of a high-permittivity (k) barrier located between capacitor plates on dielectric breakdown properties. By improving our knowledge of electric breakdown and degradation in composite dielectrics it is hoped that a more reliable capacitor with a graceful failure mechanism can be developed.  Using Mathsoft\u2019s MathCad 13 software, a Monte Carlo based computer simulation was developed to model the treeing phenomena found in capacitor breakdown. The model explored the electrostatic effects of adding a high-k barrier within an existing dielectric causing a dielectric contrast and distorting the electric field. In the program, normalized local fields are compared to a random number between 1 and 0 to determine breakdown events. Weibull statistics were applied to the collected data and characteristic number of breakdown steps was compared between runs. Run conditions explored dielectric contrasts of 2, 10, 50, 100 and a homogeneous matrix. Barrier location was varied from \u00bc to \u00be of the distance between capacitor plates and occupied 2 of 60 vertical spaces (3.3%) of capacitor thickness. Characteristic breakdown steps for each condition did not show significant trends until higher contrast values. It was noted that average time spent within the barrier increased with barrier distance from the initiation point and the contrast between the barrier and the matrix. It was also observed that lateral growth occurred with higher dielectric contrast values. Further development of the model to incorporate more material properties affecting breakdown would be highly beneficial in understanding current experimental observations.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [788], "author_name_tesi": "Koch, Benjamin T", "last_name_ssi": "Koch", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan", "Michael T Lanagan", "Eugene Furman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan, Thesis Advisor", "Michael T Lanagan, Thesis Advisor", "Eugene Furman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Capacitor", "Energy Storage", "Monte Carlo", "Breakdown", "Composite Dielectric", "Dielectric", "composite", "simulation", "dielectric  contrast", "dielectric barrier", "barrier"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Effects of Age on Sympathetic Vasoconstrictor Responsiveness in Exercising Leg Muscles\n", "id": "9050", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1632", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vasoconstrictor responsiveness to acute sympathetic stimulation declines with advancing age in resting skeletal muscle.  However, the effect of age on sympathetic vasoconstrictor responsiveness in exercising skeletal muscle has not been examined previously.  Therefore, the purpose of these studies was to examine the balance between sympathetic vasoconstriction and metabolic vasodilation in the leg vasculature, both during large and small muscle exercise.\nThe purpose of the first study was to determine if age-related reductions in sympathetic vasoconstrictor responsiveness also occur in exercising skeletal muscle.  Thirteen younger (20-30 yr) and seven older (62-74 yr) healthy non-endurance trained men performed cycle ergometer exercise at &#61566;60% of maximal oxygen uptake while leg blood flow (femoral vein thermodilution), mean arterial blood pressure (radial artery catheter), and plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations were measured.  After steady state was reached (i.e. ~4 minutes), acute sympathetic stimulation was achieved by immersing a hand in ice water for 2-4 minutes (cold pressor test, CPT).  CPT tended to cause a larger increase in mean arterial blood pressure in older men (O:16&#61617;3 vs. Y:10&#61617;2 mmHg) during exercise, but increases in arterial noradrenaline were similar (O:2.56&#61617;0.96 vs. Y:1.98&#61617;0.40 nM).  However, the older men demonstrated a larger percentage reduction in exercising leg vascular conductance (leg blood flow/mean arterial pressure) during CPT compared to younger men (O: -13.6&#61617;3.1% vs. Y: -1.5&#61617;4.3%; P=0.04).  Leg blood flow tended to increase in the younger men, but not in the older men (P=0.10).  These results suggest, in contrast to what has been observed in resting skeletal muscle, that vasoconstrictor responsiveness to sympathetic stimulation is not reduced, but may be augmented in exercising muscle of healthy older humans.\nThe results of the first study raised the possibility that aging enhances sympathetic vasoconstrictor responsiveness in exercising legs.  However, age-associated reductions in cardiac reserve or age group differences in the absolute workload performed may have contributed to the increased vasoconstriction observed in older men in that study.  In the second study, then, the topic was revisited.  In this study, small muscle leg exercise (single leg knee extension) exercise was used to minimize cardiac output limitations, and all subject groups were matched for absolute exercise intensity.  Therefore, 10 young (20-30 yrs) and 9 older (60-79 yrs) healthy, recreationally active men performed both active and passive single leg knee extension exercise before, during, and after acute sympathetic stimulation (ischemic handgrip at 40% maximal voluntary contraction to exhaustion, followed by 2 minutes of post-handgrip circulatory arrest).  Blood pressure (Finometer), femoral artery blood flow (Doppler ultrasound), femoral conductance, and plasma catecholamines were measured at baseline, during exercise, and during exercise with sympathetic stimulation.  No age group differences were found in the femoral vascular conductance response to sympathetic stimulation during passive exercise (P=0.56), but smaller decreases in conductance were noted in older versus younger men during active exercise (Y: 14&#61617;3%; O: 4&#61617;3%, P=0.045).  In a subset analysis of 4 younger and 4 older men, sympatholytic responses were augmented in the older men (P=0.002).  These results suggest that there is not an age-associated impairment in functional sympatholysis in healthy men under these conditions.\n\tCollectively, the results of these studies suggest that primary aging is unlikely to be associated with enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness in exercising leg muscles in healthy, normally-active men.  Briefly, the results of the first study were not duplicated in the second study in which younger and older subject groups were matched on absolute exercise intensity.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1619], "author_name_tesi": "Koch, Dennis William", "last_name_ssi": "Koch", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Dennis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor", "David Nathan Proctor", "William Lawrence Kenney Jr.", "Lawrence Isaac Sinoway", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "Mosuk Chow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor, Dissertation Advisor", "David Nathan Proctor, Committee Chair", "William Lawrence Kenney Jr., Committee Member", "Lawrence Isaac Sinoway, Committee Member", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Committee Member", "Mosuk Chow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vascular control", "vasoconstriction", "sympatholysis", "sympathetic", "blood flow", "exercise", "aging"]}]
