Hence, it is important to understand the interactions that occur at the water/metal oxide interfaces. In this dissertation, we have used ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study these interactions. In particular, we will study the (110) surfaces of the commonly occurring natural polymorphs of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and tin dioxide (SnO2) known as rutile and cassiterite, respectively. \nA detailed analysis is presented for the structure of water above the rutile (110) surface. We find three distinct layers of water that are identified as L1, L2 and L3. The water molecules in L1 layer are covalently bonded with the metal atoms in the surface. The L2 layer is highly structured, which is in good agreement with the X-ray studies. The water molecules in this layer adsorb at two well-defined sites. The most prominent location is above and around the bridging oxygen. The other site is located above and between the two terminal oxygens from the L1 layer. The water molecules in the L3 layer do not show any specific adsorption preference. We show that the preferential adsorption sites, in L2 water layer, are produced by strong hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between the surface and the water layer above the surface. The strength of these H-bonds is estimated from the broadening of the corresponding stretching mode of the vibrational band. The total vibrational spectrum from our ab initio simulations is in excellent agreement with those obtained from the inelastic neutron scattering experiments.\n We compare the proton jump processes in the hydration layer on both rutile (110) and cassiterite (110) surfaces. A set of five simulations is done, for both surfaces, to remove the effect of initial configuration on the simulation results. These simulations differ in the dissociation level of the adsorbed water molecules in the initial configurations. We find that all five simulations equilibrate to ~25% and ~60% water dissociation level on rutile and cassiterite, respectively. This dissociation level is dynamical and both surfaces exhibit proton jumping events for the whole time of the simulation and throughout the whole surface. The cassiterite surface has three times higher proton jumping events than rutile surface. The higher proton jump activity on cassiterite is produced by stronger H-bond between the surface and the water layer above the surface. We find that the stronger covalent and ionic interaction, due to the difference in the electronic structure, leads to stronger H-bond on cassiterite. In general, we find that the H-bonds are stronger on cassiterite than on rutile surface. Among these, the bridging oxygen atoms form the strongest H-bonds between the surface and the hydration layer. Thus, the cassiterite surface has the highest proton jump activity, around 10 times greater than the rutile surface.\nAnother surface property that provides insight into the interaction of the water with the metal oxide surface is the length of the bond between the bridging or terminal oxygen and the five fold coordinated metal atom on the surface. This metal oxygen (M-O) bond length is sensitive to its local environment. We find that the M-O bond length increases as the number of covalently bonded hydrogen atoms increase on either the bridging oxygen or the terminal oxygen, on both surfaces. The histogram of the M-O bond length is narrower on cassiterite surface indicating stronger M-O bond. The terminal water forms higher average number of H-bonds on rutile surface resulting in an additional broadening of the corresponding M-O bond length histogram. We also find that, along with the number of H-bonds, the species forming the H-bond plays an important role in determining the M-O bond length. The M-O bond length histogram for the dissociated water molecule, on rutile surface, exhibits an interestingly broad peak. A closer look at the H-bonding environment shows that the broad M-O histogram contains two distinct peaks. We show that one of these peaks is completely due to a specific set of species that forms the H-bond with the dissociated water molecule. \nFinally, we study the dependence of dissociation preference of the adsorbed water molecules on the thickness of the slab that is used to model the rutile surface. A three-layer slab shows preference for partial dissociation. But this preference changes as thicker slabs are used in the simulation. Moreover, the adsorption energy difference between the associated and partially dissociated configurations increases monotonically with the slab thickness. We find that this energy difference converges when the atoms below the first layer of the slab are kept fixed at the bulk positions. This indicates that the bulk plays an important role in determining the dissociation state of the water molecules adsorbed on the surface. The H-bond between the bridging oxygen and the water molecule weakens with the increasing slab thickness. We show that the weakening of the H-bond affects the proton transfer that is necessary for obtaining a dissociated configuration. Along with the slab thickness, we also investigate the effect of lateral size of the simulation cell on the dissociation preference. This study shows that a larger simulation cell, with sufficient slab thickness, may eventually prefer fully associated configuration for the adsorbed water molecules. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7112], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Nitin ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nitin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Renee Denise Diehl", "Reka Z Albert", "Coray M Colina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Dissertation Advisor", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Chair", "Renee Denise Diehl, Committee Member", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member", "Coray M Colina, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rutile(110)", "interface", "rutile water interface", "proton jump", "cassiterite water interface", "water dissociation", "ab initio"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Essays in Banking and Production", "id": "18787", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8762", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " Chapter 1\n\"Market Power and Cost Efficiencies in Banking\"\n\n A merger wave during the last 20 years has led to a decrease in the number of commercial banks from 12,343 in 1990 to 6,222 in 2012. For anti-trust and regulatory agencies, evaluating the relative importance of market power and cost efficiencies that result from a horizontal merger is important. To quantify these two effects, I develop an empirical model of banking which includes a demand model for differentiated products that allows market power effects to be calculated and a cost model that quantifies cost efficiencies from a merger. Since most of these banks operate in more than one market, incorporating the network structure of branches in the analysis is important. Cost parameters related to the network structure are estimated using moment inequality methods. Using the estimated parameters, I simulate mergers between banks of various sizes. I find that for a merger between 2 small banks (less than 500 branches), cost efficiencies play an important role in profitability. While for mergers involving a large bank (more than 500 branches) and a small bank or two large banks, the benefits accruing from market power are far more than the cost savings if there is substantial overlap in the networks of the merging banks. Although mergers involving large banks generate more market power, overall consumer welfare increases as the price effect of market power gets dominated by the consumer's preference for a larger bank. \n\n Chapter 2 \n\"Market Structure and Growth of Banking in Rural Markets\"\n\n The passage of the Riegle-Neal act in 1994 enabled banks to expand their network of branches across the United States. Since rural markets are often seen as unattractive destinations for banks due to the lack of commercial activities, this could possibly lead to a lower branch density in rural markets relative to the larger metropolitan markets. Hence it is important to understand the underlying dynamics governing the market structure in these rural areas. In this paper, we study the incentive structure governing branching growth in rural banking markets in the United States. We develop and estimate a dynamic oligopoly model with a rich state space. We find that one-branch banks have a very different incentive structure than other banks in that they generate most of the revenue from non-interest income such as fund-management fees, loan-arrangement fees and by selling insurance. Banks with more than one branch generate revenue using the traditional method of collecting deposits and investing in loans. There is a large adjustment cost involved in opening a second branch which results in few banks making that transition. \n\nChapter 3\n\"Unraveling Effects of Demand Shocks on Production Function Estimation and Firm Behavior\"\n\n The traditional productivity measures estimated using revenue-based firm-level data have both demand side and production side shocks embedded in them. In order to separate these two shocks, a small literature has exploited output price data but this data is typically not available in firm-level production data sets. In this paper, we use inventory data to disentangle and separately identify demand and productivity shocks without using any price data. Introducing a demand shock into the model also addresses the multi-collinearity bias pointed out by Ackerberg, Caves and Fraser (2006). Finally, we use our estimates to explain entry/exit dynamics and find that demand shocks are a more important driver of firm-turnover than productivity shocks. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8615], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Pradeep ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pradeep", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts", "Mark John Roberts", "Paul L E Grieco", "James R.

Experiments were designed to investigate the role of water, produced by degradation of 1,4-butanediol, on equilibrium morphology of alpha-Al2O3 particles synthesized under glycothermal conditions.  Development of platelet like morphology was promoted by low water concentrations in the solvent, and development of polyhedron morphology was promoted by high water concentrations in the solvent.  A theoretical model predicting morphology for particles produced under solution conditions is proposed, with the possibility of extension of the model to any particle produced under solution conditions.  A comparison was made between theoretically predicted and experimentally observed morphologies of alpha-Al2O3.  Glycothermal synthesis process for preparing sub 100 nm phase pure alpha-Al2O3 nanoparticles with platelet morphology has been developed.  The role of treatment temperature, seed concentration, stirring speed and solvent water content was investigated in controlling particle size and shape.

These one-hop wireless networks have been extended to multi-hop wireless networks like mesh, ad hoc, and sensor networks. Since the wireless medium is broadcast in nature, multi-hop wireless networks are susceptible to congestion due to excessive traffic in a part of the network. In this dissertation, five algorithms are proposed to ameliorate the impact of congestion on different wireless networks under separate scenarios. \n\n\nAn important aspect of congestion in wireless networks is its indiscriminate impact. Data in sensor networks may not all be equally important and congestion in such a network may lead to low priority data being delivered while high priority data is dropped en route to the destination. A differentiated routing scheme is proposed to address this issue. \n\n\nNetwork coding, heralded as a means to better utilize the medium's capacity as compared to traditional routing's approach of store-and-forward, is also susceptible to congestion. Channelization, or reserved access to the medium, has been proposed as a means to eliminate congestion by assigning parts of the medium to different links. In this dissertation, channelization schemes are proposed for intra-flow network coding of multicast flows in a wireless network. These channelization schemes effectively restore the performance of network coding.\n\n\nCongestion in wireless networks has also been addressed by using appropriate transmission rates in a multi-rate wireless MAC. But a multi-rate medium raises the issue of rate selection, the problem of selecting which transmission rate to use. When inter-flow network coding is used to deliver unicast traffic in such a network, it requires some packets to be multicast. A rate selection scheme is proposed to determine the appropriate transmission rate while taking network coding into account and ensuring that the throughput on the multicast link is maximized. Finally, all prominent rate selection schemes are hop-by-hop. We propose an end-to-end rate selection scheme for networks that leverage opportunistic reception as a means to increase the medium capacity to counter congestion.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5438], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Raju ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Raju", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas La Porta", "Thomas La Porta", "Guohong Cao", "Sencun Zhu", "Aylin Yener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas La Porta, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas La Porta, Committee Chair", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Aylin Yener, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rate Selection", "Network Coding", "Congestion", "Wireless Networks", "Multi-Rate", "Routing"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Development of a Kinetic Particle-based Method to Model the Multi-scale Physics of Expanding Flows\n", "id": "11591", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5448", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multi-scale transitional flows through a nozzle into vacuum are widely studied flows because of their numerous applications in many fields of science and engineering, and, especially in aerospace sciences. These flows are usually characterized by multiple flow length scales, which significantly complicate their accurate and numerically efficient modeling. Experimental studies under such conditions are rare and expensive. For both micro and meso-sized nozzles operating in the space near-vacuum environment, the interaction of flows with sensitive spacecraft surfaces at high altitudes is important, because back-flows produced by such devices can cause contamination to sensitive electronic devices such as optical instruments and solar panels. This damage can potentially jeopardize the active lifetime of expensive space missions.\nThe development of accurate numerical tools capable of simulating multi-scale transitional flows is therefore important, but at the same time, challenging, because the flow regime changes from continuum to transitional along the length of the domain. The continuum techniques based on the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations encounter physical challenges when applied to these flows. In such a scenario, the study of high speed rarefied flows, involving strong thermo-chemical non-equilibrium, suggests direct consideration of the Boltzmann equation. The Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC) approach provides a good approximation to the solution of the Boltzmann equation, but the method becomes prohibitively expensive for modeling high density flows. The Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) method, which solves a simplified form of the Boltzmann equation, is more effective approach in such situations. A computational framework based on a statistical formulation of the BGK method was therefore developed in this work that can handle polyatomic multi-species gas flows. A number of classic fluid flow problems in semi-rarefied flow regime were studied to ascertain the accuracy of the statistical BGK computational framework, such as supersonic flow over a flat plate, planar Couette flow and expanding gas flows in transitional flow regime. These types of flows are commonly found in microfluidic applications. The statistical BGK and a related approach, the Ellipsoidal-Statistical BGK (ESBGK), were found to be equally accurate but more efficient as compared to the benchmark DSMC method for near-equilibrium gas flows, however, for gas flows far from equilibrium, the DSMC method was found to be the preferred approach.\nThe complimentary features of the statistical (particle) BGK and DSMC methods naturally motivated the development of a new particle-particle hybrid scheme that combines the statistical BGK and DSMC methods for an accurate and numerically efficient modeling of multi-scale flows. The new particle-particle hybrid scheme eliminated the typical numerical issues associated with the continuum-particle hybrid schemes, such as issues related to the imposition of boundary conditions at the interfaces. The key idea behind the new hybrid scheme is the use of DSMC for non-equilibrium flow regions, whereas more efficient BGK for near-equilibrium flow regions. In this work, a new switching criterion between the two methods is developed that is fundamentally linked to the physics of non-equilibrium flows, and is based on the deviation of the velocity distribution function from Maxwellian, called as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test. The selection of a particular particle method in each cell in the computational domain is based on the local KS parameter value with respect to a pre-set global switching criterion. A numerically efficient technique to compute the KS parameter is developed so that the degree of non-equilibrium can be calculated for the whole computational domain. To study the new hybrid scheme and its relationship to the rigorous DSMC method, supersonic expanding flow of argon into a vacuum is considered. It is demonstrated that the new hybrid method, composed of DSMC and BGK methods, performed as well as the benchmark DSMC method and better than the two individual component methods in terms of the computational efficiency. The new hybrid scheme can potentially extend the application of particle methods to high density flow regimes.\nThe complexities involved in the modeling of multi-scale expanding flows increase when the gas flows undergo condensation during their supersonic expansion. Condensation has been an active area of research for more than a century with wide applications in a number of fields such as metallurgy, meteorology, chemistry and aerospace engineering. One of the goals of the present work is to model the homogeneous condensation of gas flows at computationally challenging flow conditions by using the statistical BGK method. To this end, a new comprehensive BGK based condensation model is developed that includes models for the processes of nucleation, cluster growth, coalescence and cluster evaporation. In addition to this, a new heat accommodation model is proposed to redistribute the heat released due to the exothermic processes of nucleation and cluster growth. Molecular dynamics studies were carried out to validate the heat accommodation model from a microscopic standpoint. Homogeneous condensation studies were carried out for freely expanding flows of carbon dioxide in the stagnation pressure range of 1 to 5 bar. The new BGK based condensation model enabled the simulation of computationally challenging 5 bar case of carbon dioxide, previously not possible with DSMC, and the simulations showed reasonably good agreement with experiments. In another study, homogeneous condensation of ethanol in air-ethanol mixture is modeled for computationally challenging experimental conditions. Another over riding numerical problem is the resolution of ethanol-cluster collisions from all of the species particle collisions due to the low ethanol partial pressure, making the use of gas/cluster species weighting factors necessary. For this reason, a new weighting scheme is developed to resolve cluster species growth and evaporation, and is incorporated into the BGK-condensation model. The use of the new weighting scheme allowed the simulation of true experimental conditions, and enabled the BGK based condensation simulations to show a significantly improved agreement with experiments. The BGK based condensation model proved to be an effective technique in simulating high density condensing flows.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5440], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Rakesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rakesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Deborah A Levin", "Deborah A Levin", "Philip John Morris", "Barbara Jane Garrison", "Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof Deborah A Levin, Dissertation Advisor", "Deborah A Levin, Committee Chair", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "Barbara Jane Garrison, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["molecular dynamics", "DSMC-ESBGK hybrid method", "Particle-particle hybrid scheme", "homogeneous condensation modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION", "id": "26764", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11291", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Humans can infer meaning through the use of not only the definition of a word, but\nalso, where one word might have various conflicting definitions, based on their experiences and the text\u2019s context and domain.

Fundamental understanding of the mechanics of deformation and fracture of thin films is therefore important from device design and reliability perspectives.\nThis thesis pursues an experimental approach to understand deformation behavior of nanoscale thin films. A micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) based device has been developed to carry out fracture testing of metallic and multilayer thin films in-situ inside the transmission electron microscope (TEM). Nanofabrication techniques are utilized to fabricate a bent beam thermal actuator device integrated with notched fracture testing specimens. The experimental results suggest significant deviation from classical relationship between grain size and underlying deformation mechanism. A key contribution of this research is the size effect on stress concentration. Typically, geometrically necessary dislocations result in strain gradient at the notch tip. However, our in-situ selected area electron diffraction (SAED) studies clearly show the absence of any strain gradient at the notch tip. To explain this anomalous observation, we propose that when the grain size is below a critical size (for aluminum ~ 60 nm), dislocation based plasticity mechanisms are replaced by grain rotation, which homogenize the strain field. In the absence of strain (or stress) concentration, the material becomes flaw tolerant. This behavior is similar to behavior shown by naturally occurring biomaterials. We repeated the experiments on Platinum thin films with grain size favorable for dislocation based mechanics to support our hypothesis.  \nPure metals do not exhibit solid-solid phase transformation since they deform and fail far below the theoretically required stress levels that exceed hundreds of GPa. A key contribution of this research is to show experimentally that by controlling grain size and thickness, classical deformation modes can be suppressed to induce phase transformation in pure metal films at stresses few orders of magnitude lower than theoretical values. For the first time, we present in-situ transmission electron diffraction evidence of face-centered cubic (FCC) to hexagonal \u03c9 phase transformation in 99.99% pure nanocrystalline aluminum at room temperature and only 2.5 GPa of tensile stress. For 60 nm average grain size, the aluminum films did not show any appreciable diffusion-based processes such as grain growth, rotation and sliding. Facilitated by the absence of dislocation and diffusion based processes, the uniaxial nature of specimen loading results in phase transformation at stresses two orders of magnitude lower than that predicted for aluminum. We propose that in absence of dislocations and grain rotation, phase transformation could be the only way to relax the high strain energy at the notch tip without initiating failure, which can make the material flaw tolerant. \nWe also developed an experimental setup for bulk materials to explore the deformation mechanics in thin films of complex multilayer materials, Ti/TiN in present case. We observed that microstructure plays a critical role in determining the performance of multilayer coatings. We also observed that TiN, even though a ceramic, might exhibit significant dislocation activity. Whereas a metal like Ti with small grain may not provide the sufficient ductility required for such materials. Such dislocation activity was observed at room temperature as compared to bulk behavior where dislocations are activated above 0.5Tm (melting point). Typically dislocations are generated at the notch tip and they move away from the notch tip resulting in increased radius of notch/crack tip and reduction in stress concentration. This behavior is called dislocation shielding of a crack. Our experiments suggest a second mechanism where dislocations generated away from the notch tip get attracted by notch tip could provide effective shielding. This behavior may give rise to flaw tolerance in TiN.\nThe final topic of this dissertation explores whether deformation of nanoscale materials result in complex multi domain loading. We utilized electric field generated joule heating and electromigration induced stress to achieve thermo-electro-mechanical loading on the freestanding thin films. This complex loading helped us in mapping the deformation mechanisms in platinum thin films. At very small grain size (5-30 nm) grain growth is the predominant deformation mechanism. For grain size 30-60 nm, grain rotation is the predominant deformation mechanism. Above approximately 80 nm, conventional dislocation based deformation is predominant. This complex thermo-electro-mechanical loading resulted in complete amorphization in aluminum thin films. Such amorphization may be detrimental to performance of interconnects in microelectronic devices.\nThis thesis also lays the foundation for future direction to carry out further research in thin film behavior. Future work includes understanding the coupling between different physical domains such as mechanical, thermal, electrical and optical.

In today\u2019s world of globalization, buildings are being designed in distributed settings with a diverse number of specialists across geographical locations.  This leads to an increasingly complex design process that is inherently collaborative due to the large number and diversity of professionals who are involved. The goal of the study is to investigate how the present scenario of digital mediation facilitates collaboration during the design process in architectural practice.\nSince digital mediation for collaboration in design is an emerging phenomenon, an exploratory investigation using mostly qualitative methods of social science research techniques is undertaken. The objective of the study is to understand the phenomenon of digitally mediated collaboration in two distinct contexts: the academic setting and the realm of professional practice. Observations and field study of a Participatory Design Studio between Pennsylvania State University and Carleton University, where student teams worked remotely on their designs was carried out. The next step was to study exemplary conditions or case studies of architectural firms, who are designing projects that require them to employ digital tools for the purpose of design communication over distributed locations. \nThe study examined the nature of collaboration in various stages of the design process and based on this, identified the type of digital tools and media required for design collaboration. Some of the issues related to digital mediation in design such as design idea exchange and representation, teamwork ability in distributed settings and technical issues of bandwidth and interoperability were revealed. The study compared and contrasts between the tools, technology and mode of design in academia and practice and hence, helped to generate a set of guidelines that enable optimum practices for remote design collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5829], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Sonali ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sonali", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katsuhiko Muramoto", "Loukas N Kalisperis", "Ute Poerschke", "S.

Current research in healthcare facility design strongly indicates that the physical environment greatly impacts end-users in issues of safety and overall health quality. This has led to emerging trends and design approaches such as experience-based design and evidence-based design that encourage participation and collaboration with the end-users of healthcare facilities. Interactive virtual prototyping provides opportunities for embedding experience-based design concepts that enable end-users to truly experience design alternatives and concepts during design reviews. However, studies have also highlighted that developing interactive virtual prototypes is a time-consuming and labor intensive process. \n\nThis study proposes an experience-based virtual prototyping system (EVPS) that was developed, implemented and evaluated at the Hershey Children\u2019s Hospital. The goal of the study was to simulate experience-based design concepts in virtual prototypes within the context of healthcare facilities. This goal was achieved through four objectives. First, requirements for experience-based design review were analyzed by documenting end-user activities in healthcare facilities. Second, a framework was developed to categorize end-user tasks into scenarios that could be simulated in interactive virtual prototypes of a healthcare facility. The third objective focused on developing a computer application called the Experience-Based Virtual Prototyping System (EVPS) to simulate scenarios that take place in healthcare facilities. Lastly, the developed EVPS application was implemented at the Hershey Children\u2019s Hospital to evaluate the effectiveness of task-based scenarios for extracting end user feedback during design reviews.\n\nA virtual prototyping procedure was developed to rapidly convert digital model content into interactive experience-based virtual prototypes for design review. Strategies for development included creation of a system architecture to identify interaction media, modeling content as well as features and functionality requirements.  Design information workflows were investigated to efficiently transfer model content from building information modeling tools to an interactive real-time rendering platform. Procedures to incorporate interactivity were explored to enable simulation of task-based scenarios in virtual prototypes. Finally, a database of reusable interactive model content was developed and utilized for rapid production of experience-based virtual prototypes.\n\nThe experience-based virtual prototyping system was implemented and tested with nurse participants at the Hershey Children\u2019s Hospital. Focus groups enabled the identification of end-user needs and functionality requirements for developing the EVPS. The EVPS application was developed and tailored to the needs of the end-users at the Children\u2019s Hospital - these included transition planning, way finding and staff training before they moved into the new facility. End-users preferred the EVPS to traditional methods of design review, as they were better able to visualize the design and understand the layout of spaces. A user study was designed to compare the design feedback obtained from participants in two conditions comprising a simple walk through and a task-based scenario within the virtual prototype stimulus. The study revealed that adding task-based scenarios in interactive virtual prototypes increases the level of engagement in end users and enables them to provide detailed design feedback related to their daily healthcare activities. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8395], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Sonali ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sonali", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Messner", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba", "Madhu Reddy", "S.

The full extent of this chromatin and transcriptional control, however, has not yet been understood. We explore these questions in a mouse cell line model of erythroid differentiation. G1E is an ES-derived cell line with a genetic knockout of the gene Gata1. G1E cells closely mirror erythroid progenitors BFU-E and CFU-E. An estradiol-dependent rescued subline of G1E (G1E-ER4) mimics normal erythroid maturation on treatment with estradiol. This system provides a physiologically meaningful assay to evaluate genes that are induced or repressed by GATA1.\n\tIn this thesis, we compared the transcriptomes of G1E and differentiating G1E-ER4 cells to primary progenitors and erythroblasts obtained from HA-tagged fetal liver (E13.4), sorted using Ter119 and CD71. We find that a majority of genes expressed in primary erythroid cells are also expressed in the G1E model, with differentially expressed genes being largely regulated in the same direction and a majority of genes in both systems being repressed.  We establish that the transcript profile of G1E cells and primary progenitor, and induced G1E-ER4+E2 cells and primary erythroblasts, are sufficiently similar that meaningful comparisons can be made between transcription factor binding profiles between the primary cells and the G1E cell system. We identify potential long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in G1E/G1E-ER4+E2. \n To study the role of transcription factors and histone modifcations in erythroid gene regulation, we comprehensively mapped transcription factors GATA1, GATA2, TAL1 and CTCF, histone modifications H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, and chromatin accessibility (DHS) and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), genome-wide, in G1E and induced G1E-ER4 cells. In addition to transcriptome data, from RNAseq, we also obtained the expression profile of mouse genes over a 30 hour time course using the Affemtrix Moe430v2 microarray. We studied the relative impact of the levels and changes in these features on the levels and changes in gene expression using dimension reduction, discriminant analysis and multivariate regression. In both G1E and G1E/G1E-R4+E2, we find that the levels of histone modifications H3K4me3, H3K4me1 and H3K9me3 drive the discriminations between expressed and silent genes with H3K4me1&3 being strongly associated with expression and H3K9me3 being associated with silent genes.  We also find that these epigenetic factors do no discriminate between induced and repressed genes in both G1E and G1E-ER4+E2 cell lines. Comparison of the covariation structure of the ten epigenetic features between the G1E and its restored cell line G1E-ER4+E2 revealed limited changes during erythroid differentiation, suggesting that the establishment chromatin marks occurs prior to GATA1-triggered differentiation. We also studied the explanatory power of the epigenetic features in relation of the level of gene expression using regression. Our models explain ~70% of the variation in expression in both progenitor and erythroblast cells. We find that changes in epigenetic features do not significantly increase the power of the discriminatory models. However, a synergy between changes in histone modifications and transcription factor binding contributes to explaining ~35% of the change in expression. \n\tWe investigate this interplay between transcription factors GATA1, GATA2 and TAL1, in G1E and G1E-ER4+E2. We find that most induced genes have GATA1 and TAL1 close to the start site, while some repressed genes have only GATA1 without TAL1 occupancy. The erythroid transcription factor KLF1 is expressed in primary progenitors and erythroblasts. We find that the EKLF interactome shows very little overlap with regions that bind the erythroid transcription factors GATA1, TAL1 and GATA2 leading to a model that EKLF directs gene expression programs that are independent of those regulated by GATA1 and TAL1. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7159], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Swathi Ashok", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "Ashok", "first_name_ssi": "Swathi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison", "Robert Paulson", "David Scott Gilmour", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Francesca Chiaromonte"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Paulson, Committee Chair", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Member", "Francesca Chiaromonte, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Epigenetics", "erythroid differentiation", "multivariate statistics", "histone modifications", "transcription factors", "G1E", "G1E-ER4+E2"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Essays in the Economics of Explicit Collusion", "id": "18745", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8854", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "CHAPTER 1 (with Robert C. Marshall, Leslie M. Marx and Lily Samkharadze): Buyer Resistance for Cartel versus Merger\n\nProcurement practices are affected by uncertainty regarding suppliers\u2019 costs, the na- ture of competition among suppliers, and uncertainty regarding possible collusion among suppliers. Buyers dissatisfied with bids of incumbent suppliers can cancel their procure- ments and resolicit bids after qualifying additional suppliers. Recent cartel cases show that cartels devote considerable attention to avoiding such resistance from buyers. We show that in a procurement setting with the potential for buyer resistance, the payoff to firms from forming a cartel exceeds that from merging. Thus, firms considering a merger may have an incentive to collude instead. We discuss implications for antitrust and merger policy.\n\nCHAPTER 2: Collusive Price Announcements with Strategic Buyers\n\nThe international vitamins cartel that operated in the 1980s and 90s issued coordinated public price announcements in an attempt to influence prices. This was done in an envi- ronment where buyers had the ability to take incremental actions to increase competition among the sellers. A particularly striking feature of the price announcements was their arrival in gradual increments which, in turn, served to raise transaction prices gradually. Motivated by these observations, this paper constructs a two period dynamic model of (explicitly) collusive price announcements, featuring a buyer who can (at a cost) increase competition in the procurements it conducts by qualifying a non-cooperative \u201coutside\u201d seller. In this setting, the paper shows that there exists an explicitly collusive mechanism that for an interesting range of parameter values exhibits gradually increasing price an- nouncements, resulting in transaction prices that rise gradually. Moreover, the cartel in our model obtains payoffs greater than those under competition by submitting bids that are completely indistinguishable from non-cooperative bids. Thus, the paper not only for- malizes the notion that a cartel may raise prices gradually to counter buyer \u201cresistance\u201d, but also highlights the role of a cartel\u2019s price announcements in doing so. Understanding the latter aspect of collusive pricing is of particular interest because issuing public price announcements can be consistent even with non-cooperative conduct.\n\nCHAPTER 3: Collusion in Auctions with Endogenous Quantity: A Numerical Exploration\n\nThe effects of the presence of a non all-inclusive bidding ring on the outcome of en- dogenous demand procurements is explored. We build on Hansen (1988), where a buyer with a publicly known demand curve conducts a procurement, and the quantity trans- acted is a function of the bids. In a first-price procurement (FPP) the per unit transac- tion price equals the lowest bid and the quantity transacted corresponds to that price. The transaction price and quantity are determined analogously in a second-price pro- curement. Numerical results show that irrespective of the underlying demand curve, the buyer and the non-cartel bidder prefer the endogenous demand FPP over the endogenous demand SPP. However, while the cartel prefers the SPP over the FPP for relatively inelas- tic demand curves, for sufficiently elastic demand curves it prefers the FPP over the SPP. The numerical exercises also suggest that although the payoff for two out of three sellers to form a cartel is lower in a FPP than an SPP when demand is relatively inelastic, when demand is sufficiently elastic, the incentive to form such a cartel is higher in an FPP than an SPP.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8700], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Vikram ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vikram", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Clifford Marshall", "Robert Clifford Marshall", "Leslie M Marx", "Edward James Green", "Vijay Krishna", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica", "Leslie M Marx"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Clifford Marshall, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Clifford Marshall, Committee Chair", "Leslie M Marx, Committee Chair", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member", "Leslie M Marx, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cartel", "Collusion", "Procurement", "Merger", "Monopolization", "Price Announcements", "Endogenous Quantity"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "SYSTEMS BASED OPTIMIZATION APPROACHES TO ANALYZE AND IMPROVE METABOLIC NETWORKS", "id": "10665", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6425", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The central theme of this dissertation is the development of computational frameworks to analyze and improve the content of metabolic networks. The key questions that are addressed in this work are how does one a) characterize and automatically identify topological inconsistencies in a given metabolic network, b) rectify these inconsistencies by modifying these networks both internally and externally, c) develop a systematic framework to compare predictions of a given metabolic network with observed experimental data, d) develop optimization tools to reconcile any inconsistencies between model predictions and observed data and e) apply these tools during the elucidation of metabolic networks for novel organisms instead of applying them to existing metabolic networks. \nIn the first part of the dissertation, we will provide the background in biology needed to understand the role of metabolism in the cell. We will then introduce the formalisms established to model this cellular process as a large-scale network. Equipped with these concepts, in the second part of the dissertation, we will characterize notions of topological inconsistencies (\u201cgaps\u201d) in these networks and design a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) (GapFind) developed to automatically pinpoint them. Subsequently, we will introduce a MILP (GapFill) developed to automatically correct these inconsistencies by minimally adding foreign reactions from external databases and alternatively, by suggesting modifications of thermodynamic assumptions in the existing network. We demonstrate these procedures by analyzing the metabolic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cervisiae (commonly known as yeast), which are model organisms used extensively in the biological community.\nIn the next part of the dissertation, we utilize the gold standard for testing the accuracy and completeness of these models of metabolism, which is to compare their cellular growth predictions  (i.e., cell life/death) across different scenarios with available experimental data. Although these comparisons have been used to suggest model modifications in prior efforts, the key step of identifying these modifications has often been performed manually. In this part of the thesis, we describe an automated procedure GrowMatch that addresses this challenge. When the model over-predicts the metabolic capabilities of the organism by predicting growth in contrast with experimental data, we use a minimax inspired bilevel optimization model to restore consistency by suppressing growth enabling biotransformations in the model. Alternatively, when the model under-predicts the metabolic capabilities of the organism by predicting no growth (i.e., cell death) in contrast with available data, we use an MILP to restore consistency by adding growth-enabling biotransformations to the model. We demonstrate the use of GrowMatch by reconciling growth prediction inconsistencies of the latest Escherichia coli model with data available at the Keio database. \nIn the final part of the dissertation, we will demonstrate the use of these procedures during the reconstruction of metabolic models of the organisms, Methanosarcina acetivorans and Mycoplasma genitalium.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6426], "author_name_tesi": "Kumar, Vinay ", "last_name_ssi": "Kumar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vinay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Costas D Maranas/ Dr Soundar T Kumara", "Costas D Maranas", "Soundar T Kumara", "James Gregory Ferry", "David Arthur Nembhard", "Arunachalam Ravindran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Costas D Maranas/ Dr Soundar T Kumara, Dissertation Advisor", "Costas D Maranas, Committee Chair", "Soundar T Kumara, Committee Chair", "James Gregory Ferry, Committee Member", "David Arthur Nembhard, Committee Member", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Optimization", "systems biology", "metabolism", "gaps"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Diversity and Reach of Penn State Extension Programs and Effect of Brokerage and Network Position on Extension Program Outcomes through Social Network AnalysiS (SNA)", "id": "22653", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10285", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study was designed to understand the diversity and reach of Cooperative Extension programs in Pennsylvania delivered by Penn State Extension and the influence  of network variables (brokerage and centrality) on program outcomes (program business performance and demand for the program) using Social Network Analysis (SNA). \nThe study was conducted at Penn State Extension (PSE), the outreach wing of the College of Agricultural Sciences at the Pennsylvania State University. The population for this study consisted of all the programs offered by Penn State Extension and the program stakeholders. The sampling method used for this study was a \u2018census\u2019 of all programs and their stakeholders. The study utilized the SNA methodology and ex-post facto research design. The independent variables used in the study were the network variables, which included five types of brokers (liaison, gatekeeper, representative, itinerant, and coordinator), and degree centrality of Extension programs. There were two dependent variables, change in program business performance and change in demand for the programs. The independent variables were analyzed using UCINET 6 and network maps were drawn using NetDraw\u2019s spring embedding algorithm. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 21). Binary logistic regression was used to test the hypotheses. The study had four hypotheses regarding influence of network variables (degree centrality, gatekeeper brokerage, consultant brokerage, and liaison brokerage) on Extension program outcomes (program business performance and demand for the programs).\nResults showed that network of Penn State Extension is widespread and programs are well connected to stakeholders in the form of number of stakeholders and connections of programs to stakeholders. Analysis using backward Wald binary logistic regression revealed that all the independent variables together (degree centrality, gatekeeper brokerage, consultant brokerage, and liaison brokerage) were statistically significant in predicting the business performance of programs but were unable to significantly explain the change in demand for the programs. Only degree centrality statistically predicted the change in business performance of programs but it had no relationship with demand for Extension programs. None of the other variables significantly predicted the change in business performance or demand for the programs. \nOverall, it can be concluded that, SNA is useful to understand the outreach of Extension and in understanding various outcomes of Extension programs. Based on the findings of the study, it is recommended that emphasis be placed to encourage collaboration among various programs, a need for systematic and accurate data collection and management that provides reliable data for all Extension activities.

Despite their importance, anharmonic effects are typically overlooked due to the high computational cost associated with calculating them. In part 1 of this thesis, anharmonic effects of small clusters of ammonium nitrate and hydroxylammonium nitrate are investigated. We compare the structures and vibrational modes against their harmonic counterparts using a vibrational perturbation theory approach within the density functional theory framework.

Different methods are investigated to calculate the free energy barrier of hydride transfer in DHFR. The hydride transfer reaction is investigated using empirical valence bond molecular dynamics simulations followed by a weighted histogram analysis or umbrella integration to generate the free energy distribution along the reaction coordinate. Fifteen single mutants of DHFR are used in this study. Our results indicate a promising correlation between experimentally determined reaction rates and calculated free energy barriers.

The physicochemical processes occurring within the foam layer, comprised of liquid and gas bubbles, and a gas-phase region above the burning surface are considered.  The chemical kinetics is represented by a global thermal decomposition mechanism within the liquid by considering 18 species and 8 chemical reactions. The reactions governing decomposition of TAGzT were deduced from separate confined rapid thermolysis experiments using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToFMS). Within the gas bubbles and gas-phase region, a detailed chemical kinetics mechanism was used by considering up to 93 species and 504 reactions. The pseudo propellant burn rate was found to be highly sensitive to the global decomposition reactions of TAGzT.  The predicted results of burn rate agree well with experimental burn-rate data.  The increase in burn rate by inclusion of TAGzT is due in part from exothermic decomposition of the azotetrazolate within the foam layer, and from fast gas-phase reactions between triaminoguanidine decomposition products, such as hydrazine, and oxidizer products from the nitramine decomposition. To improve the predictive capability of combustion models like the one discussed above, it is essential to understand the liquid-phase decomposition chemistry of propellants and their additives. Hence in the second part of this research, the decomposition of liquid-phase RDX was studied using FTIR spectroscopy of evolved gas-phase species from rapid thermolysis and of the condensate and residue formed from the decomposition.  Sub-milligram sample of RDX was heated at rates of about 2000 K/s to a set temperature where decomposition occurred under isothermal conditions.  Since RDX melts at around 205\u00b0C, decomposition studies were conducted at temperatures ranging from 265 to 305\u00b0C. 1,3,4-oxadiazole (C2N2H2O, m/z=70) was one of the compounds detected in the thermolysis tests. A chemical reaction mechanism explaining the formation of 1,3,4-oxadiazole is postulated based on the acquired experimental data, thermochemical analysis and related studies. The \u201ccage effect\u201d principle that is important when reactions take place in a liquid phase is applied. Finally in the third part of this research, a detailed reaction mechanism of the decomposition of the high-nitrogen compound guanidinium 5-amino tetrazolate (GA) in the liquid phase is formulated. This compound is chosen because it has a simpler molecular structure as compared to TAGzT. A combined experimental and computational approach is used. The experimental information comes from data published in the literature. The computational approach is based on using quantum mechanics for identifying species and determining the kinetic rates, resulting in 55 species and 85 elementary reactions. In these ab initio techniques, various levels of theory and basis sets were used. A continuum-based model for predicting species formation and mass loss of a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiment was also developed and solved numerically, accounting for reversible chemical reactions and mass transfer in the computational simulations of the GA decomposition process. The model accounts for reactions within the liquid phase and evaporation of several of the observed experimentally measured products. Simulation results for species concentrations and heat release were obtained, and these results were found to satisfactorily match the temporal experimental results previously published in literature for the decomposition of GA. Important reaction pathways in the proposed reaction scheme were identified based on a sensitivity analysis.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9498], "author_name_tesi": "Kumbhakarna, Neeraj Ratnakar", "last_name_ssi": "Kumbhakarna", "middle_name_ssi": "Ratnakar", "first_name_ssi": "Neeraj", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stefan Thynell", "Richard A Yetter", "Prof Adri Van Duin", "James Hansell Adair"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stefan Thynell, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Prof Adri Van Duin, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["RDX", "TAGzT", "combustion model", "confined rapid thermolysis", "GA", "molecular modeling", "reaction mechanism"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATING THE PERSUASIVE EFFECTS OF NARRATIVE COMMUNICATION AND CATEGORIZATION ON DE-STIGMATIZATION OF MENTAL ILLNESS", "id": "15055szk220", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15055", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the past decade, the use of narrative communication as a messaging strategy is gaining a lot of popularity especially in the realm of health communication. In the recent past, researchers have also uncovered some of the important mechanisms that make narratives communication persuasive leading to changes in attitude and behavior. Some of the unique features of narratives include its ability to engross the audience into the story thereby reducing the tendency to counter argue with the message (Moyer-Gus\u00e9, 2008; Slater & Rouner, 2002). Narratives also allow the audience to temporarily experience life through another person\u2019s perspective, thus helping empathize with people who are otherwise hard to empathize with. This makes narratives a powerful tool to use in stigma reduction campaigns. While previous studies have looked at the mechanisms via which narratives aid in empathy and changes in attitudes towards the stigmatized, little is known about how to build characters, and at what point in the plot of the narrative should to reveal about the stigmatized condition to help facilitate destigmatization.  In order to test these effects, a between-subject online experimental design was conducted using narratives, character categorization, and timing of disclosure in context of mental illness. Results indicate that overall, narratives aided in destigmatization of the individual and the group on an explicit level, but did not play a significant effect in reducing implicit bias. A series of mediational analyses indicate that liking of the character mediated the effect between narratives and destigmatization. Results also indicate that cueing participants about the character\u2019s stigmatized condition at the beginning of the narrative amplify implicit bias. These study findings offer multiple theoretical implications for strategic communication and entertainment education.

It sought to examine how maximum solar irradiation power and locational marginal pricing (LMP) of electricity each affect overall revenue output, as well as how they each impact the risk associated with a portfolio of solar sites. Ten different sites were used along the east coast of the U.S. to give a range of both solar availability and LMP zones within the PJM interconnection operating grid. TRNSYS software was used to simulate an array of solar photovoltaics based on the specifications of a current-market PV panel, in order to generate maximum power from the solar irradiation data. Beta values were calculated to determine how the two factors affected the overall risk, as well as how individual sites contributed to the portfolio. A standardized regression model was run on the average maximum power and average LMP in order to evaluate which has a greater impact on revenue variance. The results showed relatively low beta values of around 0.05 for maximum power and 0.09 for LMP (annual timescale), indicating a low level of risk for each site relative to the entire portfolio. A breakdown of the beta values showed that maximum power exhibited low variance and covariance, while LMP had high variance and covariance across sites. This indicated that the more volatile LMP values were the bigger driving force behind revenue variance. The standardized regression analysis further verified the conclusion that the average values of LMP have a greater impact on the variance overall revenue than the average values of maximum solar power. Further study showed that the beta values varied by location, depending on the individual zonal electricity pricing and the climate region of the site. It was determined that when investing in solar PV utility arrays, a core base of low beta sites from the same climate region and stable electricity pricing zones yielded a low risk portfolio. The portfolio could then be expanded upon by bridging over to sites in different climate regions and zones with more volatile LMPs.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9679], "author_name_tesi": "Kumpf, Katrina Heidi", "last_name_ssi": "Kumpf", "middle_name_ssi": "Heidi", "first_name_ssi": "Katrina", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack", "Jeffrey Brownson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seth Adam Blumsack, Thesis Advisor", "Jeffrey Brownson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["solar photovoltaics", "solar irradiation", "beta values", "locational marginal pricing", "investment", "portfolio risk", "portfolio analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL STUDY OF PARAMETRIC EFFECTS ON THE TRANSITION BOILING REGIME FOR FLOW BOILING IN A ROD BUNDLE UNDER LOSS OF COOLANT CONDITIONS ", "id": "14024hkk5111", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14024", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Post-dryout heat transfer is an important phenomenon in the analysis of nuclear fuel rods during a hypothetical loss of coolant accident (LOCA). Heat transfer in transition boiling increases as intermittent wetting of the heated surface takes place. In film boiling, a vapor film covers the heated wall and prevents direct contact heat transfer from the liquid to the rod. The boundary between these two heat transfer regimes occurs at Tmin, the minimum film boiling temperature, sometimes called the Leidenfrost point. Understanding the sensitivity of Tmin to pressure, subcooling, peak power, surface conditions and flow rates is critical because Tmin determines when the vapor film breaks, and the heat transfer significantly improves. In this work, the minimum film boiling temperature has been determined for different ranges of pressure, subcooling, flow rate and peak power for various flooding rate tests. Pressure, liquid subcooling and flow rate were varied from 0.14 MPa to 0.42 MPa (20 to 60 psia), 5 K to 83 K (9 to 150\u00b0F), 0.076 m/s to 0.2032 m/s (3 to 8 in/s), and 1.31 kW/m to 2.3 kW/m (0.4 to 0.7 kW/ft) respectively with the peak power varying from 1.31 kW/m to 2.3 kW/m (0.4 to 0.7 kW/ft) and the initial peak rod temperature varying from 1033 K to 1144 K (1400 to 1600 \u00b0F).

Yet disparities in health care remain a prevalent problem in the U.S. Prior research has established that socio-economic status (SES), race, and geographic location are predictive of health care receipt, but little research has explored the influence of these risk factors in relation to one another, especially among mothers and infants. In addition, little is known about the receipt of health care for mothers and their infants living in more rural areas. To extend previous research and address the dearth of research on health care for rural families, the focus of the present study was to examine the influence of a multitude of factors, including rurality, socio-economic status, and race, on maternal and infant health care services among a predominantly lower-income, non-metropolitan sample living in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Findings indicated few differences in maternal and infant health care by rurality alone. As a whole, mothers and infants reported high frequencies of regular care. Risks associated with low socio-economic standing affected only White families living in more rural areas. These families were at risk for not receiving prenatal care or childbirth preparation services. Findings also indicated that families who are typically most at-risk were actually more likely to receive certain specialty health care services. For example, low-income families and Black families were more likely than families with higher economic standing and White families to receive post-birth home visits. No significant differences in infant well-care visits by income, race, or rurality were found. Mothers with an education beyond high school were almost twice as likely to report having a regular doctor for their child. Other significant predictors of maternal and infant health care receipt included factors that enabled or impeded receipt and factors that created a health care need. These factors included: personal transportation, travel time to reach the doctor, social support, maternal health risks, and whether the child was the mother\u2019s first-born. First-time mothers were significantly more likely to receive childbirth classes and parent education videos. This study demonstrated that although some health care disparities may still exist for lower-income families in non-metropolitan areas, receipt of maternal and infant health care services are greatly improving for at-risk families.

While the immediate (up to two years) impacts of imidacloprid on non-target organisms have been well-documented, the insecticide has been found in hemlock plant tissues eight years post-treatment, raising concerns for long-term impacts on non-target arthropods in hemlock ecosystems. My thesis addresses the potential residual impacts of imidacloprid on both the target pest and the non-target arthropod community using two hemlock stands previously treated with imidacloprid four or nine years ago. \nIn Shenipsit State Forest, where hemlock trees were treated nine years ago, imidacloprid was still present in hemlock needles, albeit at low levels. Although imidacloprid was approaching the limit of detection, HWA densities were lower and displayed impacts on canopy arthropod community composition compared to untreated trees. In additions, non-target canopy arthropod communities might be more sensitive to imidacloprid treatment than our ability to detect this insecticide. In Griswold Research Center, where hemlock trees were treated four years ago, HWA densities were also lower on average than control trees, but impacts on the canopy arthropod community compared to untreated trees were not observed. However, because trees were very close together at Griswold Research Center, some \u201cuntreated\u201d trees designed as controls contained detectable levels of imidacloprid, adding a confounding factor to the ability to detect differences in arthropod communities. Furthermore, there might also be site variations in response to insecticides. Given the results at Shenipsit State forest, land managers should consider the costs and benefits of insecticide use and its long-term effects when working to protect hemlock ecosystems from the invasive HWA. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8999], "author_name_tesi": "Kung, Wing-yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Kung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wing-yi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kelli Hoover", "Andrew Robert Deans", "David A Mortensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kelli Hoover, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Robert Deans, Thesis Advisor", "David A Mortensen, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hemlock woolly adelgid", "Adelges tsugae", "imidacloprid", "systemic insecticide", "Tsuga canadensis", "Eastern hemlock", "long term"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Managing disruption risks in global supply chains", "id": "18727", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8851", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Supply chain disruptions from man-made and natural disasters represent the most pressing concern in supply chain management.

A disruption risk score is determined from a qualitative assessment of three factors: hazard, vulnerability, and risk management practice. We apply the disruption risk assessment framework to quantify the suppliers\u2019 disruption risks of a global distribution company and develop disruption risk matrices for the suppliers\u2019 facilities and suppliers\u2019 transportation links. The assessment could enable the company to better understand their suppliers, to address critical network components, and to prioritize risk management activities. \nNext, we use the quantified disruption risk scores as disruption risk parameters for the supply chain optimization models. We formulate a multi-criteria strategic model for a global supply chain network design. We solve the multi-criteria model using goal programming. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the robustness of the supply chain network by incorporating disruption risk in the supply chain network design decisions.\nEven though the robustness of a supply chain network has been considered at the strategic level, risks still exist. A disruption at a supply chain component may occur at any time during the planning horizon. We formulate a multi-period tactical supply chain model based on the strategic decisions taken during the design phase to evaluate how the disruption at a supply chain component impacts the supply chain network profit and the demand fulfillment. The supply chain network is subjected to a vulnerability analysis and risk mitigation assessment to evaluate the resiliency of the supply chain network operations under disruptions. Finally, we apply risk mitigation strategies, such as extra inventory and backup supplier, to increase the supply chain network resilience. Decision tree analysis is used to evaluate the cost and benefit among the various risk mitigation strategies. \nThe strategic model illustrates that a supply chain network design that relies heavily on maximizing profit may create a network characterized by high disruption risk. Considering disruption risk in a strategic supply chain decision enhances the robustness of a supply chain network. The tactical model enables the resiliency improvement of an existing supply chain network. From the numerical example, all three risk mitigation strategies (use of backup supplier, keep extra raw material inventory, and have both backup supplier and extra inventory) increase the ability of a supply chain to bounce back to a stable condition after facing a supplier disruption. Using a backup supplier increases resiliency by providing adequate supply capacity when there is a disruption. Keeping extra raw material inventory temporarily prevents part shortages when facing a short-term disruption.  Having both a backup supplier and extra raw material would be an appropriate strategy to mitigate medium-term or long-term disruptions as extra inventory allows a supply chain network to continue its operations until a backup supplier is available. The cost benefit analysis shows that all risk mitigation strategies are attractive. The mitigation costs are much less than the mitigation benefits and the supply chain profits with mitigation strategies are higher than those without any mitigation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8697], "author_name_tesi": "Kungwalsong, Kanokporn ", "last_name_ssi": "Kungwalsong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kanokporn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "Paul Griffin", "Deborah Jean Medeiros", "Terry Paul Harrison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran, Dissertation Advisor", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Chair", "Paul Griffin, Committee Member", "Deborah Jean Medeiros, Committee Member", "Terry Paul Harrison, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supply chain", "Disruption risk", "Supply chain risk management", "Robustness", "Resilience", "Vulnerability"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "STRUCTURE OF OXIDE LAYERS FORMED ON CANDIDATE STEEL ALLOYS EXPOSED TO FLOWING LEAD-BISMUTH EUTECTIC FOR GENERATION IV REACTOR APPLICATIONS\n", "id": "9122", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2868", "abstract_tesi": "Ferritic-martensitic steels of interest for use in Generation IV lead cooled fast reactors were corroded in a flowing lead-bismuth eutectic environment and the microstructures of the oxide layers they formed were characterized using microbeam synchrotron radiation.

Inner oxide layers were formed primarily from Fe3O4, but also contained retained ferrite from the bulk metal, carbides, and chromium oxides. Chromium oxides, specifically Cr2O3, are known to act as barriers against the diffusion of oxygen and iron in these materials, slowing oxidation in these materials. The retained bcc iron, or ferrite, in the inner oxide combined with preferential oxidation along lath boundaries suggest that the oxide front advancement proceeded into the metal via preferential oxidation along lath boundaries, followed by selective oxidation of the laths. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2864], "author_name_tesi": "Kunkle, Jamie McKinney", "last_name_ssi": "Kunkle", "middle_name_ssi": "McKinney", "first_name_ssi": "Jamie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Arthur Thompson Motta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Thesis Advisor", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["lead-bismuth eutectic", "corrosion", "Generation IV Nuclear Reactors", "lead cooled fast reactor"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Development Of Control Oriented Electrical And Thermal Models Of An Electric Transit Bus Battery System", "id": "22496", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9910", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents the insights derived from the empirical characterization, modeling, simulation, control-design, and verification tasks performed in developing energy storage system (ESS) controls for a plug-in electric transit-bus.\n\nThe electrical and thermal behavior of a representative electric transit-bus ESS is analyzed through a system-level empirical characterization study. \n\nExperimental data and insights derived from the study are leveraged to develop a control-oriented electrical model of the battery-system, with a provision to incorporate thermal effects.

The soil cores were collected in a continuous hole extending across the soil profile vertically at one location to quantify how solute transport behavior changes with physical and chemical weathering.  Additionally, we performed a field scale doublet tracer test to determine transport behavior within the weathered shale bedrock.  Hydraulic conductivity and porosity are as low as 10^-15 m/s and 0.035, respectively, in the shale bedrock and range as high as 10^-5 m/s and 0.45, respectively, in the shallow soils. Bromide BTCs demonstrated significant anomalous tailing in soil cores and shale bedrock, which do not fit classical advection-dispersion model equations. To quantify the behavior, numerical simulation of solute transport was carried out with both a mobile-immobile (MIM) model and a continuous-time random walk (CTRW) approach.  1-D MIM modeling results on the soil cores yielded low mass transfer rates (<1/d) coupled with large immobile domains ( ) and revealed that solutes were transported within only 30-40% of the total pore space.  MIM modeling results also suggested that immobile porosity is a combination of soil texture, fracture spacing, and porosity development on shale fragments.  Similarly, the field scale doublet tracer test between boreholes indicated fractures are controlling transport and the surrounding shale matrix has a large potential to store and retard solute movement. 1-D CTRW results yielded a parameter set indicative of a transport regime that is consistently non-Fickian across the vertical length of the soil profile, identified solute tracer velocities are up to 50 times greater than the average fluid velocity, predicted that anomalous transport behavior could extend for significant periods of time, and identified the need to incorporate a continuum of mass transfer rates to accurately predict and describe the observed tailing behavior.  These modeling results confirmed the important role of preferential flow paths, fractures, and mass transfer between more- and less-mobile fluid domains, and established the need to incorporate a mass transfer process that utilizes a distribution of mass transfer rates.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [829], "author_name_tesi": "Kuntz, Brad W", "last_name_ssi": "Kuntz", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Brad", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kamini Singha", "Kamini Singha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kamini Singha, Thesis Advisor", "Kamini Singha, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["tracer", "porosity", "permeability", "shale", "solute transport", "Shale Hills", "soil cores", "soil weathering", "anomalous tailing", "mobile-immobile", "continuous time random walk", "MIM", "CTRW", "critical zone", "bromide"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Incubation of heroin-seeking behavior and accompanying molecular changes", "id": "9237", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3472", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The field of neuroscience provides an opportunity to combine psychological and biological studies with the ultimate goal of gaining a better understanding of physiological systems.  The research presented in this dissertation has used this combinatorial approach to make a contribution to the field of drug abuse, specifically relapse to heroin use.  The notion that a handful of genes are particularly important to relapse has guided these studies, expanding on the knowledge that currently exists for cocaine relapse.  Incubation of drug-seeking (increased drug-seeking with extended periods of abstinence) is a behavioral model of relapse that has been well-characterized following cocaine self-administration.  Data presented in this dissertation demonstrates that incubation also occurs for heroin-seeking behavior and, furthermore, incubation is not limited to drug-seeking behavior, but also extends to goal-directed behavior.\nFollowing the behavioral studies, gene expression was assessed in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens using quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR).  This study included controls that received non-contingent infusions of heroin at the same time and same dose as the self-administering rats.  That is, the rats in this group had no control over the administration of the drug.  Additional controls received saline infusions at the same time as self-administering rats received infusions of heroin.  The genes that were examined were selected because they had previously been reported to have altered expression following administration of cocaine, morphine, or heroin (in a different behavioral model of heroin use).  Prior to sacrifice, rats were reintroduced to the self-administration chambers and allowed to seek drug (although no drug was infused) for 90-minutes.  Therefore, the observed gene expression levels were potentially impacted by both heroin abstinence and contextual re-exposure.  Five of the twelve genes that were examined were found to be significantly changed, and changes were altered in a time-specific and region-specific manner.  Furthermore, in some cases, gene expression was affected differently in rats that self-administered heroin compared to rats that received the same dose and schedule of heroin exposure, but did not self-administer the drug.\nExamination of gene expression in the medial prefrontal cortex following the 90-min drug-seeking session in the animal model of incubation of heroin-seeking behavior was continued in a microarray experiment.  Following a whole genome screen of nearly 41.000 genes, analysis focused on genes that are involved in behavior and neuroplasticity.  QRT-PCR was performed for 22 genes identified by the arrays to be significantly changed between the self-administering and yoked saline rats, and 7 of the changes were confirmed.  Additionally, 2 other genes that were identified as changed in the microarray experiment have been confirmed in the gene expression work presented elsewhere in this dissertation and in work published by another laboratory.\n \tThe research in this dissertation demonstrates the similarities between heroin and other drugs of abuse, but also highlights important differences.  This material adds to the current knowledge of relapse to drug use by demonstrating that some genes are universally affected following use of either cocaine or heroin.  Also, the importance of contingency (i.e., active or passive administration of drug) on gene expression has been demonstrated, a finding that evokes reconsideration of previously published studies.  The added understanding of changes in gene expression that occur in a behavioral model of relapse to heroin-seeking behavior helps to narrow the focus of possible \u201crelapse genes\u201d and should be applicable to studies of the broader problem of addiction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3459], "author_name_tesi": "Kuntz-Melcavage, Kara Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Kuntz-Melcavage", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Kara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kent Eugene Vrana", "Kent Eugene Vrana", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy", "Jong Kak Yun", "Willard M Freeman", "Patricia J Mc Laughlin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kent Eugene Vrana, Dissertation Advisor", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Chair", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy, Committee Member", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member", "Willard M Freeman, Committee Member", "Patricia J Mc Laughlin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["addiction", "drug relapse", "heroin", "opiate"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Study on the Electrolytic Decomposition of HAN-Based Propellants for Microthruster Applications\n", "id": "10840", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "890", "abstract_tesi": "The characteristics of electrolytic decomposition of HAN-based liquid propellants including 13M HAN and HAN269MEO15 were investigated in a single channel liquid flow reactor which consists of a straight electrolytic channel and a combustion chamber adjacent to it.

However, the acoustic measurements for such nozzles are scarce, due to the cost involved in making full-scale measurements and the lack of details about the exact geometry of these nozzles. Thus the present\neffort at The Pennsylvania State University and the NASA Glenn Research Center, in partnership\nwith GE Aviation, is aiming to study and characterize the acoustic field produced by supersonic jets issuing from converging-diverging military style nozzles. An equally important objective is to develop a scaling methodology for using data obtained from small- and moderate-scale\nexperiments which exhibits the independence of the jet sizes to the measured noise levels. The\nexperimental results presented in this thesis have shown reasonable agreement between small-scale and moderate-scale jet acoustic data, as well as between heated jets and heat-simulated ones.\nAs the scaling methodology is validated, it will be extended to using acoustic data measured with\nsmall-scale supersonic model jets to the prediction of the most important components of full-scale engine noise. When comparing the measured acoustic spectra with a microphone array set at different radial locations, the characteristics of the jet noise source distribution may induce subtle inaccuracies, depending on the conditions of jet operation. A close look is taken at the details of the noise generation region in order to better understand the mismatch between spectra measured at various acoustic field radial locations. A processing methodology was developed to correct the effect of the noise source distribution and efficiently compare near-field and far-field spectra with\nunprecedented accuracy. This technique then demonstrates that the measured noise levels in the\nphysically restricted space of an anechoic chamber can be appropriately extrapolated to represent the expected noise levels at different noise monitoring locations of practical interest.\nWith the emergence of more powerful fighter aircraft, supersonic jet noise reduction\ndevices are being intensely researched. Small-scale measurements are a crucial step in evaluating the potential of noise reduction concepts at an early stage in the design process. With this in mind, the present thesis provides an acoustic assessment methodology for small-scale military-style nozzles with chevrons. Comparisons are made between the present measurements and those made by NASA at moderate-scale. The effect of chevrons on supersonic jets was investigated,\nhighlighting the crucial role of the jet operating conditions on the effects of chevrons on the jet flow and the subsequent acoustic benefits. A small-scale heat simulated jet is investigated in the over-expanded condition and shows no substantial noise reduction from the chevrons. This is contrary to moderate-scale measurements. The discrepancy is attributed to a Reynolds number low enough to sustain an annular laminar boundary layer in the nozzle that separates in the over-expanded flow condition. These results are important in assessing the limitations of small-scale measurements in this particular jet noise reduction method.\nLastly, to successfully present the results from the acoustic measurements of small-scale jets with high quality, a newly developed PSU free-field response was empirically derived to\nmatch the specific orientation and grid cap geometry of the microphones. Application to\nmeasured data gives encouraging results validating the capability of the method to produce\nsuperior accuracy in measurements even at the highest response frequencies of the microphones.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1235], "author_name_tesi": "Kuo, Ching-Wen ", "last_name_ssi": "Kuo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ching-Wen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis K Mclaughlin", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin", "Philip John Morris", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Stephen Clarke Conlon", "Jun Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis K Mclaughlin, Dissertation Advisor", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Committee Chair", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Stephen Clarke Conlon, Committee Member", "Jun Huang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["acoustic measurements", "jet noise"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Development Of A New Nano-scale Vehicle For Delivery Of Curcumin In Biological Systems", "id": "22459", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9853", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Curcumin, a natural compound extracted from turmeric, has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and neuroprotective properties that make it an attractive therapeutic agent for treatment of disesaes such as cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD).

While bottom-up techniques can achieve higher aspect ratio at reduced dimension without having surface and sub-surface damage, uniform doping distributions with abrupt junction profiles are less challenging for top-down methods. In this dissertation, nanowires fabricated by both methods were systematically investigated to understand: (1) the in situ incorporation of boron (B) dopants in Si nanowires grown by the bottom-up vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) technique, and (2) the impact of plasma-induced etch damage on InGaAs p+-i-n+ nanowire junctions for tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) applications. \nIn Chapter 2 and 3, the in situ incorporation of B in Si nanowires grown using silane (SiH4) or silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) as the Si precursor and trimethylboron (TMB) as the p-type dopant source is investigated by I-V measurements of individual nanowires. The results from measurements using a global-back-gated test structure reveal non-uniform B doping profiles on nanowires grown from SiH4, which is due to simultaneous incorporation of B from nanowire surface and the catalyst during VLS growth. In contrast, a uniform B doping profile in both the axial and radial directions is achieved for TMB-doped Si nanowires grown using SiCl4 at high substrate temperatures. \nIn Chapter 4, the I-V characteristics of wet- and dry-etched InGaAs p+-i-n+ junctions with different mesa geometries, orientations, and perimeter-to-area ratios  are compared to evaluate the impact of the dry etch process on the junction leakage current properties. Different post-dry etch treatments, including wet etching and thermal annealing, are performed and the effectiveness of each is assessed by temperature-dependent I-V measurements. As compared to wet-etched control devices, dry-etched junctions have a significantly higher leakage current and a current kink in the reverse bias regime, which is likely due to additional trap states created by plasma-induced damage during the Cl2/Ar/H2 mesa isolation step. These states extend more than 60 nm from the mesa surface and can only be partially passivated after a thermal anneal at 350oC for 20 minutes. The evolution of the electrical properties with post-dry etch treatments indicates that the shallow and deep-level trap states resulting from ion-induced point defects, arsenic vacancies and hydrogen-dopant complexes are the primary cause of degradation in the electrical properties of the dry-etched junctions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8573], "author_name_tesi": "Kuo, Meng-wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Kuo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Meng-wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Suman Datta", "Nitin Samarth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Dissertation Advisor", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Chair", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Suman Datta, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanowire", "VLS", "InGaAs", "tunnel"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF CHOICE VARIETY AND SPECIFICATION TYPE ON CUSTOMIZATION PROCESS SATISFACTION", "id": "10550", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4972", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Factors that would affect customization process satisfaction were rarely examined to date.

In the 1970s two significant rhetorical obstacles needed to be overcome by civil rights advocates in order to counter the authority of physicians treating mental patients: people with mental illness needed to be constituted as a single and united group, despite the variety and severity of illnesses represented, and they needed to be given the tools to speak to the broader public about their needs. Later, as people with mental illness became a visible contingent of the long-term homeless, another complication to their agency arose: that of the role of the physical body. In the first chapter of this thesis, I discuss The Rights of Mental Patients, which was first published in 1973. This book addresses common legal concerns about civil commitment. In this chapter, I argue that The Rights of Mental Patients shifts the agentic orientation of people with mental illness from marginalized group to citizen activists, both in the ways it frames the readers, and by teaching them how to speak. The second chapter examines Kenneth Donaldson\u2019s book Insanity Inside Out, his memoir about experiences during civil commitment. I argue that the book both demonstrates Donaldson\u2019s loss of agency in the institution and restores his agency by entering his experiences into public deliberation about civil commitment. The third chapter examines the ongoing debate in the New York Times about the rights of homeless people with mental illness in the 1980s, specifically during the winter, when the mayor sought to have them removed to shelters. By studying editorials and letters to the editor on this issue, I show the arguments that were made about the agency of homeless people with mental illness.

In this thesis I will present the development of ToF-SIMS imaging methodology for biological analyses as well as applications that have yielded information about the role of lipids in membrane organization.\nIn the first chapter, I introduce the plasma membrane and describe its fundamental role in maintaining life through the dynamic remodeling of its structure.  I focus on two concepts that are believed to influence the localized chemical make up and structure of the membrane, intrinsic curvature and lipid domains.  ToF-SIMS imaging is briefly described and a discussion of cluster ion bombardment and sample preparation is included.  The chapter concludes with a survey of several important biological studies that have come out of the SIMS community.\nIn Chapter 2 I report a protocol for the use of SIMS imaging to comparatively quantify the relative difference in cholesterol level between the plasma membranes of two cells.  This development enables direct comparison of the chemical effects of different drug treatments and incubation conditions in the plasma membrane at the single-cell level.  Relative, quantitative ToF-SIMS imaging was used to compare macrophage cells treated to contain elevated levels of cholesterol with respect to control cells.  In-situ fluorescence microscopy with two different membrane dyes was used to discriminate morphologically similar but differentially treated cells prior to SIMS analysis.  SIMS images of fluorescently identified cells reveal that the two populations of cells have distinct outer leaflet membrane compositions with the membranes of the cholesterol-treated macrophages containing more than twice the amount of cholesterol of control macrophages.  Relative quantification with SIMS to compare the chemical composition of single-cells can provide valuable information about normal biological functions, causative agents of diseases, and possible therapies for diseases.  \nChapter 3 investigates prospects for three-dimensional SIMS analysis of biological materials using model multilayer structures and single cells.  The samples were analyzed in a ToF-SIMS spectrometer equipped with a 20 and a 40 keV buckminsterfullerene (C60+) ion source. Specifically, molecular depth profile studies involving dehydrated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) organic films indicate that cell membrane lipid materials do not experience significant chemical damage when bombarded with C60+ ion fluences greater than 1015 ions/cm2.  Moreover, depth profile analyses of DPPC\u2013sucrose frozen multilayer structures suggest that biomolecule information can be uncovered after the C60+ sputter removal of a 20 nm overlayer with no appreciable loss of underlying molecular signal.  The resulting depth information was used to characterize C60+ bombardment of biological materials.  This information was used to controllably remove the plasma membrane of a single macrophage cell using a molecular depth profile approach allowing the analysis of the chemistry of the cytoplasm.\nTwo methods that were developed to increase the reproducibility of biological SIMS analysis are covered in Chapter 4.  First I demonstrate the utility of the C60+ cluster ion projectile for sputter cleaning biological surfaces to reveal obscured spatio-chemical information.  Following the removal of nanometers of material from the surface using sputter cleaning; a frozen-patterned cholesterol film and a freeze-dried tissue sample were analyzed using ToF-SIMS imaging.  In both experiments the chemical information was maintained after the sputter dose, due to the minimal chemical damage caused by C60+ bombardment.  In fact, the damage to the surface produced by freeze-drying the tissue sample was found to have a greater effect on the loss of cholesterol signal than the sputter-induced damage.  In addition to maintaining the chemical information, sputtering did not alter the spatial distribution of the surface chemistry.  This approach removes artifacts that are common to many biological sample preparation schemes for ToF-SIMS imaging.  Removing these artifacts, which may obscure the surface chemistry of the sample, will increase the number of analyzable samples for SIMS imaging.  \nThe second method covered in Chapter 4 is freeze-etching, the practice of removing excess surface water from a sample through sublimation into the vacuum of the analysis environment.  This method was used to cryogenically preserve single cells for ToF-SIMS imaging analysis.  By removing the excess water, which condenses onto the sample in vacuo, a uniform surface is produced that is ideal for imaging by static SIMS.  I demonstrate that the conditions employed to remove deposited water do not adversely affect cell morphology and do not redistribute molecules in the top most surface layers.  In addition, I found water could be controllably re-deposited onto the sample at temperatures below -100 oC in vacuum.  The re-deposited water increases the ionization of characteristic fragments of biologically interesting molecules 2-fold without loss of spatial resolution.  The utilization of freeze-etch methodology will increase the reliability of cryogenic sample preparations for SIMS analysis by providing greater control of the surface environment.  Using these procedures we have obtained high quality images and spectra with both atomic bombardment as well as C60+ cluster ion bombardment.\nSample handling is also the topic of Chapter 5.  It this chapter, I describe a device which has been designed to prepare frozen, hydrated single cell cultures with a freeze fracture methodology for ToF-SIMS analysis in an ION-TOF (GmbH) TOF-SIMS IV mass spectrometer.  The device reproducibly produces frozen hydrated sample surfaces for SIMS analysis.  I show that SIMS analysis with the Bi32+ produces high-resolution molecular images of single PC12 cells in an ice matrix.  I also show that the combination of ionization enhancements that are provided by both the ice matrix and the cluster ion source facilitates the localization of lipid ions that have not been localized in these cells previously.  Namely, two fragments of phosphatidlyethanolamine (m/z 124 and m/z 142) and a large fragment of phosphatidylcholine (m/z 224).  The ability to localize and measure these ions will increase the number of question that SIMS imaging can be used to answer.\nIn Chapter 6 ToF-SIMS imaging was used to demonstrate that lipid domain formation in mating single-cell organisms is driven by changes in membrane structure.  Studies of lipid bilayers in both living and model systems have revealed that lipid composition is coupled to localized membrane structure.  However, it is still not clear if the lipids that compose the membrane actively modify membrane structure or if it is structural changes that cause lipid heterogeneity.  I report that time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry images of mating Tetrahymena thermophila acquired before, during and after mating demonstrate that lipid domain formation, identified as a decrease in the lamellar lipid phosphatidylcholine, does not precede structural changes in the membrane.  Rather, domains are formed in response to function during cell-to-cell conjugation.  ToF-SIMS imaging has been used to collect information with wide implications in all membrane processes.\nThe work presented here is the continuation of a project aimed at chemically characterizing biological samples with spatially resolved mass spectra, with a particular focus on single cell imaging.  Much of the work I have done has centered on understanding the capability of current technology and using this understanding to solve a particular problem.  This work is vital to keeping SIMS in the biological realm but the development of new technology is the ultimate future for these experiments by increasing the number of tools that the experimenter has to choose from.  In Chapter 7 discuss two ongoing projects that I think will lead to the next break through bringing us closer to realizing the goal of this project: a complete chemical map of a single cell.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4066], "author_name_tesi": "Kurczy, Michael Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Kurczy", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing", "Andrew Ewing", "Nicholas Winograd", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Michael L Heien", "Kyung An Han"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Ewing, Committee Chair", "Nicholas Winograd, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Michael L Heien, Committee Member", "Kyung An Han, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Analytical Chemistry", "SIMS Imaging"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "GENEALOGICAL CRITIQUE IN THE LATER WORK OF MICHEL FOUCAULT\n", "id": "12090", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2737", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\u201cGenealogical Critique in the Later Work of Michel Foucault\u201d attempts to explain the political stakes of Michel Foucault\u2019s strategy of genealogical critique by examining genealogy as both an attempt to affect and an effect of biopolitics.  In examining the critical, historical and political dimensions of genealogical critique, I show that Foucault situates his work between a set of critical requirements rooted in Enlightenment attempts to rationalize history and a network of institutional practices that discipline bodies and normalize populations.  Since the nineteenth century these projects of critique, discipline and normalization have grown into a decentered apparatus of power and knowledge that resists systematic analysis. Rather than pursuing systematic theoretical closure, genealogy reveals both discursive and non-discursive biopolitical investments in systematic accounts of political practices and identifies the ways in which liberal discourses contribute to effects of domination that marginalize individuals on the basis of class, gender, race, sexuality and culture. One effect of this revelation is to momentarily paralyze the regular effects of biopower in order to mobilize previously ignored opportunities for critical practice.\n\nCharacteristic of its questioning of systematic critique, the project proceeds through a series of episodic provocations. The first moment of provocation concerns attempts to render the theoretical underpinnings of genealogical critique. I show that Foucault highlights the historicity and contingency of genealogical criticism by first linking it to Enlightenment and anti-Enlightenment critical traditions, before raising the question of this tradition\u2019s practical political investments. The second moment of provocation examines Foucault\u2019s refusal to construct a theory of power capable of articulating the enduring practical conditions linking knowledge and power before concluding with a discussion of the strategic commitments of that refusal. Finally, the third moment of provocation evaluates the political significance of Foucault\u2019s strategic use of genealogical critique by examining the impact of genealogy on feminism, queer theory, critical philosophy of race and postcolonial theory. Within these discourses, genealogy effectively paralyzes existing standards of evaluation and thereby serves as a basis for experimenting with the possibility of inventing new critical practices.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2732], "author_name_tesi": "Kurdys, Joshua ", "last_name_ssi": "Kurdys", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Edward Scott", "Charles Edward Scott", "Dennis Schmidt", "Vincent M Colapietro", "Nancy A Tuana", "Jeffrey Nealon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Edward Scott, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles Edward Scott, Committee Member", "Dennis Schmidt, Committee Chair", "Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Member", "Nancy A Tuana, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Nealon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Enlightenment", "Genealogy", "Critique", "Criticism", "Political Philosophy", "Michel Foucault", "History of Philosophy"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Challenges and Opportunities Presented by Charter Schools: The Responses of Three Pennsylvania School Districts", "id": "6633", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2866", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This comparative case study examined how three Pennsylvania school districts responded to the challenges and opportunities presented by charter schools.

Data for each case study were gathered through site visits, interviews, online database searches, and a review of available publications and documents. Data were collected and analyzed during 2004 and the first half of 2005.  \nThe findings supported a number of previous studies but also challenged some earlier findings. The study\u2019s propositions concerning the effects of the passage of time and movement through stages on the relationships between districts and charter schools were not supported in any consistent fashion, but the overall propositions about higher levels of threat in terms of financial costs and enrollment losses predicting stronger district responses were supported. However, the character and quality of district responses to increasing perceptions of threats varied and were not always positive or effective. Another important finding challenging previous research came from evidence that leadership differences were more important in shaping relationships between districts and charter school than contextual differences between districts. It is often said that leadership matters, and that it can be crucial to the success of schools. To a degree that went beyond what would have been expected from previous research on relationships between districts and charter schools, leadership differences, although importantly conditioned and shaped by the community context, proved to be the single most important factor in this comparative study. While the small sample size of this study makes generalizations impossible, it seems clear that future studies of this topic should pay close attention to how leadership behavior may mediate, and possibly overcome, some of the contextual factors that often seem to dominate school district affairs.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2862], "author_name_tesi": "Kurelja, John Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Kurelja", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Emily Boyd", "William Hartman", "James F Nolan Jr.", "John Daniel Marshall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Emily Boyd, Committee Chair", "William Hartman, Committee Member", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Charter Schools", "Case Studies", "Competition"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Electrical Characterization of GaN and SiC Schottky Diodes and Non mechanical beam steering using Liquid Crystals", "id": "27079", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11569", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis we investigated the electrical characteristics of GaN schottky diodes fabricated on a commercial LED wafer using Inductively Coupled Plasma Reactive Ion etching (ICP-RIE) techniques.

Using I-V characteristics the ideality and the Barrier height of the Schottky diode was determined and the C-V characteristics were used to calculate the doping concentration of the device. These measurements were done at room temperature as well as different temperatures ranging from 100K to 300K for GaN diodes and 133K to 433K for SiC diodes to observe the dependence of Barrier height and the Ideality factor on the temperature. It was concluded that for GaN the ideality factor decreases with the increase in temperature while the barrier height increases with increase in temperature. The values of barrier height for GaN at 120K is 0.44eV and at 300K it is 0.81eV and the ideality factor at 120K is 0.96 and at 300K it is 0.6.

The ultrastability of the STM enables the measurement of single molecules with great precision.  These high-resolution microscopic and spectroscopic studies are essential in developing benchmarks for the design of novel catalytic systems, understanding the communicative behavior of adsorbates through\nsubstrate-mediated interactions (SMIs), and probing the buried interface structures of monolayers.\nToward understanding heterogeneous catalysis at the atomic scale, studies of the subsurface hydride (SSH) of Pd, the key material and reactant hypothesized to be critical both to hydrogenation reactions and metal embrittlement, are presented.  The SSH species has been created directly for use as a chemical reagent, in preparation for tunneling electron-induced reactions that can be monitored by recording the discrete spectroscopic signatures of intermediates and products isolated at 4 K.  Additionally, Pd surface-bound atomic hydrogen and deuterium (as well as vacancies at higher coverages) exhibit diffusion even at low temperature, offering insight into the behavior of these species prior to reaction.\nBecause molecular thiophene (and its heterocyclic analogues) poses a significant challenge to desulfurization due to its stabilizing \u0192\u00ce electrons, it is an ideal candidate for investigating the mechanism of hydrodesulfurization (HDS).  The chemical structure and adsorption of thiophene on Pd{111} and Pd{110} are presented.  Through topographic measurements and differential conductance (<I>d</I>I/<I>d</I>V) imaging, we show a dramatic difference between the adsorption of thiophene on Pd{111} and that on Pd{110}.  The observation of the electronic structure of thiophene on Pd reveals that the surface state may play a role in molecular adsorption via SMIs, however, the surface state dispersion for Pd suggests that mediation may come from bulk-state or image-state electrons.  Further, these techniques will be used both to manipulate single adsorbates into proximity of SSH and to induce reaction in situ.\nWe have studied the SSH of Pd{111} and the subsurface deuteride (SSD) of Pd{110} toward understanding chemical reactions with these novel reactants.  Deposition of deuterium into the bulk and interstitial subsurface sites of Pd{110} causes a (1 \u0081~ 2) surface reconstruction.  We have found that while SSH causes unidirectional lattice distortion for Pd{111}, SSD formation results in the growth of facets along the   substrate direction, reverting to the (1 \u0081~ 1) phase.  Single-molecule vibrational spectroscopy of thiophene adsorbates on both flat and faceted regions allude to distinctly different chemical identities, suggesting that we are observing the reaction intermediates of the HDS of thiophene.\nAdditionally, the controversy of STM image interpretation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been resolved using a technique that images both the chemically bound head-groups and exposed tail-groups in bi-component alkanethiolate (ALK) SAMs on Au{111} simultaneously, with molecular resolution.  The polar tilt and azimuthal angles of single molecules within monolayers have been measured and demonstrate that ordered domains with different superstructures also have varied buried sulfur head-group structures.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [505], "author_name_tesi": "Kurland, Adam Ross", "last_name_ssi": "Kurland", "middle_name_ssi": "Ross", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss", "Paul S Weiss", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Benjamin James Lear", "Seong H Kim", "Michael V Pishko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul S Weiss, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "Seong H Kim, Committee Member", "Michael V Pishko, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["substrate-mediated interactions", "low temperature", "STM", "catalysis", "spectroscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Source Characterization Via Autonomous Aircraft\n\n", "id": "8262", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6772", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tGiven numerous concentration observations it is straightforward to find the source of a toxic atmospheric release, to produce a prediction of contaminant impacted area, and to plan evacuation. Human and fiscal resources, however, limit the number of fixed sensors to levels that may be inadequate for these tasks. This study explores the possibility of supplementing a sparse fixed sensor network with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to increase accuracy and to save cost. \n\tFirst we use the Gaussian plume model to simulate how a toxic gas disperses in the atmosphere. Then we back calculate the source location, strength and the wind direction with a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Testing and tuning the GA was conducted to ascertain the best population size, mutation rate and number of generations for achieving a rapid and accurate back calculation. We have developed an ensemble method for improving accuracy by conducting multiple GA runs, each with its own UAV and solution population, and using a median-based consensus for the final answer. Testing conducted with simulated concentrations thresholded to resemble real sensor data and with random weather and source locations suggests the real world applicability and utility of our method.\n\tA new navigational intelligence of the expert system type was developed for the simulated UAVs, allowing them to collect the data required for GA-based source characterization given only one fixed sensor. Thus we require development of a new navigational strategy for the UAV to use the actual observations from the fixed sensor and the UAV itself to direct the aircraft in gathering concentration data. Different expert systems were required for plume and puff situations.\nThe results demonstrate that our expert system approach works for both plume and puff releases if given the observations from one fixed sensor and from the simulated UAV itself. These model runs demonstrate that the coupling of autonomous aircraft navigation with a GA has the potential for application to source characterization in real world problems.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6770], "author_name_tesi": "Kuroki, Yuki ", "last_name_ssi": "Kuroki", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuki", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George Spencer Young"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George Spencer Young, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Guassian Plume", "Gaussian Puff", "Expertsystem", "Autonomous Aircraft", "Genetic Algorithm"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A Rhetorical History of the Federal Reserve", "id": "14581jak580", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14581", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, I examine key moments when the Federal Reserve chair responded to important economic and political episodes, tracing its increasingly important role in these debates over the twentieth century.

The heat capacity measurements on arrays of these nanowires indicate that despite the one-dimensional transport effects observable at these diameters, the thermodynamic signature of superconducting order is surprisingly bulk-like. These results demonstrate, then, that the crossover regime from three-dimensional behavior to one-dimensional behavior in these superconducting nanowires is quite dependent upon the measurement in question.

The aim of this study is to estimate the value of this prospective energy exchange for Turkey. \n\nIn order to estimate a value, two different scenarios were compared. In the first scenario, it was assumed that a hypothetical retailer procures its entire electricity requirement from the spot market. In the second scenario, an optimal procurement strategy that benefits from both the spot and forward markets was calculated. Since currently no forward electricity markets exist in Turkey, there is no price data for the derivatives. In order to overcome this challenge, a forward price model is developed by constructing a spot price model first and then defining a relationship between spot and forward prices using the spot price data from January 2010 to December 2012. \n\nThe developed spot price model revealed that electricity prices are highly seasonal, while the forward price model revealed unlike most commodity markets, the market price of risk is negative and hence the futures contract quotes are higher than the expected spot prices. Those results are in agreement with the literature. \n\nFinally, my analysis points out that the prospective exchange is indeed valuable for a hypothetical company which is assumed to supply 5% of Turkey\u2019s electricity consumption, with an estimated the value of around TL27.3 million or $14.2 million for the first six months of 2013.

In this dissertation, we propose two classes of joint modeling procedures for studying the time-varying association between two intensively measured longitudinal responses: a continuous one and a binary one. Since it is well-established that varying-coefficient models increase the flexibility of parametric models and may reduce the modeling bias, our first procedure is based on time-varying coefficient models. However, it is known that semiparametric models represent an appealing compromise between parametric models and nonparametric models, retaining the explanatory power of parametric models while offering the flexibility of nonparametric models. Hence, in the second part of this dissertation, we propose a semiparametric approach, namely, partially linear models. A major challenge in jointly modeling binary and continuous responses is the lack of a multivariate distribution. We suggest introducing a normal latent variable underlying the binary response and factorizing the model into two components: a marginal model for the continuous response, and a conditional model for the binary response given the continuous response. For both techniques, we develop a two-stage estimation procedure and establish the asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators. We also derive the standard error formulas for the estimated coefficients. In each part we conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study to assess the finite sample performance of our procedures. The proposed nonparametric method is illustrated by an empirical analysis of smoking cessation data \\citep{Shiffman:1996fk}, in which we investigate the association between urge to smoke, the continuous response, and the status of alcohol use, the binary response, and how this association varies over time. We apply our proposed semiparametric methodology to data from the Women\u2019s Interagency HIV Study.

Agents are typically characterized by self-organizing behavior with heterogeneity in their individual goals, local information states or hypotheses. This thesis studies two domain specific problems in multi-agent systems: task decomposition and task aggregation. The former deals with suitably tasking the agents to achieve system level goals under the constraint that each agent has limited knowledge of the current state of the system. The latter studies the problem of combining the results of the agents\u2019 tasks by taking into account the heterogeneity in agent-level parameters and their hypotheses or perceptions. The first part of this thesis deals with an agent-level decomposition of a task for optimizing clusters in super-peer based peer-to-peer(P2P) systems for efficient knowledge discovery via reduction in the average query resolution time. In this scenario, peers acting as independent agents are suitably incentivized in order to achieve this system-level objective. In particular, each peer chooses a super-peer using a game-theoretic cost function based on its limited \u201cscope of view\u201d and the communal goal is the minimization of average query resolution time. The resulting self-organizing system of peers attempts to \u201clocally\u201d solve a graph partitioning problem, thereby, leading to a guaranteed equilibrium state under the assumption of static network parameters, or at least, guaranteeing reduction in transitions without such an assumption. In the second part of this thesis, we study novel methods of aggregating agent-level decisions for a communal\nlearning task in a crowdsourcing domain. Herein, agents are human annotators who expedite the annotation of large databases and make individual inferences on a subset of tasks assigned to them. In this case, the goal is to fuse or aggregate their responses in order to learn the ground truth values. We present two\napproaches to crowd aggregation in the case of multicategorical annotation tasks. Firstly, we present a stochastic generative model of a worker\u2019s response to the annotation tasks that uses a novel comparative paradigm of the worker\u2019s skill and the difficulty level of the task. Secondly, we propose a model-independent weighted plurality-based aggregation rule that uses novel weight energy constraints. Both these methods defeat the \u201ctyranny of the masses\u201d, i.e., they exploit the expertise of a minority subset of highly skilled workers in a crowd of mostly low-skilled workers. We also model both \u201cnaively\u201d malicious as well as \u201cstrategic\u201d adversarial agent behavior. The third and the final part of the thesis studies the detection of sybils in a peer-to-peer (P2P) system, which typically uses distributed reputation and referral mechanisms to enforce fair content distribution across peers. Each peer is limited in terms of the knowledge of the reputation scores of other peers and hence centralized graph-based search is not suitable. Under such constraints, we propose a distributed sparse-cut detection algorithm based on a novel hierarchical implementation of Karger\u2019s min-cut algorithm on a trust (or reputation) graph\nalong with a local \u201csparsity\u201d metric that measures the confidence of presence of a\nsybil cluster.

Comb-shaped polymer, random copolymer, and block copolymer proton exchange membranes (PEMs), such as Nafion, and anion exchange membranes (AEMs), such as poly(hexyl methacrylate\u2013block\u2013quaternized vinyl benzyl chloride) (PHMA-b-QAPVBC) and comb-shaped quaternized poly(phenylene oxide), were investigated in order to elucidate the effect of confinement on material properties and morphology in these systems. Ion-containing polymers rely on water to facilitate ion transport in electrochemical systems resulting in a large portion of this work studying the in situ effects of humidity on the polymer structure and the relationship to water uptake. The morphology of the polymer systems was primarily examined using grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) while spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) were employed to study the in situ water uptake. By studying a number of different ion-containing polymer systems using multiple techniques and a deep analysis of structure-property relationships, a more complete illustration of the confinement effect in these polymer systems was developed. \nNafion has remained the standard PEM material, driving decades of research; however, in the past 7-10 years, operational inefficiencies have been associated with confinement of Nafion in the catalyst layer of PEM fuel cells, surging investigations into confinement. The water uptake, molecular orientation, and structural relaxations were characterized in order to elucidate the substrate effect on the structure-property relationship. Substrates utilized include gold, platinum, carbon, and native- and sputtered SiO2. The strength of the interactions dictated the molecular orientation, where strong polymer/substrate interactions resulted in highly ordered molecular orientations that were oriented parallel to the substrate. Weakly interacting systems formed parallel orientations while moderate interactions resulted in Nafion self-assembling into an isotropic structure. The molecular orientation was found to have an impact on the swelling where perpendicular structures exhibited a greater swelling compared to parallel structures. To further analyze the polymer/substrate interactions, the physical aging of unannealed Nafion was measured on gold, carbon, and native-SiO2. The polymer/substrate interactions were found to dictate the structural relaxation resulting in two cases: (1) structural relaxations induced by increases in humidity as a result of strong interfacial interactions or (2) no observable structural relaxations as a result of weak interfacial interactions. In order to examine the effect of confinement, the aging rate was measured as a function of thickness for films fabricated on gold substrates. As the thickness decreased the rate of aging increased, an indication of the increased configurational entropy with decreasing thickness.\nTo further examine substrate confinement influences on the morphology and water uptake of ion-containing thin films, the diblock copolymer PHMA-b-QAPVBC was investigated. Water plasticization occurs during water uptake resulting in chain mobility which can have a profound impact on the stability of the morphology. PHMA-b-QAPVBC thin films demonstrated a morphological transition from random cylinders to parallel lamellae using atomic force microscopy and GISAXS techniques. In situ measurements were performed on the diblock copolymer by increasing the relative humidity (RH) in steps of 1% RH in order to monitor the dynamic morphological transition. By simultaneously measuring the thickness (SE) and mass (QCM), the density could be computed where observable inflections in density corresponded to this dynamic transition. By cycling the samples twice in a relative humidity environment, the glass transition temperature due to water plasticization was pinpointed, indicated by changes in data. The water content was input into the Kelley-Bueche glass transition temperature equation in order to estimate the temperature departure from a bulk membrane. It was found that the water content in thinner films was lower before the dynamic morphological transition occurred, indicating that thin film confinement reduced the glass transition temperature of QAPVBC block and ultimately destabilized the as-cast morphology.\nTo continue the investigation of confinement on the properties of polymer films, three comb-shaped polymer AEMs were examined with a control polymer that had no side chain. The comb-shaped polymers were synthesized with 6, 10, and 16 carbon alkyl side chains with the purpose of increasing mechanical strength through side chain crystallization, inducing phase separation, and limiting chemical degradation. Using cantilever curvature, the mechanical properties of thin films could be measured. The comb-shaped polymer synthesized with a 16 carbon side chain was the only sample to show increased mechanical properties while the other three polymers had relatively similar moduli. The phase separation and crystallinity were studied using grazing X-ray scattering techniques and showed that phases observed in membranes were also present in the thin film configuration however the scattering was not nearly as strong, indicative of weaker phase separation. As the side chain length increased, scattering features at the same q-value as hexagonally packed polyethylene appeared from the amorphous halo indicating that the side chains were crystallizing although there was no mechanical reinforcement in the 6 and 10 carbon samples. Confinement disrupted the crystallinity and domain formation compared to the bulk membranes resulting in increased water uptake in the thin films, most notably the 10 and 16 carbon samples. By disrupting the domain and crystallinity formation, the swelling was not as restricted compared to the membranes, resulting in the greater water uptake.\nIn order to provide accurate results, a full understanding of the characterizing techniques was necessary, especially working with thin films where 0.5 nm could represent a 3% increase in swelling. During these studies it was found that the sputter-coated SiO2 layer on the QCM crystals was porous which resulted in erroneous water uptake due to the hydrophilic nature of the silanol groups that line these pores. This has gone largely unnoticed in literature because the measured mass and thickness on these crystals coincided resulting in erroneous data being interpreted as a thin film phenomenon. As water penetrates the porous network, the refractive index of porous SiO2 layer was increasing as a result of water replacing void space. The optical model used to describe the polymer film accounted for the extra water associated with the SiO2 layer leading to incorrect thickness values. A simple model was developed to account for the water in the SiO2 layer by determining the porosity and thickness using a dry and humidified substrate. The humidity-dependent refractive index was applied to the in situ thickness measurement resulting in a corrected thickness measurement that was in agreement with the same polymer measured on a silicon wafer. Similarly, the QCM recognized that mass was being added to the system and was being accounted for in the water uptake of the polymer film.\nIn summary, by studying the morphology and water uptake characteristics of these confined polymer thin films under controlled humidity, structure-property relationships were developed. This will lead to a greater understanding of how confinement will influence the future generation of PEMS and AEMS. Expanding this knowledge will lead to the development of materials that increase the performance of fuel cell devices by providing a more intimate image of how these polymers will perform in the catalyst layer, and the ideas developed here can be extended to new types of materials used in various applications.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13654], "author_name_tesi": "Kushner, Douglas Ian", "last_name_ssi": "Kushner", "middle_name_ssi": "Ian", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Ralph H Colby", "Evangelos Manias", "Enrique Daniel Gomez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Chair", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Member", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thin Polymer Films", "Nafion", "Water Sorption", "Fuel Cells", "Spectroscopic Ellipsometry", "Quartz Crystal Microbalance"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Preference Signaling in Matching Markets", "id": "10943", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "138", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines a natural signaling mechanism in a two-sided matching market between firms and workers. We consider a basic game of incomplete information. Each agent knows her own preferences over matches, but uncertain about other agent preferences. Each worker can send a limited number of private costless signals to firms indicating her interest in positions there; workers send signals simultaneously. Then, each firm makes an offer to a fixed number of workers; firms make offers simultaneously. Finally, workers can choose a fixed number of offers from those available to them. We study the impact of the signaling mechanism for different environments that vary in market size, agent preference distribution, the number of signals, firm and worker positions, and periods of interaction.\n\nChapter 1 discusses the motivation for our analysis. It describes the necessity for a signaling mechanism in practice and instances of real markets that already use some form of signaling mechanisms.\n\nChapter 2 analyzes the basic model where each firm can hire at most one worker, each worker can be matched with at most one firm, and each worker can send at most one signal. We analyze the environment where agent preferences are quite dispersed. Specifically, workers have idiosyncratic (and uniformly distributed) preferences over firms. Firms have also idiosyncratic (and uniformly distributed) preferences over workers. We prove the existence of symmetric equilibrium in pure strategies as well as that multiple symmetric equilibria, with varying responsiveness to signals, may exist. These equilibria can be welfare ranked: workers prefer equilibria where firms respond more to signals, while firms prefer the equilibria where they respond less. Finally, we show that, on average, introducing a signaling mechanism increases both the expected number of matches as well as the expected welfare of workers for this environment. The welfare of firms, on the other hand, changes ambiguously. \n\nChapter 3 presents extensions to our main model. First, we show that the welfare results of the basic model carry over to a setting in which workers have correlated preferences. Second, the effects of a signaling mechanism persists if we consider another extension where each firm can hire several workers, each worker can be matched to several firms, and workers can send several signals. Finally, we analyze a simpler environment where agents only care about getting a match, but not the quality of the match, defining the value of a signaling mechanism as the expected increase in the number of matches from the introduction of a signaling mechanism. For such an environment, the value of a signaling mechanism is maximal for markets markets where the number of firms and workers are of roughly the same magnitude. Furthermore, additional periods of interaction between firms and workers decrease the impact of signaling. Finally, the optimal number of signals\u2014the number of signals that maximizes the expected increase in the number of matches\u2014increases when workers can be matched to more firms.\n\nChapter 4 analyzes a version of our basic model where agent preferences are tightly distributed. Workers have almost aligned preferences over firms: each worker has \u201ctypical\u201d commonly known preferences with probability close to one and \u201catypical\u201d idiosyncratic preferences with the complementary probability close to zero. Firms have some commonly known preferences over workers that may vary across firms. Though signals transmit previously unavailable information, they also facilitate information asymmetry in this environment. Prior to the signaling, all firms have identical beliefs about worker preferences. However, after the signals are received they may have diverse beliefs. This disparity in beliefs leads to coordination failure. As a result, the introduction of a signaling mechanism may decrease the total number of matches and the welfare of agents.\n\nFinally, Chapter 5 summarizes our findings of previous chapters and analyzes the roles of preference signaling in matching markets. Signals play two important roles in match formation: they transmit information and they facilitate information asymmetry. When there is only a small amount of information about agent preferences available, as in Chapter 2 and 3, information transmission plays a more important role in match formation. However, when there is almost complete information about agent preferences, as in Chapter 4, the introduction of signaling may lead to coordination failure. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [137], "author_name_tesi": "Kushnir, Alexey ", "last_name_ssi": "Kushnir", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alexey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijay Krishna", "Vijay Krishna", "Marek Pycia", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Tymofiy Mylovanov", "Gary Bolton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijay Krishna, Dissertation Advisor", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Chair", "Marek Pycia, Committee Member", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Member", "Tymofiy Mylovanov, Committee Member", "Gary Bolton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Matching", "signaling", "market design", "job market"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Design of a Compliant Mechanism Radiofrequency Ablation Probe to Treat Pancreatic Carcinoma", "id": "21860", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9899", "abstract_tesi": "Pancreatic cancer is a deadly and difficult to treat disease affecting hundreds of thousands of patients globally every year.

This research examined several such variables, based on the model of academic competence developed by DiPerna, Volpe, and Elliott in 2002. These include self-efficacy, motivation, study-skills, and academic engagement, together with student ability and reading comprehension, as predictors of academic performance.

H2S has significant vasoactive properties and plays a role in the modulation of vascular function. The purpose of this series of studies was to examine the vasodilatory role of H2S in the cutaneous circulation of healthy young adults and subsequently determine alterations in H2S-dependent vasodilation that occur with hypertension. In the first series of studies we hypothesized that (1) the H2S generating enzymes, cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MPST), would be expressed in the cutaneous circulation, and (2) that H2S-donors would elicit dose-dependent increases in cutaneous vasodilation through potassium ATP channels. We further hypothesized that both NO and by-products of cyclooxygenase (COX) metabolism would contribute, at least in part, to exogenous H2S-induced cutaneous vasodilation. The novel findings from the first series of studies were (1) CSE and 3-MPST were expressed in the human cutaneous microvasculature, (2) H2S donors elicited vasodilation in a dose-dependent manner in the cutaneous circulation of healthy young adults, (3) exogenous H2S-induced cutaneous vasodilation was mediated, in part, by calcium-dependent potassium channels, and (4) NO and COX inhibition attenuated exogenous H2S-induced cutaneous vasodilation. The results of these studies confirm the presence of H2S-generating enzymes in the cutaneous circulation as well as vasodilator responsiveness to a H2S donor. Additionally, H2S-mediated vasodilation occurred through downstream potassium channels and via interaction with the NO and COX vasodilatory pathways. \nH2S production and function are altered in the presence of hypertension in animal models. In the second series of studies, we hypothesized that endothelium-dependent (ACh, acetylcholine) vasodilation would be blunted in pre/stage 1 hypertensive adults compared to normotensive controls, due to blunted NO- and H2S-dependent vasodilation. Additionally, we hypothesized that the end-organ responsiveness to exogenous H2S would be preserved in pre/stage 1 hypertensive adults but that vasodilatory interaction with NOS and COX signaling pathways would be diminished compared to normotensive age matched controls. Our data demonstrated blunted vasodilation to a cholinergic stimulus in pre/stage 1 hypertensives, in part, due to a diminished H2S-dependent vasodilation. Additionally, our data demonstrated preserved end-organ responsiveness to exogenous H2S in pre/stage 1 hypertensive adults, despite a loss of vasodilatory interaction with NOS and COX vasodilatory pathways. \nFinally, we used reactive hyperemia to non-invasively assess microvascular function in pre/stage 1 hypertensive adults and normotensive age-matched controls. We sought to determine the role of H2S to the overall total hyperemic response (THR). Inhibition of endogenous H2S production blunted the THR in pre/stage 1 hypertensive adults, but not in normotensive adults; however this blunted response was not significantly different from the control site. Additionally, we found that NO does not mediate the reactive hyperemic response in normotensive or pre/stage 1 hypertensive adults. Also, the THR was related to both the H2S- and NO-dependent ACh-mediated vasodilation. These data support the use of cutaneous reactive hyperemia to assess generalized microvascular function; however, we were unable to detect statically significant differences in vascular function in a group of pre/stage 1 hypertensive adults. \nIn summary, these data suggest that H2S contributes to vasodilation in the cutaneous microcirculation in humans. H2S donors caused robust vasodilation through calcium-dependent potassium channels and interaction with NOS and COX vasodilatory pathways. Pre/stage 1 hypertensive adults had diminished H2S-dependent vasodilation in response to a cholinergic stimulus; however, end-organ sensitivity to exogenous H2S was preserved despite a lack of vasodilatory interaction with NOS and COX pathway. Finally, H2S may modulate a portion of the reactive hyperemic response in pre/stage 1 hypertensive adults due to a loss of redundant signaling mechanisms. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11123], "author_name_tesi": "Kutz, Jessica Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Kutz", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lacy Marie Alexander", "William Lawrence Kenney Jr.", "Timothy R Mc Connell", "Martin John Sliwinski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lacy Marie Alexander, Dissertation Advisor", "William Lawrence Kenney Jr., Committee Chair", "Timothy R Mc Connell, Committee Member", "Martin John Sliwinski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogen sulfide", "skin blood flow", "hypertension", "nitric oxide"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Flammability Limits of a Premixed Gas with Steam Addition", "id": "8305", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4932", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many industrial processes utilized for synthesis gas production are carried out at elevated temperatures, and therefore knowledge of flammability boundaries is quite important for safety considerations.

Ticket queues are widely used by service providers to manage customer flows. In this dissertation, we present three studies with the goals of generalizing system representations of  ticket queues, investigating the validity of\nthe assumptions used in the analytical models, and providing empirical support for the analytical model results.\n\nThe first essay proposes a Markov chain (MC) model for multi-server ticket queues with state-dependent balking and state-independent reneging customers. This study aims at analyzing the system\nperformance of a multi-serve ticket queue and benchmarking ticket and physical (stand-in-line) queue performances. We develop exact analytical results for key system performances with customer\nabandonment (including both customer balking and reneging behavior), and present efficient and accurate heuristics to analyze large systems. The heuristics prove to be robust and accurate approximations.\n\nA ticket queue differs from  a corresponding physical queue in terms of the amount of information available to customers. The lack of\ninformation for the number of existing customers in the ticket queue system  results in naive customer abandonment behavior and worsens system performances compared to those in the corresponding physical queue. In order to close the performance gap, we propose to provide different types of information to ticket queue customers. We find that for each type of information provided, the customer balking probability decreases while the customer reneging probability increases, and the overall service completion rate improves. Therefore, providing information does not necessarily guarantee an\nimprovement in each system performance measures. The queuing system managers should consider this trade-off when they are providing information to customers.\n\nThe second essay generalizes the model developed in the first essay by considering state-dependent reneging behavior of ticket queue customers. The reneging behavior of a customer depends on his/her\nticket position in the system. The literature on progress towards the goal and on the escalation of commitment suggests that the reneging rate will be an increasing function of one's ticket\nposition. On the other hand, the view that the time spent in line makes customers more impatient will suggest the reneging rate should be a decreasing function of the ticket position. Our analysis can incorporate  either an increasing or a decreasing function of the reneging rate in the model. In conclusion, the second essay provides the framework to analyze multi-server ticket queues with state-dependent abandonment and provides insight into developing more realistic ticket queue models.\n\nAlthough certain system performances deteriorate in ticket queues compared to those in physical queues, we observe that ticket queues are popular systems in both private and public sectors. This dilemma motivates us to obtain insights into the customer perceptions of and behavior in different queue arrangements, and to investigate whether the assumptions and results of our analytical models hold. The third essay investigates the perceptions of and behavior in ticket queues\nempirically using a series of surveys. Our results indicate that subjects generally prefer  a ticket queue arrangement over a physical queue arrangement, and the level of preference is amplified in high traffic intensity or high service value settings. In addition, we find that the subjects are willing to wait longer in\nthe ticket queue setting than they are in the  physical queue setting, which contradicted one of the assumptions we used in the first two essays. On the other hand, we validated the existence of\nthe sunk cost effect in waiting scenarios, which provides support for our  assumption in the analytical pieces that customers become more patient after they join and spend some time in line. Finally, we identify the factors effective in the subjects' decisions to prefer the ticket queue setting over the physical queue setting  and\nshow the impact of the context of the wait on the preference of and behavior in different waiting lines. Our results suggest that the analytical models used in the literature should incorporate the abandonment behavior of customers to reflect reality. We also identify and recommend the type of queues to be implemented under different service settings as a decision support to system managers.\n\nIn summary, we analyze, obtain insights into and compare the performances of  ticket and the physical queues from both the analytical and  empirical points of view in this dissertation. Our findings could assist system managers in designing better queuing arrangements, and matching an appropriate type of queue with the services provided.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3659], "author_name_tesi": "Kuzu, Kaan ", "last_name_ssi": "Kuzu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kaan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan H Xu", "Susan H Xu", "Christopher William Craighead", "Terry Paul Harrison", "Zan Huang", "Tao Yao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan H Xu, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan H Xu, Committee Chair", "Christopher William Craighead, Committee Member", "Terry Paul Harrison, Committee Member", "Zan Huang, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["analytical", "abandonment", "heuristic", "markov chain", "ticket", "queue", "empirical"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "COMBINING PROTEOMICS and SYSTEMS BIOLOGY to IDENTIFY THEAPEUTIC TARGETS & \nPATHWAYS OF CANCER DRUGS\n\n\n", "id": "12446", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4813", "abstract_tesi": "Melanoma is the malignancy of pigment producing melanocyte cells. It is the most lethal form of the skin cancer that takes the life of one person per hour in United States (U.S)[1]. It is estimated that more than 70 thousand new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2011 and at least one melanoma diagnosed patient in ten projected to die due to this deathful disease[2]. Moreover, about 40-60% of patients with advanced melanoma will have brain metastasis and after its detection in the brain, median survival time is only 3 months[3]. Unfortunately, melanoma is poorly responsive to chemotherapy. Although there are many drugs in clinical trials, ipilimumab is the second most promising drug which is recently approved by FDA, 35 years after the approval of the dacarbazine (DTIC)  [4, 5]. However, the response rate for both DTIC and ipilimumab is lower than ~18% [6, 7]. Thus there is an urgent need for development of therapeutic drugs against malignant melanoma.\n\nWe have previously identified leelamine (dehydroabietylamine), a diterpene molecule extracted from pine trees, as a potential melanoma tumor growth inhibitor from natural chemical library screening (unpublished data).  We have shown that leelamine inhibits melanoma tumor growth and induces apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism of action of leelamine was not revealed. In here, we aimed to illuminate the molecular pathways and targets of leelamine with the help of proteomics and systems biology.  \n\nTo achieve our objective, we first investigated the activities of the two known targets of leelamine (PDK1 and CB1/CB2 receptors) on melanoma cells. We found that any of these targets directly contribute to the anti-tumor activity of leelamine. Thus to identify the actual target(s), we did antibody array analyses to investigate the expression of more than 800 proteins. We analyzed the data with the Ingenuity pathway analyses tool, which revealed that the PI3K-Akt pathway is the major target of leelamine. After validation of the deregulations in the members of the Akt signaling by western blot analyses we focused on upstream targets that regulate the Akt signaling.  \n\nCombinational treatment of phosphotase inhibitor with leelamine eliminated the possibility of the regulation through activation of phosphatases. After that, we ran a second antibody array that was specifically designed to evaluate the activities of the 42 different receptor tyrosine kinases which are one of the major subfamily of proteins that regulate Akt signaling [8]. This array analyses revealed that activity of PDGFR is significantly decreased by leelamine treatment. We validated this inhibition by western blot analyses; however, several groups have reported that inhibition of PDGFR was not enough to decrease melanoma cell growth [9, 10]. Our siRNA mediated knockdown of the PDGFR also supported these reports by not decreasing the growth of UACC903 cells. Thus, PDGFR inhibition seemed to be an indirect effect of leelamine treatment. \n\nWe continued our search by using GeneGo\u2019s MetaDrug software, which is designed for evaluation of biological effects of small molecule compounds based on their structures. Basically, this tool compared the structure of leelamine with structures in its own database, which contains more than 600.000 compounds and interactions [11]. This analysis gave rise to two possible targets: NMDA receptors and ALOX5. Combinational treatment of leelamine with agonists or antagonists of these targets revealed that leelamine does not act through NMDA receptors. However, baicalein, an ALOX5/12/15 antagonist protected UACC903 cells from leelamine induced cell death in a concentration dependent manner.  Even though, this information draws up us very close to our objective, we finished our thesis by proposing several hypotheses, which we will investigate in future. \n\nIn the first chapter of this thesis, we review some of the current proteomic approaches and systems biology tools. In the second chapter we summarize the molecular background of the melanoma development. We briefly give information about the pathways and mutations that regulate melanoma development.

Until 2030, it is forecasted to be the primary cause of death with a 45 % increase in new cancer cases.  Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States with more than 3 million cases is diagnosed, annually.  Most skin cancers can be surgically removed when detected early. However, melanoma, the malignancy of pigment producing skin cells, is the most aggressive and dangerous of all skin cancers.  It accounts for approximately 80% of skin cancer associated deaths. Until 2013, dacarbazine (DTIC), an alkylating chemotherapeutic agent that was approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1975, was the most common drug used for the treatment of melanoma.  Recently, targeted agents such as those targeting the MAP kinase pathway have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of melanoma. However, in nearly all cases, development of drug resistance limits the efficacy of these agents to only few months. Therefore, there is need for development of new melanoma therapeutics that have long term efficacy.      \n\nRecently, we have identified Leelamine, a small natural compound as a potential chemotherapeutic agent against melanoma.  Leelamine was 3 to 5 fold more effective at inhibiting viability of malignant melanoma cell lines compared to other skin cells.  More importantly, leelamine showed efficacy in-vivo leading to ~60% decrease in the growth of xenografted melanoma tumors. However, very few reports were available regarding the mechanism of action of this agent. Therefore, the primary objective of my dissertation is to identify the molecular mechanisms leading to leelamine-mediated cancer cell death. Our studies suggested that as a weakly basic amine, leelamine displayed lysosomotropism that lead to its accumulation inside the acidic organelles and consequently disrupted cholesterol egress from lysosomes.  Inhibition of intracellular cholesterol transport by leelamine was the leading cause of cell death. These findings led to the development of our secondary objective, which was to explore the chemotherapeutic efficacy of other potential cholesterol transport inhibitors.  A class of weakly basic lysosomotropic compounds called Functional Inhibitors of Acid Sphingomyelinases (FIASMA) were identified as potential cholesterol transport inhibitors and shown to be effective against melanoma cells as well as xenografted melanoma tumors. \n\nIn this dissertation, we show that as a cholesterol transport inhibitor, leelamine and several FIASMA compounds disrupt autophagic flux and inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis resulting in the shutdown of key pathways to which melanoma cells are addicted.  Inhibition of lysosomotropic accumulation of compounds by Bafilomycin-A1 co-treatment or depletion of cellular cholesterol with \u03b2-cyclodextrin co-treatment was able to attenuate the cell death mediated by these agents.  This study is unique in terms of identification of FIASMA compounds as potential chemotherapeutic agents showing efficacy through inhibiting intracellular cholesterol transport.  In fact, two FIASMA compounds, Perphenazine and Fluphenazine, that are generic antipsychotic drugs, led to 50 to 60% inhibition of xenografted melanoma tumor development.  Since most of the FIASMA compounds were generic tricyclic antidepressants or antipsychotics with well-known toxicity profiles, the findings of this study could open new perspectives for repurposing these drugs for the treatment of advanced-stage cancers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10298], "author_name_tesi": "Kuzu, Omer Faruk", "last_name_ssi": "Kuzu", "middle_name_ssi": "Faruk", "first_name_ssi": "Omer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gavin Peter Robertson", "Robert G Levenson", "Jin Ming Yang", "Sinisa Dovat"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gavin Peter Robertson, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member", "Jin Ming Yang, Committee Member", "Sinisa Dovat, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Melanoma", "tricyclic antidepressant", "antipsychotic", "FIASMA", "lysosomotropic", "intracellular cholesterol transport inhibitor"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Essays in Economic Theory", "id": "6389", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1620", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-08-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many important phenomena (electoral competition, R&D races, lobbying) are instances of multiple simultaneous contests with unconditional commitment of limited resources. Specifically, the following game is analyzed in the first chapter. Two players compete in a number of simultaneous contests. The players have limited resources (budgets) and must decide how to allocate these to the different contests. In each contest the player who allocates more resources than his adversary wins a corresponding prize. Resources devoted to a contest are not recoverable (sunk costs). Mixed-strategy equilibria are characterized for cases of: identical values and budgets; different values but identical budgets; identical values but different budgets.\nThe second chapter shows how the time considerations, especially those concerning contract duration, affect incomplete contract theory. We consider a bilateral trade setting where contracting, investment, trade, and renegotiation take place in continuous time. Time is not only a dimension along which the relationship unfolds but also a continuous verifiable variable that can be included in contracts. It is shown that incentives for efficient investment can be provided either through a chain of constantly renegotiated fixed-term contracts; or through a renegotiation-proof `evergreen' contract---a contract of indefinite duration that includes an option of unilateral termination with advance notice.\nThe third chapter analyses the strategic formation of (undirected) buyer-seller networks using a fully non-cooperative framework, employing subgame perfect equilibrium not a stability notion as a solution concept. No costs of forming links between players are assumed, instead the notion of specificity as a source of negative externality in a network is introduced. Equilibrium and efficient networks are characterized for the three models, and the relationship between these sets is analyzed.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1602], "author_name_tesi": "Kvasov, Dmitriy ", "last_name_ssi": "Kvasov", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dmitriy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Vijay Krishna", "Tomas Sjostrom", "Victor Nistor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Chair", "Tomas Sjostrom, Committee Member", "Victor Nistor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["contests with limited resources", "contracting on time"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Mechanisms Of Insertion And Deletion Mutations:\nRate Variation, Context Specificity, And Impact On Primate Sex Chromosome Evolution\n", "id": "9956", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1820", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite substantial progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of origin for nucleotide substitutions, at present we have only a rudimentary understanding of these processes for insertions and deletions. Such knowledge is important because almost a third of all mutations in the Human Gene Mutation Database (http://www.hgmd.org/) are insertions and deletions (indels).\nHere we use the tools of bioinformatics, statistics and comparative genomics to study indel mutagenesis in detail. We have established a novel computational pipeline to accurately detect insertions and deletions in whole-genome human-chimpanzee alignments using the macaque sequence as an outgroup. This platform has allowed us to address several key questions pertaining to the formation of indels. In particular, this dissertation is organized around three specific questions:\n1.\tWhat determines the variation in small insertion and deletion rates across the human genome? Genomic factors delineated here distinguish insertion vs. deletion mutagenesis. \n2.\tWhat are the specific local contexts that contribute to rate differences in small insertions vs. deletions? Specific local sequences are hypothesized to facilitate indel mutations, and to differ between insertions and deletions.\n3.\tWhat is the mechanism(s) contributing to the observed distribution of transposable elements (TEs) on primate sex chromosomes? Comparisons of sex chromosomes vs. autosomes (combining both their sequence features and retrotransposition history) serve to narrow the alternative scenarios for the evolution of the observed distribution.\nResults from this research directly contribute to understanding the biological basis for insertion and deletion mutagenesis, with its implications for human genetic diseases. In addition, it aids in the development of improved gap modeling, which is crucial for improving alignment methodology and thus the accuracy of inferences regarding genome evolution. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1805], "author_name_tesi": "Kvikstad, Erika Marit", "last_name_ssi": "Kvikstad", "middle_name_ssi": "Marit", "first_name_ssi": "Erika", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Anton Nekrutenko", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Francesca Chiaromonte", "Webb Colby Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Dissertation Advisor", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Chair", "Anton Nekrutenko, Committee Member", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member", "Francesca Chiaromonte, Committee Member", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["indels", "mutagenesis", "comparative genomics", "molecular evolution", "biostatistics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SYNTHESIS AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF SOME NEW OXYFLUORIDES \n\n", "id": "12613", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3253", "abstract_tesi": "The solid-state reductive fluorination of Dion-Jacobson phase layered perovskites RbLaNb2O7 and KCa2Nb3O10 was studied by using poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE, monomer unit CF2) as a reductive fluorinating agent. This method was previously discussed in a preliminary report on the mixed-valence layered oxyfluorides RbLaNb2O6F, KCa2Nb3O9-xFx, and NaYTiO4-xFx (Kobayashi, Y.; Tian, M.; Eguchi, M.; Mallouk, T. E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 9849). X-ray diffraction patterns of the fluorination product of perovskite oxide RbLaNb2O7 suggested that we successfully made electrically conducting, ion-exchangeable and air-stable mixed-valence layered perovskite oxyfluorides by the PTFE route. However, the electronic conductivity of this product was several orders of magnitude lower than that previously reported, and the material was unstable when ion-exchanged with acid and exfoliated with the bulky base tetra(n-butylammonium) hydroxide. Thus, further study of reductive fluorination in the RbLaNb2O7 system and with other layered perovskites is needed. \nA new reductive fluorination method for binary oxides, especially semiconducting binary oxides, was developed by using perfluorodecalin (C10F18) as a gas-phase fluorinating agent. Semiconducting binary oxides were also reacted with PTFE under the same conditions as with layered perovskites but in most of cases they showed little or no reduction. As an alternative vapor-phase fluorinating agent, perfluorodecalin (C10F18) were used to obtain oxyfluorides. The results of this method appear interesting because the fluorinated SnO2 product had low resistivity and low carbon residue. Thus, we plan to extend the new fluorination method developed with SnO2 to other semiconducting binary oxides such as GeO2, PbO, TiO2, ZrO2, V2O5, Nb2O5, Fe2O3, CuO, ZnO and In2O3. This method could in principle be applicable to the vapor phase reductive fluorination of other binary oxides, layered perovskite oxides and non-perovskite layered oxdes.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3240], "author_name_tesi": "Kwak, Jung eun ", "last_name_ssi": "Kwak", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jung eun", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tom Mallouk", "Tom Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tom Mallouk, Thesis Advisor", "Tom Mallouk, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["reductive fluorination method", "oxyfluorides", "mixed-valence layered perovskites", "semiconducting binary oxides"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Genetic Basis for Persister Cell Formation", "id": "24942", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11054", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The prevalence of bacterial infections poses a significant threat to public health; however, the advent of antibiotics has largely subdued the lethality of infections treated clinically. Nevertheless, antibiotics are ineffective against both resistant and persistent bacteria, which contribute to chronic and recalcitrant infections. Persister cells comprise a small, multi-drug tolerant sub-population of all bacterial cultures, which is a non-hereditary phenotype that occurs due to a state of metabolic dormancy. The low frequency of persister cell formation makes it difficult to isolate and study persisters, leading to a dearth of information regarding the basis for persister cell formation. In this dissertation, a technique is developed to chemically induce persistence via bacteriostatic compounds that mimic toxins from toxin/antitoxin (TA) systems, which have been implicated in persister cell formation. Through these chemical pre-treatments, it is demonstrated that arrested protein synthesis is the key to persister cell formation and that environmental factors contribute to persistence. Investigation of toxin YafQ of the YafQ/DinJ TA system reveals a regulatory mechanism which increases persistence via reduced levels of the intercellular and interkingdom signal indole. Additionally, phosphodiesterase DosP is found to increase persistence through reduction of the global regulator cyclic adenosine monophosphate and consequentially down-regulation of indole levels, corroborating the effect of indole on persistence through a second regulatory pathway. Owing to the relationship between TA systems and persistence, the physiological significance of the MqsR/MqsA TA system was investigated, revealing an important role for this TA system in tolerance to bile stress through regulation of YgiS, a periplasmic protein. MqsR/MqsA is a well-characterized persister cell formation mechanism, so this result reveals bile as an environmental stress that likely influences persistence. Finally, the anti-cancer drug mitomycin C (MMC) was tested for activity against persister cells because MMC crosslinks DNA through a spontaneous, growth-independent mechanism which should be effective in metabolically dormant persisters. MMC was found to eradicate persister cells with efficacy against both planktonic cultures and highly robust biofilm cultures for a broad range of bacterial species, including commensal Escherichia coli K-12 as well as pathogenic species of E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additionally, MMC was effective in an animal model and in a wound model. Therefore, MMC is the first broad-spectrum compound capable of eliminating persister cells, which can be used clinically against recalcitrant infections. In summary, this dissertation reveals arrested protein synthesis as the basis for persistence, characterizes mechanisms of persister cell formation, and discovers a readily applicable clinical treatment to eradicate persisters via repurposing an FDA-approved anti-cancer drug.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10629], "author_name_tesi": "Kwan, Brian Wai", "last_name_ssi": "Kwan", "middle_name_ssi": "Wai", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Keith Wood", "Manish Kumar", "Howard M Salis", "Stephen John Knabel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Keith Wood, Dissertation Advisor", "Manish Kumar, Committee Member", "Howard M Salis, Committee Member", "Stephen John Knabel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["persister cells", "antibiotic tolerance", "toxin/antitoxin system"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Development of an Improved Silicon-based Photoconductive Switch for Microwave Signal Control\n", "id": "8749", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2319", "abstract_tesi": "A new silicon-based photoconductive switch concept for microwave signal control has been demonstrated.

MMPs have long been implicated in cancer progression and are found in greater concentrations and activation in malignant melanoma than normal or benign tissues. However, most current work focuses on MMPs\u2019 role in angiogenesis and MMPs secreted by the cancer cells themselves. In this study, we examined the expression of MMPs that result from the dynamic interaction between the endothelial and the melanoma cells. We found that upon co-culture, MMP2 showed an increase in expression. There was also an increase in the activated form of MMP2.\n\nWe also investigated the role cytokines play in the changes in MMP expression and how the interactions between the two cell types affect their expression. We report that IL8 (Interleukin 8) and MCP1 (Monocyte Chemotactic Protein) that were secreted from the Lu1205 melanoma caused the MMP2 upregulation and activation. At the same time, the levels of TIMP2 (Tissue Inhibitor of MMP) increased while the levels of MMP14 decreased. Furthermore, we discovered that contact co-culture of HUVEC (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell) and Lu1205 melanoma resulted in a significant increase in expression of MCP1 and IL8 chemokines. The increased levels of MCP1 is mediated by MCAM (Melanoma Cell Adhesion Molecule) expressed on the surface of the endothelial and melanoma cells, while the receptors for the increase of IL8 remains unknown.\n\nTo study the role that MMP2 plays in melanoma invasion, we developed a transendothelial migration assay. The Boyden chamber was modified to allow HUVEC to be grown in a monolayer atop a Matrigel coated micropore filter with minimal migration of HUVEC across the filter. When the melanoma cells are placed on the top well, it allows for dynamic interaction between the HUVEC and the melanoma cell, upregulating and activating MMP2 for invasion. We showed that blocking IL8 and MCP1 with antibodies successfully reduced the transendothelial migration of melanoma cells.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1162], "author_name_tesi": "Kwang, Chong haw ", "last_name_ssi": "Kwang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chong haw", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheng Dong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheng Dong, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["melanoma", "MMP"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Robust analysis of the basic economic order quantity model and deterministic serial two-echelon inventory model", "id": "19740", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9333", "abstract_tesi": "Since holding an inventory has its advantages and disadvantages, inventory is often referred to as \u201ca double-edged sword.\u201d Thus, managing inventory wisely is one of the critical success factors in business. A variety of research has investigated the systematic management of inventory. General research has assumed that all parameters are either known and deterministic or uncertain, but their values are all governed by probability distributions. Unfortunately, the parameters are ordinarily unknown, and furthermore, it is also hard to identify their probability information. This thesis assumes that all parameters are unknown and information about their probability distributions is also unknown. In this uncertain situation, a robust optimization point of view describes each unknown parameter as a continuous value that is restricted to some prespecified interval. To address uncertain data input, this thesis uses robust optimization to analyze the basic Economic Order Quality (EQQ) model and the deterministic serial two-echelon inventory model. \n First of all, this thesis derives the functions that show the upper and lower bounds of EOQs under input data uncertainty. By considering the functions together, this thesis develops the closed form expressions that characterize the set of all possible EOQs and corresponding minimum average costs. Because this set predicts all possible inventory situations given unknown parameters, it demonstrates variability of the basic EOQ model\u2019s minimum average cost.\n Also, this thesis analyzes the effect of randomness in the worst case scenario, and suggests the optimal order policy of the basic EOQ model to minimize the worst error. This thesis considers two minimax analyses \u2013 the ratio approach and the difference approach. These analyses prove that the geometric mean or the arithmetic mean of the maximum and the minimum EOQ\u2019s provides the optimal order policy that produces the smallest possible error in the worst case. \n Finally, this thesis extends the closed form expressions of the basic EOQ model to the deterministic serial two-echelon inventory model for robust analysis. The deterministic serial two-echelon inventory model has a multiplicity factor for the order quantity. Thus, this thesis first develops the closed form expressions that describe the set of all possible optimal order quantities and corresponding minimum total costs for general multiplicity factor. This set is called variability of the minimum total cost because this set predicts all possible inventory situation of the deterministic serial two-echelon inventory model. But, the multiplicity factor can actually take different positive integer values under input data uncertainty. Thus, after calculating all possible candidates of the optimal multiplicity factor, we apply our closed form expressions to draw variability for each candidate then we compare their variability. One interesting observation is that the area of variability decreases logarithmically as the multiplicity factor increases. It indicates that an inventory manager can reduce variability by increasing the multiplicity factor when making or renewing contract. But one problem is that sometimes upper bound of the minimum total cost also increases as the multiplicity factor increases. To avoid this problem, we suggest a method to find the best multiplicity factor at which upper bound of the minimum total cost is minimized with small variability.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9137], "author_name_tesi": "Kweon, Sang Jin", "last_name_ssi": "Kweon", "middle_name_ssi": "Jin", "first_name_ssi": "Sang", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Antonio Ventura"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Antonio Ventura, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["inventory", "two-echelon system", "uncertainty", "robust analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "LOCATION OF ALTERNATIVE-FUEL REFUELING STATIONS ON TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS CONSIDERING VEHICLE DEVIATIONS AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS", "id": "14231svk5333", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14231", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Burning conventional fossil fuels including gasoline and diesel mainly results in over 90% of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. To reduce these emissions from the ground transportation sector, the use of alternative-fuel vehicles is being spotlighted. As a result, refueling station location problems for alternative-fuel vehicles have received attention as well. These refueling station location problems can be classified into two types depending on the set of candidate sites: when a preliminary (finite) set of candidate sites is given, this problem is called discrete; when the stations can be located anywhere along the network, the problem is called continuous. This dissertation considers one discrete and two continuous location problems for alternative-fuel refueling stations on transportation networks.\n     First, the discrete location problem is addressed with two conflicting objectives of maximizing the total vehicle-miles traveled per time unit covered by the stations and minimizing the capital cost for constructing the refueling infrastructure. Two versions of bi-criteria binary linear programming models are proposed and validated with an application to the Pennsylvania Turnpike System regarding the location of liquefied natural gas refueling stations on existing service plazas.\n     Next, assuming that a vehicle cannot deviate from the preplanned path, the continuous location problem for a single refueling station is addressed on a tree network with the objective of maximizing the traffic flow (in round trips per time unit) covered by the station. Two reduction properties regarding the problem size and some optimality conditions are derived. Then, an exact polynomial algorithm is developed to determine the set of optimal locations for the refueling station.\n     Lastly, the continuous location problem introduced above is extended to a version where a given portion of drivers are willing to deviate to be able to refuel if the station is not located along their preplanned routes.

RNA structure plays critical roles in regulation of gene expression and cellular processes. Knowledge of RNA structure therefore provides important molecular insights regarding its function in biological systems. While much is known about how RNA folds in the test tube under non-biological conditions, our current understanding on in vivo RNA structure is very limited. This can be mainly attributed to three obstacles: (1) Inability to detect minute amount of transcripts and their structures in cells; (2) Inability to determine in vivo structure of thousands of different transcripts at once; (3) Insufficient data to support the hypothesis that RNA structure regulates cellular processes in eukaryotes, particularly in plants. The broad objective of my thesis research is to enable and carry out studies on RNA structure determination in vivo by establishing novel, sensitive, and high-throughput methods at the interface of chemistry and biology to allow probing of in vivo RNA structures in myriad low-abundance transcripts, and to investigate their regulatory roles in cellular processes. In addition, the chemical properties and biological significance of G-quadruplex structures (GQSs) are investigated. I am conducting my experiments in the model plant species Arabdopsis thaliana, which was chosen because (i) plants are sessile and are likely to have evolved (RNA-based) regulatory mechanisms to cope with stresses; (ii) its life cycle is short (4-6 weeks) and intact plants can be used for in vivo experiments; (iii) it is the first plant genome being fully sequenced and has a small genome (~125 Mb in A.thaliana versus ~3,000 Mb in human), yet it provides similar complexity as human (~30,000 genes).\nRegarding obstacle 1, I have developed a sensitive method to query the in vivo RNA structure of low-abundance transcripts by integrating chemicals that covalently modify RNA in vivo (dimethyl sulfate (DMS) or an acylation SHAPE reagent) with a general amplification technique (ligation-mediated PCR), i.e. \u201cDMS/SHAPE-LMPCR\u201d. This novel method probes RNA structure with attomole sensitivity, an improvement of five orders of magnitude over conventional methods. I benchmarked and demonstrated the utility of this method by chemically probing and analyzing the structures of high- and low-abundance coding and non-coding RNAs in living A. thaliana seedlings. Importantly, I revealed that in vitro and in vivo DMS/SHAPE chemical modifications patterns can be radically different from each other, emphasizing the critical importance of probing RNA structure in vivo. I also constructed the secondary structure of the low-abundance U12 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) in A. thaliana from comparative sequence analysis among 11 plant species, verified the phylogenetic structural model with DMS/SHAPE-LMPCR, and provided strong evidence that the single-stranded Sm-protein binding site in U12 snRNA is indeed bound by Sm-proteins in vivo. This universally applicable method opens the door to identify and explore the specific structure-function relationships of the multitude of low-abundance RNAs that prevail in living cells.\nRegarding obstacle 2, I have helped to establish a high-throughput, genome-wide in vivo RNA structure probing method, \u201cStructure-Seq\u201d, in which in vivo DMS methylation of unprotected As and Cs is identified by next generation DNA sequencing. Our innovative method promises to vastly expand our understanding of how RNA structure regulates cellular processes in living cells. This method was applied to A. thaliana seedlings and yielded the first in vivo genome-wide RNA structurome at nucleotide resolution for any organism, with structural information across more than 10,000 transcripts in a single experiment. I performed extensive experiments to demonstrate that DMS chemical probing was in vivo, confirmed that results from Structure-Seq and conventional gel-based DMS probing were strongly correlated, and verified that the in vivo Structure-Seq structure predictions for rRNAs were in good agreement with evolutionarily-derived phylogenetic rRNA structures. Using Structure-Seq, characteristic global RNA structural patterns were revealed and novel regulatory features were uncovered in RNA processing steps of translation, alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing. Moreover, the structural properties of stress-related mRNAs in vivo were identified. Overall, our study suggests that differential folding of RNA structures can regulate a number of cellular processes in cells. The development of Structure-Seq allows the RNA structurome and its biological roles to be interrogated on a genome-wide scale and should be applicable to any organism.\nI also developed a new technology for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ligation for improved yield of ligation products with low nucleotide bias. This technique may be applicable to the DMS/SHAPE-LMPCR and Structure-Seq studies described above. A provisional patent is pending on this work. Existing ssDNA ligation methods were shown to suffer from slow kinetics, poor yield, and severe nucleotide preference. To resolve these issues, I introduced a hybridization-based strategy to allow efficient and low-bias ligation of ssDNAs. With this strategy, DNAs with different ends were found to complete the ligation in less than 2 h, with low nucleotide bias and ~95% yield. Furthermore, it was successfully applied to LMPCR. This technique potentially can be applied in protocols that require ligation of ssDNAs, including cDNA library construction.  \nRegarding obstacle 3, I have performed three detailed studies to better understand the structure and function of GQSs. A GQS is composed of a guanine-rich sequence that contains the pattern GxLaGxLbGxLcGx, where x \u2265 2, and loops (L) a, b, and c are \u2265 1. (A) A systematic circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence study was performed on RNA GQSs with varying G-stretch lengths and loop sequences. CD titration results suggested that when the length of the G-stretch increases (i.e. G2 GQS to G6 GQS), a general decrease in Hill coefficient/folding cooperativity (n) occurs. I demonstrated that the decrease in folding cooperativity was due to the population of intermediates in the GQS folding by showing a clear three-state transition in G3 and G4 GQS. Fluorescence titration results revealed for the first time that RNA GQSs exhibit intrinsic fluorescence. (B) The intrinsic fluorescence of GQSs was further explored using DNA GQSs, with varying loop sequences, loop lengths, and G-stretch lengths. Label-free fluorescence enhancements of up to 16-fold and a shift in fluorescence emission maximum to the visible light portion of the spectrum were reported upon GQSs formation. The studies of A and B serve to provide a deeper understanding of folding and intrinsic fluorescence of GQSs. The molecular switch (high n) or rheostat (low n) mode and intrinsic fluorescence of GQS potentially can be engineered to develop label-free detection methods and biosensors. (C) I have investigated the regulatory role of a GQS in planta. A thermostable GQS was identified within the 5\u2019UTR of Ataxia Telangiestasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) mRNA in A. thaliana. I found that ATR GQS was more thermostable than its competitive structure at physiological K+ and Mg2+ concentrations. In-line probing further confirmed the formation of ATR GQS in vitro in the context of the complete 5\u2019UTR. Reporter gene assay results suggested that ATR GQS acts as a translational repressor in living cells. This is the first GQS being reported to regulate translation in any plant organisms, and the results provide the possibility to manipulate gene expression by modulating GQS formation.\nTo summarize, my thesis work consists of cross-disciplinary research between chemistry and biology into the investigation of in vivo RNA structures. My work serves to improve current RNA structural probing methods and advance our understanding of the role of RNA structures in the regulation of cellular processes. In addition, some of these results may be engineered and applied for bio-applications, such as nucleic acid ligation and amplification, biosensing, and gene expression manipulation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9367], "author_name_tesi": "Kwok, Chun Kit", "last_name_ssi": "Kwok", "middle_name_ssi": "Kit", "first_name_ssi": "Chun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

We provide a formal method for handling uncertainty in the objective function, which may be nonlinear in states, controls, and uncertain parameters. \nTo develop an algorithm for DVIs, we consider a gap function for DVIs and study an equivalent optimal control problem.

This dissertation stems from a Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) sponsored understanding to research network response under Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) attack scenarios. Specific attention is focused on developing a systematic method for evaluating and identifying network vulnerabilities and conducting lifecycle risk assessments. Downtown Seattle in Washington State, due to its border proximity and multimodal accessibility, is the case study providing the empirical basis for this dissertation. The dynamic nature of nonmotorized travel is analyzed though continuous 15-minute time increments of the typical weekday for the period of 6AM to 6PM. The analytical approach establishes a layered modeling framework that structures individual traveler activity information with lifecycle data at the disaggregate level, and leads to a micro-level simulation basis for visualizing nonmotorized flows in downtown corridors. It is hypothesized that lifecycle status plays a crucial role in the development of traveler risk via exposure in space and time of activity choice, influenced by personal relationship dynamics, work status, educational and socio-economic background, and residential choice. To unearth the impact of activity choice, activity time engagement is first analyzed at the individual level. A systems-of-equations framework is established to examine the endogenous relationship between travel time and activity time duration for each lifecycle group. The next layer in the progression of the modeling framework applies a multinomial logit model to gauge various activity type engagements in a given 15-minute interval. The MNL model is therefore built on 96 consecutive time slices of the day for each individual. The insights gained from this step disclose what activity state each individual lifecycle type will be engaged in and at what specific time of day. Based on this information, the Relative Risk Ratio (RRR) is determined and profiled for each lifecycle group. Through origin-destination matrix evaluation of the relative flows to various critical corridors and subnetworks in downtown Seattle, the RRRs are translated into focused time windows for a social force model of nonmotorized flows. By doing so, the peak of the RRR curve is simulated as opposed to the entire time duration of 96 time steps, thereby resulting in a method to analyze peak exposure. The pedestrian flow information is simulated in a visualized context and calibrated to provide pedestrian measures of effectiveness. The micro simulations offer an added dimension of vulnerability analysis by focusing on specific time intervals, which can provide further information on risk exposure for each lifecycle group in a network level context. Outputs of the pedestrian simulations are incorporated into a joint model of relative risk of exposure and pedestrian flow measures. The joint model integrates land use elements through activity associations with lifecycle groups.\nThe original contributions of this dissertation are demonstrated through linking macro and micro scales of analysis through a hybrid statistical-simulation technique, and addressing the need to account for behavioral heterogeneity in population exposure estimates. The combinations of methods involve a multidimensional analysis that traces activity engagement to pedestrian behavior in space and time. The approach established in this work also lays the foundation for a system that quantitatively measures the risk of exposure to traveling civilians, which is a capability that is not currently afforded to the Department of Defense. The findings of this research have significant policy implications that can dramatically alter the landscape in which federal government agencies conduct network vulnerability and threat assessments.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9234], "author_name_tesi": "Kwon, Daniel Wontak", "last_name_ssi": "Kwon", "middle_name_ssi": "Wontak", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar", "Swagata Banerjee Basu", "Jeremy Joseph Blum", "M Jeya Chandra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar, Dissertation Advisor", "Swagata Banerjee Basu, Committee Member", "Jeremy Joseph Blum, Committee Member", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transportation security", "micro simulation", "travel behavior", "risk ratio", "simultaneous equations"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Ultra-Low Temperature Processing of Barium Tellurate Dielectrics\n", "id": "6868", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1646", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ceramics, metals and polymers have unique electrical properties that are combined for electronic devices and systems.  It necessitates lower processing temperatures for ceramics to be compatible with metal and polymer systems.  In this thesis, the synthesis, crystal structure, and dielectric properties of barium tellurate are studied for temperatures between 500 and 900 C. Barium tellurate dielectric ceramics (BaTe4O9, BaTe2O5, BaTe2O6, BaTeO3, BaTeO4, and Ba2TeO5) are extensively investigated as new LTCC (Low-Temperature Cofired Ceramics) dielectric systems integrated with low resistivity metal electrodes such as silver and aluminum for microwave application. \nStudies on the phase formation and crystal structure through thermal analyses (Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetric Analysis, DSC-TGA) and X-ray diffraction phase analysis attest that barium tellurates are formed in the temperature range of 500 ~ 900 C, through the sequential phase formations from Te-rich to Ba-rich phases. The oxygen coordination of the tellurium ion progresses from TeO4 to TeO6 via TeO3+1 and TeO3 with increasing barium content as confirmed by structural analysis using infrared spectroscopy. High density barium tellurate ceramics are achieved at temperatures as low as 550 C, which provides the potential to be co-fired with low-melting aluminum metal electrodes in LTCC processing. \nDielectric permittivity, loss, and temperature stability of barium tellurate dielectric ceramics were measured from 100 Hz to 13 GHz. Barium tellurate ceramics exhibit excellent microwave dielectric properties with intermediate dielectric permittivities and high quality factors (Q). The dielectric properties at microwave frequencies are k = 17.5, Qxf = 54700 GHz, TCf  = -90 ppm/C for BaTe4O9, k = 21, Qxf = 50300 GHz, TCf  = -51 ppm/C for BaTe2O6, k = 10, Qxf = 34000 GHz, TCf  = -54 ppm/C for BaTeO3, and k = 17, Qxf = 49600 GHz, TCf  = -124 ppm/C for Ba2TeO5.\nCo-firing studies of barium tellurate ceramics with metal electrodes establish new LTCC systems for microwave devices. Chemical compatibility of barium tellurates with silver electrodes was achieved in the barium rich compositions. Ba2TeO5 was found to be co-fireable with silver electrodes at 850oC by adding CuO and B2O3 as fluxing agents. During the co-firing, a thin interfacial layer of AgTe is metastable according to the thermodynamic equilibrium between the Ba2TeO5-Ag/Ag2O pseudo-binary system. \nA breakthrough LTCC technology with aluminum is based upon the ultra-low processing temperature and chemical compatibility of BaTe4O9, which enables co-firing and fabrication of multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) with aluminum inner electrodes. The aluminum base metal electrode (BME) BaTe4O9 MLCCs provide good dielectric properties of k = 17.5, TCC = 100 ppm/C, and Q = 500 at 1 MHz, which are suitable for the class-1 MLCCs. Aluminum microstrip ring resonators on the BaTe4O9 substrates realized good electromagnetic performance of the new materials at microwave frequency exhibiting resonant frequency of 2.97 GHz and Q factor of 278.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1633], "author_name_tesi": "Kwon, Do-Kyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Kwon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Do-Kyun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan", "Thomas R Shrout", "Clive A Randall", "Gary Lynn Messing", "Amar S Bhalla"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan, Committee Chair", "Thomas R Shrout, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Member", "Amar S Bhalla, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ULTCC", "Dielectric", "Barium Tellurate", "Microwave"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Choosing Where To Eat Versus What To Eat:\nthe Effects Of Choice Order And Construal Level\n", "id": "28964", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12608", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research examines the underlying psychological mechanisms on the effects of choice order (in the sequence of assortment-option vs. option-assortment) in a restaurant setting.

However, less is studied about the factors that influence construal level and temporal focus. \nOne Pilot Study and three experiments identified that choice order is a contextual factor influencing construal level. Our results show that consumers adopt an abstract vs. concrete mindset, depending on the sequence of choices (assortment-option sequence vs. option-assortment sequence). In addition, this research shows that an assortment-option sequence is associated with a more distal temporal perspective, whereas an option-assortment sequence is associated with a more proximal temporal perspective. Our findings demonstrate that the match (vs. mismatch) between choice order and construal level enhances consumer attitudes and anticipated satisfaction. Furthermore, we identified choice order as a key moderator to the desire for a large choice set. The findings show that individuals who choose assortment first have increased preferences for a large choice set. When choosing an option first, the preference for large assortments diminishes.

(3) How has direct exposure to computer operations and usage affected inexperienced users\u2019 attitudes toward the computer? and (4) How have socio-demographic factors shaped participants\u2019 attitudes toward the computer? \n\tThis study utilized grounded theory to analyze the responses of sixteen older Korean-American adults in Baltimore, Maryland. One-on-one personal interviews were conducted with 16 participants of the Baltimore Christian Center for Korean Older Adults and Calvary Presbyterian Church. \n\tThe findings showed that older Korean-American adults\u2019 consequences of using the computer made them recognize both benefits and harms associated with computer use. This process included their direct and vicarious computer experiences. It affected their formation of \u201cperceived consequences of computer use\u201d into four modes: a) abundant b) adequate c) insignificant and d) counterproductive. Also, they tended to have four modes of attitudes: a) enthusiastic b) receptive c) ambivalent and d) unreceptive toward the computer. \nComputer-inexperienced participants showed attitude changes after having computer presentation sessions. The changes revealed three forms of attitude change: upward change from unreceptive to enthusiastic toward the computer, status quo, and downward change from ambivalent to unreceptive attitude. In this process, each participant experienced application of consequences, benefits, and harms into his or her own practical situation, and their decisive factors affected their formation of attitudes. Those decisive factors were their standards and values of late-life management such as health status, management of daily living activity, and practice of religious faith. \nInterestingly, participants\u2019 socio-demographic factors affected their formation of attitude toward the computer utilizing two modes, utilizing perceived factors and latent factors.

The experience of sexual trauma harms a sense of subjectivity; and, thus, the restoration of subjectivity is critical for bearing witness to trauma. Subjectivity is an individual\u2019s sense of existence whereby the individual can consciously make and act upon decisions. By examining bearing witness through art within the context of feminist art pedagogy, my study reveals how feminist art pedagogy has enabled trauma subjects to actively discover, interpret, and, thereby, comprehend their trauma through art making experiences.\nSpecifically, I examine how feminist art pedagogy enabled art creation as bearing witness by four sexual trauma subjects and three trauma artworks created in feminist art courses. These include former Korean comfort woman Duk-kyung Kang and her painting Stolen Innocence (1995), created in Gyung-shin Lee and Sook-jin Kim\u2019s informal art course for surviving comfort women; co-artists Katie Grone and Joshua Edwards et al.\u2019s group installation art Rape Garage (2001), created in Judy Chicago and Donald Woodman\u2019s undergraduate course the At Home: A Kentucky Project at Western Kentucky University; and my own performance and installation art Honoring Comfort Women, created in Karen Keifer-Boyd\u2019s graduate art course Judy Chicago@PSU: Art, Pedagogy, Exhibition, & Research at the Pennsylvania State University. I intertwine Kang, Grone, Edwards, and myself in a visual mapping and performative autoethnography.\nCreating visual mapping and performative autoethnography is a way to become a witness to one\u2019s own trauma. The goal of the visual mapping and performative autoethnography, presented in this dissertation, is to dismantle hegemonic, oppressive, and medicalized perceptions of trauma. My autoethnographical and performative research not only analyzes the feminist art pedagogy that prompted trauma art but, also, performs witnessing. Additionally, this research suggests how art educators can utilize feminist art pedagogy to engage trauma subjects to bear witness through art creation by strengthening students\u2019 subjectivity. Performing visual mapping and performative autoethnography is necessary to analyze shared witnessing, to process trauma without being re-traumatized, and to re-affirm the desire to bear witness in building subjectivity through collective and performative acts. This process is evident in how Kang, Grone, Edwards, and my own experiences in distinct feminist art courses considered trauma as a political concern, formed transferential relations between trauma and non-trauma subjects, and helped us affectively engage with trauma through art.\nDue to the lack of understanding of sexual trauma, a hegemonic visual culture that supports sexual violence, and the minimal recognition given to sexual trauma in an educational context, subjects of sexual trauma typically hide their trauma even from themselves because they feel ashamed. By establishing a counter-hegemonic discourse on sexual trauma through the utilization of art creation as bearing witness, both trauma and non-trauma subjects can become witnesses to the process of witnessing.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14104], "author_name_tesi": "Kwon, Hyunji ", "last_name_ssi": "Kwon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyunji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Keifer-Boyd", "Karen Keifer-Boyd", "Charles Garoian", "Kimberly Powell ", "Rosemary J.

Human capital theory suggests that training and development investment may not immediately affect financial performance but may instead create effects that are realized over time. However, most existing cross-sectional research explores the influence of training and development investment on performance while overlooking such investments\u2019 long-term effects. This study investigates how the cost of training and development investment influences financial performance over time in South Korea\u2019s private sector. Longitudinal data for 312 firms, which is categorized into 4 distinct waves, was used. Training and development investment is operationalized by total direct expenses for training and development. Financial performance was operationalized using the ratio of ordinary income to total assets. Latent growth modeling was used to help identify a pattern of influential relationships between training and development investment and financial performance. The results indicate that even though growth in training and development investment over time stable, there are systematic differences in such investments among firms over time. Prior financial performance was shown to be positively related to higher levels of training and development investment, but it was not related to growth in training and development investment. The initial level of training and development investment did not predict subsequent profit, but growth in training and development investment was positively related to future financial performance. This study suggests that as an organization\u2019s training and development investment increases over time, a delayed effect on financial performance may emerge because of this accumulated investment. Ultimately, the results highlight the importance of having a stock of human capital, rather than concentrating upon momentary flows that yield immediate effects.

Although the Li-ion battery presently shows best performance for energy density and power density compared to other rechargeable batteries, some degradation problems still remain as key challenges for long-term durability in automotive applications. Among those problems, Li deposition is well known for causing permanent capacity loss. Fundamental mechanisms of Li deposition in the carbon anode are, however, not fully understood, especially at subzero temperature and/or under high rate charge. This dissertation introduces comprehensive study of Li deposition using automotive 18650 Li-ion cells. The mechanism and relevant diagnostic methods as well as preventive charging protocol are discussed.\n  In part one, a new diagnostic tool is introduced utilizing 3-electrode cell system, which measures thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of cathode and anode, respectively, as a function of temperature and SOC (state of charge): open circuit potential (OCP); Li diffusion coefficient in active particles; and internal resistance. These data are employed to understand electrochemical reaction and its thermal interaction under charging conditions that result in Li deposition.\n  Part two provides a threshold parameter for the onset of Li deposition, which is not commonly used anode potential but charge capacity, or more specifically the amount of Li+ ions participating in intercalation reaction without Li deposition at given charging circumstances. This is called the critical charge capacity in this thesis, beyond which capacity loss at normal operating condition is observed, which becomes more serious as temperature is lowered and/or charge C-rate increases.\n  Based on these experimental results, the mechanism of Li deposition is proposed as the concept of anode particle surface saturation, meaning that once the anode particle surface is saturated with Li in any charging circumstances, no more Li+ ions can be intercalated but should be reduced to metallic form on the anode particle surface. This is validated by calculating the distribution of Li concentration inside the anode particle with electrochemical modeling.\n  In part three, a novel pulse charge protocol is developed, which consists of two steps. First high current charge/discharge pulses increase the cell temperature from a subzero temperature up to above room temperature in a short time, and next, high current charge provides the net charge capacity. Sluggish Li diffusion at low temperature becomes fast thanks to cell temperature elevation by high current pulses (1st step), which plays a role of preventing surface saturation during high current charge (2nd step). Thus, this charge protocol is not only Li deposition-free but also leads to rapid charge at subzero temperatures.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4802], "author_name_tesi": "Kwon, Ou Jung ", "last_name_ssi": "Kwon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ou Jung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Chao Yang Wang", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Christopher Rahn", "Donghai Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thermal effect at low temperature", "Li-ion battery", "Electric vehicle", "Rapid charge", "Lithium deposition", "Anode degradation"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "NUMERICALLY EFFICIENT TECHNIQUES FOR THE ANALYSIS OF MMIC STRUCTURES\n", "id": "6472", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5965", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The method of moments (MoM) has been widely used for the full-wave electromagnetic analysis of layered structures. It has been gaining in popularity because the conventional equivalent circuit based simulation techniques have difficulty in producing accurate results for circuits with complex geometry and high operating frequency. However, the MoM is a computationally intensive process and requires considerable computer resources to perform the analysis. This thesis proposes and validates several techniques to speed up different stages of the MoM process.\nWe first consider the computation of impedance matrix for layered structures. It is time-consuming since each element requires the evaluation of quadruple integrals. To increase the efficiency, we propose a technique, referred to as the Fast Matrix Generation (FMG). In this method, conventional and rigorous numerical methods are still used for generating the impedance matrix elements that are associated with the near-field interactions, while a more efficient scheme is employed where the separation distance between basis and testing functions exceeds a threshold value. A significant saving in computation time, sometimes over 90%, can be achieved via the application of this approach, as is demonstrated by numerical results for a number of typical microwave circuits.\nThe frequency response of microwave passive structures often involves one or more resonances, and this, in turn, requires the use of small frequency steps for their analysis. This imposes an enormous computational burden when computing their frequency response via the MoM process. We introduce an impedance matrix interpolation technique that serves to reduce the computation time for the impedance matrix quite considerably, especially if the frequency band of interest is wide. In this approach, the frequency variation of the matrix element is expressed in term of interpolating polynomials with or without extracting the phase factor exp(-jkr), depending on the separation distance between the source and field points. Although the concept of matrix interpolation is not entirely new, the accuracy has been improved in this work over those published previously. Furthermore, our algorithm has the added advantage that it can be readily incorporated into existing codes. The efficiency of this approach is validated by considering a variety of layered structure problems.\nNext, the Characteristic Basis Function Method (CBFM) is proposed to reduce the matrix solution time for MoM analysis of large and/or complex geometries. The CBFs are special types of high-level basis functions, defined over domains that encompass a relatively large number of conventional subdomain bases, e.g., triangular patches or rooftops. In this approach, we define two kinds of CBFs that represent different kinds of interactions between the conventional subdomain bases contained in the CBFs. The primary CBF for a particular block is associated with the solution for the isolated block, while the secondary ones account for the mutual coupling effects between this block and others. Efficiency of the CBFM is demonstrated with several numerical examples\nFinally, we present an iterative process for solving the matrix equation by using an extrapolated initial guess in conjunction with the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method. The initial guess is computed from the orthonormalized version of the solutions at previous frequencies. The number of iterations needed to make the residual error smaller than a tolerance is reduced via the application of the extrapolated initial guess. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated via several numerical examples.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5959], "author_name_tesi": "Kwon, Soon Jae ", "last_name_ssi": "Kwon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Soon Jae", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raj Mittra", "Douglas Henry Werner", "Lynn A Carpenter", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raj Mittra, Committee Chair", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Member", "Lynn A Carpenter, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Method of Moments", "Layered structure", "Full-wave electromagnetic field analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "School-to-work transition of college graduates in Korea: the impact of high school track on college-performance and post-college occupational outcomes.", "id": "21068", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9708", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study aimed at examining the impacts of high school track on college performance and subsequent occupational outcomes after college graduation. To this end, the Korean Education and Employment Panel (KEEP) data from 2004 through 2010, including 4,000 samples of 12th graders as of 2004 from vocational and general high schools, were analyzed. The differences in the influence of the two high school tracks were also investigated to identify the effect of secondary vocational education. \nRegarding college performance, a great gap was found between the two high school track graduates. Even though the majority of the high school graduates advanced to some college, considerably fewer samples from the vocational track chose two-year colleges rather than four-year colleges. They are significantly affected by their individual and family backgrounds in determining post-secondary education. In contrast, the graduates from general high schools were significantly influenced only by their academic records and educational aspiration when making a decision on college advancement. These results support the findings of previous research, asserting that students in the vocational track demonstrate lower self-efficacy and disadvantageous socio-economic circumstances in comparison with those in the general track.\nHigh school track had significant relationships with college performance. The vocational high school graduates were less likely to enroll in four-year colleges, less likely to choose a temporary left during college education, and much less likely to complete four-year colleges than those from general high school. On the other hand, high school track did not influence job relevance to college major and job correspondence to educational level, when those who were in first-paid employment after college graduation were analyzed. These results imply that high school track has short-term effects, but the impact does not last in the middle- or long-term after the cohorts complete their college education. One noticeable finding is that those who desired four-year college graduation, enrolled in four-year colleges, and chose a temporary stop of college attendance are less likely to be satisfied with their first-paid jobs. \nThe finding of this study\u2014no differences in post-college occupational outcomes between the two high school track graduates\u2014may suggest that a fundamental transformation of the policies regarding secondary vocational education is essential. The Korean secondary vocational education needs to change its goal from producing middle-level skilled labor to preparing a workforce with transferable knowledge and skills for pursuing some college education. This alteration will inevitably require integrating the vocational curriculum with the academic curriculum at the high school level. Further, given that 50% of the vocational high school graduates enrolled in two-year colleges and demonstrated more satisfaction with their jobs than their peers from general high schools, strengthening post-secondary vocational education could facilitate the college-to-work transition, thereby eventually reducing the high unemployment of college graduates.\nWith empirical evidence, this study contributes to a better understanding of the behaviors of the vocational high school graduates, with regard to their in-college and post-college outcomes. This study also suggests that differentiating the competencies of college graduates from both tracks could ensure the identity of secondary vocational education. In addition, the findings of the study support that expediting the college-to-work transition should be the goal of the Korean secondary vocational education.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9462], "author_name_tesi": "Kwon, Sung Youn", "last_name_ssi": "Kwon", "middle_name_ssi": "Youn", "first_name_ssi": "Sung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia Pellock", "Cynthia Pellock", "Mark D Threeton", "Soo Yong Byun", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Kyle Leonard Peck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia Pellock, Dissertation Advisor", "Cynthia Pellock, Committee Chair", "Mark D Threeton, Committee Member", "Soo Yong Byun, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Kyle Leonard Peck, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["school-to-work transition", "college", "graduates", "high school track", "vocational education", "college performance", "post-college occupational outcoems", "career and technical education", "CTE", "vocational education and traning", "CTE", "secondary vocational education of Korea"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "TARGET DETECTION IN ULTRA-WIDEBAND NOISE RADAR\nSYSTEMS", "id": "15716", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7981", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ultra-wideband (UWB) noise radar has been widely considered as a promising technique\nfor covert high-resolution detection of multiple targets due to several advantages such\nas excellent immunity from jamming and interference, low probability of detection and\ninterception, and relatively simple hardware architectures. The most important advantages\nof noise radar is immunity of interception by an adversary, since the transmitted\nnoise-waveform is constantly varying and never repeats exactly. In addition, UWB noise\nradar obtains high-resolution detection of multiple targets due to its high instantaneous\nbandwidth. Based to the above advantages, UWB noise radar systems are garnering\nmore and more attention recently. In this dissertation, two issues concerning detection\nand estimation based on information theory and compressive sensing applied to UWB\nnoise radar are investigated in detail.\nThis dissertation explores a target detection method using the total correlation formalism\nbased on information theory which enables the detection of multiple targets at\nintermediate and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. This approach uses the largest\neigenvalue of the sample covariance matrix to extract information from the transmitted\nsignal replica, and outperforms the conventional total correlation detector when reflected\nsignals have intermediate or low SNR values. Additionally, in order to avoid ambiguous\ntarget occurrence, an adaptive threshold is proposed, which guarantees the detection\nperformance with the same receiving antenna elements for a given false alarm probability.\nThe threshold is computed from the largest and smallest eigenvalue distributions\nbased on random matrix theory. Numerical simulations show this detection method can\nbe used for a wide range of SNR environments, and the threshold provides definitive\ntarget detection.\nThis dissertation also explores an application of compressive sensing for multipleinput\nmultiple-output (MIMO) UWB noise radar imaging. Two schemes to improve\nthe system performance of a sample selection and an adaptive weighting allocation are\ninvestigated. The sample selection is based on comparing the norm values of candidates\namong the received signal, and selecting the largest M samples among N per antenna\nto obtain selection diversity. Moreover, an adaptive weighting allocation which improves\nreconstruction accuracy of compressive sensing by maximizing the mutual information\nbetween target echoes and the transmitted signals is investigated. Further, this weighting\nscheme is applicable to both sample selection schemes, a conventional random sampling\nand the proposed selection. Simulations show that this selection method enhances\nthe multiple target detection probability and reduces the normalized mean square error (NMSE).\nThis dissertation also develops the adaptive weighting allocation of compressive sensing\nfor MIMO UWB noise radar imaging from a practical perspective. For an adaptive\nweighting allocation scheme in the previous chapter, however, perfect knowledge of the\ntarget scene is not available in practice due to the existence of noise at receivers or lack of\nmeasurements. Thus, the recovery error provides inaccurate weighting values which can\ndegrade reconstruction accuracies and target detection probabilities. In order to mitigate\nthis problem, an adaptive weighting allocation with reconstruction error by using\nknowledge of recovery error variances is investigated. Numerical simulations for various\nscenarios show that this practical scheme improves NMSE and the target detection\nprobability.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7927], "author_name_tesi": "Kwon, Yangsoo ", "last_name_ssi": "Kwon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yangsoo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ram Mohan Narayanan", "Ram Mohan Narayanan", "William Evan Higgins", "Mark Levi", "Vishal Monga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ram Mohan Narayanan, Dissertation Advisor", "Ram Mohan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "William Evan Higgins, Committee Member", "Mark Levi, Committee Member", "Vishal Monga, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["noise radar", "target detection", "MIMO radar"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Molecular dynamics of biomembrane as probed by multifaceted biophotonics\n", "id": "8103", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4584", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The cellular membrane plays a vital role in numerous biological processes, such as communication, hormonal response and transport of both small and large molecules into and out of the cell.  In these processes, intra-and intermembrane interactions and their dynamics are critical.  Any intramembrane reactions depends upon later interactions with the two-dimensional bilayer, which are not yet well understood.  However, the underlying mechanism of lateral molecular diffusions in biomembranes is not fully understood.  For example, it is unclear whether these molecules diffuse in a controlled manner and if they do, what kinds of interactions and properties govern their molecular dynamics.  In contrast, intermembrane interactions are key processes for endocytosis and exocytosis.  Small vesicles diffuse close to and fuse with the target membrane or are pinched off and diffuse away from the target membrane.  Although much focus has been directed toward the actual fusion and fission steps, understanding of vesicle dynamics and their interactions near the target membrane remain elusive, despite their importance.  The major intricacy in studying weak, yet highly cooperative, these dynamics is the complex heterogeneity of cellular membranes, which requires integrated and noninvasive techniques to investigate the requisite broad range of spatial and temporal scales.  To date, however, conventional techniques have been optimized to probe membrane dynamics over a narrow range of space and time. \nTo fully understand complex membrane dynamics in vivo, model systems allow systematic and rigorous exploration of physical mechanisms.  Therefore, I employed supported planar bilayers and small unilamellar vesicles to study membrane dynamics, under various controlled conditions.  To interrogate intra- and intermembrane dynamics, we developed multimodal microscopy that can simultaneously perform several microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, such as prism based- and objective based total internal reflection (TIR) microscopy, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), single particle tracking (SPT) and holographic optical trapping.  Individual techniques were validated by proof-of-concept experiments including imaging local adhesion of C3H 10T\u00bd fibroblast, monitoring the diffusion properties of lipid analogs in the plasma membrane of RBL cells, tracking individual lipids in model membrane systems and trapping arrays of silica beads (~ 0.8 um in diameter) in defined patterns. \nBy combining three different methods, i.e., TIR, FCS and optical trapping, I simultaneously manipulated and probed the dynamics of individual particles near a substrate-solution interface.  I observed the diffusion of polystyrene particles and trapped single particles (~84 nm in diameter) near glass surfaces treated with several materials, such as polyethylene glycol 8000, bovine serum albumin or sodium hydroxide.  These results indicated that particle diffusion is influenced by surface interactions, which may have further implications in vesicle/membrane interactions that subsequently were investigated. \nTo provide a comprehensive interpretation of endocytosis and exocytosis, the dynamics of freely diffusing small vesicles near supported planar bilayers were investigated using TIR-FCS.  The population distributions of vesicles near planar bilayers were affected by ionic strength, pH of surrounding buffers, as well as lipid compositions of the planar bilayers.  As a result, vesicles experienced altered hydrodynamic interactions with the planar bilayers and thus changing measured vesicle diffusion near the bilayers.  These experimentally determined vesicle dynamics agree with theoretical simulations.  Based on these results, I propose that, when small vesicles are not in contact with cellular membrane, they do not randomly diffuse around membranes, but may diffuse in a controlled manner under various dynamic biological conditions.\nTo further mimic the cellular environment, the interactions of vesicles with supported planar bilayer were investigated under crowded and highly viscous conditions.  By adding glycerol to the small vesicle/planar membrane model system, the dynamics of vesicles near planar bilayer were considerably reduced.  Increasing the solution viscosity with glycerol enhanced the attractive interactions of vesicles with planar bilayers.  In addition, I observed that Ficoll 70 solutions that increased viscosity and the excluded volume effect can further reinforce the attractive interactions between vesicles and planar bilayers.  The excluded volume effect of Ficoll 70 slightly enhanced vesicle/membrane interactions, in contrast to the large viscosity effects induced by Ficoll 70.  In addition, vesicles showed more dramatic changes in their interactions with negatively charged planar bilayer than with neutral planar bilayer.  Therefore these results imply that, within cells, vesicle interactions are improved mainly due to viscosity effects.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4551], "author_name_tesi": "Kyoung, Minjoung ", "last_name_ssi": "Kyoung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Minjoung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Erin Elizabeth Sheets", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Tae Hee Lee", "Ahmed A Heikal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Erin Elizabeth Sheets, Committee Chair", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Tae Hee Lee, Committee Member", "Ahmed A Heikal, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["membrane", "spectroscopy", "microscopy", "TIR", "HOT", "FCS", "cell", "lipid"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "An Investigation of Quality of Life, Job Satisfaction, and the Return to Work Related Experiences of Women with Spinal Cord Injury", "id": "8381", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1786", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     This study explored the relationship between employment status, quality of life, and job satisfaction among 190 women with spinal cord injury.
