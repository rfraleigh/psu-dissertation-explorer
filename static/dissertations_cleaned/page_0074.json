I employed qualitative case study methodology to gain a detailed and in-depth understanding of this phenomenon. Two individual interviews and four focus groups were conducted to elicit youth participants\u2019 views on leadership and how they were applying the leadership skills learned at Eduland in their schools, communities and in other aspects of their day to day lives. After analyzing field notes and ten interview transitions, I found three emerging themes, simulated group work as the foundation for leadership development, leading through selfless service, and specific challenges to leadership. Based on these themes four key things can be inferred about the program. First, Partnership Foundation prepared youth for leadership using a multiculturalist contextual leadership approach and facilitated the participant\u2019s development of human capital and social capital. Second, focus group participants applied the leadership skills through their leadership positions at school and through organizing events in their communities. Third, youth marginalization prevented participants from fully exercising leadership skills learned at Eduland. Lastly, the contextual leadership approach used at Eduland had its strengths, but lacked the critical perspective needed to challenge the ideological, political and structural underpinnings which maintain the status quo. A new leadership framework steeped in critical multiculturalism philosophy which exposes the deeply rooted class and race-based structural inequalities in South Africa is needed.  This study holds implications for various stakeholders, policy makers, community organizers, and anyone involved in the youth development and the youth leadership development field.

Moreover, extraordinary victories by exceptional athletes brought superhuman status, a condition comparable to that of the mythic heroes.  Ancient Greek myth emphasized the athletic nature of many heroic figures, imparting to them excellence in contests as well as achievements in battle or other endeavors.  This athletic component of a hero\u2019s identity allowed for ready comparisons between the accomplishments of the ancient heroes and the achievements of historical athletes.  Consequently, a few extremely successful athletes during Greece\u2019s Archaic and Classical periods received posthumous heroic cults.  The accoutrements of victory, such as the victory crown, the epinician ode, and the victory statue likened the victor to the immortal heroes.  In addition, the spatial organization of the panhellenic sanctuaries, as well as other athletic fields, closely connected the world of the living athletes with the accomplishments of the deceased heroes.  Finally, the importance of founding and sponsoring athletic competitions, especially significant for the tyrants of the Archaic period, provided a means for powerful and wealthy rulers to associate themselves with the victory of athletic contests with no risk of defeat.  \nThe lifetimes of the athletic heroes are generally limited to a period in the late Archaic and early Classical periods, when large portions of ancient Greece were struggling with social and political upheaval, but the issues of their heroic status were still being contended and recognized into the fourth century BCE.  As glorified individuals, athletic victors embodied the ideals of the aristocratic elite but also could impart their kudos and kleos to communities as civic heroes.   The power of victory and its ability to justify and legitimize political power was not lost on the aristocratic and non-aristocratic forces in ancient Greece, and each side vied to capitalize on the immense power of prestigious kleos.  Despite these social and political rivalries, powerful and successful athletes sought their own heroic honors through their individual quests for kleos and immortality.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1416], "author_name_tesi": "Lunt, David James", "last_name_ssi": "Lunt", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Munn", "Mark Munn", "Paul Harvey", "Stephen Wheeler", "Mark Dyreson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Munn, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Munn, Committee Chair", "Paul Harvey, Committee Member", "Stephen Wheeler, Committee Member", "Mark Dyreson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hero cult", "ancient athletics", "ancient Greece"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Teachers' Knowledge and Understanding of Addition and Subtraction Word Problems on Student Understanding", "id": "10495", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2975", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines the influence of teacher understanding on student understanding through teacher practice.

The interface circuit between the piezoelectric device and electrical load plays an\nimportant role in the energy harvesting process. Most of the previous techniques are mainly passive, based on AC-DC diode-bridge rectifier circuits. However, since the diode-bridge rectifier circuit can only emulate a resistive load, while the internal impedance of a piezoelectric device is essentially capacitive, the impedance matching condition can not be satisfied, and so generally the power harvesting ability of the passive technique is very low.\nThe semi-active techniques represented by the synchronized switch harvesting on inductor(SSHI) technique improves performance over the passive techniques by inverting the piezoelectric voltage in phase with the device velocity, but its performance drops dramatically at off-resonance frequencies because it does not guarantee impedance matching at off-resonance frequencies. The newly proposed active energy harvesting technique actively applies electrical boundary\nconditions to the piezoelectric device, and experimental results showed that the active technique can boost the harvested power\ndramatically under quasi-static conditions.\n\nIn previous work, the active energy harvesting experiments were all implemented under the quasi-static assumption, and the device displacement was assumed to be constant regardless of the applied voltage. However, in many practical applications, especially systems where the energy harvesting device possesses resonance frequency,\nthe quasi-static assumption does not hold. Furthermore, the resonance frequency of a mechanical system is often changing and hard to estimate because of the variation of device parameters, and so previous techniques based on certain resonance frequencies may not be effective. Also, for a practical system, it is more likely that the excitation force instead of the displacement is fixed. Hence we seek to develop a more practical active energy harvesting\ntechnique for a real dynamic system application.\n\nIn this dissertation, the active energy harvesting technique for a spring-mass-damper piezoelectric dynamic system under a constant-magnitude force excitation is investigated. First the model of a piezoelectric dynamic system is built, and from this model we derive a general expression for the harvested power. It is shown\nthat the harvested power is proportional to the integral of the product of the device voltage and velocity, and the optimal control voltage that results in maximum energy harvesting is derived. It is also shown that for any excitation frequency, the optimal control voltage is always trying to shift the system's resonance frequency to the excitation frequency, and the equivalent load impedance matches the internal impedance of the electromechanical system. The harvested power can therefore always be maximized at any excitation frequency. Simulation results are shown to prove the theory.\n\nIn practical implementation, the circuit efficiency and change of device parameters make the situation much more complicated, and the\ntheoretically predicted optimal control voltage may not be accurate. We propose an adaptive control algorithm that can find the optimal\ncontrol voltage adaptively. The method is based on sequential quadratic interpolation, and only information that can be easily measured from the circuit is needed to implement the control.\nSimulation results show good behavior of the controller.\n\nCircuits used to implement the active harvesting technique are proposed, including a full-bridge converter with a flyback converter, dead-time insertion circuit, current and voltage regulator, current and voltage sensing circuit, PWM and drive signal generation circuit, etc. All the circuits are built on a stand-alone PCB board. Experimental results show that the active technique can harvest five times more power than the passive technique at off-resonance frequencies.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1244], "author_name_tesi": "Luo, Cheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Luo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Heath Hofmann", "Heath F Hofmann", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Qiming Zhang", "John Douglas Mitchell", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Heath Hofmann, Dissertation Advisor", "Heath F Hofmann, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member", "John Douglas Mitchell, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Full-bridge Converter", "Piezoelectric", "Energy Harvesting", "Adaptive Control"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Understanding shear-induced hydrolysis reactions on soda lime silica glass surface", "id": "15252jzl221", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15252", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soda lime silica (SLS) glass is the most widely used glass materials in terms of mass in windows, glass bottles & containers, etc. One of the biggest challenge for SLS glass is its brittleness or prone to be damaged at ambient conditions. One important reason is that cracks propagation on SLS glass surface can be significantly accelerated by tensile stress induced corrosion reactions of amorphous silicate network, which breaks the Si-O-Si bonds to form two silanol groups, known as stress corrosion effect. It has also been found that stress corrosion reactions are faster with the increase of relative humidity (RH). The propagation of cracks will eventually lead to the failure of SLS glass. However, very little is known on the reactions between glass and water in the environment induced by interfacial shear, which results in the removal of SLS glass. \nRecently, it has been found that SLS glass shows unique response to interfacial shear in humid conditions through a ball-on-flat wear test. For most of the commercial flat glasses, including silica, borosilicate glasses, boroaluminosilicate glasses and aluminosilicate glasses, the amount of wear will increase as the humidity level increases. Only SLS glass shows wear resistance at high relative humidity. It is found that shear-induced hydrolysis reactions take place on SLS glass surface for medium and low RH conditions. Then this shear-induced hydrolysis reaction must be \u201csuppressed\u201d or have similar reaction rates of its reverse reactions (condensation of silanols) at high RH. One hypothesis is that Na+/H+ + H2O exchange could take place at high RH, which creates surface residual compressive stress at the meantime. Compressive stress which could lower the effective tensile stress on glass surface, is believed to stabilize or hinder the propagation of cracks. Then the amount of wear could also be lowered if the applied stress is not large enough to induce hydrolysis reactions. \nTo test this hypothesis and explore the factors that govern the shear-induced reactions on SLS glass surface, effects of different structural units, surface mechanical properties and compressive stress, Na+/H+ + H2O exchange are investigated in this dissertation. It should be noted that these factors cannot be easily isolated. Therefore, multiple different treatments need to be performed to modify the surface chemical structures of SLS glass. These surface treatments include hydrothermal reactions, leaching in acid solution, thermal poling in controlled environment, ion-exchange with KNO3. The governing factors are determined through correlating the changes in surface chemical structure, mechanical properties with the wear behavior. It is found that surface mechanical properties, compressive stress and alteration layers created by Na+/H+ + H2O exchange are not responsible for SLS glass\u2019s unique wear behavior at high RH. While no specific mechanism has been identified, mobile Na+ cations and silicate network structure are suggested to be the dominating factors. \nTo better understand the amorphous silicate network structure of SLS glass. Several novel approaches based on non-destructive spectroscopy have been developed to describe the wide distribution of structural parameters of silicate network. With the assist of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, the weighted mean of Si-O bond length is in linear relationship with the weighted mean of Si-O-Si asymmetric stretch absorbance. Then a new mathematical algorithm has been developed to extract absorbance of Si-O-Si asymmetric stretch from specular reflectance infrared spectra. By utilizing the selection rule of sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, O-H\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf0d7O distribution in the subsurface of SLS glass has been roughly identified, which is in good agreement with theoretical prediction. Speciation of hydrous species (ratio of SiOH/H2O) can be determined through a new algorithm based on attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy and H depth profile. \nA new hypothesis on the unique wear behavior based on the current findings is proposed: shear induced hydrolysis and condensation reactions are in dynamic equilibrium in the presence of Na+. Existence of Na+ can lower the activation energy barrier, especially for condensation reactions. At high RH, Na+ can migrate through the adsorbed water layers and moved to the silanol sites to \u201ccatalyze\u201d condensation reactions. To prove this hypothesis, MD simulation with reactive force fields as well as experimental work are required.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16743], "author_name_tesi": "Luo, Jiawei ", "last_name_ssi": "Luo", "first_name_ssi": "Jiawei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seong Han Kim", "Seong Han Kim", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn", "Manish Kumar", "Carlo G.

The major contribution of this thesis is the development of a semantic model of geographical problem solving, which synthesizes aspects of knowledge representation and reasoning to capture and model the meanings of geospatial information technologies and geographical applications.

Android dominates the market with 87.5% of the global smartphone shipments and over 65 billion Android apps downloaded. With the unprecedented popularity of Android devices, however, a dramatically increasing number of security threats are posing to Android applications and systems. Tremendous efforts from both industry and academia have been made to mitigate the threats to secure Android. This dissertation mainly focuses on two severe threats: Android App repackaging and Android Framework vulnerabilities, and propose techniques and approaches to address them and, hence, enhance Android application and system security.\n \nFirst, we propose a decentralized Android app repackaging detection scheme to impede the prevalent app repackaging problem in the market. Existing countermeasures mostly detect repackaging based on app similarity measurement and rely on a central party to perform detection. However, the centralized scheme is unscalable and the detection techniques tend to be imprecise when handling obfuscated apps, resulting in many repackaged apps escaping detection and being widely distributed in the market. To solve the problem, we propose a decentralized repackaging detection scheme, which adds the repackaging detection capability into the code of an app, such that repackaging detection becomes an inherent part of the app when it is released.\n\nSecond, we design and build the first system that enables symbolic execution of Android Framework to automatically discover vulnerabilities and generate exploits. Android Framework is an integral and foundational part of the Android system. Each of the 1.4 billion Android devices relies on the system services of Android Framework to manage applications and system resources. Given its critical role, a vulnerability in the framework can be exploited to launch large-scale cyber attacks and cause severe harms to user security and privacy. Recently, many vulnerabilities in Android Framework were exposed, showing that it is vulnerable and exploitable. However, most existing research has been limited to analyzing Android applications, while there are very few techniques and tools developed for analyzing Android Framework. To fill the gap, we develop the first system that analyzes the framework through symbolic execution, and demonstrate how the system can be applied to discovering new vulnerability instances and generating PoC exploits.\n\nGiven that symbolic execution has proven to be a very useful technique, we plan to apply the system to other purposes in future work, such as automatic API specification generation, fine-grained malware analysis, and testing.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14659], "author_name_tesi": "Luo, Lannan ", "last_name_ssi": "Luo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lannan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peng Liu", "Peng Liu", "Anna Squicciarini", "Xingyu Xing", "Minghui Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peng Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Peng Liu, Committee Chair", "Anna Squicciarini, Committee Member", "Xingyu Xing, Committee Member", "Minghui Zhu, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Symbolic execution", "Concolic execution", "Vulnerability discovery", "Exploit generation", "Android Framewor", "Code obfuscation", "Android apps", "Android app repackaging", "Tamper-proofing", "Obfuscation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "QUANTIFICATION OF SOIL MACROPORE NETWORK AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PREFERENTIAL FLOW USING COMBINED X-RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY AND BREAKTHROUGH CURVE ANALYSIS\n", "id": "9032", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3897", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the unresolved challenges in soil physics/hydrology is to quantify soil structure, especially macropore characteristics, in a manner that can be implemented into current flow and transport models. The goal of this study is to characterize, visualize, and quantify soil macropore characteristics and their relationships to preferential water flow and chemical transport in intact structured soils.  Two soils (Hagerstown silt loam and Morrison sand) with contrasting texture/structure and two land uses (cropland and pasture) were investigated through a combined X-ray computed tomography (CT) and solute breakthrough experiments using relatively large intact soil columns (102 mm in diameter and about 350 mm in length). \nFive contributions are made in this dissertation. Firstly, an improved protocol is introduced to quantify 3-D macropore networks. Important macropore characteristics were quantified, including macroporosity along soil depth, macropore network density, macropore size distribution, surface area, macropore length density, length distribution, mean hydraulic radius, tortuosity, inclination or angle, and connectivity (i.e., pathway and node density). The approach developed in this study quantified the distinct morphological features of macropore networks in two soil types and two land uses. \nThe second contribution presented in this dissertation is the understanding of the variation of macropore characteristics in different types of soils and land uses and with soil depth. Within the same soil type, the soils with pasture land use had greater macroporosity, pore length density, and node density, especially in the subsoil. Within the same land use, the Morrison sand displayed fewer macropores and weaker structure than the Hagerstown silt loam. The macropores in the subsurface (i.e., Ap2 and Bt horizons) were less tortuous, more vertically oriented, and less inter-connected than the macropores in the Ap1 horizon. The analysis of variance indicated that a combination of soil type and land use needs to be considered to evaluate the variation of the macropore characteristics. Such results contribute to the enhanced evaluation of preferential flow and transport potential in soils under different land uses.\nThe third contribution of this dissertation is the development of the quantitative relationships between macropore characteristics and soil hydraulic parameters (i.e., saturated hydraulic conductivity and hydrodynamic dispersion). For the soil columns taken from the Hagerstown silt loam with two types of land uses (i.e., crop and pasture), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) of each soil horizon and of the whole column were measured and the breakthrough curve (BTC) for CaBr2 was determined. For all the soil columns with two land uses, macroporosity and path (i.e., the number of independent paths between two ends of the soil volume) explained 75% of the variation in Ksat. Within each land use, macroporosity, path, and tortuosity were the most important characteristics to estimate Ksat of the horizon but with different rank of importance. The path, hydraulic radius, and the angle explained 97% of the variation in the dispersion coefficient of all the soil columns. Additionally, the good correlation between the hydrodynamic dispersion and Ksat of the Bt horizon implied that the hydrodynamic dispersion was mainly controlled by the horizon with the lowest conductivity. \nThe fourth contribution of this dissertation is the examination of the lacunarity to test if macropore networks and flow patterns are fractal and if lacunarity has a diagnostic value in characterizing soil macropore structure and preferential flow pattern where fractal dimension alone could not. Relative lacunarity functions (RLFs) and pore fractal dimensions, both in 2-D and 3-D, were calculated for the macropore networks and tracer distributions at the five positions in the soil column scanned with a micro-CT. The lacunarity function reflected the size distribution of macropores and the spatial pattern of flow and transport. The RLFs indicated that the tracer distributions exhibited more self-similarity than the macropore networks. Lacunarity is a potentially powerful parameter that may be coupled with the fractal dimension to better describe and model soil structural properties.\nThe fifth contribution of this dissertation is a simplified method to quantify soil structure (i.e., porosity) and preferential water flow and solute transport (i.e., the velocity, solute mass, and concentration) in the soil macropore domain, matrix domain, and their interface. The voxel-based soil porosity and solute tracer concentration, mass, and velocity were quantified using micro X-ray CT and digital radiograph in an intact soil column (10 cm in diameter and 30 cm in length) of a Hagerstown silt loam. Only part of the macropores, especially the highly continuous biogenetic macropores at the subsurface, were active in transporting the solute. This study illustrates that preferential flow pathways in the intact structured soil consist of a complex network of earthworm burrows, root channels, inter-aggregate macropores, and mesopores or even micropores in the soil matrix. Modeling of this flow network and its dynamics would require a new approach different from the classical continuous-domain approach.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3870], "author_name_tesi": "Luo, Lifang  ", "last_name_ssi": "Luo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lifang ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hangsheng Lin", "Hangsheng Lin", "Daniel Dale Fritton", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "John Matthew Schmidt", "Kamini Singha", "Phillip Michael Halleck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hangsheng Lin, Dissertation Advisor", "Hangsheng Lin, Committee Chair", "Daniel Dale Fritton, Committee Member", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "John Matthew Schmidt, Committee Member", "Kamini Singha, Committee Member", "Phillip Michael Halleck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["soil structure", "solute transport", "preferential flow", "macropre", "computed tomography"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Copolymerization of polar and non-polar monomers: free radical polymerization and late transition metal catalyzed insertion polymerization\n", "id": "8933", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5449", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The addition of the heterogeneous Lewis acid, acidic alumina (Acidic, Brockmann I, standard grade, ~ 150 mesh, pH = 4.5\u00b10.5 in aqueous solution) to the 2, 2\u2019-azobis (2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) -initiated copolymerization of methyl acrylate (MA) with 1-alkenes results in significant increase in polymerization rate and increased incorporation of the later monomer to the polymer backbone. Alumina can be recovered by filtration and reused repeatedly with no loss of activity. This led to the design of an Al2O3-filled column reactor system for the copolymerization reaction\n\nThe addition of insoluble acidic alumina to controlled radical NMP and RAFT polymerizations of acrylate monomers results in significantly higher reaction rates and conversions. The effect is particularly dramatic since only a small fraction of the Lewis acid sites that are present on the alumina surface can actually interact with the acrylate. The Lewis acid-enhanced polymerizations have \u201cliving\u201d characteristics, allowing the synthesis of block copolymers. The alumina can be quantitatively removed by filtration and recycled with no significant loss in efficacy.\n\nThe addition of both homogeneous and heterogeneous Br\u00f8nsted acids resulted in increased monomer conversion and 1-alkene incorporation. Further, the heterogeneous Br\u00f8nsted acids can be recycled without loss of activity. A direct correlation exists between the ability of the Lewis or Br\u00f8nsted acid to bind to the ester group of the acrylate/methacrylate monomer and its ability to promote the copolymerization reaction. For Lewis acids, there is also a direct correlation between the charge/size ratio at the metal center and their ability to promote copolymerizations.\n\nThe first electron transfer induced iron-catalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) system for styrene derivatives was developed. Environmental benign reducing agents tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate (Sn(EH)2) and D-glucose were employed to constantly regenerate active Fe(II) species. This reducing/reactivating cycle allowed the controlled polymerization even in the presence of a limited amount of air. Furthermore, the amount of iron catalyst could be reduced to as low as 0.01 mmol while retaining sufficient control over the polymerization. Monomers with electron-withdrawing substituents polymerized faster than those having electron-donating substituents. Block copolymers were obtained by chain extension of polystyrene macroinitiators. Well-defined copolymers of styrene and methyl methacrylate (MMA) were also synthesized using this iron-based catalyst, and the MMA content in the copolymers could be varied by changing the monomer feed ratio.\n\nThe palladium-catalyzed alternating copolymerization of ethene and carbon monoxide has been extensively studied in the last two decades. A series of polyketones with very low CO content has been synthesized using palladium catalyst bearing (P-SO3-) ligand by varying the monomer feed ratio and reaction conditions. We have also demonstrated that the reason for the non-alternation in this system is more complicated than just the instability of the five-membered chelate resting state existed in the catalytic cycle, and the less dramatic difference in CO and ethene binding affinity also plays an important role for this non-alternating fashion. The kinetics and thermodynamic data has allowed us to estimate the fraction of non-alternation due to double ethene insertion during the copolymerization.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5441], "author_name_tesi": "Luo, Rong ", "last_name_ssi": "Luo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen", "Harry R Allcock", "John V Badding", "T C Mike Chung"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen, Committee Chair", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "T C Mike Chung, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["1-alkenes", "copolymerization", "acrylates"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Essay on Network Effects, Consumer Demand, and Firms' Dynamic Pricing.", "id": "26256", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11088", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation includes three chapters on estimating structural economics models. My research focuses on empirically study consumers\u2019 utility from different products, the impact of network effects on consumers\u2019 demand for products, and multi-network firms\u2019 dynamic pricing strategies. The three chapters share the same feature of estimating a discrete choice demand model, but differ in the static versus dynamic setting and the underlying economics question and strategic behaviors that I\u2019m interested.\nChapter 1\n\"The Operating System Network Effect and Telecom Carriers\u2019 Dynamic Pricing of Smartphones.\"\nThe utility a consumer realizes from owning a smartphone increases with its operating system (OS) network size. Due to this OS network effect, multi-network telecom carriers have a different pricing strategy for smartphones than the single- network manufacturers in a dynamic environment. While manufacturers choose higher prices for larger networks, carriers, who can internalize competition across OSs, have incentives to choose lower prices for larger networks. The carriers\u2019 pricing strategy contributes to the increasing smartphone users and OS concentration. In this paper, I first analyze a theoretical model to compare the pricing strategies of the carriers and manufacturers. Then I design a structural model of consumers\u2019 demand and the carriers\u2019 dynamic pricing game for smartphones, and empirically study the impact of the OS network effect and carriers\u2019 two-year contract policy on the smartphone market penetration and OS concentration. I estimate the model using product level data from August 2011 to July 2013 in the US. I deal with the empirical challenges of dynamic prices for multi-product carriers, high dimension continuous state variables, and asymmetric oligopolistic firms in the estimation. The results show that the OS network size has a positive and significant impact on consumer utility. I then study two counterfactual cases in which I eliminate the OS network effect and the carriers\u2019 pricing strategy, respectively. I find that, without the OS network effect, the smartphone penetration rate would decrease by 54.7% and the largest OS share difference decrease by 31.7% by May 2013. Without the carriers\u2019 pricing strategy, the penetration rate would decrease by 29.1% and the OS market share difference decrease by 11.2%.\nChapter 2\n\"The Operating System Network Effect and Consumers\u2019 Dynamic Demand of Smartphones with Two-Year Contracts.\"\nThis paper studies consumers\u2019 dynamic demand of smartphones on two-year wireless contracts. Individuals\u2019 demand decisions are affected by the improving quality and changing prices of smartphones, and the OS network effect, and their current smartphone contract status. Consumers need to pay high early termination fees if they end active contracts. The dynamic demand model in this paper incorporates the evolving choice set, prices, endogenous OS network sizes, and the termination policies in the smartphone industry. The preliminary results find that the OS network effect is large and significant. In addition, compared with dynamic model results, a static demand model tends to underestimate the OS network effect and overestimate price coefficient.\nChapter 3\n\"Store Brands and Retail Grocery Competition in Breakfast Cereals.\"\nThis paper empirically analyzes the impacts of store brands on grocery retailers and consumers in the market for breakfast cereals. On the supply side, store brands help a retailer to avoid direct competition with other retailers and change the set of retailer\u2019s products. On the demand side, introducing store brands changes the national brands prices and consumers\u2019 choice set. We analyze the effects via demand estimation for a single grocery store chain Dominick\u2019s at Chicago in 1997 and counterfactual exercises. The estimation results show that consumers\u2019 unobserved utility of buying at a competing retailer is higher for consumers that value national brands, and is lower for ones that value Dominick\u2019s store brands. This is consistent with the claim that store brands help a retailer to avoid competition. The counterfactual calculations show that the profit loss from removing store brands is higher if the retailer has more competitors, with a median loss of 4.33% of profits from cereals. Existence of store brands increases national brands prices and consumer welfare increases slightly when store brands are removed.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10660], "author_name_tesi": "Luo, Rong ", "last_name_ssi": "Luo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts", "Mark John Roberts", "Paul L E Grieco", "Peter William Newberry", "Shrihari Sridhar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark John Roberts, Committee Chair", "Paul L E Grieco, Committee Chair", "Peter William Newberry, Committee Member", "Shrihari Sridhar, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Network Effect", "Static and Dynamic Discrete Choice", "and Dynamic Pricing"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "ULTRASONIC GUIDED WAVES AND WAVE SCATTERING IN VISCOELASTIC COATED HOLLOW CYLINDERS \n\n\n", "id": "6860", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6593", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over a million miles of piping is used in the USA in almost every industry that calls for a large scale transportation and distribution of energy or product, like natural gas, oil, water, etc. Pipeline safety is crucial in that defective pipelines can lead to catastrophic failure, property damage and high replacement costs.  To preserve the integrity of these pipelines, viscoelastic coatings are widely used on the pipes. However, pipe aging and exposure to a variety of changing environmental conditions reduces the protection effectiveness consequently leading to the occurrence of defects. An effective non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method is needed to provide the current pipeline status to the pipeline operators for any further decisions on repair or replacement actions. \n\nUltrasonic guided waves, with a long range propagation capability, are becoming useful in new solutions for pipeline inspection. It is much more efficient and economical than other commonly used NDE methods like point-by-point bulk waves and magnetic flux leakage. Long pipes can be inspected from a simple sensor position. Among the two methods for the long rang guided wave pipeline inspection, almost decade old axisymmetric waves and recently developed phased array focusing, the latter presenting itself with a tremendous improvement in terms of penetration power, detection sensitivity, and inspection distance.  However, guided wave inspection potential in coated pipe has not yet been studied in detail. Many important questions need answers, like focusing feasibility in coated pipes, wave scattering possibilities study for effective inspection of 3-D defects, and quantitative evaluation of inspection distances under various coating conditions.  Since a large percentage of the pipelines are covered with viscoelastic coatings, a thorough study of guided waves in viscoelastically coated pipes is strongly called for. \n\nIn this work, guided wave propagation, scattering and focusing in coated pipes are studied comprehensively for the first time with numerical, analytical and experimental methods. A three-dimensional finite element tool utilizing ABAQUS/Explicit was developed for quantitatively and systematically modeling guided wave behavior in pipes with different viscoelastic materials. A whole process, from experimental measurement to theoretical modeling has been established, including in-situ coating property measurement, transformation of measured properties to model inputs, specific wave mode generation, and output data processing and analysis.  With the help of this new  powerful modeling tool, it is very exciting to find that guided waves can still be focused very well in a coated pipe for the frequency studied, although there is an amplitude loss due to the viscoelastic nature of the coating materials. The quantitative evaluation of the energy increment and the subsequent inspection distance increment from axisymmetric loading and focusing was studied. Wave scattering from planar and corrosion like defects were investigated under both axisymmetric and phased array focused loading with both longitudinal and torsional waves. It was found that axisymmetric waves had a small possibility of finding small corrosion like defects while focusing had a much higher chance. Defect sizing potential was also studied based on an observation of the wave interaction with defects and the mode conversion that occurred thereafter.  \n\nMoreover, in order to minimize the attenuative effect from the coatings, a parametric study of coating property effects on wave attenuation was conducted making use of the attenuation dispersion curves. An improved mathematical root search algorithm was utilized for highly viscoelastic materials.  This lead to a decision on the best choice of either coating to be used or in the case of existing coatings the best set of sensor and instrumentation parameters to do the test. Appropriate coating properties, frequency range, and wave type were recommended for future work in the pipeline industry. In addition, an experimental method of property measurement for field coating materials was developed as a means of providing inputs to computer models. It was found that coating properties had a wide variation suggesting the need of in-situ coating property measurements for any subsequent modeling work based on field coated pipes.  Finally, a detailed criterion to improve the inspection potential of coated pipes is recommended.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6591], "author_name_tesi": "Luo, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Luo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Eduard S Ventsel", "Qiming Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Eduard S Ventsel, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["acoustics", "wave mechanics", "guided wave", "finite element analysis", "phased array focusing", "ultrasonics", "viscoelasticity", "wave scattering", "nondestructive evaluation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "COATINGS TO OPTIMIZE OPTICAL FORCE AND OPTICAL ANGULAR MOMENTUM EXERTED ON METALLIC SPHERES\n\n", "id": "10869", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6621", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Optically controlled nanobeads,  each constituted by a dielectric coating on a metallic core,  are used to investigate molecular and cellular systems.

The use of HDM comes with a relatively low cost and the HDM could be directly incorporated into the existing clinical practices without additional changes in MRI sequence and patient care. In the current research and development of HDM in MRI, there are several challenges. For example, (I) limited material has been introduced or created as HDM in MRI. (II) New measurement technique may be required to measure the electrical properties of a new HDM in the frequency range that is relevant to MRI. (III) Advanced optimization method is demanded to combine with numerical simulations to design the MRI coil incorporating HDM. (IV) The lack of a fair comparison between the coil design incorporating HDM and the coil design without HDM is one of the reasons that the coil engineers hesitate to use HDM in their design. (V) There is no general guideline on the usage of HDM for clinical practice and this is another reason that slows the development of HDM.\nTwo different studies were discussed in this dissertation to advance the research and development of HDM in MRI. In the first study, a new HDM consisting of sintered BaTiO3 beads in deuterated water was created for MRI applications. This material has a much higher relative permittivity compared to all of the dielectric materials developed before. The relative permittivity and electrical conductivity of this new HDM were characterized at 3T (at approximately 125 MHz) and 7T (at approximately 300 MHz) using resonant cavities. Its superior performance in MRI was demonstrated by comparing the transmit efficiency, receive sensitivity, and SNR to previously used dielectric materials in simulation and experiment at 3T. This new HDM was later used to improve MRI performance in a spine imaging.\nIn the second study, an attempt was made (I) to answer the question that whether an optimal MRI coil incorporated with HDM would outperform an optimal MRI coil without HDM and (II) to explore the improvement in coil efficiency brought by the effect of HDM. A simple hybrid design consisting of a loop coil and an HDM disk was optimized to image a lossy sphere at 123 MHz in electromagnetic simulation using particle swarm optimization. The coil location, coil radius, HDM location, HDM geometry, and HDM material properties were considered together as parameters in the optimization. The performance of the optimal hybrid design for imaging at any depth in the lossy sphere along the coil axis turned out to be better than the corresponding optimal Coil-only design, with an average of 87% and 23% improvement in coil efficiency for locations near the center and periphery of the sphere, respectively. This result showed, for the first time, that an optimal MRI coil incorporated with HDM would outperform an optimal MRI coil without HDM. It also showed, for the first time, that the HDM can improve the coil efficiency significantly in a location deep in the imaging sample. The optimization used in here demonstrated a possible method to design an hybrid MRI coil.

Both approaches demonstrate strong conceptual overlaps. For example, actors close to each other tend to have greater similarity than those far apart; this phenomenon has different labels in geography (spatial autocorrelation) and in network science (homophily). In spite of those conceptual and observed overlaps, the integration of geography and social network context has not received the attention needed in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of their interaction or their impact on outcomes of interest, such as population health behaviors, information dissemination, or human behavior in a crisis. \nIn order to address this gap, this dissertation discusses the integration of geographic with social network perspectives applied to understanding social processes in place at both theoretical and methodological levels. At the theoretical level, this dissertation develops a theoretical framework to integrate geographical context, network context, and societal context (e.g., political or economic background) to understand the geo-social interaction in certain societal contexts. The framework extends the concepts of nearness and relationship in terms of the First Law of Geography as a matter of both geographical and social network distance, relationship, and interaction. At the methodological level, the integration of geography and social network contexts is framed within a new interdisciplinary field: visual analytics, in which three major application-oriented subfields (data exploration, decision-making, and predictive analysis) are used to organize discussion. In each subfield, this dissertation presents a theoretical framework first, and then reviews what has been achieved regarding geo-social visual analytics in order to identify potential future research.\nThis dissertation also develops two novel geo-social visual analytics tools to study the complex interaction between spatial and social relationships at different geographical levels: the regional level (e.g., country, state, or county) and the individual level (e.g., person, or organization). The first tool, called GeoSocialApp, uses data for international trade networks among different countries to empirically study the interaction of spatial-social relationships across geographical regions at multiple levels of network hierarchy: http://www.geovista.psu.edu/GeoSocialApp/. The second tool, GS-EpiViz, takes network statistics relevant to air-borne disease transmission and control and integrates them into appropriate visualization techniques, thereby facilitating the exploration of human interaction network structures to design advanced disease control strategies. This tool also implements agent-based epidemic models to test and evaluate control strategies in a highly interactive and iterative manner. The two tools provide generic frameworks to explore spatial-social relationships at geographical scales, ranging from individual-level to national-level.\nThe research reported here opens a new research area: geo-social visual analytics and achieves a substantial step forward regarding the science and technology of this area.

Extensive strain gage data was collected by embedded strain gages both in the overlay and the underlay, due to tridem dual and tandem dual axle loads in a controlled distribution of wander paths. It provided new data and information, which has been used in this work to develop a concrete overlay pavement model in a manner that was not done before.\nA semi-analytical model was conducted in this thesis to simulate dynamic behavior, specifically designed for airfield concrete overlay pavements, with consideration of multi-axle moving loads. Within the concrete overlay pavement model, interface condition is important to define. The interface conditions, from fully bonded to fully unbonded conditions, have a significant influence on dynamic responses of the pavement system, especially for the overlay and the underlay, and may also affect the corresponding performance and serviceability of pavement. . By using Ks, the shear reaction modulus, the interlayer could be seen virtually with its function remaining such that its shear stress could be obtained by multiplying Ks by relative displacement between overlay and underlay. All the bonding conditions could be described by relative displacement; when there is no relative displacement, the shear stress between the overlay and the underlay is also zero, which represents the unbonded condition. The fully bonded condition and partially bonded condition have similar mechanism. Characterization of load is another important factor affecting dynamic responses, so the loads were simulated as uniform constant pressure and harmonic load, respectively. In addition, the viscosity property of pavement layers below the underlay was considered in the model.\nGoverning equations were compiled for overlay and underlay from equilibrium relations. To get an analytical solution, Fourier Transform was performed. The closed-form of Inverse Fourier Transform seldom works out for complex kernel functions. Alternatively, one of the numerical methods, self-adaptive numerical integration algorithm, was tried and successfully worked for the final result, and reached agreement with examples in the literature. Then the model was verified with embedded strain gage data, after parameter study of Ks, harmonic load frequency and viscosity, and strain calculated by the model showed characteristics of strain history very clearly. The analytical model is effective and with good performance, which is much faster than numerical modeling. However, the particular analytical model in this thesis can only fit for a pavement system whose geometric shape is infinite plates.

Increasing the response of the cells to low-dose IFNg potentiates the antiviral response. In this study, I hypothesized that atRA regulates IRF-1 through multiple mechanisms, which include 1) potentiation of interferon (IFN)g signaling, thus inducing IRF-1, 2) regulation of IRF-1 transcription and localization in the absence of IFNg.\nIn the human lung epithelial cell line, A549, pretreatment with atRA followed by low-dose IFNg induced a faster, higher, and more stable expression of IRF-1 than IFNg alone. Through the function of a receptor of atRA, retinoic acid receptor-a (RARa), atRA sequentially increased surface expression of IFNg receptor (IFNGR)-1, activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1, and expression of IRF-1. atRA pretreatment also affected the transcriptional functions of IFNg-induced IRF-1, increasing its nuclear localization, DNA-binding activity, and the transcription of IRF-1 target genes. \nThe human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A, was used to investigate the effect of atRA on IRF-1 in the absence of IFNg. atRA by itself rapidly induced IRF-1 mRNA and protein. Sequential treatments with atRA induced almost the same level of IRF-1 as the single dose; however, more IRF-1 was concentrated in the nucleus. The DNA-binding activity of IRF-1 and transcription of an IRF-1 target gene were also increased. In addition, sequential treatments with atRA increased the levels of RARa and its dimerization partner, retinoid X receptor-a, in the nucleus. \nTherefore, atRA may increase the response of the cells to low-dose IFNg by affecting the IFNg signaling pathway that leads to increased expression and transcriptional functions of IRF-1. Furthermore, atRA by itself increases both expression and nuclear localization of IRF-1, which may be mechanisms by which atRA regulates the death of cancer cells. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that atRA regulates IRF-1 through multiple mechanisms.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6672], "author_name_tesi": "Luo, Xin ", "last_name_ssi": "Luo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross", "John Elliot Beard", "Keith R Martin", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Michael Teng", "Richard John Frisque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross, Committee Chair", "John Elliot Beard, Committee Member", "Keith R Martin, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Michael Teng, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vitamin A", "IRF-1"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Bundling and Nonlinear Pricing in Telecommunications", "id": "18312", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8772", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of three chapters. \n\nChapter 1: Nonlinear Pricing with Product Customization\n\nThis paper proposes a method to incorporate product customization and unobserved heterogeneity in structural analysis of nonlinear pricing data. My model is adapted from Maskin and Riley (1984). In equilibrium, average price per unit decreases with an index of quality/quantity, which aggregates observed attributes and unobserved heterogeneity of the product. I study the identification of the aggregation parameters and tariff function from data on payments and consumption quantities. My novel aggregation method leads to a problem reminiscent of transformation models. I then exploit both the firm's and consumer's first-order conditions to identify the model primitives, which are the consumer's utility function, taste distribution, distribution of product unobserved heterogeneity and firm's cost function. I also develop a semiparametric estimation method to recover these primitives. The estimation method is applied to data from a major mobile service provider in Asia. My empirical results support the model. Counterfactual experiments show that, with the same level of complexity, incremental discounts seem to be more preferable as it better approximates the second-best, leading to higher firm profit and consumer surplus relative to all-units discounts and quantity forcing. \n\nChapter 2: Multiproduct Nonlinear Pricing: Mobile Voice Service and SMS, with I. Perrigne and Q. Vuong\n\nThis paper studies multiproduct nonlinear pricing in the cellular phone industry with voice and message services. The model derives from Armstrong (1996) in which the unknown types of consumers are aggregated while the firm designs an optimal cost-based tariff. As usual in multidimensional screening problems, there is pooling at equilibrium. Moreover, given that the consumers add a large number of unobserved extra features, we introduce two terms of unobserved heterogeneity for voice and message add-ons. The model defines two one-to-one mappings between the unknown aggregate type to the cost and the cost to the payment. We then study the identification of the model primitives. Under some identifying assumptions such as a parameterization of the cost function, we show that the primitives of the model (the aggregate type density, the indirect utility and the joint density of unobserved heterogeneity) are identified from observables. The empirical results support the model and display an important heterogeneity in types and unobserved heterogeneity. The cost of asymmetric information for the firm is assessed.\n\nChapter 3: Bundling and Nonlinear Pricing in Telecommunications \n\nThis paper studies bundling and price discrimination by a multiproduct firm selling internet and phone services in an imperfect information setting. I derive the optimal selling mechanism, and provide primitive conditions under which different bundling strategies arise, such as component pricing, pure bundling, semi-mixed bundling and mixed bundling. I show that the model structure is nonparametrically identified. I then propose a three-step semiparametric estimation procedure involving a new regression spline estimator under both monotonicity and bound restrictions. An illustration on China Telecom data shows that mixed bundling is beneficial to both the firm and the consumer relative to component pricing.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8622], "author_name_tesi": "Luo, Yao ", "last_name_ssi": "Luo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Isabelle Perrigne", "Paul L E Grieco", "Jonathan W Eaton", "Fenghua Song", "Quang Vuong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Isabelle Perrigne, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul L E Grieco, Committee Chair", "Jonathan W Eaton, Committee Member", "Fenghua Song, Committee Member", "Quang Vuong, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bundling", "Nonlinear Pricing", "Telecommunications", "Multidimensional Screening", "Asymmetric Information"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF H2-PRODUCING BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES   FROM HEAT-TREATED SOIL AND ISOLATION OF DOMINANT CLOSTRIDIUM SPP.\n", "id": "7868", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6776", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    Hydrogen is an attractive alternative to conventional fossil fuels.  Currently most hydrogen is produced from nonrenewable natural gas, oil and coal. However, from the perspectives of economics and environmental quality, hydrogen production from renewable resources is gaining more and more attention. Biohydrogen production from the fermentation of wastewater containing carbohydrates is one approach for exploiting renewable resources. Much literature has been published on the effects of external factors such as substrate concentration, temperature, pH, etc. on hydrogen production by pure cultures or defined mixed cultures. However, only a few studies have been conducted on the effects of these external factors on H2-producing microbial communities from uncharacterized, mixed inocula. The objectives of this research were threefold:  to determine the effect of glucose concentration on H2-producing bacterial community composition in the fermentation of synthetic wastewater; to determine the effect of L-cysteine and successive transfer on H2 producing bacterial community composition in batch cultures; and to isolate and characterize a new strain of H2-producing Clostridium spp. from mixed soil inocula using L-cysteine as reducing agent. In the first study, a continuous flow bioreactor was continuously fed with synthetic wastewater for periods of 7-14 days. Heat-treated soil was introduced into the reactor as a mixed inoculum and L-cysteine was added to a final concentration of 0.5g/L as reducing agent. PCR-based ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer analysis (RISA) was used to characterize the bacterial community composition in the bioreactor. It was revealed that RISA profiles of bacterial communities grown in media with 5.0, 7.5 or 10g/L glucose yielded partial 16S rRNA sequences most related to Clostridium spp. In contrast, RISA profiles of cultures grown in 2.5 g/L glucose yielded more diverse DNA sequences. The lowest glucose concentration gave rise to sequences representing two bacterial families, Clostridiaceae and Acidaminococcaeae, in the low G+C Gram-positive Firmicutes division, and one family, Enterobacteraceae in the gamma Proteobacteria division. Using an oligonucleotide probe \u00a1\u00b0LYHI\u00a1\u00b1, complementary to rRNA of an isolate obtained from the reactor containing 10 g/L glucose, it was shown that about 90% percent of the bacterial cells in microscope fields from bioreactor samples at 10 g/L glucose hybridized with the LYH1 probe. In samples from the bioreactor fed with 2.5 g/L glucose, only 26% of bacterial cells hybridized to LYH1 probe. These results further confirmed the effect of glucose on the composition of bacterial communities as judged by RISA. In the second study, batch experiments were carried out with the same nutrient levels used in  the continuous flow bioreactor. Regardless of the glucose concentration and number of serial transfers, RISA profiles of bacterial communities grown without L-cysteine yielded partial 16S rRNA sequences closely related to Enterobacteriaceae. In contrast, RISA profiles of batch cultures with L-cysteine yielded results similar to those observed with the continuous flow bioreactor, which indicated that 5g/L appeared to be the lowest favorable glucose concentration for the successful competition of Clostridium spp. over other bacterial species. L-cysteine could have affected the composition of bacterial communities in batch experiments either due to its function as a quick oxygen scavenger or its role as a spore germinant. In the third study, a new Clostridium sp. strain LYH2 was isolated from a silty clay loam soil using L-cysteine as a reducing agent in the growth medium. Closest cultured relatives of strain LYH2 were Clostridium acidisoli, Clostridium akagii and Clostridium pasteurianum. This dissertation showed that heat-treated soil provided a useful source of Clostridium spp. for producing biohydrogen from renewable wastes, and that glucose concentrations greater than 5g/L and L-cysteine enhanced their growth and H2 production.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6774], "author_name_tesi": "Luo, Yonghua ", "last_name_ssi": "Luo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yonghua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maryann Victoria Bruns", "John Michael Regan", "David Robert Huff", "Hangsheng Lin", "Curtis James Dell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Chair", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "David Robert Huff, Committee Member", "Hangsheng Lin, Committee Member", "Curtis James Dell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Biohydrogen production", "bacterial community", "H2-producing Clostridium spp.", "L-cysteine", "RISA", "16S rRNA"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Understanding Information Workers' Sedentary Behavior Through a Desktop-Based Break Prompting System", "id": "13877ypl5142", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13877", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Prolonged sedentary behavior is detrimental to long-term health.

With Time for Break, people can set their desired work duration, and receive the prompt of taking standing or moving breaks in-between. I conducted a three-week deployment study (N = 25) to collect participants\u2019 work and break habit with Time for Break, and semi-structured interviews to understand their experience.

This kill zone was spatially heterogeneous, varying in soil pH, moisture, sulfur, and thickness of the surface layer of AMD precipitates. Treatments of lime only, lime and 27 Mg/ha compost, and lime and 54 Mg/ha compost (comprised of food waste, landscape debris, and animal waste) were applied to duplicate plots in each of three blocks designated red, orange, and gray respectively.

One of the features of many stealth aircraft is an integrated engine that is mounted above the aircraft fuselage.  The engine nozzle is often rectangular with a high aspect ratio, and exhausts onto a jet deck formed by the aircraft fuselage.  This configuration allows the aircraft fuselage to shield the noise and other detectable features caused by the engine from the ground.  The Northrop Grumman B2 Bomber is perhaps the most well-known example of this configuration.  Additionally, stealth technology combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) has led to the Joint Unmanned Combat System project, or J-UCAS.  Both of the aircraft in development in this project use a wall-bounded high aspect ratio nozzle for stealth purposes.  While these engine configurations provide a low radar profile and reduce the noise levels on the ground, they do introduce additional considerations.  Since the engine is mounted above the aircraft, the nozzle jet is wall bounded by the fuselage of the aircraft.  This is known as the flight deck.  The jet stream exiting the nozzle can travel at supersonic speeds and potentially generates shock or expansion waves that impinge on the surface of the deck.  The oscillations of these shockwaves on the deck produce localized unsteady forces acting on the aircraft.  In addition, the interaction between the high speed jet stream and the slower ambient air causes a shear layer to form from the trailing edge of the nozzle.  Turbulent eddies form and increase in size as they move downstream.  The interactions of the shear layer with the flight deck produce additional unsteady forces on the aircraft.  This thesis presents a study to predict the forces on a flight deck caused by a high aspect ratio wall bounded nozzle using both experimental methods and numerical simulations.\n\nThe experiments performed were conducted on two different nozzles with aspect ratios of 4-1 and 8-1.  Several different run conditions, including subsonic, over-expanded, on-design, and under-expanded, are included to study the effects of Mach number on the unsteady pressure.  An aluminum flat plate is used to represent the aft deck.  The plate is instrumented with Endevco pressure transducers to capture the fluctuating pressure on the aft deck.  A spectral analysis performed on the individual sensors shows that the primary sources of fluctuating pressure are the shear layer along with shock-boundary layer interaction.

Kaolinite and bauxite ores doped with varying concentrations of K2O and Fe2O3 were sintered at different temperatures to elucidate composition-processing-property relationships.

Conventional biochemical techniques on this and other cofactors require the destruction of cells and therefore the morphological context is lost. Here, we used integrated, non-invasive microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to quantify the concentration and molecular conformation (i.e., free versus enzyme-bound) of natural flavins as a function of cell pathology. In these studies, we used metastatic breast cancer (Hs578T) and normal (Hs578Bst) cells as a model system. These cells exhibited distinct morphological differences, as revealed by confocal microscopy, such as perinuclear crowding of mitochondria in transformed cells due to variation in calcium signaling and apoptotic pathways. Prior to converting intensity images of natural flavins, it was essential to quantify the variation of their fluorescence quantum yield in cellular environment using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) in a calibrated microscope. These measurements, and simple image processing, indicated that the natural flavin concentrations in the normal breast cells (144 \u00b1 38 &#956;M) were significantly larger than in their transformed counterpart (21 \u00b1 10 &#956;M). In addition, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence polarization anisotropy measurements, the first to our knowledge at this spectral window, indicated a restrictive environment and mostly protein-bound flavins. As a control, these cellular flavin autofluorescence were compared with free FAD in solution along with a representative flavoprotein (namely, LipDH) that exists in abundance in cells. To examine the sensitivity of our experimental approaches and universality of our findings, preliminary studies were carried out on the non-metastatic breast cancer cells (MCF7) and normal counterpart (MCF10A) as complementary models. These preliminary studies will open the door for using molecular dynamics imaging of natural cofactors as biomarkers for energy metabolism and health problems that are related to mitochondrial anomalies such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cancer, diabetes, and other neurodegenerative diseases.

A key feature of this response is production of type I interferons (IFNs) which induce an antiviral and anti-proliferative state in the cells.  This process requires activation of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) and interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3). It has been reported that paramyxovirus infection can activate expression of cytokines such as IFN-&#946;, a type I IFN. However, the mechanism of the activation by virus is not well understood. The cytoplasmic viral sensors, the RNA helicases, RIG-I or MDA5, play critical roles in induction of interferon signaling through detection of specific viral components in the infected cells.  However, the origin and molecular identity of these viral RNA ligands is not well characterized. Intriguingly, viruses have strategies to evade this host defense response.  This interplay between innate immunity and virus infections, is not only crucial to understand virus-host relationships, but also may lead to development of novel antiviral therapeutics. \n\nIn this work, we have studied the activation and modulation of innate immune responses by viruses, focusing on the NF-&#954;B and the interferon signaling pathways using parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), a prototypical paramyxovirus as our model system. Paramyxoviruses are enveloped nonsegmented negative stranded (NNS) RNA viruses that include many important human and animal pathogens. PIV5 is a poor inducer of the antiviral responses. However, a recombinant PIV5 lacking the conserved region of the V protein (rPIV5V&#916;C) activates expression of cytokines IFN-&#946; and IL-6 through a NF-&#954;B dependent pathway. \n\n   We investigated the role of viral proteins in this activation and determined that the  large (L) polymerase protein of PIV5 can activate NF-&#954;B leading to activation of IFN-&#946; and IL-6. The L protein of PIV5 is the main component of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and is about 250 kDa. It contains six domains that are conserved among all NNS RNA viruses. We analyzed the mechanism of the activation of NF-&#954;B by the L protein and found that AKT1, a serine/threonine kinase plays a critical role in activation of NF-&#954;B by L. We found that the L protein interacts with AKT1 and enhances its phosphorylation. We further mapped the region within the L that is sufficient to activate NF-&#954;B to domain II and discovered its role in activation of IFN-&#946;. Surprisingly, we found that the RNA transcribed from domain II of the L gene is sufficient to activate NF-&#954;B in an AKT independent pathway and can also induce interferon expression. We have further evaluated the mechanism of this activation and have determined that this viral RNA activates IFN-&#946; through MDA5 and endoribonuclease, RNase L dependent pathway. \n\n\tOur study has revealed novel roles of the L gene in the host signaling pathways. Our work is the first report identifying a natural ligand for MDA5 that can induce interferon expression and can serve as a possible prototype for the development of broad antiviral therapeutics.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4989], "author_name_tesi": "Luthra, Priya ", "last_name_ssi": "Luthra", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Priya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Biao He", "Biao He", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Avery August", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Katsuhiko Murakami"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Biao He, Dissertation Advisor", "Biao He, Committee Chair", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Katsuhiko Murakami, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["paramyxoviruses", "PIV5", "Large protein", "NF-&#954;B", "AKT", "interferon", "MDA5", "RNase L"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Seismic Investigation of Sediments Beneath Antarctic Ice Streams", "id": "13579tyl5106", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13579", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An accurate knowledge of the subglacial system is key in elucidating the mechanisms of ice stream motion and overall mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Ice streams, owing to their geometry and low surface slopes, generate really low driving stress, thus typically require an extensive deformable subglacial sediment layer to allow fast flow conditions. This thin layer of sediment is highly sensitive to subglacial water pressure, which, if reduced, can dramatically alter the flow dynamics of ice streams. The flow regime of Whillans Ice Stream and Kamb Ice Stream highlight these basal conditions. Kamb Ice Stream stagnated about 150 years ago while current observations of the Whillans Ice Stream show that the ice stream is decelerating in the past few decades. Both attribute their current flow conditions to the presence of areas of high basal drag or the so-called \u2018sticky spots\u2019, which inhibit fast ice stream flow. This subglacial interface is highly influenced by the sediment porosity, fluid pressure, and water content which ultimately defines its overall strength in restricting the ice-stream flow. In this thesis, I employ the seismic amplitude analysis technique to study the subglacial interface of these two ice streams. The seismic amplitude analysis provides an insight into the subglacial regimes of ice stream flow in Antarctica. The knowledge about this subglacial interface and ground truthing of bed conditions is essential for the ice sheet models and discerning ice dynamics to understand the future evolution of these ice streams.

The theoretical framework of feminist poststructuralism informed this study, which emphasizes the role of discourse and power relations in the construction of identity.  An aim of this study was to uncover the visible and invisible influences of gender as a social structure in respect to workplace experiences and career decisions in nursing.  Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eleven female registered nurses who had serious intentions of leaving the nursing profession.  \nFive major themes emerged from the data: feelings of duty and obligation; the power distribution in the hierarchy; growing incongruity between working conditions and patient care; interpersonal communication; and shifting perspectives on work and self.  The findings suggest that gender role socialization was an influence on career entry into nursing which was related in some ways to the decision to leave nursing.  The participants felt unable to provide adequate nursing care, and the inability to do so was found to influence their decision to leave nursing.  Additionally, the participants perceived that they were at the \u201cbottom\u201d of the hierarchy.  They also perceived that they had few opportunities for advancement and did not have access to power structures, which contributed to a lack of voice.  The decision to leave was not easy for most of the participants, partially because their identity as a nurse was closely aligned with their personal identity.  Several of the participants wanted to leave nursing to find passion in their work, which speaks to a need to reconceptualize the relationship between work and individual subjectivity. Thus, this study supports the feminist poststructural notion that social structures, such as gender, do affect identity development in respect to career decisions and work experiences.  Based on the findings of this study, suggestions are offered both for further research and nursing education in an effort to potentially influence recruitment, practice, and retention in a profession that is already experiencing a shortage of workers.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5663], "author_name_tesi": "Lutter, Stacy Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Lutter", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Stacy", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Edward W Taylor", "Judith E Hupcey", "Samuel William Monismith", "Gary Kuhne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Dissertation Advisor", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Chair", "Edward W Taylor, Committee Member", "Judith E Hupcey, Committee Member", "Samuel William Monismith, Committee Member", "Gary Kuhne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["intentions to leave", "gender", "poststructural feminism", "registered nurse", "nursing shortage"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "OPTIMIZATION OF AN ALGINATE BASED EDIBLE COATING WITH BEESWAX, NISIN AND EDTA TO MAXIMIZE SHELF LIFE                                    OF FRESH MUSHROOMS (Agaricus bisporus)\n", "id": "12589", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "518", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fresh white button mushroom (Agaricus Bisporus) is a highly perishable crop with limited shelf life.

The reasons animals disperse can be separated into two categories: proximate and ultimate causes. Proximate causes provide cues for dispersal to occur and can influence the characteristics of the dispersal event. Ultimate causes of dispersal refer to the evolutionary advantages of dispersal and why dispersal persists on the population level. Documenting an organism\u2019s dispersal behavior and identifying factors that influence that behavior are crucial not only to understanding the basic ecology of a species, but also for providing critical information for the conservation and management of that species. Although dispersal is an important component of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) ecology and management, it remains understudied and most analysis has focused on the dispersal of males. I investigated dispersal behavior patterns in female white-tailed deer to better understand proximate and ultimate causes of dispersal.\n\nProximate cues influence important features of dispersal behavior, including when dispersal occurs, how long it lasts, and the direction, straightness, and distance of the dispersal path. I tracked 229 radiomarked (VHF collars, n = 204; GPS collars, n = 25) juvenile female white-tailed deer in 4 study areas in Pennsylvania to evaluate dispersal behavior and to determine proximate cues that influence dispersal. I observed dispersal in all 4 study areas, with an overall dispersal rate of 11.8%. Female dispersal largely occurred at 1 year of age with an average dispersal date of 6 June, which coincides with the fawning season. Dispersal paths varied, but were generally non-linear (average straightness = 0.579), long distanced (average dispersal distance = 18.0 km), and prolonged (average duration = 355 hrs). Physical landscape features (i.e., roadways, rivers, residential areas) were important influences on changing dispersal path direction and influencing where dispersal terminated, however topography did not influence dispersal direction. Additionally, forays outside the natal range that did not result in dispersal were recorded in 52% of GPS-collared deer during the dispersal period. Our results suggest that dispersal behavior in female deer is influenced by both intra-specific social interactions, particularly during the fawning season, and physical landscape features. \n\nThe characteristics of dispersal behavior can provide insight into the ultimate causes and evolutionary strategies of dispersal. Hypotheses for the ultimate cause of dispersal suggest it is a beneficial strategy for the disperser because it reduces competition for local resources, reduces competition for breeding partners, and reduces the potential for inbreeding. Dispersal behavior in white-tailed deer predominantly occurs in 1-year-old males; however, females of the same age also disperse. The timing of female dispersal during fawning season and low dispersal rates suggest that competition for mates and reduced inbreeding are not ultimate causes of female dispersal, as suggested for males. I proposed that female dispersal is the result of competition for space when pregnant females seek to isolate themselves before and after parturition. To test this hypothesis, I conducted a meta-analysis of female dispersal rates from 12 populations of white-tailed deer and predicted dispersal rate and distance were positively related to deer density. I found a positive relationship between dispersal rate and deer per forested km2 and between dispersal distance and deer per forested km2. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that female dispersal is density dependent and caused by the exclusion of subordinate 1-year-olds as adult females seek isolation before and after parturition. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11406], "author_name_tesi": "Lutz, Clayton Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Lutz", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Clayton", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach", "C Paola Ferreri", "Michael John Sheriff", "Christopher S Rosenberry", "Michael Gerard Messina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach, Thesis Advisor", "C Paola Ferreri, Thesis Advisor", "Michael John Sheriff, Thesis Advisor", "Christopher S Rosenberry, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Gerard Messina, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["barriers", "chronic wasting disease", "disease spread", "dispersal", "foray", "movement", "Odocoileus virginianus", "Pennsylvania", "proximate causes", "ultimate causes", "white-tailed deer"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Positional and directional repair of O6-alkylguanine lesions by human O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase", "id": "6576", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3642", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Human O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltranserase (AGT) is a widely expressed DNA repair protein present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. AGT repairs O6-alkylguanine adducts in DNA via a stoichiometric reaction that transfers the alkyl group onto an internal cysteine residue of the protein. This irreversible reaction inactivates AGT and de novo protein synthesis is required to produce more active protein. AGT protects normal cells from the mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of alkylation, but overexpression of AGT by cancer cells confers resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. The development of AGT inhibitors may prove useful in enhancing cancer chemotherapy.\n\n \nO6-Benzylguanine (b6G) is a potent inactivator of AGT. We showed that a single-stranded (ss) 7-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) containing multiple b6G can inhibit AGT activity in vitro. The protein is more efficient at reacting with b6G residues positioned near the 5'-end compared to those positioned near the 3'-end. In vivo, oligos containing single or multiple b6G can also sensitize HT29 cells to killing by BCNU. The position of b6G in an oligo may confer some protection from serum nucleases as oligos with b6G near the 5'- or 3'-end tend to have a longer half-life. \n\n\nStudies done with 16-mer oligos containing O6-methylguanine (m6G) at different positions also showed a trend in which there is an increase in the ED50 values for AGT inactivation with methylated lesions located towards the extreme 3'-end of the oligo. The ED50 values for the 16-mers with m6G positioned at the second, sixth, and eleventh nucleotide from the 5'-end were between 9-13 nM for wild type AGT. However, the ED50 values for the 16-mers with m6G positioned at the fourteenth and fifteenth nucleotide from the 5'-end were 57 nM and >50 microM, respectively. AGT repaired adducts at all positions equally well in duplex 16-mer oligos except those at positions 2 and 15. These results suggest that AGT recognizes the polarity in DNA and requires a minimum of four nucleotides 3' of an m6G lesion in order to productively bind and efficiently repair that lesion. \n\n\nThe preference for AGT to repair 5'-end lesions in short oligos suggested that AGT may bind DNA in an oriented manner and scans directionally (3' to 5') to identify and repair O6-alkylguanine lesions. Using a single-stranded 70-mer oligo with an m6G lesion near either end, we confirmed that AGT preferentially (3.5 fold) repaired the 5'-end m6G lesion than the 3'-end lesion. However, this preference was not apparent in double-stranded oligos.\n\n\nA streptavidin/biotin-dT block was inserted between the two m6G lesions in the 70-mer oligo to impede the action of AGT. Compared to the appropriate controls, a streptavidin/biotin-dT block proximal to the 5'-end m6G in a single-stranded oligo decreased the repair of that lesion by about 2.6 fold while the repair of the 3'-end m6G was unaffected. A block distal to the 5'-end m6G decreased the repair of the 5'-end m6G to a lesser extent (1.7 fold) than the proximal block, while the repair of the 3'-end m6G was decreased by 1.6 fold. Similar results were obtained using double-stranded substrates. In summary, AGT preferentially repaired 5'-end m6G lesions and a streptavidin/biotin-dT block affected the repair of the 5'-end m6G more than the 3'-end lesion, supporting a model for AGT to move 3' to 5' along DNA. These findings provide new insights into how AGT repairs O6-alkylguanine lesions in an oligo context for the purpose of rational drug design of novel AGT inhibitors.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3622], "author_name_tesi": "Luu, Kieu ", "last_name_ssi": "Luu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kieu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony Edward Pegg", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Robert G Levenson", "Charles D Smith", "Lisa M Shantz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony Edward Pegg, Committee Chair", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member", "Charles D Smith, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DNA repair", "AGT", "alkyltransferase", "alkylation", "chemotherapy resistance", "O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "A large-scale approach to K-homology\n", "id": "6773", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6418", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<p>To any coarse space <i>X</i>, one can associate a <i>C</i><sup>*</sup>-algebra <i>C</i><sup>*</sup>(<i>X</i>), called the <i>Roe algebra</i> of <i>X</i>.

The annual medical cost of fractures caused by osteoporosis in the US is estimated to be $18 billion and is likely to rise with the growing elderly population. Adequate daily dietary calcium and vitamin D intake is important to reduce the risk of osteoporosis.  The calcium intake of Chinese Americans in the U.S. is well below the Dietary Reference Intake, which increases their risk of osteoporosis and women are more at risk than men.  The objective of our research was to collect information on how Chinese Americans use dairy products within their family food system and then to use this information in designing a nutrition education intervention to increase Chinese American women\u2019s dietary calcium and vitamin D intake.  \n\nTo accomplish this objective, three studies were conducted with Chinese American populations mainly in the Philadelphia area.  In the first study, 8 focus groups, stratified by sex and marital status, were conducted in each of three PA cities to investigate factors within these strata that influenced dairy product consumption.  Analysis indicated that participants\u2019 evaluated dairy products based on specific characteristics and that family dietary patterns affected their choices.  In the second study, interviews were conducted with 20 Chinese American couples in each of these three PA cities to collect information on the Chinese American family food system and family use of dairy products.  These couples were recruited from weekend Chinese schools, because these schools, where parents enroll their children to maintain Chinese language skills, provide access to Chinese American families.  Analysis indicated that parents used roles, rules and power to balance family member food preferences and maintain the traditional Chinese meal pattern.\n\nIn the final step, using the information gathered in the two previous studies, a nutrition education intervention, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, was designed for peri- and menopausal married Chinese American women.  Intervention impact was then evaluated using a quasi-experimental study with a nested design and pre, immediate post, and 3-month follow-up assessments.  Six Chinese schools in the Philadelphia area were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n= 3) or the control group (n=3) so each group contained about 70 women.  The experimental group received a heel scan and six weekly interactive lessons.  The control group received six weekly non-related financial lessons by mail.  Results of repeated assessments showed that women in the experimental group significantly increased their daily dietary calcium and vitamin D intake, knowledge, and stage of change for consuming dairy products, compared to the control group at post assessments.  Their attitudes towards, perceived behavioral control over, and intention of consuming calcium-rich foods were also improved compared to the control group at post assessments.   \n\nThis research is the first to investigate the family food system and use a nutrition intervention to increase calcium and vitamin D intake of first generation Chinese Americans.  The intervention could be used by educators to reduce the risk of osteoporosis in Chinese American women.  The couple interviews shed light on the Chinese American food system.  Results of both the focus groups and the couple interviews are useful to nutrition educators who hope to change the food choices of Chinese Americans.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4673], "author_name_tesi": "Lv, Nan ", "last_name_ssi": "Lv", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Juanita Lynne Brown", "Lynne Brown", "Audrey Neff Maretzki", "Robert F Roberts", "Dr Carla K Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Juanita Lynne Brown, Dissertation Advisor", "Lynne Brown, Committee Chair", "Audrey Neff Maretzki, Committee Member", "Robert F Roberts, Committee Member", "Dr Carla K Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Calcium", "Osteoporosis", "Nutrition Education", "Chinese American", "Food Preferences", "Dairy Products"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Essays in Applied Microeconomics\n", "id": "12152", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5841", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "CHAPTER 1 (with Joris Pinkse, Margaret Slade, and John Van Reenen): Spillovers in Space: Does Geography Matter?\n\nWe simultaneously assess the contributions to productivity of three sources of research and development spillovers: geographic, technology and product--market proximity. To do this, we construct a new measure of geographic proximity that is based on the distribution of a firm's inventor locations rather than its headquarters, and we report both parametric and semiparametric estimates of our geographic--distance functions. We find that: i) Geographic space matters even after conditioning on horizontal and technological spillovers; ii) Technological proximity matters; iii) Product--market proximity is less important; iv) Locations of researchers are more important than headquarters but both have explanatory power; and v) Geographic markets are very local.\n\nCHAPTER 2: Spillovers, Absorptive Capacity and Agglomeration.\n\nI study knowledge spillovers in an industry where firms are mobile and heterogeneous in their ability to adopt outside knowledge (absorptive capacity). I develop a static model of industry agglomeration where, in equilibrium, the force of attraction induced by spillovers is counteracted by the force of repulsion created by local competition. The model is applied to a sample of the US software firms. I estimate the structural parameters of the model and obtain the following results: i) The data are consistent with highly localized knowledge spillovers; ii) The attraction force induced by spillovers creates a significant sorting pattern placing firms with higher absorptive capacity in more agglomerated counties; iii) Ignoring firm heterogeneity in absorptive capacity leads to substantially biased estimates of gains from spillovers in policy experiments.\n\nCHAPTER 3 (with Sanghamitra Das, Kala Krishna, and Rohini Somanathan): Back on the Rails: Competition and Productivity in State-owned Industry.\n\nWe use a proprietary data set on the floor-level operations at the Bhilai Rail and Structural Mill (RSM) in India to understand how output rose sharply in response to competitive pressures.

One key component to understanding adolescent risk-taking is knowledge of normative brain development. Brain-based models of adolescent risk-taking have provided insight into the increases in risk-taking observed during adolescence by considering an adolescent-specific organization of brain circuitries associated with sensation-seeking and impulsivity. While these models have increased our understanding of the role of normative brain development in adolescent risk-taking, a number of critiques of these models have emerged in recent years. These include a lack of consideration of biopsychosocial context alongside normative brain development, a limited view of the role for self-control in risk-taking, and a lack of consideration of between-person differences.\n\nThree studies were undertaken to address critiques of brain-based models of adolescent risk-taking. Study 1 used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health to examine age-varying associations between sensation-seeking, impulse control, and cigarette smoking through adolescence into young adulthood. Study 2 examined the behavior and blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity in oculomotor control and incentive processing regions of children, adolescents, and adults during an incentivized oculomotor task to examine the sensitivity of sensation-seekers' cognitive control performance to monetary incentives. Study 3 examined the between-network connectivity of three large-scale brain networks involved in cognitive control during resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nFindings from this dissertation suggest that the positive association between sensation-seeking and cigarette-smoking is particularly strong during adolescence (prior to age 20 years) relative to during young adulthood. Alongside this increased vulnerability to engage in risky behaviors, sensation-seekers' resting state networks were characterized by patterns of functioning that have been previously associated with limitations in cognitive control. These potential limitations in cognitive control in sensation-seekers, however, may be context-specific, with sensation-seekers' sensitivity to rewards rendering them amenable to increases in cognitive control accuracy when monetary incentives are available.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15488], "author_name_tesi": "Lydon, David M", "last_name_ssi": "Lydon", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Geier", "Charles Geier", "Lisa Michelle Kopp", "Nilam Ram", "Stephen Jeffrey Wilson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Geier, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles Geier, Committee Chair", "Lisa Michelle Kopp, Committee Member", "Nilam Ram, Committee Member", "Stephen Jeffrey Wilson, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adolescence", "sensation-seeking", "risk-taking"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The perceived causal structure of cigarette addiction among a sample of late adolescent smokers and non-smokers: a network comparison study", "id": "21111", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9691", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research has highlighted the roles of smoking beliefs in predicting smoking-related behaviors during adolescence.

Separate networks were also created for responses at time 1 and time 2 for the subsample of participants completing the measure twice. Multidimensional scaling determined the spatial structure of the networks. The analyses resulted in highly consensual and interpretable network diagrams that conveyed the perceived causal structure of cigarette addiction for both smokers and non-smokers. In line with previous examinations of smoking-related beliefs, smokers held more optimistic beliefs about the effects of smoking and cigarette addiction relative to non-smokers. Follow-up t-tests revealed significant differences in the strength of four perceived causal relationships contained in the smoker and non-smoker networks, each indicating more optimistic beliefs about the consequences of smoking behaviors and the experience of peer pressure to smoke in smokers relative to non-smokers. A comparison of the time 1 and time 2 network diagrams revealed highly similar networks suggesting that the network analysis method is moderately reliable.

Instead of perfect competition and two industries\nin the standard model, they assume Bertrand competition in a continuum of industries,\nand argue that the \u201cpathologies\u201d of the standard treatment eliminated. In particular,\nthe equilibrium is typically unique with trade patterns consistent with \u201cnatural\u201d\ncomparative advantage. For high transportation costs, GRH posits a mixed\nstrategy equilibrium in which firms in the country with the comparative advantage\ntargets the world market by posting a pair of discrete prices in one state, and targets\nonly the domestic market in the other state.\nWe first show that there is a profitable deviation to this conjectured equilibrium,\nand propose an alternative. We also provide a formal analysis of the equilibrium\nconfigurations under different transportation costs for a single industry that exhibits\nMarshallian externalities, and demonstrate that when transportation costs are low,\nthe equilibrium is not necessarily unique. The implications are that trade patterns\nneed not be consistent with natural comparative advantage, and, more importantly,\na theoretical basis for industrial policy arises.\n\nChapter 2: Marshallian Externalities, Comparative Advantage, and International Trade (with Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez-Clare)\nThere is strong evidence for the existence of external economies of scale that are\nlimited in their industrial and geographical scope. What are the implications of these\nMarshallian externalities for the patterns of international trade, the welfare gains\nfrom trade, and industrial policy? The standard model in the literature assumes\nthat firms engage in perfect competition and ignore the effect of their actions on\nindustry output and productivity. This has the unfortunate implication that any\nassignment of industries across countries is consistent with equilibrium.\nTo avoid this predicament, we follow Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2010) and\nassume that firms in each industry engage in Bertrand competition and understand\nthe implications of their decisions on industry output and productivity. We develop\nthree main results.\nFirst, we show that the indeterminacy of international trade patterns still persists\nfor some industries when trade costs are low.\nSecond, we apply these results in a full general equilibrium analysis and reexamine\nthe implications of Marshallian externalities for industrial policy. Our results indicate\nthat the additional welfare gains from moving to the Pareto-superior equilibrium\ndepend positively on the strength of Marshallian externalities and negatively on the\nstrength of comparative advantage, and - using reasonable parameter estimates - are\nat most about 2%.\nFinally, our framework allows us to ask whether Marshallian externalities lead\nto additional gains from trade. Our quantitative analysis indicates that this is indeed\nthe case, and that Marshallian externalities increase overall gains from trade\nby around 50%.\n\nChapter 3: Brain Drain, Brain Return and the Role of on-the-Job Learning\nThis paper contributes to the literature on skilled migration by providing an\nalternative framework which examines the welfare effects of skilled emigration on a\nsmall developing country. In particular, we incorporate the fact that some skilled\nemigrants do return to the developing country after acquiring expertise abroad by\nway of on-the-job learning.\nIgnoring return migration in our model yields results consistent with a \u201cbrain\ndrain\u201d for the developing country. Once we account for return migration the results\nare more nuanced. If the cost of return is sufficiently low to attract skilled emigrants\nwith enhanced foreign expertise, then skilled emigration can lead to a \u201cbeneficial\nbrain drain\u201d for the developing country.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7695], "author_name_tesi": "Lyn, Gary Anthony", "last_name_ssi": "Lyn", "middle_name_ssi": "Anthony", "first_name_ssi": "Gary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Clare", "Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Clare", "Stephen Ross Yeaple", "Jonathan W Eaton", "David Gerard Abler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Clare, Dissertation Advisor", "Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Clare, Committee Chair", "Stephen Ross Yeaple, Committee Member", "Jonathan W Eaton, Committee Member", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Marshallian Externalities", "Comparative Advantage", "Skilled Migration"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Collaborative planning for an elementary mathematics methods course in a third space: The role of expertise in a community of practice", "id": "14250cml320", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14250", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines the collaborative planning of a team of school- and university-based teacher educators who co-taught an elementary mathematics methods course in a grades K-4 Professional Development School (PDS). The PDS spans the boundaries between the school and university creating a third space for hybrid teacher educators (Martin, Snow, & Franklin Torrez, 2011). The team of four hybrid teacher educators formed a Methods Planning Community of Practice (MPCoP). This study focused on the MPCoP\u2019s collaborative planning of elementary mathematics methods courses to prepare beginning teachers to select and adapt mathematical tasks. I conducted a domain analysis (Spradley, 1979) to identify and describe the MPCoP\u2019s general co-planning activities (establishing goals, general brainstorming, and determining instructional details). Using the construct of boundary objects (Star, 1989) and theoretical perspectives from communities of practice (Wenger, 1998), I examined areas of expertise that influenced the MPCoP\u2019s joint enterprise. Data was collected during Fall 2015 and consisted of audio recordings of four of the MPCoP\u2019s co-planning sessions (80-85 minutes each), researcher notes, the MPCoP\u2019s planning documents, individual background interviews, 16 semi-structured interviews (4 with each teacher educator), 2 semi-structured group interviews, and artifacts from the interviews. The MPCoP, operating without a guiding protocol, spent the majority of its time determining the instructional details for methods course experiences.

These UHSLA cast steels have both ultrahigh strength levels and good impact toughness.  The influence of heat treatment, secondary processing using hot isostatic processing (HIP), and chemical composition on the microstructure and properties of UHSLA cast steels have been evaluated.  The extent of microsegregation reduction expected during the heat treatment of UHSLA cast steels has also been estimated by diffusion modeling.  This new family of UHSLA cast steels is similar in composition and properties to UHSLA wrought steels.  However, the heat treatment and secondary processing of the UHSLA cast steels is used to develop microstructures and properties typically developed through thermomechanical processing and heat treatment for wrought UHSLA steels. \nTwo martensitic UHSLA steels, 4340+ (silicon modified 4340) and ES-1 were investigated for this study.  For the 4340+ alloy, heat treatment variables evaluated include homogenization temperature and time, tempering temperature, and austempering temperature and time.  For the ES-1 alloy, heat treatment variables evaluated include homogenization temperature and time, austenization temperature, cryogenic treatment, and tempering temperature.  The effect of high temperature hot isostatic processing (HIP) on the 4340+ and ES-1 alloys was also investigated.  Tensile properties, charpy v-notch impact toughness (CVN), microstructures, and fractographs have all been characterized after heat treatment.  The effects of HIP on microporosity reduction in the ES-1 alloy were also investigated.    \nThe experiments carried out on the investment cast 4340+ alloy have shown that increasing the homogenization temperature can increase CVN without changing the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) or yield strength (YS) of the cast material.  By replacing the homogenization step in the conventional heat treatment process with a high temperature HIP treatment, both the CVN and ductility of the alloy was found to increase while maintaining comparable ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS) levels as compared to the original homogenization treatment.  Austempering the (IC) 4340+ material led to a significant increase in CVN and ductility at the expense of UTS and yield strength as the primarily martensitic microstructure was converted to a mixed martensitic-bainitic structure.  \nExcellent impact and tensile properties were possible with vacuum degassed ES-1 cast ingot material when the material was subject to a high temperature HIP homogenization cycle prior to heat treatment.  A high temperature HIP homogenization cycle following by a second high temperature homogenization cycle, high temperature austenization cycle, and a low temperature tempering step had the potential to produce cast ES-1 ingot material with 40 ft-lbs. of CVN impact toughness at -40\u00b0F while possessing 15% elongation, yield strength > 190 ksi., and an ultimate tensile strength of  > 250 ksi.  The impact transition behavior of this material showed evidence of the excellent impact toughness exhibited by the material across a wide range of temperatures (-100\u00b0F to +212\u00b0F).  The lower shelf energy for the cast + HIP ES-1 alloy could not be estimated from the impact toughness vs. temperature curves shown, because the lower shelf energy for this alloy occurs at a temperature below -100\u00b0F, the lowest impact testing temperature in the study.  \nA high temperature HIP homogenization treatment of cast ES-1 ingot material significantly reduces both the average number of pores and the average area fraction or average % porosity.  A high temperature homogenization treatment (without pressure) significantly increased the average number and average area fraction (% porosity) of the cast ES-1 material.  \nNo retained austenite was found in the as cast, as quenched, or fully heat treated ES-1 ingot samples that were analyzed using XRD analysis.  Cryo-treatment led to a small improvement in hardness at the expense of -40\u00b0F impact toughness.  \nAn initial heat of induction melted, aluminum deoxidized investment cast ES-1 with 0.06 wt % of aluminum showed that the average -40\u00b0F and +72\u00b0F impact toughness, % elongation, and UTS and YS of the fully heat treated investment cast + HIP ES-1 material lagged significantly behind that of the vacuum degassed cast + HIP ES-1 ingot material.  Even though the % elongation and impact toughness of the investment cast ES-1 material changed between heat treatment conditions, the average UTS and YS values remained relatively unchanged throughout the heat treatments for the investment cast study.  Etched micrographs of the investment cast ES-1 material showed evidence of significant differences in microsegregation reduction between the samples homogenized at 2125\u00b0F for 4 hours and those not homogenized at 2125\u00b0F for 4 hours.  SEM fracture surface work performed on the investment cast material clearly showed that the induction melted investment and aluminum killed cast material contained significant amounts of MnS and Al2O3 inclusions that were not discovered in the vacuum degassed cast ingot material.  \nLastly, the results of a third heat of induction melted, aluminum deoxidized investment cast ES-1 material possessing just 0.01wt% of aluminum showed that the decrease in aluminum content from the first experimental heat did not improve the mechanical properties of the investment cast material.  \nCasting section size (cooling rate) is shown to directly influence the amount of segregation reduction possible during HIP or homogenization treatments of UHSLA steel castings.  The segregation reduction possible depends not only on the alloys present and the homogenization time and temperature, but also on the DAS of cast steels.  Model estimates show that little, if any diffusion of substitutional alloying elements will occur during the homogenization of steels castings with DAS &#8805; 200 &#956;m regardless of the homogenization temperature.  Throughout this study, high temperature (1950\u00b0F - 2125\u00b0F) HIP cycles as well as high temperature homogenization cycle improved the impact toughness of UHSLA cast steels.  Diffusion modeling suggests that high temperature HIP cycle can also significantly reduce the microsegregation of substitutional alloying elements and can therefore replace the homogenization step in the heat treatment of UHSLA cast steels.  The research suggests that HIP processing improves the toughness by significantly reducing microporosity formed during solidification.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4843], "author_name_tesi": "Lynch, Paul C.", "last_name_ssi": "Lynch", "middle_name_ssi": "C.", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt", "Robert Carl Voigt", "Edward Demeter", "Richard Allen Wysk", "Chantal U Binet"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Carl Voigt, Committee Chair", "Edward Demeter, Committee Member", "Richard Allen Wysk, Committee Member", "Chantal U Binet, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ultrahigh strength steel", "cast steel", "low alloy steel", "homogenization", "HIP"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF SELECTIVE AUTOMATED PEACH (PRUNUS PERSICA (L.)

The proposed system needed to visualize the tree fruit canopy, discriminate targets, mechanically reach the canopy from a stable platform and remove unwanted targets. The experimental system consisted of: vision acquisition hardware, kinematic targeting and heuristic programming, a robotic arm and a pomologically designed end-effector.  \n\t\nA quarter-scale robotic arm based on a Fanuc M-16Li robotic arm was designed and constructed.  The robotic arm had a payload of 2.5 kg (5.5 lbs) and was mounted on a test plate and platform configuration for study.  The robotic arm could deliver a torque greater than 44 N (10 lbf) at a target location. A rotating brush end-effector was also designed and fabricated. The end-effector had a measured tangential force capability of 5.3 N (1.19 lbf ) at the brush blossom interface. \n\nThe normal and tangential force requirements to remove a peach blossom from a shoot were evaluated.  The resultant of the blossom force tests gave a range of 0.44 N to 0.57 N (0.10 lbf - 0.13 lbf) for the normal force and 0.49 N to 0.71 N (0.11 - 0.16 lbf) for the tangential force. Both force ranges were orders of magnitude lower than the deliverable force of the system.  Thus, the robotic arm with end-effector combination could effectively remove peach buds and/or blossoms from a branch or shoot configuration. \n\nThe precision and accuracy of the robotic arm and end-effector placement were also studied.  A kinematic positioning test for the robotic arm consisted of 120 repetitions. The resultant 120 test repetitions fell within the first standard deviation of a proposed +/- 2.54 cm (1 in) precision standard.  With a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of +/- 8.96%, the robotic arm had a consistent range of -1.26 cm (0.496 in) to +1.57 cm (0.618 in) in vector magnitude per target location. For the end-effector positioning test the brushes reached the proposed +/- 2.54 cm (1 in) target area 100% of the time.  The deviation from target to the center of the brushes was within the first standard deviation with a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of +/- 10.33%, the end-effector brushes had a consistent range of -2.97 cm (-1.1 in) to +3.04 cm (+1.2 in) per target location.  For the heuristic thinning tests of 10 cm (3.93 in), 15 cm (5.90 in) and 20 cm (7.87 in) the end-effector successfully removed the unwanted blossom in each case.  The blossom thinning percentage for each case was 100%.  \n\nIn conclusion, a quarter-scale robotic arm and full scale end-effector was designed and built.  A system of the robotic arm, end-effector, heuristic and kinematic algorithms was successfully integrated.  The robotic arm maneuvered without the end-effector to the respective targets +/- 2.54 cm (1 in) no less than 95% of each test case.   The robotic arm maneuvered with the end-effector to the respective targets +/- 2.54 cm (1 in) no less than 95% of each test case. The partial system (robotic arm, end-effector and heuristic programming without vision system) was able to remove blossoms without damaging branch structure or removing wanted blossoms no less than 95% of each test case. The vision system was not integrated into the laboratory experimental system. The kinematics and end-effector from this current study could be used with a full scale robotic arm and a mobile platform for orchard testing.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9179], "author_name_tesi": "Lyons, David James", "last_name_ssi": "Lyons", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Jude Liu", "James Rawlinson Schupp", "Virendra Puri"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Heinz Heinemann, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Chair", "Jude Liu, Committee Member", "James Rawlinson Schupp, Special Member", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pomological End-Effector", "Peach Thinning", "Saturn Blossom Heuristics", "Peach Thinning Heuristics"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Root Distribution of Creeping Bentgrass and Annual Bluegrass on Golf Course Putting Greens\n", "id": "6214", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1821", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Three experimental cultivars of annual bluegrass and two cultivars of creeping bentgrass, \u2018Penncross\u2019 and \u2018Penn A-4\u2019, were planted on an experimental golf green at Penn State University.

Methods to predict these forces have traditionally treated the airfoil as a flat plate. At higher frequencies, where the relevant turbulent length scales are comparable to the airfoil thickness, the flat plate approximation becomes invalid and results in overprediction of the unsteady force spectrum. This work provides an improved methodology for the prediction of the unsteady lift forces that accounts for the thickness of the airfoil. An analytical model was developed to calculate the response of the airfoil to high frequency gusts. The approach is based on a time-domain calculation with a sharp-edged gust and accounts for the distortion of the gust by the mean flow around the airfoil leading edge. The unsteady lift is calculated from a weighted integration of the gust vorticity, which makes the model relatively straightforward to implement and verify. For routine design calculations of turbulence-induced forces, a closed-form gust response thickness correction factor was developed for NACA 65 series airfoils. The model was then validated by measuring the unsteady lift spectrum using piezoelectric force gages in a water tunnel with grid-generated turbulence. A series of four airfoils with thickness-to-chord ratios ranging from 8 to 16 percent were tested over a wide range of speeds. In addition, the turbulence spectrum was measured using Laser Doppler Velocimetry. The experimental results confirmed that the analytical model accurately predicts the attenuation of the high frequency gust response due to the airfoil thickness.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4848], "author_name_tesi": "Lysak, Peter Daniel", "last_name_ssi": "Lysak", "middle_name_ssi": "Daniel", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dean Capone", "Dean Capone", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Michael Lester Jonson", "Philip John Morris", "Victor Ward Sparrow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dean Capone, Dissertation Advisor", "Dean Capone, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Michael Lester Jonson, Committee Member", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["turbulence ingestion noise", "airfoil gust response"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "A SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF EXPRESSION AND FUNCTION OF CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS GENES ENCODING P-TYPE ATPASES IN SUBFAMILY IV, THE GROUP OF PUTATIVE TRANSBILAYER AMPHIPATH TRANSPORTERS", "id": "7735", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4770", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In eukaryotic organisms, the cytofacial and exofacial monolayers of the plasma membrane and certain other cell membranes exhibit substantial differences with respect to lipid composition.

Viable cells normally conceal plasma membrane PS, while cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis expose it on the cell surface. P-type ATPases in subfamily IV are the leading candidate transbilayer amphipath transporters (TATs), the proteins postulated to actively translocate PS to the cytofacial half of the compositionally polarized membranes.

Phenotypic analysis of nematodes with temporarily, via RNA interference, or permanently, by deletion mutagenesis, altered expression of tat-1 through 5 shows that tat-5 is an essential gene. tat-5(RNAi) animals exhibit morphological defects of the gonad, fertilization deficiencies and embryonic lethality. tat-1 through 4 are nonessential. The tat-3; tat-4 gene pair is nonessential as well. tat-1 seems to be required for exposure of PS on the surface of apoptotic cells in the nematode gonad. tat-2 and tat-4 appear to mediate cholesterol metabolism in the digestive system.

To reduce the number of runs by a simulator, the Artificial Neural Network is used to predict the relationship between variables using a history matching technique. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) mainly consists of two solution parts. The first part is called forward solution and is used to obtain production properties from parameters generated using the simulator. Using an inverse solution enables users to obtain reservoir or well design data based on production data such as production rate and cumulative production. \nThe artificial neurons are mathematical functions that handle multiplying, summing and activating the neurons to be transformed to a desired goal, an output. Different scenarios have been implemented following the Artificial Neural Network application to the petroleum industry. As the number of layers in a multilayer reservoir increases, neural network requires more time and computations. By using optimization methods and applying them to the ANN, the tool decides on the best design in which the least error is achieved. The developed tool has been assessed based on the comparison of simulator parameters and ANN learned variables.\nTo enhance the utilization of the tool, a graphic user interface (GUI) has been created to help users access the data and results efficiently.

Oligodendrocyte progenitor (OP) cells generated in the developing neural tube differentiate into oligodendrocytes capable of producing myelin. OP cells undergo extensive proliferation before they become post-mitotic, mature oligodendrocytes. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence OP cells to decide whether to continue cell cycle progression or exit the cell cycle and terminally differentiate. Growth factors are extrinsic signals involved in developmental regulation of OPs. Some growth factors act independently and other growth factors act coordinately to exert maximal effects. Previously, our laboratory reported that insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which itself is a weak mitogen in oligodendrocyte lineage cells, synergizes with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) for G1 cell cycle progression and S phase entry, in part, by inducing cyclin D1 and enhancing activity of cdk2.\nHere, we report that the combination of IGF-1 with FGF-2 accelerates S phase and promotes S phase progression. Particularly, IGF-1/FGF-2 enhances mRNA and protein expression of cyclin A and cdk2, the predominant regulators of S phase. Further, the growth factor combination increases effective complex formation in IGF-1/FGF-2 resulting in enhanced cdk2 activity. We further studied the signaling mechanism by which IGF-1 and FGF-2 synergize to exert their coordinated effects on cell cycle progression, specifically in S phase. Using specific inhibitors for MAP kinase and PI3 kinase, we determined that both pathways are necessary for expression of S phase proteins and mRNA and for phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb), a target of cdk2. However, the effects of each pathway on S phase targets were distinct. \nWe also demonstrate that IGF-1 plays a critical role in G2/M progression. OP cells exposed to FGF-2 alone fail to progress through G2/M. In contrast, the combination of IGF-1 with FGF-2 promotes progression through G2/M. Protein expression of cyclin B and cdk1 increases and cyclin B/cdk1 complex formation increases with concomitant increase in cdk1 kinase activity in the combination growth factor treatment. Nuclear localization of cyclin B and cdk1, one parameter for active cdk1, was enhanced in IGF-1/FGF-2 treated cells as well as the relative amount of cdc25C, an activator of cdk1. Using mechanism to arrest cells in S phase or with cells treated with FGF-2 alone into S phase, we demonstrated that IGF-1 by itself promotes G2/M progression. Overall, we have determined that IGF-1 plays an important role in cell cycle progression of OP cells, and furthermore, it is an essential factor for G2/M progression.       \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3193], "author_name_tesi": "MIN, JUNGSOO  ", "last_name_ssi": "MIN", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "JUNGSOO ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Teresa L Wood", "Teresa L Wood", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "Steven W Levison", "Jong Kak Yun", "James M Hammond", "Charles H Lang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Teresa L Wood, Dissertation Advisor", "Teresa L Wood, Committee Chair", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Chair", "Steven W Levison, Committee Member", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member", "James M Hammond, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["IGF-1", "oligodendrocyte", "cell cycle"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "SECURITY AND PRIVACY IN LOW COST RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION", "id": "9554", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3088", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Automatic Identification (AutoID) technology has introduced innovative ways to collect,manage information and monitor everything from hospital patients and livestock to library books.Radio frequency  Identification  (RFID)  is  the burgeoning AutoID  becoming  a  popular  tool  in \nmanufacturing, supply chain management and retail inventory control.

Holography encodes the phase of a complex optical field into the intensity distribution of the interference pattern between the signal and the reference fields.\n\nThe first part of this thesis is devoted to the metamaterial characterization using spectral holography. Metamaterial is a class of artificial material having novel properties not existing in nature. The developed spectral holography measurement system uses a supercontinuum as the light source, which enables broadband characterization covering a wavelength range from 600nm to 1700nm. Spectral holography is applied to measure the complex transmission and reflection coefficient of two metamaterials, namely a zero-index-material (ZIM) on a substrate that has effective zero refractive index at 1.55\u03bcm, and a Dielectric Magnetic Mirror (DMM) that can achieve high reflection efficiency. The transmission and reflection coefficients are then used to deduce the corresponding refractive index and impedance. The optical characteristics of two metasurface based wave plates (a half wave plate and a quarter wave plate) are also measured. The experimental results and the simulations show good agreements.\n\nI also developed a unique sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopic holography for chemical selective 3D imaging on organic samples. The strong SFG emission attributed to the vibrational resonance enhanced second order nonlinear susceptibility has been utilized for label free chemical selective imaging of biosamples. I have demonstrated the single shot, scanning-free technique for 3D imaging of biologically interesting samples such as starch and D-galactose, using a pump and probe picoseconds laser system.

The present work studies the flow dynamics and system performance of airbreathing PDEs with a stoichiometric hydrogen/air mixture.  The system includes a supersonic inlet, an air manifold, a rotary valve, a single-tube or multitube combustor, and a convergent-divergent nozzle.  The flight condition involves an altitude of 9.3 km and a flight Mach number of 2.1.\nThe supersonic inlet dynamics is analyzed through axisymmetric two-dimensional simulations based on the Harten-Yee upwind total-variation-diminishing scheme.  Turbulence closure is achieved by a two-equation model.  In addition to the steady-state inlet flow dynamics, the response of the inlet shock system to downstream disturbances is studied by imposing periodic pressure oscillations at the exit plane.  A wide range of fluctuation frequency and amplitude are investigated.  In general, the acoustic response of the inlet flow increases with increasing amplitude of the imposed oscillation, but decreases with the frequency.\nBoth one- and two-dimensional simulations based on the recently developed Space-Time conservation element/solution element method are carried out for single-tube PDEs.  The two-dimensional code is further parallelized using the message-passing-interface library and a domain decomposition technique for unstructured grid.  The flow dynamics, the effects of the operation timing and nozzle configuration on the propulsive performance, and the various loss mechanisms are examined.  Results show that an optimum cycle frequency exists for a given configuration.  For a given frequency and purge time, a longer refilling period increases the specific thrust of PDEs considered.  The nozzle studies indicate that the convergent-divergent nozzle significantly increases the propulsive performance.  Moreover, the throat area of the convergent-divergent nozzle plays a more important role than the length.\nEffort is also expended to study the flow dynamics and propulsive performance of multitube PDEs.  Comparison with the single-tube results demonstrates that the multitube design improves the engine performance in terms of specific impulse, operation steadiness, and timing range.  The effect of the system geometry is partially assessed by considering a free volume between the detonation tubes and the common nozzle.  Results indicate that the free volume helps to reduce the imperfect nozzle expansion loss and improve the engine steadiness.  However, it also induces more complicated shock waves and increases the internal flow loss.

An emphasis on sustainability is imperative for the competitive success of modern design and manufacturing enterprises, and incorporating sustainability into the product design process continues to warrant the increasing attention. Sustainability includes three dimensions: economic, environmental, and social. To the best of our knowledge, no existing product design method yet involves these three dimensions of sustainability, partly because social sustainability is difficult to evaluate and measure.  This research gap motivates this study. \nProduct life cycle management, especially the end-of-life (EOL) stage management, with its benefits of cost savings and increased environmental awareness performance, has emerged as a critical component of the product design process. However, determining EOL options during the product design stage can present a complex challenge because of vagueness in the design en-vironment\u2014for example, an imprecise factor such as product maintenance. Therefore, developing a comprehensive framework to help understand uncertain EOL options is also a foundational motivation of this study. \nIn today\u2019s challenging marketplace, key components play a significantly important role in product competitiveness. These components may represent a core technology and affect the product\u2019s functional performance, such as the turbocharger in an automobile engine; or they may be expensive or complicated to assemble and consequently influence the product\u2019s market performance, such as the cabinet of a refrigerator. However, based on existing literature, scant research discusses key components in the product design process. Therefore, involving a focus on key components in the design process also stimulates this study. \n  Modular product design (MPD)\u2014splitting a product into several components and then analyzing each separately\u2014has proven to be a widely accepted design tool due to its advantages across the entire product life cycle, evincing benefits to manufacturing, to assembly, and to the product supply chain itself. In this study, a new MPD approach is presented that considers uncertain EOL options and key component specifications to improve three dimensions of sustainability. \nThree indicators\u2014cost, environmental impact, and labor time\u2014are employed to measure economic, environmental and social sustainability as individual elements. The environmental impact assessment is adopted using an open source software, Eco-99, which measures environmental sustainability in a comprehensive manner. Fuzzy logic is used to estimate the probability of each EOL option and to determine the expected EOL sustainability values (cost, environmental impact and labor time) for each component. Three clustering algorithms, with respect to the three sustainability aspects, are developed for specific key components; component modules are then grouped based on the identified key components and their sustainability optimization at all three stages of the total life cycle (manufacturing, maintenance, and EOL). The tri-criteria model builds toward optimizing sustainability in order to derive the compromised module structure.   \n Based on this investigation into three-dimension sustainability, the economic, environmental, and social aspects are first quantified and measured simultaneously from the view of the product life cycle, and then improved through a product module generation process. Key components are also emphasized in the design stage, and key-component-based clustering algorithms are introduced to generate product modules. Moreover, uncertain EOL options are taken into ac-count in the module forming process. This new MPD approach has proven to generate better performance than previously existing methods (e.g., decomposition approach) in terms of sustainability.  \n  Two case studies are used to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed methodology, based on the perspective of product scale. A coffee maker is used to illustrate the analysis of a small and simple product, and a refrigerator is used to illustrate the analysis of a large and complex product. Given pre-determined sustainability indicator weights, both the coffee maker and the refrigerator are decomposed into several modules, as such modular architectures can benefit product life cycle full-dimension sustainability performance assessment.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11827], "author_name_tesi": "Ma, Junfeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Ma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Junfeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gul Kremer", "M Jeya Chandra", "Charles David Ray Sr.", "Conrad S Tucker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gul Kremer, Dissertation Advisor", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Charles David Ray Sr., Committee Member", "Conrad S Tucker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Modular Product Design", "Sustainability", "End-of-Life", "Optimization", "Key Components"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Self-powered Internet-of-Things Nonvolatile Processor and System Exploration and Optimization", "id": "15167kxm505", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15167", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Every shift in the way our devices are connected or powered brings with it a potential for revolution in the usage and capabilities of the systems built around them. Just as the transition from wired to wireless telephones led to unprecedented changes in our communications and the shift from wall-power to battery-power transformed our expectations for computational systems, the shift from battery-powered systems to self-powered systems promises to fuel the next revolution in the Internet of Things (IoT).\nThe ability to utilize ambient, scavenged energy, such as solar energy, radio-frequency (RF) radiation, piezoelectric effect, thermal gradients, etc., can liberate IoT devices from the lifetime, deployment, and service limitations of a fixed battery.\nHowever, the power supplied by energy harvesting sources is highly unreliable and dependent upon ambient environment factors.

First, we begin by proposing an efficient, parallel implementation of the Periodic Boundary Condition (PBC) in FDTD, which is based on the split-field method. The parallel scheme is based on a one-cell overlapping approach that is employed in the conventional FDTD method, which is extended in this work to include the PBC to model problems with periodic geometries. Next, a new, stable implementation of the Convolutional Perfectly Matched Layer (CPML) is implemented in the PBC/FDTD algorithm to truncate the computational domain with open boundaries.\nSecond, we propose a scheme to excite a desired incident field distribution in the computational domain to solve scattering problems that involve infinite structures. This scheme is based on modifying the conventional Total-Field/Scattered-Field (TF/SF) technique, which, in its original form, applies only to finite structures. The performance of the proposed scheme is studied by launching two different incident field distributions, namely a Gaussian beam and a plane wave.\nThird, we carry out an extensive study of the electromagnetic (EM) response of a Double-Negative (DNG) slab, comprising of a combination of split-rings and wires, by using the parallel FDTD technique. Initially, we perform a preliminary analysis of the scattering characteristics of an infinite DNG slab, by using the proposed PBC/FDTD technique, to retrieve the effective material parameters via the modified inversion approach, which is described in this work. Some problem areas that may be encountered when using effective material parameters in real-world applications are identified, and the importance of carrying out rigorous simulations, which model the original structure, comprising of inclusions in a background medium accurately, is recognized .

The proposed action will draw on an urban tree approach to achieve an innovative preservation morphology by establishing procedures to both conserve the traditional identity of the city and provide new opportunities for growth and modernization.\nBeijing\u2019s hutongs comprise narrow laneways and vernacular courtyard houses arranged in a quadrangle style.

Under the influence of China\u2019s rapid economic development and radical urbanization, many hutongs have been replaced by an urban form that reflects the purpose of presenting a modern image. New apartments, offices, and government buildings have replaced thousands of hutongs, whose residents have been relocated to modern housing complexes. The external forces driving this transformation are modernization and globalization. Additionally, the inadequate development of public infrastructure within the old neighborhoods is a critical internal factor.\nIn order to determine the ways in which the hutong is structurally different from other neighborhoods, the study focuses on hutong neighborhoods in Beijing that exemplify various aspects of and processes relating to neighborhood change, decline, gentrification and stability.

LCA methodology provides emission-focused environmental accounting by expressing all the resource uses (material and energy) across a product's entire life as categorized environmental impacts. In contrast, EMA methodology presents a single unit measured, energy-focused environmental accounting by expressing all the resource consumption (material, energy and labor) in a solar energy equivalent or solar emjoule (sej).\n\nA significant, albeit simplified, case study \u2013 that of a wood biomass Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system - is used to compare the results and analytically assess merits of LCA and EMA as well as to consider possible integration of the methods. Woodchips production, transportation, facility construction, industrial conversion to energy and disposal of wastes are included in the analysis. A Monte Carlo simulation model is developed by taking into account factors that have inherent uncertainty in a biomass CHP system. The results obtained from the two methods are compared by means of uncertainty analysis, sensitivity analysis and correlation analysis.\n\nThis research provides three key contributions. The findings suggest that information provided by the two methods is complementary rather than competing. Each of these two methods displays its own unique \"optimal field of application\": \n\n1)LCA is a useful assessment method to evaluate local and global environmental impacts of the system. Its usefulness is very limited to the assessment of a specific system. However, LCA may be and is commonly used within clearly-stated assumptions, to compare two similar processes and thereby provides environmental sciences a continuous benchmarking tool.\n\n2)EMA provides a more robust assessment of interconnection between an industrial process, its recognized environmental dynamics and its economic potential. Its capability to account for externalities expands its usefulness over a broader spectrum of cases, but also limits its use for improvement of a specific process. The crucial benefit of EMA is that it provides an approach aimed for maximizing utilization efficiency of local environmental resources in supporting industrial process and economy. Simply speaking, EMA answers the question \"What is the most efficient product or process?\" while LCA answers \"How can we improve environmental efficiency of a specific product or process?\"\n\nSecondly, LCA and EMA indicators are characterized by different degrees of uncertainty:\n\n1)Uncertainty is inherent in the current LCA approach, and cannot be overcome even if practitioners strictly follow the procedures described in the LCA standards. Therefore, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis should always be reported in the LCA final results. \n\n2)EMA indicators are subject to free environmental service and human labor associated with the system, which are not accounted in LCA. This uncertainty analysis of EMA adds value to the extant literature. \n\nGiven the large degree of uncertainty of the LCA results, using LCA independently as the sole tool for decision-making in energy policy will, in some cases, cause decisions resulting in more environmental damage and poorer economical performance than expected and understood. Therefore, LCA can be a useful tool for a company's internal decision-making, but should not be solely trusted to guide public policy. EMA can quantify the contribution of natural capital for sustaining economic activity. The results become more accurate as the scale of environmental area gets larger, which makes well-executed EMA a better tool for environmentally and economically conscious policy-making.\n\nFinally, correlation analysis reveals no significant correlation between Global Warming Potential (GWP), the most commonly referred-to indicator in LCA, and any EMA indicators. On the other hand, varying correlations are found among EMA indicators, suggesting the number of EMA indicators could be reduced as they lead to similar findings. Surprisingly, biogenic CO2 emission from LCA and Transformity (Tr) in EMA are strongly correlated. This relationship suggests that using some LCA components and methodology could possibly increase the applicability and long-term value of EMA in environmental decision-making as it complements the assessment perspective. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8671], "author_name_tesi": "Ma, Li ", "last_name_ssi": "Ma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Li", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles David Ray Sr.", "Charles David Ray Sr.", "Judd Harrison Michael", "Michael Gerard Messina", "Richard Charles Stehouwer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles David Ray Sr., Dissertation Advisor", "Charles David Ray Sr., Committee Chair", "Judd Harrison Michael, Committee Member", "Michael Gerard Messina, Committee Member", "Richard Charles Stehouwer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Life Cycle Assessment", "LCA", "Emergy Analysis", "Environmental Accounting", "Uncertainty Analysis", "Sensitivity Analysis", "Correlation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Constructing China from Afar: National Image, Public Diplomacy, and Public Perception", "id": "24907", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11037", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In an increasingly globalized world, connected through trade, education, and tourism, nation states have become more conscious about the importance of their images in the other parts of the world.

Iron absorption is crucial in maintaining systemic iron homeostasis because there is no physiological mechanism for iron excretion, which distinguishes iron from other minerals. Dietary factors, such as phytate, ascorbic acid and animal tissues, have been proven consistently to influence intestinal iron absorption. The unique components of animal tissues that enhance intestinal iron absorption are coined as \u201cmeat factor\u201d. However, the influence of polyphenols on iron absorption and the nature of the \u201cmeat factor\u201d remain unresolved. As the major transporters for intestinal iron absorption have been identified in the past decade, the focus has shifted to the molecular mechanism of intestinal heme iron absorption. To address these identified gaps of knowledge, our research focused on defining the effect of polyphenols on iron absorption and elucidating the interactions between heme and non-heme iron during iron absorptive processes using the human intestine-like Caco-2 cell model. \n     In the first study, our objective was to investigate the effect of several bioactive polyphenolic compounds, including (-) -epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), grape seed extract (GSE) and green tea extract (GT) on intestinal heme iron absorption. Dietary polyphenolic compounds has attracted increasing attentions recently because they have a wide range of health benefits. Previous studies have revealed the inhibiting effect of polyphenols from black tea on non-heme iron absorption. Our initial study showed the inhibitory effect of EGCG and GSE on non-heme iron absorption. We explored whether polyphenols from green tea and grape seed extract could inhibit intestinal absorption of heme iron in Caco-2 cells. Both EGCG and GSE decreased (p < 0.05) transepithelial transport of heme-derived 55Fe. Although apical heme-55Fe uptake was increased (p < 0.05) by GSE, the amount of total 55Fe released to basolateral chamber was negligible. In contrast, EGCG moderately decreased the apical uptake of heme-55Fe, whereas the basolateral iron transfer was extremely low. All three types of polyphenolic compounds tested, including EGCG, GSE and GT, significantly inhibited heme-55Fe absorption in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of ascorbic acid did not modulate the inhibitory effect of these polyphenols on heme iron absorption when the cells were treated with polyphenols at a concentration of 46 mg/L. However, ascorbic acid was able to offset or reverse the inhibitory effect of polyphenolic compounds when lower concentrations of polyphenols were added (\u2264 4.6 mg/L). In summary, findings from the first study suggest that bioactive dietary polyphenols inhibit heme iron absorption mainly by reducing basolateral iron exit rather than decreasing apical heme iron uptake in intestinal cells. In addition, the results imply that regular consumption of dietary ascorbic acid can easily counteract the inhibitory effect of very low concentrations of dietary polyphenols on heme iron absorption but cannot counteract the inhibitory actions of higher concentrations of polyphenols.\n     In the second study, our objective was to explore the mechanism of increased iron absorption promoted by meat factor of animal tissues and whether and how the absorption of heme and non-heme iron interfere with each other. We examined cellular uptake and transepithelial absorption of non-heme 55Fe in human intestine-like Caco-2 cells in response to treatment of different doses of heme or the heme precursor, protoporphyrin IX, for different time periods. We found that non-heme 55Fe absorption across Caco-2 cell monolayer was enhanced by heme via redistributing iron importer divalent metal-transporter-1 (DMT1) from cytosol to apical membrane and iron exporter ferroportin1 (FPN1) from cytosol to basolateral membrane. Interestingly, heme-55Fe absorption was also increased by treatment of non-heme iron. Although non-heme iron alone did not affect FPN1 localization, heme and non-heme iron together synergistically redistributed FPN1 to basolateral membrane. In addition, the heme precursor protoporphyrin IX itself was sufficient to increase non-heme iron absorption, while the competition between the iron released from the heme moiety and non-heme iron was negligible compared to compensatory increase of FPN1 on basolateral membrane. Finally, non-heme 55Fe absorption was also enhanced adaptively by pretreatment of heme for 2 \u2013 3 days, possible as a consequence of increased FPN1 transcription induced by heme.\n     In conclusion, our research supports that polyphenols from green tea and grape seed extracts drastically block intestinal absorption of both heme and non-heme iron and that intestinal absorption of heme and non-heme iron are reciprocal of each other via regulation of DMT1 and FPN1 using the Caco-2 cells model. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7087], "author_name_tesi": "Ma, Qianyi ", "last_name_ssi": "Ma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qianyi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Okhee Han", "Okhee Han", "A Catharine Ross", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Debashis Ghosh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Okhee Han, Dissertation Advisor", "Okhee Han, Committee Chair", "A Catharine Ross, Committee Member", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Debashis Ghosh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Intestinal iron absorption", "Polyphenol", "Heme", "Green tea", "Ferroportin-1"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Semi-blind Robust Identification and Model (In)Validation\n", "id": "8026", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6595", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, we study a so-called semi-blind robust identification motivated\nfrom the fact that sometimes for system Identification only partial input data is exactly\nknown.

This thesis investigates energy harvesting from human motion, air flow, and the sun using model-based design and experimental testing of devices tailored for specific energy harvesting modalities. Specifically, this thesis develops piezoelectric energy harvesters for wearables and heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) ducts and tracking solar energy harvesters using shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators.\n\nPiezoelectric energy harvesters typically perform poorly in the low frequency, low amplitude, and intermittent excitation environment of human movement associated with wearables. A piezoelectric compliant mechanism (PCM) energy harvester is designed, modeled, and analyzed that consists of a piezoelectric unimorph clamped at the base and attached to a compliant mechanism at the tip. The compliant mechanism has two flexures that amplify the tip displacement to produce large motion of a proof mass and a low frequency first mode with an efficient (nearly quadratic) shape. The compliant mechanism is fabricated as a separate, relatively rigid frame with flexure hinges, simplifying the fabrication process and surrounding and protecting the piezoelectric unimorph. Comparing the time domain performance based on realistic wrist acceleration data, the PCM produces 6 times more average power than a benchmark proof mass cantilever with the same unimorph area and natural frequency. Experiments with a fabricated PCM energy harvester prototype show that the compliant hinge stiffness can be carefully tuned to enforce a quadratic boundary condition, approaching the theoretical high power output and mode shape efficiency.\n\nThe bridge structure of the PCM also introduces an axial tensioning nonlinearity that self-limits the response to large amplitude impacts, improving the robustness of the device. A nonlinear model of the PCM energy harvester under large base excitation is derived to determine the maximum power that can be generated by the device. Experiments show that the compliant mechanism introduces a stiffening effect and a much wider bandwidth than the proof mass cantilever design. The PCM outperforms the cantilever in both average power and power-strain sensitivity at high accelerations due to the PCM axial stretching effect and its more uniform\nstrain distribution.\n\nPiezoelectric energy harvesters can also be used to scavenge energy for unattended sensors in HVAC ducts. An aeroelastic energy harvester using a pinned-pinned beam is designed, modeled, and analyzed. Nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, a linear piezoelectric constitutive law, and nonlinear pressure dynamics are used to obtain the desired model. Compared with the traditional cantilever beam used by previous researchers, the pinned-pinned beam has a higher frequency limit cycle and more efficient mode shape, which ensure higher power output at the same strain level. The pinned-pinned boundary condition also self-limits the response amplitude, limiting strain in the piezoelectric beam and premature failure. Simulation results show that the pinned-pinned beam can harvest at least 4 times more average power than a cantilever beam with the same maximum strain.\n\nWrist-worn devices often use a magnet on a spinning rotor to interact with a magnet on a piezoelectric cantilever, transferring energy from the rotor to the cantilever. Electrical energy can then be harvested from the cyclically strained piezoelectric material as the vibration transient decays. From the viewpoint of designing the rotor system, it is desirable to model these complex orthogonal interactions by an equivalent damping. The equivalent damping of orthogonal magnetic interactions can be calculated using a simplified model. A magnet connected to an inertia that is moving along one axis can interact with another magnet connected to an inertia that is initially at rest and constrained to move along an orthogonal axis. This orthogonal interaction results in a decreased speed and loss of energy for the moving mass and an increased speed and gain of energy for the initially-stationary mass. The damping predictions are compared with simulation results from an energy harvester consisting of a rotating proof mass that interacts orthogonally with a petal arrangement of piezoelectric bimorph beams.\n\nMulti-junction concentrating photovoltaics (CPV) have been pursued as a practical path to achieve high efficiency solar energy harvesting. A novel design consists of a central glass sheet sandwiched by an upper refractive lenslet and a lower reflective lenslet. High efficiency multi-junction microscale photovoltaic cells are transfer-printed onto the central sheet, which is moved by a precision translational microtracking system between the fixed lenslet arrays. SMA is wellknown for durable actuation with small displacements at low cycling speeds and is well-suited to the microtracking application. A one-dimensional SMA model with resistive heating is derived and validated by experiments.

In this network, many pathways, both promoting and inhibiting ones, are responsive to external (environmental) and internal (developmental) signals. Recent advances in microarray technologies have made it possible to decipher mechanisms regulating floral development on a genome-wide scale. \nFloral development has been elaborated as a canonical \u201cABC model\u201d. Previous studies have revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying floral development of many angiosperms, especially in core eudicots and monocots. However, the understanding of basal eudicots, which can serve as an evolutionary link between core eudicots and monocots, remains limited. The microarray experiments on the basal eudicot Eschscholzia californica (California poppy) have made it possible to characterize its floral transcriptome. The interwoven-loop design of oligonuleotide microarray allowed the transcriptome of eight tissues (flower buds with pre-meiotic and meiotic cells, developing fruits, leaves and four floral organs at pre-anthesis stages: sepals, petals, stamens and carpels) to be compared simultaneously. Several gene families of transcription factors with putative regulatory function in flower development have been studied, such as MADS-box, AGO, MYB, ZF-HD, ARF, bZIP and bHLH. In addition, comparison between whorl-specific gene expression pattern of E. californica and other species suggested its unique evolutionary position. \nGenes contributing to flower development have been studied for decades, especially those involved in the reproductive organ development. Several studies had focused on the male reproductive organs by analyzing transcriptome of male sterile mutants. Despite the increasing knowledge, the regulatory mechanisms regulating early anther development are still unclear. Microarray experiments on early anthers of wild type anther and sterile mutant, aborted microspores (ams), have revealed 1368 genes that are differentially expressed in ams during a narrow time period around meiosis. The transcriptome of ams suggested the possible functions of AMS in metabolism, transportation, ubiquitination and stress response. Moreover, comparison between the transcriptome of early anther and those of vegetative tissues identified more anther specific genes which might have important roles in anther development. Combining with previous studies on two other mutants, SPOROCYTELESS (SPL)/NOZZLE (NZZ) and EXCESS MALE SPOROCYTES1 (EMS1), an expanded regulatory network of early anther development has been established. \nThough developmental signaling pathways have been studied for years in Arabidopsis, the mechanisms in which environmental signals impact the development of reproductive organs mostly remain unclear. Among those factors affecting reproduction thus production, drought is a very, if not most, prominent one. The yield loss in crops as a result of drought prompted many researchers to elucidate the pathways in which plants adapt to water deficiency. Phenotypical analyses of wild type Arabidopsis in response to different drought conditions have shown that the severity of water deficiency is correlated with the yield loss. And the transcriptome analyses of inflorescences with different water supply at a series of time points provided more information about genes responsive to drought during the process at the molecular level. Moreover, on the basis of known cis-regulatory elements, a possible regulatory network of floral development integrating the external and internal signals has been proposed, providing a series of hypotheses for future experimentation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7234], "author_name_tesi": "Ma, Xuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Ma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Ma", "Hong Ma", "Teh Hui Kao", "Yinong Yang", "Claude Walker Depamphilis", "Naomi S Altman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Ma, Dissertation Advisor", "Hong Ma, Committee Chair", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Yinong Yang, Committee Member", "Claude Walker Depamphilis, Committee Member", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Floral development", "microarray", "transcriptome", "regulatory network"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "POPULATION DYNAMICS MODELING OF HETEROTYPIC CELL AGGREGATIONS AND RELATED PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION PROBLEMS", "id": "13128", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6858", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cancer has been one of the leading causes of death around the world for decades. Metastasis, the spread of the tumor cells from the primary site to other locations in the body via the lymphatic system or through the blood stream, is responsible for most of the cancer deaths. Massive experimental studies have been done in these areas. The work of this thesis brings together the experimental, numerical, and mathematical studies on the step of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) tethering to the vascular endothelial cells (EC), and the subsequent melanoma cell emboli formation in a nonlinear shear flow, both of which are important in tumor cell extravasations from the circulation during metastasis.\n\nThe primary focus of this work was the development of mathematical models of heterotypic aggregation between PMNs and melanoma cells in the near-wall region of an in vitro parallel-plate flow chamber. A population balance model based on the Smoluchowski coagulation equation was applied to study the process, and then in vivo cell-substrate adhesion from the vasculatures were simulated by combining mathematical modeling and numerical implementations with experimental observations. This work proposed a new coagulation kernel, and also, developed a multiscale near-wall aggregation model, which to the best of our knowledge, was the first one that could incorporate the effects of both cell deformation and general ratios of heterotypic cells on the cell aggregation process. Quantitative agreement was found between numerical predictions and in vitro experiments. The effects of factors, including: intrinsic binding molecule properties, near-wall heterotypic cell concentrations, and cell deformations on the coagulation process, were discussed. Sensitivity analysis has been done, and we concluded that the reaction coefficient along with the critical bond number on the aggregation process should be recommended as the most critical variables. The conclusions from this thesis work also managed to propose more experimental time-frame design by the end of chapter two.\n\nThe success of mathematical modeling not only depends on the theoretical model development, but also crucially relies on the accuracy of parameter estimations. Following the comparisons between numerical simulations and experimental results, it was proposed that the parameters in our model, instead of being constants over time, could be modeled by functions with stochastic uncertainties. The other part of this thesis work, chapter three, focused on the application of the Bayesian framework to the parameter identification problems for our models, and hence, provided quantitative instead of purely qualitative analyses for the inverse problems. We adopted the Bayesian framework studied in literatures, and theoretically verified the assumptions for our models. Moreover, we successfully found the maximum a posteriori estimator (MAP estimator) for the parameters following variational methods, and estimated the sensitivity of the parameters with respect to the data using Monte Carlo methods. This work thus offered a systematic parameter identification tool specially tailored to our models.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6855], "author_name_tesi": "Ma, Yanping ", "last_name_ssi": "Ma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yanping", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiang Du", "Cheng Dong", "Qiang Du", "Cheng Dong", "Xiantao Li", "John Fricks", "Qiang Du; Cheng Dong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiang Du, Dissertation Advisor", "Cheng Dong, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiang Du, Committee Chair", "Cheng Dong, Committee Chair", "Xiantao Li, Committee Member", "John Fricks, Committee Member", "Qiang Du; Cheng Dong, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Population dynamics", "Bayesian framework", "inverse problem", "cell coagulation", "cancer metastasis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION AND CLONING OF TIE-DYED1, A NOVEL GENE REGULATING CARBOHYDRATE PARTITIONING IN MAIZE LEAVES\n\n\n", "id": "8148", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6781", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Acquisition of cell identity requires communication among neighboring cells.  To dissect the genetic pathways regulating cell signaling in later leaf development, a screen was performed to identify mutants with sectors that violate cell lineage boundaries in maize (Zea mays) leaves.  We identified a recessive mutant, tie-dyed1 (tdy1), which develops stable, nonclonal variegated yellow and green leaf sectors.  Sector formation requires high light, occurs during a limited developmental time, and is restricted to leaf blade tissue.  Yellow tdy1 sectors accumulate excess soluble sugars and starch, whereas green sectors appear unaffected.  Significantly, starch accumulation precedes chlorosis in cells that will become a yellow sector.  Retention of carbohydrates in tdy1 leaves is associated with a delay in reproductive maturity, decreased stature, and reduced yield.  To explain the tdy1 sectoring pattern, we propose a threshold model that incorporates the light requirement and the hyperaccumulation of photoassimilates.\n\ntdy1 and sucrose export defective1 (sxd1) are the only recessive mutants known with nonclonal chlorotic leaf sectors that hyperaccumulate starch and soluble sugars.  Based on their similar mutant phenotypes, we investigated whether tdy1 and sxd1 function in the same pathway.  Using aniline blue staining for callose and TEM to inspect plasmodesmatal ultrastructure, we determined that tdy1 does not have any physical blockage or alteration along the symplastic transport pathway as found in sxd1 mutants.  To test whether the two genes function in the same genetic pathway, we constructed F2 families segregating both mutations.  Double mutant plants showed an additive interaction for growth related phenotypes and soluble sugar accumulation, and expressed the leaf variegation pattern of both single mutants indicating that Tdy1 and Sxd1 act in separate genetic pathways.  Although sxd1 mutants lack tocopherols, we determined that tdy1 mutants have wild type tocopherol levels, indicating that Tdy1 does not function in the same biochemical pathway as Sxd1.  From these and other data we conclude that Tdy1 and Sxd1 function independently to regulate carbon export.\n\nTo characterize Tdy1\u00a1\u00afs function at the molecular and cellular levels, Tdy1 was cloned using transposon-tagging. Tdy1 encodes a novel protein highly conserved in grasses with orthologs in rice, sorghum and sugarcane.  Though no ortholog was found in dicot plants, two stretches of amino acid sequences were found to have similarities to TDY1, which implies the function of TDY1 may be conserved in higher plants.  In addition, maize genomic DNA Southern blotting revealed a duplicate gene for Tdy1, and multiple related sequences were discovered by BAC filter hybridization suggesting that Tdy1 belongs to a small gene family.  It is possible that the closest duplicate gene partially compensates for Tdy1 function so that the tdy1 mutant does not show uniform chlorosis in its leaves.  Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that Tdy1 is expressed in both source leaves and young sink tissues.  Furthermore, in situ hybridization localized Tdy1 RNA in phloem cells, supporting a potential function in phloem transport.  As sucrose transporters are involved in phloem loading, their expression patterns were examined and overlapping expression was found for ZmSUT2 and ZmSUT4.  The results suggest that Tdy1 may function in regulating phloem transport of sucrose in maize plants.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6779], "author_name_tesi": "Ma, Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Ma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Braun", "Paula Mc Steen", "Teh Hui Kao", "Dawn S Luthe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Braun, Committee Chair", "Paula Mc Steen, Committee Member", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sucrose transport", "carbohydrate partitioning", "phloem loading", "phloem unloading"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "electro-optics and nonlinear optics of liquid crystal-plasmonic materials and structures", "id": "16431", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8273", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The electro-optics and nonlinear optics effects of liquid crystals have already been intensively studied.

The first part is devoted to the study of an incompressible magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) system, which is a coupled system of (reduced) Maxwell's equations and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. And the second part is devoted to the numerical simulation of the optical process in the unit solar cell. \n\nIn the study of the incompressible MHD system, we first propose and analyze a structure-preserving finite element scheme. The main feature of this discretization is that it naturally preserves Gauss's law for magnetism. Instead of eliminating the electric field in the discretization, we employ the mixed finite element method, which uses the electric field as an intermediate variable. Inspired by the natural discretization from the perspective of finite element exterior calculus, we choose special finite element spaces and preserve the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field on the discrete level.\n\nThis finite element discretization inherits the energy estimate from the continuous level naturally. As a consequence, optimal order of convergence exists. Moreover, the linear system after Picard linearization is well-posed. We investigate the properties of this structure-preserving discretization in Chapter \\ref{chap:FEMDiscretization}.\n\nFrom the perspective of functional analysis, the well-posedness of the linear system gives rise to robust preconditioners for Krylov subspace methods naturally. In this thesis, we propose block preconditioners for the discrete MHD system and carry out analysis on their performance. We prove that such preconditioners are robust with respect to most physical and discretization parameters. In our analysis, we improve the existing estimates of the block triangular preconditioners for saddle point problems by removing the scaling parameters, which are usually difficult to choose in practice. This new technique is not only applicable to the MHD system, but also to other problems. \n\nAt the end of the first part, we present numerical results to support our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the robustness of the proposed preconditioners.\n\nIn the numerical simulation of the optical process in the solar cells, we first propose a reasonable mathematical model. The optical process is where the sunlight (electromagnetic energy) propagates through the solar cell panel and gets attenuated. We use perfectly matched layers to build the mathematical model and validate it with numerical experiments.\n\nThe linear system resulting from the finite element discretization is of high frequency, which is very difficult to solve. We explore the performance of the algorithms, such as the moving PML method for this problem.

Polyriboinosinic: polyribocytidylic acid (PIC), a synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), is well known as an inducer of IFNs and an adjuvant, which can induce anti-viral and anti-tumor reactions as well as a variety of immune responses. Previous studies have shown that retinoic acid (RA), a bioactive metabolite of VA, and PIC synergistically increased primary and secondary anti-tetanus toxoid (TT) antibody responses in VA-deficient animals. However, their immunoregulatory effects in VA-sufficient animals, particularly the regulation of IgG isotypes and memory responses, are not well elucidated.\n    Early-life vaccination is an important strategy to protect neonates and infants from infectious diseases. Unfortunately, the immaturity of immune system hampers the generation of protective vaccine response. Hence, new strategies are sought to improve vaccine efficiency in neonates and infants. Because RA and/or PIC successfully promoted TT-induced vaccine response in VA-deficient adult animals, it was interesting to determine if RA and PIC could benefit neonatal vaccine response. Hence, the overall hypothesis in the present study was that RA and PIC cooperatively enhance anti-TT IgG responses but differentially modulate IgG isotypes in both VA-sufficient adult and neonatal mice. The immunoregulatory function of RA and PIC may be attributed to their distinct effects on type 1/type 2 cytokine response, immune-cell populations and differentiation, as well as the GC response. \n      In the first part of study, the effects of RA and/or PIC on anti-TT vaccine response were evaluated in VA-sufficient adult mice. The results showed that co-administration of RA and/or PIC with TT priming cooperatively enhanced both primary and secondary anti-TT IgG responses, but differentially regulated IgG isotypes. RA alone selectively increased anti-TT IgG1, while PIC alone increased all IgG isotypes (IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b). Whereas RA+PIC synergistically enhanced IgG and IgG1, this combination attenuated IgG2a production as compared to PIC alone, thereby keeping the ratio of IgG1:IgG2a close to the control level. Multiple mechanisms might be involved in the regulation of anti-TT antibody response by RA and PIC treatments. First of all, RA and PIC differentially regulated type 1/type 2 cytokine mRNA levels. Whereas RA reduced type 1 cytokines (IFN-gamma and IL-12), PIC enhanced both type 1 and type 2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) and Th1-related transcription factors. The mRNA levels of type 1 and type 2 cytokines are strongly correlated with the titers of IgG2a and IgG1, respectively, suggesting that RA and PIC might regulate anti-TT antibody response by shaping type 1/type 2 cytokine responses. Secondly, RA and/or PIC significantly regulated lymphocyte populations and the expression of costimulatory molecules. RA and PIC differentially modulated NK/NKT-cell populations and the expression of CD80/CD86 costimulatory molecules within 3 days of primary immunization. Also, the NKT: NK and CD80: CD86 ratios were positively correlated with the IL-4: IFN-gamma ratio, implying that RA and PIC treatments might regulate type 1/type 2 cytokines and anti-TT antibody response by modulating NK/NKT cell populations as well as the expression of CD80/CD86. Thirdly, RA and PIC increased the generation of TT-induced germinal center (GC) B cells and the expression of GC-related markers, suggesting that these agents could promote the GC reaction, thereby enhancing anti-TT antibody response. \n    In the second part of study, the adjuvant effects of RA and/or PIC on TT-induced vaccine response were evaluated in neonatal mice. Early-life treatments with RA and/ or PIC were well tolerated, and stimulated both primary anti-TT IgG production in infancy and the memory response in adulthood. TT-specific lymphocyte proliferation and type 1/ type 2 cytokine production were also significantly augmented. In addition, RA and PIC modulated the maturation and/ or differentiation of neonatal B cells, natural killer (NK)/NKT cells, and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Whereas RA alone increased neonatal anti-TT antibody response, it selectively increased anti-TT IgG1 and IL-5, resulting in a skewed type 2 response. PIC, a potent adjuvant in adult mice, elevated neonatal anti-TT IgG as well as all IgG isotypes (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b), and induced TT-specific IFN-&#61543;&#61484;&#61472;an important type 1 cytokine; however, PIC alone failed to benefit the memory response. The combination of RA+PIC was more potent than either agent alone in elevating primary and secondary anti-TT IgG responses as well as IgG isotypes. Moreover, RA+PIC increased TT-specific IFN-&#61543; and IL-5, suggesting the combination effectively promoted both type 1 and type 2 responses in neonatal mice. \n    Overall, RA and/or PIC treatments significantly enhanced TT-induced vaccine response in both adult and neonatal mice. The combination of RA&#61483;PIC stimulated a robust, durable and balanced increase in all of the anti-TT IgG isotypes (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b), suggesting that this combination may be a promising adjuvant for both adult and neonatal vaccination.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6778], "author_name_tesi": "Ma, Yifan ", "last_name_ssi": "Ma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yifan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "John Edgar Smith", "Richard John Frisque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross, Committee Chair", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "John Edgar Smith, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["all-trans retinoic acid", "polyriboinosinic: polyribocytidylic acid (poly IC)", "vaccine response", "type 1/ type 2 response", "neonatal immunity", "antigen-presenting cells", "germinal center reaction"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Development of an Improved Algorithm for \nworkpiece Localization of Raw Material\n", "id": "26537", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11067", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the problems that manufacturing industries are faced with is the proper localization of workpieces within the raw blanks while maintaining sufficient machining allowaces.

The corresponding decision-making is especially critical when the size and shape of the blank are closely specified to the designed model to ensure sufficient material.\n\tIn this paper, we present an improved workpiece localization algorithm for machining, which is achieved by two-step point cloud localization. Firstly, the two point clouds are created (one for the part and one for workpiece) and localized roughly by the Principal component analysis algorithm. Secondly, a more precise algorithm, i.e., least square-based algorithm, is used to search for the best translation and rotation of the workpiece within the blank. The algorithm allows an optimal setup of the part to ensure that no shortage of material occurs during machining. Through transformation, the algorithm determines whether or not the designed model is totally enclosed in the actual raw material to be machined. The two-step localization algorithm can reduce the computational time. The input to the new algorithm is simplified for a 2D workpiece localization process by using point clouds. A 2D example of plasma cutting of the blank and subsequent machining is used to test the algorithm.

The fidelity of miRNA biogenesis from many less-conserved MIRNA hairpins frequently deteriorates in the sister species relative to the species of first discovery. We also observe that heterochromatic siRNA occupied loci have a slight tendency to be retained as heterochromatic siRNA loci between species, but the most active A. lyrata heterochromatic siRNA hotspots are generally not syntenic to the most active heterochromatic siRNA hotspots of A. thaliana. Altogether, our findings indicate that many MIRNAs and most heterochromatic siRNA hotspots are rapidly changing and evolutionarily transient within the Arabidopsis genus.\n\n\tSmall RNAs are broadly present in all known plant species, many of which play important regulatory roles. In Chapter 3, we surveyed the small RNA populations from three plants: the tree crop Theobroma cacao, oil palm Elaeis guineensis Jacq., and the model moss Physcomitrella patens. In Theobroma cacao, we computationally identified 83 conserved miRNAs and 91 miRNA targets using sequence similarity and secondary structure information. In oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.), we identified 28 expressed miRNA families during flower development by analyzing smallRNAseq data. In Physcomitrella patens, we identified a novel family of trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) loci associated with miR156- and miR529-directed slicing by scanning the genome for ta-siRNA-like sRNA accumulation patterns in different genetic background. These studies as a whole demonstrate that many small RNA species are deeply conserved in the plant kingdom. On the other hand, novel classes of small RNAs can evolve in specific lineages.\n\n\tConserved plant microRNAs (miRNAs) modulate important biological processes but little is known about conserved cis-regulatory elements (CREs) surrounding MIRNA genes. In Chapter 4, we developed a solution-based targeted genomic enrichment methodology to capture, enrich and sequence flanking genomic regions surrounding conserved MIRNA genes with a locked-nucleic acid (LNA)-modified, biotinylated probe complementary to the mature miRNA sequence. Genomic DNA bound by the probe is captured by streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, amplified, sequenced and assembled de novo to obtain genomic DNA sequences flanking MIRNA locus of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of this enrichment methodology to enrich targeted regions spanning 10-20 kb surrounding known MIR166 and MIR165 loci. Assembly of the sequencing reads successfully recovered all targeted loci. While further optimization for larger, more complex genomes is needed, this method may enable determination of flanking genomic DNA sequence surrounding a known core (like a conserved mature miRNA) from multiple species that currently don't have a full genome assembly available.\n\n\tAltogether, by sequencing data analysis and comparative genomics, these studies contribute to the understanding of the function and evolution of plant small RNAs.

However, the parallel effort in rodents is still sparse, which impedes the progress not only in comparative functional neuroanatomy but also in translational studies of different brain disorders. In this dissertation, we first established a reproducible RSFC-based functional atlas in the awake rat brain, which exhibited high regional specialization. We then constructed a whole-brain functional brain network based on this atlas. We revealed that this network shared similar topological features with the human brain, and further investigated its integrational feature by identifying functional brain hubs. Using the connectivity patterns of these functional parcels as references, we then discovered reproducible spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of spontaneous brain activity in the awake rat brain. Furthermore, we investigated brain network using cortical myelination-based structural covariance across 881 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. Cortical myelination covariance was found to be highly reproducible, and its correlation with RSFC was relatively uniform within each resting-state brain network, but could vary considerably across them. Particularly, this correlation was appreciably stronger in sensory and motor networks than in cognitive and polymodal association networks. Taken together, the studies in this dissertation characterized specialization, integration and spatiotemporal dynamic properties in the awake rat brain, and also discovered the unique network-specific relationship between RSFC and myelination covariance of the human brain.

In addition, female adolescents have a unique experience of sexual socialization in both online and offline contexts compared to male adolescents, as there are contradictory cultural norms which encourage female adolescents to prove their sexual attractiveness but shame them for engaging in sexual behavior (Bay Cheng, 2015). To further complicate the issue, maltreated female adolescents face even more difficulty during adolescent sexual development as they process past trauma or navigate their world without sound parental guidance (Noll et al., 2013). Consequently, the internet becomes a space for sexually developing female adolescents to learn as well as practice sexual scripts, or cultural rules about sexual behavior and attitudes. Much of the research that examines online sexual behaviors among adolescents takes a variable-centered approach which lacks complexity to capture the multidimensionality of online sexual behavior, as these behaviors do not occur in isolation. Thus, this dissertation used a person-centered approach, latent class analysis (LCA), to identify patterns of a broad range of online sexual experiences (referred to as classes) to explore offline sexual behavior and substance use correlates among female adolescents specifically. Then, established classes were used to differentially predict later HIV risk, teen dating violence (TDV), and sexual assault to examine how class structure, distribution, and prediction differs between maltreated and non-maltreated female adolescents. Female adolescents (N = 312, mean age = 15.21, 45% Caucasian) who were participating in the cross-sequential Female Adolescent Development Study (FADS) filled out questionnaires across 2-5 years from approximately 14-19 years old. Nearly half had experienced substantiated maltreatment that was verified through child protective services. In study 1, a LCA was performed in Latent Gold 5.0. Based upon fit statistics and selection criteria, a four-class model was selected with the following classes: Online Abstinent, Online Inclusive, Attractors, and Seekers. Maltreated participants were more likely to have engaged in most online and offline sexual behaviors than non-maltreated participants. The same four classes were observed in both maltreated and non-maltreated participants. However, maltreated female adolescents were more likely to be members of the Online Inclusive class than any other class. In study 2, established latent classes from Study 1 differentially predicted HIV risk, TDV, and sexual assault one year later. The Attractors class was more likely to engage in HIV risk behavior and to experience TDV and sexual assault one year later compared to the Online Abstinent class. Maltreatment status moderated the prediction of sexual assault by class membership such that maltreated female adolescents in the Online Inclusive class were more likely to be sexually assaulted than non-maltreated female adolescents in the Online Inclusive class. Taken together, these studies suggest that interventions that target online sexual experiences should (1) focus on characteristics that make individuals vulnerable to online experiences instead of approaching online risk as a global issue for all adolescents, (2) address maltreatment as a unique risk factor for online and offline sexual experiences, and (3) tailor messages and programming as different adolescents are deferentially at risk for future outcomes.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13715], "author_name_tesi": "Maas, Megan Keely", "last_name_ssi": "Maas", "middle_name_ssi": "Keely", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennie G Noll", "Jennie G Noll", "Eva S Lefkowitz", "Bethany Cara Bray", "Patricia Barthalow Koch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennie G Noll, Dissertation Advisor", "Jennie G Noll, Committee Chair", "Eva S Lefkowitz, Committee Member", "Bethany Cara Bray, Committee Member", "Patricia Barthalow Koch, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["social media; teen dating violence; sexual assault; female adolescents; maltreatment; sexting; pornography; HIV risk; substance use"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "NUCLEAR RECEPTORS AS DRUG TARGETS: DESIGN AND BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF SMALL MOLECULE MODULATORS OF NUCLEAR RECEPTOR ACTION", "id": "6936", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4277", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nuclear receptors (NRs) represent a large class of ligand-inducible protein transcription factors that regulate important signalling mechanisms in higher organisms.  NRs are essential for normal cellular function, but they also play roles in numerous diseases, including cancer and diabetes.  As transcription factors, NRs exert their effects by controlling the expression of specific genes.  Upon binding of specific, lipophilic, small molecules, many NRs undergo conformational changes that lead to dissociation of corepressors, translocation to the nucleus, binding to specific DNA sequences, recruitment of coactivators, and activation of gene expression.\n\tThe androgen receptor is a nuclear receptor implicated in prostate cancer.  In an effort to discover antiandrogens with low steroid receptor cross-reactivity, we designed and evaluated novel 11b- and 17a-substituted 19-nortestosterone analogues.  11b-alkyl-19-nortestosterone analogues bind tightly to the AR ligand binding domain and exhibit minimal antiglucocorticoid activity.  The 11b-pentyl and 11b-octyl analogues are excellent inhibitors of dimerization in an AR two hybrid assay, and the 11b-octyl and 11b-decyl analogues are potent partial agonists in an AR reporter gene assay.  Studies of additional analogues revealed that appending the side chain of the antiestrogen raloxifene to the 11b  position of a nortestosterone derivative yielded an excellent inhibitor of dimerization in an AR two hybrid assay and a potent partial agonist in an AR reporter gene assay.  This analogue was able to antagonize hormone-mediated gene expression much more effectively than the initial 11b-alkyl analogues studied.\n\tIn an effort to modulate estrogen receptor action by altering the chaperone pathway, we evaluated small molecule chemical inducers of dimerization (CID) composed of estrone linked to geldanamycin, an inhibitor of the chaperone protein Hsp90.  This CID, termed E1-G, was shown to heterodimerize ER and Hsp90 protein in living cells.  This compound induces dimerization between the Hsp90 N-terminal region and the ERb ligand binding domain in a yeast three hybrid assay.  In mammalian cells, the E1-G dimer is less toxic than geldanamycin, but it also displays less effective inhibition of ER-mediated gene expression as compared to geldanamycin.  Confocal microscopy experiments with orthogonally-labeled fluorescent fusion proteins demonstrated colocalization of the ER and Hsp90 that can be inhibited by excess estradiol.  Although we believe these effects are due to heterodimerization of ER and Hsp90 in the cytoplasm of living cells, this mechanism requires further investigation.\n\tBecause nuclear receptors are major drug targets, screening to identify novel NR ligands is an important research objective.  To pursue this objective, we used a mammalian whole cell fluorescent sensor to screen a 4000 molecule library for novel antiestrogens.  We also evaluated this strategy as an approach for the discovery of ligands of other nuclear receptors.\n\tIn an unrelated line of research, we investigated small molecule alkylimidazoles and dialkylimidazolium salts as antimicrobial agents.  We also studied polyallylamine polymers with imidazolium salt substituents.  Alkyl and dialkylimidazoles with longer alkyl side chains were more effective antimicrobial agents, with octyl, decyl and dodecyl the most effective.  Although the polymers were less potent antimicrobial agents than the parent small molecules, we determined that the length of the linker between the polymer backbone and the imidazole ring is crucial for antimicrobial activity.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4250], "author_name_tesi": "MacBride, Megan Marie", "last_name_ssi": "MacBride", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Blake R Peterson", "Ayusman Sen", "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Squire J Booker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Blake R Peterson, Committee Chair", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member", "Mary Elizabeth Williams, Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nuclear receptors", "medicinal chemistry", "antimicrobial", "cellular sensors", "antiandrogens"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "A Study of Experts' Understanding of Arithmetic Mean\n\n\n", "id": "7487", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1472", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Arithmetic mean is a concept which, although simple in form, is quite complicated to fully understand.

As such, traditional conceptualizations of nicotine addiction emphasize behaviors typically experienced by daily smokers such as withdrawal avoidance. Nondaily/intermittent smokers (ITS), a rising population with similar negative health consequences as daily smokers, have received comparatively little attention. Most notably, nondaily smokers exhibit comparable rates of cessation failure and number of quit attempts as daily smokers. Since nondaily smokers do not smoke on a regular basis, withdrawal avoidance is not likely to motivate smoking maintenance and cessation failure. Instead, nondaily smokers may be motivated by \u201cpeak seeking\u201d or the acute rewarding effects of nicotine. Individual factors associated with sensitivity to rewarding stimuli can provide insight into potential mechanisms by which peak seeking motivates smoking behavior. The current study used a rewarded antisaccade task followed by a 7-day ecological momentary assessment period to evaluate the relationship between disinhibition traits, reward motivation, and momentary factors related to reward seeking and the subjective effects of nicotine. More specifically, the analysis tested the hypothesis that reward motivation mediates the relationship between disinhibition and momentary behavior. Results failed to support a mediational model; however, the results highlighted potentially important factors related to smoking behavior in ITS. Primary results suggest that ITS with greater disinhibition and reward motivation report higher momentary adventurousness after smoking a cigarette, but not during nonsmoking occasions.

For corporations who employ workers from across the globe, it is important to understand how company values can influence workers\u2019 behaviors, and even values. The purpose of this study was to examine how first-time leaders, particularly from minority populations, develop into values-based leaders.\n\tUsing Albert Bandura\u2019s social cognitive theory as a conceptual framework, this study addressed leaders\u2019 perceived influence of the environment (i.e., organizational culture and leadership) on new leaders\u2019 behavior and identity as values-based leaders. The influence of this value identity on behaviors was also examined.\n\tGrounded theory methodology was utilized in this case-study of a large privately-owned manufacturing firm with deeply held and clearly articulated values. The company is very intentional about developing its people into more productive workers and effective leaders. Interviews were conducted with 35 leaders from across the entire organizational hierarchy. Twenty of the 27 lower-level leaders were from non-white backgrounds.\n\tThe study found that the organization\u2019s culture can influence new leaders\u2019 behaviors. Its core values are embedded in every aspect of the employee\u2019s experience, which serves to teach and draw attention to the company\u2019s values. An extensive employee assistance program reinforces the company\u2019s value for each employee, often creating a desire to work hard in return for the many benefits received.\n\tThe study also found that organizational leaders can influence new leaders through intentionally building authentic relationships with them. They can directly influence new leaders\u2019 behaviors through (1) consistent role-modeling of the desired attitudes and behaviors and (2) demonstrating through their actions and words that employees are valued. Organizational leaders can also prime the self-concept of new leaders\u2014especially minority employees\u2014so that they begin to see themselves in a new role identity. Their emerging values-based leader behaviors begin to reflect a new desire for the growth and development of their subordinates.\n\tBased on the findings, recommendations for both organizational leaders and aspiring leaders are offered. Lastly, suggestions for future research are presented, including further exploration of how culture and other demographic variables might mediate the environment\u2019s influence on behavior and values.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4029], "author_name_tesi": "MacTavish, Murray ", "last_name_ssi": "MacTavish", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Murray", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith Ann Kolb", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "William J Rothwell", "Cynthia Pellock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith Ann Kolb, Committee Chair", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "William J Rothwell, Committee Member", "Cynthia Pellock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["values-based leadership", "leadership development", "social cognitive theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "UV and Visible Radiation from Magnesium Powder Combustion in Air\n", "id": "10735", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6247", "abstract_tesi": "Dense cloud powdered magnesium jet deflagration was studied using a linear test combustor. Magnesium is a highly flammable metal that produces copious ultraviolet and visible light emissions during combustion. Understanding of the radiant emission and combustion temperatures is important for application to power and propulsion. Because of the large amounts of broadband UV available and the fact that magnesium emits strongly at germicidal wavelengths indicates a possible anti-bacterial application as well. Two calibration lamps with known values of spectral irradiance and color temperature were used to validate UV and visible wavelength flux measurement and temperature measurement techniques. Silicon photo-diode detectors sensitive to UV were used to determine broadband flux. Collimators, a CCD camera and spectroscope were used to measure spectral emissions in the UV and visible spectrums. Comparison of spectral emissions was compared to Planck\u2019s law predictions using an automated algorithm to permit inference of combustion temperatures. Comparison with the temperature standard indicated an error of ~ 60 K at 3000 K temperature. Spectral extinction coefficients in a bacteria suspension were also measured as a function of concentration. These procedures were applied to measurements in a linear magnesium powder and air combustor. The flame temperature of magnesium combustion was determined to range from 2500-3500 K, depending on the location and air/fuel ratio. The predicted temperatures are comparable to previously published data and to values found from adiabatic flame temperature predictions using a chemical equilibrium computer code.

Previous depictions of addiction on television were largely restricted to individual news items and documentaries, made-for-television movies, \u201cvery special episodes\u201d, or, at most, as a recurring aspect of a fictional character\u2019s backstory; this subgenre, hereafter referred to as \u201crecovery television\u201d, represents the first time that multiple ongoing programs work to construct cultural understandings of addiction for television viewers. As a result, Intervention and its genred imitators, including VH1\u2019s Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew (Buchta et al., 2008) and TLC\u2019s My Strange Addiction (Bolicki, Cutlip, Galligani, Tarpinian,  & Theeranuntawat, 2011), mark a distinctive shift in the history of the depiction of addiction and alcoholism in the media. For critical/cultural scholars, television is seen as a medium with potentially profound ideological and normative influence. Arguably, television is one of the ways in which we learn about the world, and this pedagogical function must be interrogated when it extends to issues of mental or corporeal health\u2014especially when the issue in question, addiction, is itself contested terrain for contemporary medical science. The recovery television subgenre represents a potentially influential discursive formation which requires further examination. This dissertation is an examination of how the phenomenon of addiction becomes a televisual discursive formation, the subgenre of reality television called \u201crecovery television\u201d, and is thus re-constructed by the interactions between text, audience and industry. \nThe precursors to the recovery television subgenre activated the audience\u2019s voyeuristic instincts by spectacularizing addiction in The Osbournes (Brooks, Ewing, & Osbourne, 2002), The Anna Nicole Show (Ewing et al., 2002), Being Bobby Brown (Baker-Simmons, Nyanning, Shasid-Deen, Shelley, Tricarico, 2005), and Hey Paula! (Murphy, Sternberg & Whittaker, 2007). When these programs found \u201cevidence\u201d of addiction, this evidence was foregrounded. When the subjects deny their addiction, the programs redirect our attention to the excessive material consumption of the subjects. We also see the \u201cothering\u201d inherent in classed, racialized, and gendered portraits of addiction. \n\tConsequently, the industry responded to the success of these early programs by delivering the lived experience of \u201creal\u201d celebrity addiction via the imagery of madness in Breaking Bonaduce (Foy et al., 2005) and Shooting Sizemore (Demyanenko et al., 2007). In these programs, the distorted visuals and erratic behavior of these addicts engage with the ongoing cultural fascination with madness (Foucault, 1965) and also work to \u201cother\u201d their addicted subjects.\n\tThe production and industrial discourse surrounding Intervention (Benz et al., 2005) positioned the program as \u201cdiscourse of sobriety,\u201d a text with direct relation to reality and a desire to enact social change. Yet, the industry requires standardization, and therefore coercive power is exercised on these subjects to meet these standards. In turn, the standardized logic works as Foucauldian biopower (Foucault, 1978); it teaches the viewer how to live as self-sufficient individuals in neoliberal society. \n\tIn VH1\u2019s Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew (Buchta et al., 2008), Dr. Drew Pinsky, star, co-creator and co-producer of the Celebrity Rehab franchise exercises the power of the \u201ctele-clinical gaze\u201d over his patients. Pinsky\u2019s gaze, a hybrid of Foucault\u2019s clinical gaze (Foucault, 1973) and the gaze of the television producer, diagnoses his patients utilizing his expert medical knowledge with an eye to transforming this medical treatment into televisual spectacle. Ultimately, the need to transform treatment into a spectacle for consumption compromises the patient\u2019s treatment.\n\tFinally, the derivative texts of recovery television demonstrate that the reification of addiction into televisual commodity is complete. Addiction is reduced to an easily replicable formula. In this reduction, the concept of addiction becomes almost unrecognizable. Ultimately, the transformation into spectacle has detached the sign from the signified; the image of addiction is now undistinguishable from the other commodities in the society of the spectacle.\nIn a society where consumption is equated with success and happiness, and where vast resources are mobilized to stimulate consumptive appetites, the phenomenon of pathological consumption becomes a source of cultural anxiety. Recovery television programs tap into the collective cultural anxiety about addiction and the thin line between normal and deviant consumption: \u201cThe face of madness [that] has haunted the imagination of Western man\u201d (Foucault, 1965, p. 15). Just as madness haunted enlightenment society, now addiction\u2014coded as deviant consumption\u2014haunts contemporary consumer culture.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9909], "author_name_tesi": "Macauley, Brian Lawrence", "last_name_ssi": "Macauley", "middle_name_ssi": "Lawrence", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Frank Jordan", "Matthew Mc Allister", "Charles Elavsky", "Gail Louise Boldt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Frank Jordan, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Mc Allister, Committee Member", "Charles Elavsky, Committee Member", "Gail Louise Boldt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Television", "reality television", "genre", "addiction", "biopower", "consumption", "consumer culture", "consumer society", "spectacle"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Goal Ambiguity on Agency Rulemaking:  A Case Study of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Decision to Remove the U.s.

These dual challenges are most apparent in federal agencies where Congress sometimes assigns multiple and conflicting goals to a single agency, and rulemaking is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946.  The extant research provides support that goal ambiguity relates negatively to effectiveness, and that the effects of procedural accountability are circumscribed and even counterproductive given that the most important decisions in rulemaking are often made before the provisions of the APA go into effect.  \t\n\t\n\tThis study explores how goal ambiguity manifests itself throughout the rulemaking process, which includes several stages of rule development and provides for public comment prior to the issuance of a final rule.  The context for the study was the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) 2007 decision to remove the U.S. GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) reconciliation requirement for non-U.S. issuers.  The SEC has multiple and conflicting goals (e.g., the protection of investors and the promotion of capital formation), which are not prioritized, thus providing considerable leeway in deciding which goal should take precedence over others at a given time.\n\t\n\tThe research methodology for this study includes a longitudinal case study, and content analysis.  The research examined the rulemaking process for this decision at two different points in time, including a release issued in the early stage of rule development and the formal rule proposal published in the Federal Register.  Evidence was extracted from various sources, including the public record surrounding the decision, interviews, and through the literature on goal ambiguity and public notice and comment provisions in agency rulemaking.\n\t\n\tThe overall conclusion from this study was that goal ambiguity was present at the SEC at the time of this decision and contributed to the rulemaking process being ineffective in providing a meaningful role for public participation.  This finding challenges the normative view of agency rulemaking, which proposes that the APA democratizes the rulemaking process to ensure agency decisions are informed by affected interests and parties.  The findings from this research suggest that goal ambiguity relates negatively to the normative view of agency rulemaking, and raises questions about whether conflicts about goals can be resolved in the public interest through the existing provisions of the APA. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7222], "author_name_tesi": "Macausland, Mary ", "last_name_ssi": "Macausland", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Public Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Odd Jonas Stalebrink", "Neil M Boyd", "Jeremy Plant", "Thomas Edward Buttross"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Odd Jonas Stalebrink, Dissertation Advisor", "Neil M Boyd, Committee Member", "Jeremy Plant, Committee Member", "Thomas Edward Buttross, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rulemaking", "Globalization", "Securities and Exchange Comm.", "International Financial Reporting Standards", "U.S. GAAP Reconciliation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Semi-automated CT image segmentation program for the easy calculation of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and brain tissue", "id": "21872", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9916", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is a lack of easy, efficient, and affordable software methods for performing volumetric segmentation of computed tomography (CT) images.

I focus on the region between 69 and 108 degrees east and 29 and 54 degrees north and used seismograms from more than 1100 events. Using multiple-filter and phase-matched filter techniques, I measured the dispersion characteristics of the signals between 6 and 30 seconds period. These Rayleigh-wave group velocity dispersion curves were used to compute high-resolution, half-degree cell size, slowness tomographic maps. Because short\nperiods are primarily sensitive to upper crustal structures, the images display low velocities associated with the Tarim, Junggar, and Qaidam basins. Relatively high velocities are associated with mountainous tectonic features such as the Tian Shan. I validated these maps using dispersion curves from 640 events that were not used to construct the tomographic model. The model predictions show a significant variance reduction at short and intermediate periods (6 to 15 s) with respect to the prior model. My model also shows 15% improvement in surface-wave detection capability with respect to previous 1D models. These high-resolution, short-period tomography maps can help improve regional magnitude estimations for construction\nof mb : Ms discriminants. Moreover, the short-period surface-wave tomographic results show unprecedented resolution that reveals greater geologic detail than has previously been achieved using surface waves, and which give us insight into the shear-velocity structure of the crust underlying this part of Asia.\nI also validate an alternative method to the traditional mb?Ms seismic discriminant. This new technique uses a probability of detection model (PXD) to estimate the probability that a surface wave detection came from an underground explosion. I measured noise and signal levels of over 1,300 earthquakes and 26 underground explosions recorded at the broadband, digital station WMQ in western China. The PXD analysis shows a reduction of the false alarm rate from 22% to 17% for this\ndataset. Using path-dependent attenuation and the previously computed group velocity values, the false alarm rate decreases even more to 15%. I also present a new procedure to accurately make Rayleigh wave amplitude measurements and I compute new surface wave magnitudes, Ms, following the methodology of Marshall and Basham and the methodology of Russell. The new Ms computed following Russell\u00b4s formulation proved to be an effective mb ?Ms discriminant and do not require farther analysis with the probability of detection model. This finding is of great importance to seismologists working on seismic discrimination problems.\nTo end, I implement and apply a method to jointly invert surface-wave group velocities and free-air gravity observations. Surface-wave dispersion measurements are sensitive to seismic shear-wave velocities, and the gravity measurements supply\nconstraints on rock density variations. The goal is to obtain a self-consistent three-dimensional shear-velocity-density model with increased resolution of shallow geologic structures. I apply the method to investigate the structure of the\ncrust and upper mantle beneath two large central Asian sedimentary basins: the Tarim and Junggar. The basins have thick sediment sections that produce substantial\nregional gravity variations (up to several hundred mgal). I used gravity observations extracted from the global gravity model derived from the GRACE satellite mission. I combine the gravity anomalies with the previously computed high-resolution surface-wave slowness tomographic maps that provide group velocity dispersion values in the period range between 8 and 100 s for a grid of locations across central Asia. To integrate these data, I use a relationship between seismic velocity and density constructed through the combination of two empirical\nrelations. One determined by Nafe and Drake, most appropriate for sedimentary rocks, and a linear Birch\u00b4s Law more applicable to denser rocks (the basement). An iterative, damped least squares inversion including smoothing is used to jointly model both data sets, using shear-velocity variations as the primary model parameters. Results show high upper-mantle shear velocities beneath the Tarim basin and suggest differences in lower-crust and upper-mantle shear velocities between the eastern and western Tarim.

Both great apes and humans have stabilized their spine with the posterior shift of the transitional vertebra and reduction of non-ribbed lumbar vertebra. There is debate regarding whether these features are homologous or homoplasious, and thus whether bipedalism evolved from a short stiff back like great apes or a longer lumbar column more similar to monkeys and Miocene hominoids. Genetic modification of Hox9 in mice results in the independent modification of rib count and transitional vertebra placemen and genetic modification of Hox11 in mice results in a cranial homeotic shift at the lumbosacral border and position of the sacrum. These transitions mimic the shift of the transitional vertebra and lumbosacral boundary in hominoids. The proposed study addresses important questions that will influence interpretation of differences between extant primates, as well as fossil specimens, by providing a basic understanding for the role of developmental influences on functionally important vertebral features. Since skeletal development is a highly conserved process across tetrapods, conclusions about the development of vertebrae in mice will be broadly applicable to interpretations across mammals. \nIn this analysis, I compare the morphology of the primate transitional vertebra in museum collections and experimentally modified mice. Quantitative, qualitative, and geometric morphometric analyses were conducted on Hox9 and Hox11 modified mice and primate museum specimen thoracic and lumbar columns using micro-CT and 3D surface scanning and a large osteological dataset. \nIn the first part of this dissertation, I analyzed Hox9 and Hox11 modified mice to investigate developmental association or independence of vertebral characters including articular facets, spinous processes, transverse processes, and costal processes. The results of this study indicated that the different Hox clusters have distinct roles on different morphology and in different areas of the vertebral column. Hoxa9, -b9, -c9 and -d9 paralogs had specific and largely separate roles in specifying vertebral identity. Hoxa9 mutations in mice impacted rib placement and count. Hoxb9 and Hoxc9 modifications in isolation affected the placement of the transitional vertebra and the position of spinous process orientation change. Hoxd9 modifications instead affected the sacrocaudal boundary and the number of laterally fused segments contributing of the sacrum. Hoxd11 and combined modifications of Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 resulted in a partial or complete lumbosacral transformation and an anterior shift of the placement of the sacrum within the pelvis. The results of this study indicate that articular facet orientation can be altered independent of costal identity and that articular facet orientation and spinous process orientation shift together whereas transverse process orientation shifts once with the transitional vertebra and a second time over the rib boundary. \nIn the second part of this dissertation, I analyzed a 3D dataset of primate vertebrae to identify characters associated with vertebral column mobility and stiffening. I scanned primate vertebral columns from the 8th thoracic to the 3rd lumbar using either a NextEngine 3D surface scanner or an Artec Space Spider Surface Scanner. From the scans, the vertebrae were scored for \u201cthoracic\u201d and \u201clumbar\u201d characteristics and the angles of the spinous processes were measured to assess spinous process shape to determine which vertebral characters are linked over the articular facet and costal transitions. Additionally, I investigated whether lumbar and sacral count affects sacral position and vertebral entrapment. These data were compared to the Hox mouse models to assess the developmental independence of transitional and costal characters in primates. The results of this study showed that like the Hox mice, articular facet orientation and spinous process orientation were correlated and that there was a shift in transverse process orientation both at the articular facet transition and the costal transition, when they were not in unison. This demonstrates that classic Schultz definitions may not correspond to the developmental boundaries that determine vertebral morphology. Furthermore, humans and chimpanzees displayed a similar cranial shift in sacrum placement to the mice when lumbar count was increased. This has implications for spinal mobility and demonstrates an additional method for either reducing or increasing lumbar entrapment and changing the number of lumbar vertebra contributing to locomotion. \nIn the third part of this dissertation, I analyzed the 3D primate dataset using geometric morphometrics to assess differences between pre- and post-transitional vertebrae within the context of hominoid evolution. The dataset is divided into analyses of the entire section of the vertebral column sampled (T8\u2013L2), individual analyses of the transitional vertebra and first two post-transitional vertebrae, individual species analyses of the vertebral column, and finally individual species analyses of individual articular facet surfaces independent of orientation. Overall, differences were seen in shape and orientation across the transitional vertebra between species and this often correlated with locomotor pattern and where mobility or stiffening was needed in the spine. \n These projects address two important questions: 1) whether patterns of the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral transitions are similar across apes, and 2) the developmental independence of various thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebral features. Throughout hominid evolution there has been a posterior shift in the position of the transitional vertebra and there has been an alteration in the placement of the sacrum relative to the iliac crest. The results of these studies show that alteration of Hox genes in mice can result in similar patterns seen in primates and may underlie the anatomical trajectory seen in hominid evolution. Furthermore, the differences in the transition of vertebral characters among great apes suggests that reduction and stiffening of the lumbar column may have evolved independently.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16736], "author_name_tesi": "Machnicki, Allison Leah", "last_name_ssi": "Machnicki", "middle_name_ssi": "Leah", "first_name_ssi": "Allison", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip Reno", "Nina G Jablonski", "Timothy Michael Ryan", "Nina G Jablonski", "John Henry Challis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Philip Reno, Dissertation Advisor", "Nina G Jablonski, Committee Chair", "Timothy Michael Ryan, Committee Member", "Nina G Jablonski, Committee Member", "John Henry Challis, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hominid evolution", "vertebral development", "hox9", "hox11", "primate locomotion", "primate vertebral anatomy"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "EXTENSION OF ISO 14001 ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THE METAL CASTING INDUSTRY TO INCLUDE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS \n\n\n", "id": "9651", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2022", "abstract_tesi": "Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions legislation in the United States is forthcoming. Manufacturers have dealt with past emissions regulations differently, some through implementing environmental management systems (EMS). The most common EMS worldwide is the International Organization of Standards (ISO), ISO 14001. Currently ISO 14001 does not require GHG emissions tracking; therefore this research presents an all-encompassing ISO 14001 GHG guideline for foundries. Donsco Inc, Wrightsville plant, an ISO 14001 certified foundry, was the selected research venue. \n\nThe development of the ISO 14001 GHG guideline started with integrating ISO 14001 certified paperwork (process flow diagrams and the environmental aspects chart) and powerful Object-Process Methodology (OPM) software, OPCAT. The results found that ISO 14001\u2019s flow diagrams could effectively be input into OPCAT to communicate a foundry\u2019s complex systems, including all environmental aspects. Then a GHG OPCAT model was developed with GHG emission tracking. The GHG OPCAT model was then inserted into the original ISO 14001 EMS framework so that management decisions based on GHG impacts can be made. An environmental significance rating system incorporating GHG measures was developed. The significance rating was derived from the global warming potential (GWP) values imbedded in the ISO 14001 GHG \nframework.  \n\nThe generalized ISO 14001 GHG guidelines are presented to facilitate GHG incorporation into environmental management systems in other manufacturing facilities. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2004], "author_name_tesi": "Macht, Gretchen A", "last_name_ssi": "Macht", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Gretchen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt", "Robert Carl Voigt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Carl Voigt, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["GHG", "greenhouse gases", "metal casting", "foundry", "environmental management system", "ISO 14000", "greenhouse gas emissions", "GHG emissions", "OPCAT", "object-process methodology", "OPM"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Modeling Psychometrics for Team Performance: Personality & Emotional Intelligence", "id": "22862", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10151", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As challenges faced by organizations have become more complex, there has been an increase in the formation and use of teams and teamwork. To develop a team that can function efficiently and have a high-performance output is difficult to formulate. The psychological definitions of an individual such as personality and emotional intelligence have previous research that states, separately, that these psychometric constructs can improve team performance. Therefore, by quantitatively combining an individual\u2019s characteristics and understanding how they perform at a team-level can inform team selection techniques. \n\nAccording to the literature on Emotional Intelligence (EI), there is a mixed model that relates to the commonly agreed upon Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality. Although these two psychometric constructs are treated as distinctly different measures, their potential relationships could be a powerful indicator and tool toward understanding how individuals come together to develop overall team performance, especially with complex tasks.  \n\nThe primary goal of this dissertation is to improve team performance modeling for teams based on mathematical quantification of interactions of personality and emotional intelligence. This work explores the relationships between personality and emotional intelligence as they relate to team performance by investigating these two psychometric constructs separately and together, while testing aggregation methods, task types, individual- and team-level performance, and communication as a mediating variable. \nWe utilized two different contexts to collect data: a controlled group environment (individuals performing together to complete an Anti-Air Warfare Coordinator (AAWC) simulation) and a more natural group setting (multiple years of team project data from undergraduate engineering courses).  \n\nFirst, we considered the degree to which the Five Factor Model construct at both an individual and team extraversion is predictive of the overall performance of dyadic teams in an AAWC simulation setting, via mediation from communication.  Then, we expanded the team level analysis from the previous study to include all personality metrics with four aggregated methods in the same AAWC setting. After the AAWC setting, we transitioned from a laboratory environment to the academic environment. Within the academic setting, emotional intelligence was investigated as it related to performance at a team-level, using multiple aggregation methods and task types. Based on the previous results in conjunction with the literature, the discrepancy on how team interpersonal skills related to team performance for a specific task was explored with communication as a mediating variable. In the same academic environment, this research concludes by examining the two psychometric constructs together to see how they relate to one another and performance on both an individual and team level.\n\nOur results show that the complex relationships between personality and emotional intelligence can be quantified statistically, however there are many nuances to the interpretation of these relationships and how they could be implemented in concrete ways to improve team performance. Emotional Intelligence does predict team performance, however the relationships are dependent on aggregation method and task type. Additionally, our research concludes that verbal communication can be an effective mediator (i.e., an intermediate variable) for personality to team performance at a team level. Overall, both psychometrics are inter-related with definable, intricate relationships that can indeed predict team performance using different aggregation methods and task types.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9840], "author_name_tesi": "Macht, Gretchen A", "last_name_ssi": "Macht", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Gretchen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Arthur Nembhard", "David Arthur Nembhard", "Robert Michael Leicht", "Gul Kremer", "Ling Rothrock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Arthur Nembhard, Dissertation Advisor", "David Arthur Nembhard, Committee Chair", "Robert Michael Leicht, Committee Chair", "Gul Kremer, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Team Performance", "Psychometrics", "Personality", "Emotional Intelligence", "Performance Modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Computation of Two-Phase Drag Reduction by Gas Injection", "id": "14753", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7394", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The skin friction drag on ships and other solid bodies moving through water can be reduced by introducing air through the solid surface into the attached turbulent boundary layer.\nThis phenomenon is known as microbubble drag reduction (MBDR), or simply bubble drag reduction (BDR).\nAir is typically introduced through micropores in sintered plates or through thin slots.\nContinuing experimental efforts since the 1970s have revealed several physical mechanisms acting in the two-phase mixture to cause a localized reduction in skin friction.\nMotivated to reduce total vehicle drag, researchers in this field have focused on finding the functional dependence of the drag reduction.\n\nA homogeneous, two-phase, compressible computational flow solver is used to simulate these flows.\nThe homogenized fluid's mixture properties are determined from local volume fractions of air and water.\nMixing of phases after injection is modeled through use of a turbulent dispersion term.\nExperiments conducted by Madavan, Deutsch and Merkle (1984) in the twelve-inch water tunnel at ARL/PSU are used for validation.\nGood agreement between experiment and model is found for the total drag reduction with air injection.\nThe return to no-injection skin friction values downstream of the injection region is also predicted by the model.\nAgreement with experiment is found for both single phase simulations and multiphase simulations with gas injection.\nValidation was achieved by comparison of velocity profiles and wall-shear profiles between simulation and experiment.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7351], "author_name_tesi": "Maciejewski, Daniel ", "last_name_ssi": "Maciejewski", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric G Paterson", "Scott Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric G Paterson, Thesis Advisor", "Scott Miller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["microbubble drag reduction", "turbulent boundary layer", "CFD", "multiphase", "two-phase", "turbulence"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Heritability Estimates For Functional Capacity Measures in an Elderly Swedish Twin Sample", "id": "6195", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2176", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-09-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It is important to understand the genetic and environmental factors underlying the individual differences in functional capacity measures and how these influences change throughout aging since a decline in physical function has been a predictor of decreased mental ability, co-morbidities, and even mortality.

Multiple testing occasions allowed for the modeling of change in pulmonary function longitudinally, utilizing the genetic simplex model.\nThe results indicated genetic stability throughout time for all four functional capacity measures with specific new genetic influences at each time point exerting a minimal effect.  In general, the highest heritability estimates were for body mass index and the lowest heritability estimates were for the repeated chair stand task.

Originally developed by the U.S. Customs Agency, zero tolerance was intended to target a rapidly growing drug trade.  Most schools began adopting these policies in response to The Gun Free Schools Act of 1994.  This mandate requires all state education agencies to develop a policy towards weapons that results in an expulsion of no less than one year.  Coupled with this requirement is the stipulation that these policies must allow for the senior most administrators within a local education agency to have the discretion to modify the punishment on a case by case basis.  \nCommentators have characterized zero tolerance as one of the most simplistic approaches to school discipline.  However, school discipline data are notoriously challenging to analyze due to the many factors that contribute to school discipline in general.  There is a lack of empirical evidence to support the claim the notion that zero-tolerance policies decrease violent incidents in schools or improve school safety.  The message behind the policies clearly indicates that violence in schools is not tolerable under any circumstances; however there is no correlation between the message and the outcomes from policy implementation.  Regardless of this, the American legal structure supports the application of these policies. This study examines the legal and ethical dimensions of zero-tolerance policies in an attempt to determine the degree to which U.S. courts have provided language suggesting discrepancies between the legal holding and the opinion following the decision.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2183], "author_name_tesi": "Mackey, Hollie Jonel", "last_name_ssi": "Mackey", "middle_name_ssi": "Jonel", "first_name_ssi": "Hollie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jacqueline A Stefkovich", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich", "Dr Preston Green Iii", "David Alexander Gamson", "Nancy A Tuana", "Dr Anthony Normore"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jacqueline A Stefkovich, Dissertation Advisor", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich, Committee Chair", "Dr Preston Green Iii, Committee Member", "David Alexander Gamson, Committee Member", "Nancy A Tuana, Committee Member", "Dr Anthony Normore, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["school safety and order", "school discipline", "ethics", "education policy", "education law", "zero-tolerance", "school violence", "restorative justice"]}]
